      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether he has received reports from his engineers concerning the flooding of the river Nanny, at Kilsharvin, between Duleek and Julianstown, County Meath, where a local industry's progress is being impeded; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to remedy the position.</P>

      <P>The Nanny River was recently inspected with a view to ascertaining whether the drainage of the river would form a suitable minor employment scheme.  The estimated cost of the work, however, places it outside the scope of such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that an application for an increase of wages was made in April last to the resident engineer by the representatives of the men employed at Rhineanna by the Board of Works; that no reply having been received, an application was made direct to the Office of Public Works a fortnight later; that no reply to either having been received up to 30th June last, the men informed the resident engineer of their intention to withdraw their labour on the 4th July last; that the men have in fact been on strike <Col N="1734" /> since that date; that they have not yet received a reply to, or a decision on their application; whether he is further aware that men employed by a private contractor on similar work on the same scheme were in receipt of 5/- per week more than the men employed by the Board of Works, and that these men's wages have since been increased by a further 2/- per week, and whether he is now prepared to accede to the demand made by the men employed by the Board of Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the facts regarding the wages dispute at Rhineanna.  The rate of wages to be paid there is being considered in the light of the present position.  In arriving at a decision, due regard will be had, among other relevant matters, to the recent standard rate of wages and bonus orders applicable to the building and constructional workers employed by contractors at the airport.</P>

      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain why no reply was sent in response to this demand, and also is he aware that, as set out in the question, men employed by a private contractor on similar work were in receipt, at the time the application was made, of 5/- per week more than the men employed by the Board of Works, and that these men have since got an additional 2/- per week, with the result that they are at the moment in receipt of 7/- per week more than the men employed by the State on similar work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the position is substantially as stated by the Deputy, but I cannot throw any further light on the situation, except to say that a decision will shortly be arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he will state the nature and terms of the arrangements regarding the employment of labour at the Port of Limerick entered into with Grain Importers (Éire) Limited: whether he is aware that in connection <Col N="1735" /> with the discharge of certain cargoes of grain recently the firm in question refused to comply with the terms of a local agreement providing for the employment of dockers to discharge certain grain vessels, and that they defended their violation of the agreement on the grounds that they were acting as agents of his Department and therefore were unable to comply with its provisions; and whether, in the circumstances, he will issue to Grain Importers an instruction that it is not in the public interest to ignore or contravene the terms of existing agreements freely entered into between employers and workers concerning conditions of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for making arrangements for the discharge of the cargoes to which the Deputy refers does not rest either with my Department or with Grain Importers (Éire) Limited.  I have, however, made inquiries and I am informed that a local agreement was made in Limerick between dockers and stevedores very many years ago which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that should two ships arrive at the same time, one would be discharged by hand.  The Deputy will appreciate that conditions have materially altered since that agreement was made and even if the necessary gear were available in Limerick to discharge grain vessels by hand, the adoption of any such arrangement would involve delay which could not now be countenanced in view of the absolute necessity for securing quick discharge of vessels bringing cargoes of grain and other essential commodities to our ports.  If any serious attempt were to be made to enforce such an agreement at Limerick, steps would have to be taken to ensure that in future not more than one vessel would arrive in Limerick for discharge at any one time.</P>

      <P>There is not the same difficulty in obtaining fuel in rural areas as in urban areas.  In country districts there are quantities of scrub timber which can be cut down.  It is not intended to extend the scheme to rural areas.  The need for ensuring a supply of winter fuel is greatest in the cities and urban districts in the non-turf areas, and it is in these areas that the distribution of fuel is being authorised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the Dublin County Borough Fuel Scheme whether, in view of the fact that persons receiving one cwt. of turf per week under the scheme will have to make their own arrangements for conveying the turf to their homes, he will ask the commissioners to devise a form of voucher which will enable persons who have neither sacks nor conveyances, or who are living alone and are old and incapacitated, to take home the turf in instalments, as otherwise they may have to pay exorbitant charges for transport which will neutralise the value of the concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At the inception of the scheme it was suggested in the case of old and infirm persons that if it was not possible for them to arrange to take delivery at the fuel depôts, <Col N="1738" /> arrangements should be made with various charitable organisations to assist in the delivery of turf. The Dublin Union Commissioners have adopted this suggestion, and they will, I feel sure, do everything in their power to facilitate such persons in bringing fuel to their homes.  It should, however, be realised that the operation of this scheme entails considerable organisation, and difficulties may arise from time to time due to the transport position and other circumstances beyond control.  The commissioners may be relied upon to do their utmost to remedy any defects in the scheme.  At the same time, my present information is that it is working reasonably well.  There are 19 fuel depôts established in the city, and the distance the turf has to be transported by the recipients is not unduly long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports have been received from agricultural instructors in midland counties indicating that in some instances the ripening of grain crops was retarded. Late ripening, which was not reported to be general, was attributed to a variety of causes or to a combination of these, such as lateness of sowing, lateness of locality, deficiency of sunshine during the months of July and August and unseasonable weather conditions generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state how, having <Col N="1739" /> regard to the very low figure of factory killings of pigs and the difficulty of transport, the fixation of factory quotas can be justified; and whether, in view of the fact that the fixation of prices and control of the industry could be operated by his Department, he will consider introducing legislation for the purpose of altering and reducing the control and personnel of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that in recent weeks the Pigs and Bacon Commission increased by 50 per cent. the nominal quota of pigs allocated to each curer; whether he is aware that during the last 12 months curers in the South of Ireland were unable at any time to obtain enough pigs to fill the quotas already applicable to them; whether he is also aware that, in the absence of increased pig production, the revised quotas now in force will merely divert from southern curers, who are already short of their requirements, to other curers who could obtain supplies in excess of their former quotas a substantial portion of the existing supply of pigs which, but for the revised quotas, would reach the southern curers; whether he is aware that the new quotas will therefore have the effect of throwing out of work a large proportion of the workers engaged in <Col N="1740" /> bacon curing; and whether, in the circumstances, he will state the grounds on which the commission decided to issue the new quota orders, and on what advice they acted in doing so.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the production quotas for bacon factories were increased during the month of October as indicated by the Deputy.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It had the effect, of course, of leaving the pigs in the area where they were produced rather than sending them on to Cork.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:&mdash;(1) The number of applicants selected by the Commissioner for examination was 229.  (2) Not all those selected had obtained the Leaving Certificate.  (3) Included among those applicants not selected for examination were a number who claimed to have passed the Leaving Certificate. (4) By statutory Order, the selection of candidates for admission to the Gárda Síochána is vested in the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>In March last, advertisements were issued inviting applications from suitable members of the Defence Forces, L.D.F., L.S.F., and the A.R.P. service to fill a limited number of vacancies likely to arise during the year.  Forms of application were issued for completion to the applicants, and 2,118 completed forms were received back in course.  From these, 229 applicants were selected personally by the Commissioner for presentation for examination by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In making his selection of candidates for presentation for examination, the Commissioner was influenced solely by the physical and educational qualifications of the candidates&mdash;to the extent to which these could be gleaned from the forms of application&mdash;and he gave preferential consideration to candidates of 5 ft. 10 ins. and upwards in height.  The statutory requirements are minimum qualifying requirements, and it is obvious that with thousands of applicants and only a limited number of vacancies, a large number of applicants <i>prima facie</i> eligible must suffer disappointment.  A competitive examination for all applicants is not considered the most suitable machinery for selecting recruits.</P>

      <P>Deputies will observe that there have been tabled at least four schemes dealing with the hours of trading in licensed premises. Many of these amendments cut across each other and it is obvious that if each of these schemes and the subsidiary amendments thereto were to be discussed and decided separately there would be inevitable repetition with unsatisfactory results.  I suggest, therefore, segregating the different points. The first 18 amendments, excluding, I think, Nos. 1, 5 and 6, fall into four main categories.  No. 1 category is the extension of week-day trading hours, which might be considered on amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  I shall have something to say about amendment No. 2. The second category is the equation of Saturdays with other week-days, which might be considered on amendment No.4.  The third category&mdash;Sunday <Col N="1746" /> opening outside the county boroughs&mdash; might be considered on amendments Nos. 8, 17 and 18.  The fourth category, dealing with the alteration in Sunday hours, would arise on amendments Nos. 10 and 11.  If that proposal is not quite clear.  Deputies might so inform the Chair.  Amendment No. 2 on this sheet of amendments&mdash;or perhaps we should more properly call it this booklet of amendments&mdash;includes two paragraphs dealing with Sunday trading. These are paragraphs (e) and (j), and I suggest that Deputy McMenamin might omit these from that amendment, or, alternatively, that a decision be taken on amendment No. 3.  The House, I feel sure, would permit the deletion of paragraphs (e) and (j), as the question of Sunday trading would be considered later.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3, page 2, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended by the insertion in sub-section (1) after the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; in each of the definitions of the expressions &ldquo;licensed premises&rdquo;, &ldquo;on-licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;off-licence&rdquo; of the following: &ldquo;(whether granted on production or without production of a certificate of the Circuit Court or the District Court)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Its purpose is to remove any doubts which may exist as to the meaning of the expressions: &ldquo;licensed premises,&rdquo;&ldquo;on-licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;off-licence&rdquo; in the <Col N="1747" /> 1927 Act.  I am advised that a licence, such, for instance, as a wine retailer's licence, which is granted without the production of a certificate from the courts comes within the definitions of these expressions.  Doubts have been expressed as to the correctness of that view, however, having regard to the definition of &ldquo;licence&rdquo; contained in the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1874, and the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, and I propose that this opportunity should be taken to clarify the position.  If premises to which a wine retailer's licence is attached, were not licensed premises within the meaning of the 1927 Act, Section 2 of the Act of 1927 would not operate to prohibit permitting consumption of intoxicating liquor on such premises during prohibited hours.</P>
    <P>The amendment will make it clear that the provisions relating to prohibited hours apply to all premises licensed for the retail sale of intoxicating liquor.  Restaurants holding wine retailer's &ldquo;on-licences&rdquo; will be entitled to the same exemptions as restaurants with ordinary publicans' licences if they obtain restaurant certificates under Section 6 of the Bill.</P>

    <P>The reason I put down this amendment is that on the question of time, in connection with Licensing Acts, we are completely out of gear with modern conditions.  We are now about an hour and a half out of time, so far as the sun is concerned, and that means that people in the rural communities, who come into a town to do some shopping on a Saturday night, are suffering what amounts to total prohibition, so far as they are concerned.  Facilities are granted to people in the boroughs for getting drink on Sundays and at other times, but the people in the country are denied such facilities.  I regard that as class legislation, and I cannot see any reason for class legislation of that kind.  I do not know what its origin was, but the fact is that people in the cities can get a drink at any hour of the day they want it, whereas the people in the rural areas have not got that accommodation.  It may be said, of course: &ldquo;Oh, well, that provision was here in previous Licensing Acts, and there must have been some reason for putting it in,&rdquo; but if there was a reason for it I should like the Minister to show it to me, because nobody has given me any cogent reason for it.  As I have said, I look on it as class legislation in favour of the people in the urban and borough areas.  I do not see why these people should have that facility.  They can have a drink at practically any hour of the day they want it, whereas the people in the country, who have been working hard all the week, and who come into the local town, perhaps only once a month, on a Saturday evening, to do some shopping&mdash;buy clothes or boots, or something like that&mdash;cannot get a drink.</P>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, and Licensing Acts in general, I am not so much concerned about the hours.  Some of the present hours, in my opinion, are unreasonable.  I think it would be far better to have the hours made more reasonable and to have the law enforced. However, &ldquo;I do not want to dwell on that, because it might be touching a thorny problem and might <Col N="1750" /> ruffle some tempers, and I think it would be better to avoid that, but I suggest to the Minister that he should take his courage in his hands, because I feel that there is no reason why the rural population of this country should be completely ostracised in this respect.  Take an analogous case; Licensed premises are open on every Church holiday in this country, and I do not think the Minister, even with all the reports that are available to him officially, can state that there are abuses of drinking on Church holidays. I have never witnessed any such abuse, at any rate, and I should say that any abuse that takes place occurs after the official closing hours, and that it is due to the non-enforcement of the law as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>That is, briefly, the purpose of this amendment, and I should like to hear the Minister tell us what justification there is for this.  I put it to him that the advance of hours in the summer time should be taken into account, and that the rural population, who are working to feed the urban population &mdash;and there is no question but that they are doing that, and doing it very well &mdash;should receive some consideration. There are two points in the amendment. First, there is the obstracisation of the rural community, and the class division in favour of people living in urban districts.  In my opinion, there is no justification for that, and I have never heard any put forward.  If the Minister has any justification for it, I should like to hear it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment put down by Deputy McMenamin covers most of the points that were put down by other Deputies from country districts as regards the hours on week-days.  As the Ceann Comhairle says, we can deal with Sunday afterwards.  Deputy O'Loghlen and a number of other Deputies and I had a number of similar amendments <Col N="1751" /> down, and while there may be slight difference of views as regards the hours expressed in the amendments, I think we would be all agreed that the principle of Deputy McMenamin's amendment is what we want and what we would ask the Minister to give.  The real position as far as country districts are concerned is set out by sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the 1927 Act, which fixes the hours. The Minister will see that the period there, during the period of summer time, is from 10 to 10.  That means, of course, in country districts, from 9 to 9 old time on ordinary week-days. Nine o'clock old time in country districts is an utterly ridiculous hour at which to compel the public houses to be closed because, as far as country districts are concerned, people who are working during summer periods, not necessarily even people living in the country, but people in the towns&mdash; tradesmen, small shopkeepers and people like that who are not confined to business hours as people are in the city&mdash;do not shut their premises at anything like the early hour one might expect from the viewpoint set out in the 1927 Act.  The hour of 10 o'clock old time all round is not an unreasonable hour to ask for in the rural areas, and I think, as far as weekdays are concerned, 10 o'clock all round is what is suggested by all the amendments that have been put in, that is, 11 o'clock summer time and 10 o'clock when the period of summer time is not in force.  There is still a stronger case for Saturdays in rural areas. Saturday is the one day in the country when people may relax in the evenings and it is utterly ridiculous to say that public houses would have to close at what is approximately 8.30 old time, particularly now, when the period of summer time is in force the whole year round.  As far as I am concerned, while I did not go as far in the amendment as Deputy McMenamin went, as regards Saturdays, I would be quite prepared to say that I can see a perfectly strong case for an extension of hours on Saturdays, and I think it is vital that an extension of hours should be given on Saturdays.  The people I <Col N="1752" /> represent and the people who approached me in this matter feel that, whatever about other points in the Bill, it is absolutely necessary that there should be extended hours on Saturdays.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is overlooking one point.  When the 1927 <Col N="1753" /> Act was being debated here, that point may have been raised but people are inclined to overlook the fact that in the country districts summer time is not recognised by the ordinary people. They still carry on their lives by old time and I think there is a lot to be said for the suggestion made by Deputy Lynch that, even if you keep to the hour in the urban areas, in the country districts at any rate 10 o'clock old time would appear to be the natural hour because the time people come into the town or village in the country is the time between 8 o'clock old time and 10 o'clock old time and not earlier than that.  It is really unfortunate that the whole cause of the criticism arises from the fact that people have not adapted themselves to summer time and now, when it is in force the whole year round, matters are still worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  Like Deputy Linehan and other Deputies who live in the country and who understand the hours of working of the agricultural community, I feel the Minister should extend the time on ordinary week-days to 11 o'clock summer-time.  Summer-time is not recognised by the agricultural community at all.  They work by old time.  They work until 8.30 old time in the summer, that is 9.30 new time.  A man may be working two miles from the village or town and may want a drink.  By the time he gets to the village or town it is after 10 o'clock new time and he is not entitled then to have a drink; the public houses will be closed.  If the Minister and the Government were really in earnest about making this an Act that would be upheld by the people and the authorities, they would extend the hours.  I believe if the hour is extended in the country there would be no abuses.  If people come in from the fields and want a drink and if the public houses must close at 8.30 old time, the Act will be abused, but if the hour is extended to suit the conditions in the country there will be no abuses.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider this point.  After all, the agricultural community deserve something from this Government and from the <Col N="1754" /> country because they are the hardest working section in the community. They are the food producers.  It is unreasonable at the moment that the hours of closing during the period of summer-time should be 9 o'clock old time and 8.30 on Saturday evenings.  I would appeal to the Minister to have these hours extended in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterJosephOLoghlen" hpid="Mr. O'Loghlen Mr. O'Loghlen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment has been very clearly stated to the Minister and the Minister has accepted the principle put forward by the mover of the amendment, that a uniform hour should be fixed for the sale of intoxicating drink wherever drink is sold in this country.  It is difficult to find any substantial reason why the distinction was ever made as between county boroughs, urban county districts and towns and other places not so described.  Under the 1927 Act, as has been pointed out, later hours of trading were permitted in the county boroughs than in places not described as such.  In the county boroughs and the urban county districts the time observed is the official time. One of the essential considerations that prompted the mover of the amendments is that official time is observed in the county boroughs and urban county districts and large towns whereas official time is not observed in the other parts of the country.  Notwithstanding that official time is observed in the cities and large towns, you give increased hours of trading there and later hours of trading, although work is terminated at a given time in these places.</P>
      <P>The daily work ceases at a given time, and they are permitted to obtain reasonable refreshments.  In the country, men working in the fields or bogs do not carry on their work by official time.  They do not terminate work at a given time.  When shorter hours of trading were fixed in country districts people were deprived of the opportunity of getting a reasonable amount of time for refreshments or procuring goods.  In the amendment it is suggested that there should be uniform hours for trading on week-days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> I cannot understand why there were shorter hours on Saturday than any other day.  The main reason for that, I understand, was that men were paid their weekly wages in industrial centres and large towns on Saturday, and that the provision was deliberately inserted for the purpose of preventing them spending their wages unwisely, perhaps.  The position is completely changed now.  Wages are not now paid at all on Saturdays in industrial centres; they are paid on Fridays or Mondays.  Assuming that that was the reason why Saturday trading hours were shorter, it no longer exists.  In order to understand why 11 o'clock has been set down as the maximum hour for uniform trading I suggest that that proposal should be read in relation to amendments Nos. 42 and 43.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 42 indicates that it is proposed to extend the <i>bona fide</i> trading hours.  On the Second Reading it was indicated here that most of the abuses occur when persons leave the city and proceed to licensed premises outside, because the break in the hours permits them to do so.  In future, if trading in the city is permitted until 11 o'clock, and the hours for <i>bona fide</i> trading extended to 12 o'clock, no such inducement will exist.  By permitting trading in the city until 11 o'clock and <i>bona fide</i> trading until 12 o'clock, the inducement to persons in the city to travel to outlying places will disappear.  That is an additional reason for allowing trading within cities and county boroughs and other large towns up to 11 o'clock.  This amendment should be read in conjunction with amendments Nos. 42 and 43, so as to have a complete grasp of the reason 11 o'clock is suggested.  I am satisfied that the reasons I suggest are substantial ones and that the time should be extended to 11 o'clock on all week-days during the summer period and until 10 o'clock in the winter period.  The change really means that the ordinary time will then be 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock. I do not think the proposal is unreasonable as its acceptance, taken in conjunction with amendments Nos. 42 and 43, will remove one of the evils <Col N="1756" /> to which the Minister pointed when introducing the Bill.</P>

      <P>I put down amendments Nos. 7 and 9 for the purpose of endeavouring to persuade the Minister that there should be uniformity of opening and closing hours in provincial towns and all areas outside the county boroughs.  I did not hear any good reason given why there should be different opening hours in winter in urban towns with a population of 5,000 or over and towns with a population of 1,000 or over.  It is possible under present conditions to have different opening and closing hours inside the same Gárda area.  There should be uniformity of opening and closing hours whatever these hours may be.  I share the views expressed by Deputy O'Loghlen and Deputy Linehan that there should be uniformity of opening and closing and I hope the Minister will agree to that.  If not I should like to hear his reasons to the contrary.</P>

      <P>I stated that I agree to have uniform hours on week-days, including Saturdays.  I am prepared to agree to uniformity during six week-days in urban areas and in the country. During the debate on the Second Reading I must admit that practically every Deputy who spoke advocated extra facilities for drinking.  There is no question about that.  But I am conscious of a very strong feeling which was not given expression to here.  This is the Parliament of the country in which we should hear different views expressed.  We all know that there is a very strong feeling abroad against giving extra facilities.  If I were to agree to an extra hour in the evening or at night I think that would have very serious reactions, and Deputies who advocate that must have full regard for the views held by a very responsible section of the community, views which were not expressed except by Deputy Allen who warned the House against general opening on Sundays.  He was the only Deputy who issued that warning, and that reminded me&mdash;although I did not need to be reminded&mdash;of the powerful influence of very responsible people who are against the giving of extra facilities. <Col N="1757" /> I think there should be reasonable facilities but I heard no case at all made for giving the extra hour to 11 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I suggest that there is a certain amount of experience of the working of the Act of 1927.  Has there been an increase in the violation of the law since the Act was passed in comparison with the previous years?  Rightly or wrongly there is a general impression that there has been more evasion of the law. That may be.  One of the grounds for that impression may be that facilities have been interfered with.  I presume that the Minister has occasionally, if not as a Minister, certainly, as a private Deputy, attended what are called chapel gate meetings on a Sunday. Has he ever had any difficulty in knowing the hour at which the meeting was to be held?  Did he not recognise the extraordinary difference there is between what is down on paper and what is there in practice?  Did he ever turn up too early?  The Minister says that he sees no case for making a difference of an hour.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the facts as they are.  Does the Minister know any town in the <Col N="1758" /> country with a population of under 4,000 where, apart from the trains and the post office, new time is kept?  The Minister should remember that the ordinary country people live by the sun, independent of any time.  In practice, that means a difference of one and a half hours.  Therefore, what, in fact, you are saying is that on Saturday, after 7 o'clock by the sun, no one can get any refreshments after his week's work.  I maintain it is the Minister who is really making the difference of an hour.  I put it to him, in all seriousness, that he ought not to substitute paper legislation for the actual facts of the lives of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Deputy O'Loghlen that the position in the country has been changed with regard to the time at which wages are paid.  Speaking from my own experience, I should say that the vast majority of workers in the rural areas and in a great many of the provincial towns, are not paid until they finish their work on Saturday night.  We all know that during the present emergency farmers and their workers are engaged on the land as long as they have daylight.  When a farm labourer finishes his work on a Saturday night at 8, 8.30 or 9 o'clock new time, he is handed his week's wages.  He goes home with the money to his wife, and she rushes out to the local shop, which is also the local public house, to procure her groceries. That, unfortunately, is the position at the present time.  Personally, I cannot see any reason why those workers should not be paid on a Friday night so that their wives might be able to procure the household needs at an earlier hour on Saturday.  That is one reason why the present licensing laws are being broken.  By the time people reach the local village or town the shops are closed, but, in present circumstances, no shopkeeper is going to refuse to allow them to enter to make their purchases.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Loghen in his amendment is seeking to have the four county boroughs, the cities and towns in the country put on the one level.  One Deputy spoke against that.  I suggest to the Minister that the arguments he advanced were very poor.  He claimed to be speaking for a responsible section of the people, and said that there were going to be abuses and excesses in the cities and rural areas if there was to be any extension of the present hours.  I am more interested in the rural areas than I am in the cities.  I think the Minister should have a uniform hour of closing at 11 o'clock.  In the County Dublin you can see men working in the fields up to a late hour on Saturday nights.  If a bad spell of weather is followed by good weather, and a farmer appeals to his men to work for a few extra hours, it is always responded to.  I think the Minister should agree to have the public houses remain open until 11 o'clock.  On the Second Reading of the Bill he referred to the <i>bona fide</i> abuses.</P>

      <P>That was a matter that various Deputies expressed an opinion on.  I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy O'Loghlen's amendment so that there may be a uniform hour for the county boroughs and the <Col N="1760" /> rural areas.  Let it operate from the 1st May to the 30th September.  Many workers in rural areas do not finish work until 9 o'clock on Saturday night. Why, therefore, should not their wives and themselves be given an opportunity of doing business after that hour in the local shops?  I am sure the Minister would not get up and advocate that a man who has been working hard all the week is not entitled to have a few pints on a Saturday night.  No member of the House, I imagine, will say that there was anything criminal in taking a drink.  The acceptance of the amendment would also get rid of this sort of thing.  At the present time when people arrive in some villages after closing hour on a Saturday night, they are told that the sergeant is away, and that they can get a drink as Guard So-and-so, who is on duty, is a terribly decent fellow.  It would be well if that kind of thing could be done away with. Keep the public houses open to a reasonable hour so that any decent man can go in and take a drink without being worried as to what Guard is on duty.  I suggest to the Minister that a 9.30 closing on a Saturday night is farcical. It was introduced during the period of the British régime.  At that time the majority of workers were paid on a Saturday night, but now, so far as industrial workers are concerned, most of them are now paid on a Friday night.  I think, in spite of what Deputy Morrissey has said, that a big number of workers in the country are also paid on a Friday night.  There is no necessity at all for this 9.30 closing on a Saturday night.  As the representative of a rural, constituency, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that Deputy Fogarty understands what the full implementation of his suggestion, that there should be uniform opening and closing hours in the county boroughs, urban districts and rural areas, would mean.  I gathered from his remarks that his suggestion, if adopted, would, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, mean that the hours of work for those employed in city premises be extended to 11 o'clock at night.  The Deputy in making that suggestion was not, I am sure, conscious <Col N="1761" /> of the hardship that it would involve on grocers' assistants.  If he were conscious of it, I would remind him that it would be a retrograde step to take at this time, a step which even a foreign Government agreed it would not be in the interests of those engaged in the business, or of the community itself, to take.  Whatever may be said for varying the hours in the rural districts, I am absolutely and completely opposed to any extension of the hours of opening in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy McMenamin for the reasons explained by other Deputies.  Deputies who represent the rural areas are not concerned with Deputy Hannigan's problem.  We are concerned with the people who sent us here.  As other Deputies mentioned, to confine the trading hours from 10 o'clock to 10 o'clock in rural areas means, in effect, to confine trading to the period from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock by watches in the country.  Along the western seaboard, it means that, measuring time by the sun, you are closing down the public houses at about 8.30.</P>
      <P>I do not want to stress the points which have already been made.  It is something gained that the Minister has accepted the proposition that there should be no differentiation between the rural population and the city population as regards the cutting down of hours.  Whatever action may be taken as regards the people for whom Deputy Hannigan speaks, I hope the Minister will grant the extra hour to the rural areas.  Whatever way the Dublin problem be handled, I think that the Minister ought to accept the principle that 11 o'clock be the closing hour so far as all the rural areas are concerned. Men in the country do not finish work until considerably later than Deputy Daly mentioned.  He mentioned 8.30 p.m.  My experience is that, during the summer, they work until dark and that is usually later than 8.30.</P>

A man using his scythe cannot, in these circumstances, go in and have his pint at the end of his day's work or his week's work.  I appreciate what the Minister has said and I know how he must be pressed by the voices of persons who were not able to get many spokesmen here.  They are a very important and very influential body but they have a habit of attempting to regulate other persons' lives and there has always been a great deal of pressure in this House to make us do things which we were not entitled to do.  There has always been an inclination by these people to get the House to legislate so as to impose on the Gárda what is really the duty of the Churches.  It is not the duty of the Gárda Síochána to prevent people from committing sin and that is really the duty which these persons are putting us into the position of imposing on the Gárda Síochána. The job of keeping people from committing sin is, with all respect, the job of the Churches and not of the Gárda Síochána.  It is the job of the Gárda to prevent people from committing crime and we must not be over-influenced by those persons, no matter how important they may be in the community, into imposing restrictions on the lives of the ordinary citizen.</P>

    <P>I spoke on another Bill here last week on which Deputy Dillon waxed wroth about interference with family life.  I refer to the School Attendance Bill.  I am sorry that Deputy Dillon is not now present.  The School Attendance Act might as well not exist at all so far as 90 per cent. of the population is concerned.  They would have carried <Col N="1763" /> out the duties imposed upon them by the Legislature in any event.  But, in this case, because of a few drunkards or a few &ldquo;hard-chaws&rdquo;, every member of the population is restricted by licensing legislation.  I do not blame the Minister for that; it was his inheritance. There is a good deal of unnecessary restriction on people in connection with what should be an ordinary, essential portion of their freedom. Now that the Minister realises that there should be no differentiation between town and country with regard to reduction of licensing hours, I hope he will go a step farther and extend the time in the country to 11 p.m. to meet the needs of the people there.  Further, I hope that he will give the same facilities to every portion of the country in respect of Sunday as the boroughs enjoy at present.  However, that matter will be discussed on another amendment.</P>

      <P>Take the case of a mixed house in the country, carrying on grocery, distribution of newspapers and the liquor business.  That class of house employs a number of apprentices.  In some just after leaving school.  At present, they are working a 14-hour day.  They meet the bus at 8 o'clock in the morning and they are selling papers until the pub opens at 10 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I want to get back to the point I was making.  If you extend the hour in the evening, the danger is that, in cases where the law is not being carried out as Deputy Davin and we all would desire, apprentices may find themselves working 15 hours instead of 14 hours.  If I thought that this amendment would involve these apprentices in greater hardship, I would vote against it if there were a free vote.  The Minister for Justice would require to consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to preventing these abuses if he accepts the amendment.  Deputy Davin has been talking tommy-rot.  In villages in his own constituency, and up and down the country, he knows that apprentices are being overworked, and he has just as much responsibility in his constituency as I have in mine.  His interruption does not take from the arguments I have advanced.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Hannigan, who now sits on the Labour Benches, has taken upon himself the responsibility of making a case for the employees in the licensed trade in the city.  If he has taken on himself that responsibility, I should like to ask Deputy Hannigan and any member of his Party who claims to speak on behalf of labour and organised trade unionism whether it is their policy to propagate the limitation of hours in any particular industry or trade?  That is entirely different from the question of a working week for any particular section of workers.  As a member of this House and a member of the Government Party I made a statement on the Second Reading of this Bill which I repeat&mdash;that, having got the 48-hour week, for which this Government is to be thanked, I now look to the men who made that organisation. They are pretty old men now, many of them, and if you limit the hours in that particular trade the men who made that organisation are going to suffer. That is my answer to the young men <Col N="1765" /> who may have approached Deputy Hannigan and other Deputies.  From the general point of view, I think the licensed trade in Dublin is doing a service in agreeing to operate those hours. Why are they agreeing?  Mainly because they hope that the Minister will allow <i>bona fide</i> traffic to operate outside the county borough for at least one hour after the city houses close.</P>
      <P>It is because the city traders are concerned with the interests of other property owners outside the county borough that they agreed to operate those hours.  So far as the employees are concerned, as I stated on the Second Reading I was president of the employees' organisation, and I always advocated the 48-hour week; it is now the law of the land, and not merely an agreement between employers and employees.  I am not prepared to play Party politics on a matter like this which I think is of grave importance to the community.  Our main purpose should be to endeavour to bring in legislation which the Guards can operate and, if you oppose this amendment, Deputies on all sides of the House know perfectly well that you are encouraging illegality; you are making a law which we know perfectly well cannot function in practice.  I appeal to the Minister to accept one or other of those amendments, preferably of course Deputy O'Loghlen's amendment. I am perfectly sure that Deputy P.J. Fogarty is just as concerned with the interests of the city trade and the city workers as Deputy Hannigan or any other Deputy.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Cooney is adopting the line of advocating additional hours of work so far as those assistants are concerned, and has made reference to the 48-hour week, perhaps it may be well to explain to the House how that 48-hour week works.  On four days a week those young men work from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. with three hours off for meals.  On the fifth day they work from 12 noon to 10 p.m., with three hours off.  On the sixth day they have a half day off, and on the seventh day they work from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.  They have only two evenings off in the week as compared with other <Col N="1766" /> shop assistants, who are free every evening from 5.30 p.m. as well as having a half day during the week.  I am absolutely amazed at the attitude of Deputy Cooney.  I thought he would be the last Deputy in the House to advocate any type of legislation which would injure the young men employed on this particular work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no experience of the liquor trade, and I am afraid I have as little experience as the Minister himself of public house business; the Minister knows that.  We are from the same constituency, and I would appeal to the Minister as a colleague. I am not appealing even on the grounds that the farmer or the agricultural labourer needs a drink after his work.  I am not appealing even on that score, although I am not averse to taking a drink myself, an occasional one.  But I would appeal to the Minister to consider whether it is fair that the farmer or the farmer's wife or the farmer's son who wants tobacco or a bottle of castor oil from the local grocery shop should find that shop closed at 10 o'clock, summer time. Summer time is not recognised in the country.  They do not go by the clock in the country; they go by the sun.  They have to save their hay by the sun; they cannot save it by the clock.  If the Minister was living in the country himself, and he or some member of his household wanted something urgently from the local grocery shop, would he consider it fair that they should find the shop closed at that hour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As various Deputies have pointed out, if it is closed at that hour you are going to have illegal trade.  I am not saying that the farmer or the agricultural labourer is not entitled to a drink, but I am not making any pleas on that score because I do not think it is really <Col N="1767" /> a necessity; but if he does go there for something which he urgently requires, and finds the shop closed, I think it is a very great hardship on him.  I do not want to ask the Minister to do anything that is very embarrassing from the legislative point of view. I do not know whether it would be embarrassing in that sense to have different hours in the country, but if he could do it I think it is a reasonable thing to ask, because country hours of work are not at all the same as town and city hours.  As Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and various other people have pointed out, by that alteration you are in fact merely leveling up the city and country workers and giving them equal opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to Deputy Cooney that, so far as I know, there is nobody sitting on these benches who wants a discussion on the proposals contained in this Bill for the purpose of playing Party politics.  Let him get that out of his head right away.  I think he has misunderstood, I suppose unconsciously, the remarks made by Deputy Hannigan.  I am very glad that the Minister has agreed, without stipulating hours, to accept the proposal that there should be uniform opening hours in the areas outside the boroughs on week-days, including Saturdays.  The only difference there is between the Minister and members, I think, on all sides of the House is in regard to the hours that are to be fixed.  I agree with Deputy Brennan, Deputy O'Loghlen and Deputy Linehan; I do not want to repeat what they have said.  They have expressed what appears to me to be the viewpoint of reasonable people in the country.  Many Deputies in this House would not be able to express so well as Deputy Fionan Lynch has done the viewpoint of perhaps the majority of members sitting on every side of the House.  He has said things which we could not say as well, things which are quite correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;this is where I do not agree with him&mdash;in speaking on a previous occasion here said that he was not prepared to face up to increasing <Col N="1768" /> the facilities for drinking purposes under the terms of this Bill.  Mind you, that statement is in conflict with what is contained in the Bill.  This Bill, if I have read it correctly, proposes to give increased facilities for drinking purposes to the people who live in the borough areas.  In Dublin City, as plainly shown in the Bill, it is proposed to have a split hour, and to increase the number of hours from three hours on a Sunday at present to five hours under the terms proposed in the Bill, while at the same time the Bill in other sections proposes to restrict facilities for drinking in rural areas.  I am not prepared to accept that line of policy and I do not think anything that has happened in this country between the passing of the 1927 Act and the present time would justify the Minister and his supporters in restricting drinking facilities in areas outside the boroughs.  I think the proposal contained in the amendment of Deputy O'Loghlen which was supported by Deputy Linehan and others, should receive the careful consideration of the Minister.  I hope he will give an undertaking to give it such consideration between now and the next stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very deep sympathy with the views of the Minister in regard to extending facilities for drinking generally.  I think there is a very big volume of opinion in the country which is opposed, and rightly opposed, to drinking, particularly drinking to excess.  It must be remembered, however, that this amendment in one sense does not increase drinking facilities because, at the moment, we have drinking facilities in connection with the <i>bona fide</i> trade and these facilities the Minister intends to continue under this Bill up to 11 o'clock, as he proposes to amend the Bill. Therefore, drinking facilities will exist up to 11 o'clock, even when this Bill is passed, as the Minister visualises it, but these facilities will not be as satisfactory as if public houses were completely open.  Much has been said about the viewpoint of those who stand for increased temperance in the country.  I have taken the opportunity to consult one of the ablest advocates <Col N="1769" /> of temperance in the provinces and his viewpoint might be summed up briefly in these words: &ldquo;Give those who require drink reasonable facilities and reasonable hours, but if you have the public houses open during reasonable hours, when they are closed, let them be closed completely.&rdquo;  In other words, his viewpoint was that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be completely abolished.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has agreed to extend the hours under this Bill up to 11 o'clock, in as much as he is allowing facilities for <i>bona fide</i> travellers up to 11 o'clock.  I think it would be in the best interests of all concerned, the trade and the public, and it would also prevent abuses to have public houses completely open up to 11 o'clock, instead of having one hour from 10 to 11 o'clock when the shop door would be closed while drinking was still taking place inside.  To have the public houses open when they are supposed to be open, and closed when they are supposed to be closed, is the reasonable solution of the problem.  The whole question is what constitutes reasonable hours for opening and closing.  I think the reasonable hours for opening are those when people are out and about. That would be, in the summer time, up to 11 o'clock, official time.  After that, let the public houses be completely closed during the hours when normal people are in bed.  I think that this amendment, therefore, is quite reasonable, and will make for more satisfactory conditions and less abuses.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, I expected someone to come to my help but I have got no aid at all.  The only Deputies who objected to the extension did so, not on principle, but because the people engaged in the trade themselves, those working in it, did not want to have to work late hours.  Being a Minister in a democratic Government, naturally I have to take some notice of what has been said on both sides of the House.  I was hoping that we might get a compromise.  If I agreed to a closing hour of, say, 10.30 p.m. and to have that general throughout the country, would Deputies accept it?  In respect to the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Lynch, I fully appreciate that what he said was largely right.</P>
      <P>We all realise that we cannot legislate the people into sainthood but he must bear in mind that other Governments, which had no intention of doing that, found it necessary to impose restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor.  I have found a certain code, which I thought was a very good code, in the 1927 Act.  There were a few small things in that Act which required adjustment but my one big aim was to wipe out abuses.  That could not be done without amending the provisions in that Act in regard to <i>bona fide</i> travellers.  If it were only genuine travellers were concerned, I would not have attempted to restrict the facilities provided for them but we are all aware that, not alone in Dublin and Cork, but in every town in the country these facilities had been abused.  People left the public houses in a town at the closing hour and then went a few miles outside and started drinking again.  I say that was never legal but the Gárda could not prove that these people went outside merely for the purpose of getting drink.  That was the reason that prompted me to attempt to restrict facilities for <i>bona fide</i> travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if I have got no support here on principle, I have got some support for other reasons.  Deputies have expressed concern here about the interests of employees in the licensed trade if the hours are extended.  I think Deputy Cooney answered that point <Col N="1771" /> very well when he said that if the employees had a 48-hour week, they did not appear to have very much grievance. On that point I should like to make a reservation as regards Sunday work.  It may be prejudice on my part, being an old hurler myself&mdash;I think I am entitled to have my prejudices as well as everybody else&mdash;but I am impressed by the statements that these employees could not have a game of hurling in Dublin or other cities if the new hours were put into operation.  I think that would be a very bad thing.  Apart from that, nobody has supported me in my stand against an extension of the opening hours.  Seeing that there is a demand for it I offer the House half-an-hour on the hours proposed in the Bill, namely 10.30 p.m.  If Deputies would accept that, I am prepared to bring in an amendment to give effect to it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(bb)  on any Sunday, before the hour of two o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of six o'clock in the evening&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put down in an effort to remove the abuses which most of us in rural areas know have existed for a considerable time in regard to the sale of drink on Sundays. I expressed the view here in the House, during the discussions on the 1927 Act, that it is intolerable that there should be an exchange of populations on Sundays, to enable one section to get a drink.  We all know that that has been going on for a considerable time. The people who want to get drink on a Sunday will get it by the back door or the front door of the nearest public house to the place where they reside; or, if they do not wish to break the law, they will travel by cycle or bus to the distance laid down by the law, to get whatever refreshments they require. I want to see that system done away with.  I believe the Minister wishes to have it done away with.  The only way to do that is to allow the houses in rural areas in any part of the country to be open for a reasonable period on Sunday, not cutting across <Col N="1773" /> Church hours.  I am surprised to see Deputy Joseph Kennedy looking at me with an expression which makes me feel that he is going to lash me for making such a suggestion.  The same abuses have been going on for a number of years in my constituency as I know to exist in his and in every other constituency throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can see his way to agree to a general opening for a limited period on Sunday, the only question left for decision by the House is as to what is regarded as a reasonable period and what are the most suitable hours.  I have heard some Deputies&mdash;colleagues of my own who sit on the opposite side of the House&mdash; suggest Sunday opening between 12.30 and 2.  Personally, I believe that anybody who wants a drink should take it only after the day's work has been done.  I try to live up to that myself and I am not speaking here as a teetotaller or as one who would deprive anybody of what I think I would be reasonably entitled to get myself.  It appears to me that, in the rural areas, the people go on Sunday to early Mass at 8 or 9 or to late Mass at 11 or 12. In their own interests, I would give these people an opportunity to go home and look after their business&mdash;and in the rural areas people have business to do on Sundays as well as on week-days. Then, if they require refreshments and if they have time to go and look for them, it would be reasonable for them to do that between 2 and 6&mdash;the hours I have mentioned in the amendment standing in my name and in that of Deputy Keyes.  I know it is the Minister's intention to provide hours of that kind for those who require refreshment in the borough areas.  The Minister has proposals in this Bill making it possible for public houses in borough areas to be open between 1 and 2 and between 3 and 7, thereby increasing from three to five the number of existing drinking hours on Sunday.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas there are football and hurling matches and other forms of amusement on Sunday afternoon, and it is only reasonable and right&mdash;though Deputy Allen may disagree&mdash;that the <Col N="1774" /> people who gather to attend such sporting functions should have the same rights as the people who attend such functions in the borough areas.  I have gone to almost every hurling and football match held in Dublin for the past 35 years and I have taken part in the games played in city and country; and I challenge anyone listening to me to say that, either in the City of Dublin or in provincial towns like Thurles, Waterford, Kilkenny, Portlaoighise or Tullamore, or in other areas where hurling and football matches are played, and where the public houses are open for more than three hours&mdash; sometimes for five and six hours&mdash;there has been any excessive drinking.  Of course, the Minister has information over a long period from the Gárda authorities on this matter.  May I ask him to say whether, on the basis of the information in his possession, any serious reports have been submitted to him since the passing of the 1927 Act to justify an allegation that excessive drinking has taken place in provincial towns where hurling and football matches were played and where licensed houses were open for four, five or six hours on a Sunday?  Licensed houses are open on Church holidays and I have never seen any excessive drinking, or any sign of it, in the towns, villages or cities on Church holidays.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister accepts the proposal of uniformity of opening in regard to week-days, including Saturdays.  I am asking the Minister to accept the same kind of proposal in regard to Sunday.  If there is justification for the opening of licensed houses in the borough areas between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock, and 3 o'clock and 7 o'clock, or whatever hours are finally agreed upon by the House on Sundays in these areas, I do not see why the people in provincial towns and in rural areas should not get the same facilities.</P>
    <P>There is another reason that I am prepared to give, but perhaps Deputies may not agree with me in this matter. If you have Sunday opening in the areas outside the boroughs.  I believe many people who now have to do shopping on week-days and who, perhaps, <Col N="1775" /> by so doing, waste valuable time in the summer months and in the busy periods of the year, would do their shopping on Sundays instead of being compelled to do it on the week-days as at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen, who has a one-track mind on this question, is laughing at me, but I think he knows as well as I do that in his area the houses where drink is sold in the rural districts are houses that will fit in with the description given by Deputy Kennedy, houses where they carry on a mixed business, including the sale of drink.  If the farmer or his wife or any member of his family wants to do shopping, less time will be lost by doing it on Sunday if facilities of the kind suggested are agreed to.</P>
    <P>I make the case in favour of this proposal that it will do away with existing abuses in the rural areas which we all deplore.  I am not speaking for other members of the Party when I say that I would be prepared to wipe out the <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sunday for the purpose of getting an amendment of this kind accepted.  I believe if the suggestion contained in the amendment were adopted, it would be easier for the Guards to administer the law.  I believe the law would be administered in a more efficient manner if you had a general opening on Sunday of the kind suggested in the amendment.  I hope that the Minister, having agreed to uniformity of opening on week-days in every part of the country, will accept the same principle in regard to Sundays.  I hope that he will accept this amendment. Whether the opening be for three or four hours is a matter of indifference to me, so long as he agrees to the principle of uniformity and allows a reasonable period of opening to accommodate those people who are entitled to reasonable refreshments on Sunday.</P>

      <P>There is a strong case to be made for Sundays.  It is not so much a question as to whether we should get an opening on Sundays as well as the boroughs; it is the way the Sunday openings have been utilised in the country.  Under Section 16 of the 1927 Act, if a football match, a carnival or any other function, was to be held in a country town on Sunday, the Gárda superintendent was entitled to go to the district justice and say that in his opinion the Gárdaí might not be able to cope with the situation properly, and in order to enable the Gárdaí to carry out their duties an area exemption order would be necessary. Such an order would then be given for that area.  In three towns in the western portion of my constituency, Millstreet, Kanturk and Newmarket, it has invariably been the habit of the local superintendent on such occasions to apply for an area exemption order and the public houses have been allowed to open for certain hours on Sundays.  I do not think the superintendent or any of the Gárdaí or even the justice could ever say they were sorry over the granting of the facilities asked.  Conditions were much more orderly because of the permission granted to open the public houses.  If you had not those facilities for opening on Sundays on such occasions, what would it mean?  I suggest that instead of people going into the public houses for a couple of hours, the 5,000 or 6,000 people who would attend the football match or other function would be chasing each other up every laneway and in every back-door, looking for a drink, and get it they would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief point I want to make in connection with this amendment is that we should, in this Bill, aim at framing legislation that the people will be prepared to obey.  I believe that reasonable <Col N="1777" /> facilities should be given in the country districts.  One of the greatest advancements in social legislation in this country would be to get the idea out of the heads of people that there is nothing wrong in breaking the licensing laws.  Unfortunately, there are many people who feel that no harm is done if they break those laws.  If you can insert provisions in licensing legislation that will make the people feel that when they go beyond the code they are definitely doing something wrong, then you will have made a good step forward.  I should like the Minister to consider the experience of Gárda superintendents in cases where they have obtained exemption orders.  He should ask them whether they are satisfied with the results that have been achieved.</P>
    <P>There ought not to be differentiation between the rural areas and the boroughs.  There are certain small towns that do not come under the classification of boroughs or towns with a population over 5,000.  They are towns situated in the tourist areas, small seaside resorts, shooting or fishing centres.  The people who go there have not the same facilities in the matter of drinking as they would have in Dublin or Cork.  It is unreasonable to expect that these areas would be so restricted when their opposite numbers in the boroughs have facilities.  I doubt if it can be contended successfully that, if the Minister grants the opening hours on Sundays, it will lead to increased drinking in the rural areas.  I suggest that if there is Sunday opening in the country there will, in fact, be less drinking.  The case has been made that on holidays, such as the 29th June, the 15th August and 1st November, days on which the people in the country normally do not work, they never seem to bother about going into the public houses, although these are open.  On the other hand, when the public houses are closed on Sundays, there are many people who will succeed in some way in getting drink.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there will be any excessive drinking if country public houses are allowed to open on Sundays for a reasonable period.  I suggest it will improve the status both of the public <Col N="1778" /> houses and the people who go into them if you have reasonable hours of opening.  It will certainly remove one objectionable feature.  Everybody knows that people who are anxious to have a drink will get into the public houses in the country on Sunday. There may be four or five men together.  They will have an eye on the public house door and also an eye on what may happen if they do not get out in time.  Five or six of them enter the public house and they have five or six drinks in a very short space of time.  If the public houses were open, five or six of the them would not go in together; one or two might, and they would spend half-an-hour over a few drinks and then they would leave.  The existing practice is definitely bad.</P>
    <P>As regards the Sunday opening, it is hard to find people in agreement about the hours.  Deputy Davin mentioned that we should not interfere with Church services.  Some people would like an hour in the morning, others an hour at midday, and there are more who would favour a few hours in the evening.  I think 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and 3 o'clock to 7 o'clock in the evening, speaking in terms of summer time, would be suitable. I do not approve of the suggestion of opening from 2 o'clock to 6 o'clock.  When hurling or football matches are held in the cities, I would be as well pleased to see the public houses closed for ordinary trade during that period, from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  I think the natural hours would be the hour before dinner and a couple of hours before people have their tea.  If those hours were given in the country districts, I think there would be fairly general agreement.  I have an open mind as to what the opening hours should be.  I would be satisfied if some hours were granted on Sundays.  I would not like to press the Minister if I thought he would move further down the slippery slope in regard to Sunday opening.</P>
    <P>I put this last plea to the Minister. He has gone a long way already in his agreement on the question of hours to make this Bill a good one, and he has now the opportunity of making it a <Col N="1779" /> very good one.  He has now the opportunity of getting everybody in the country with the possible exception of cranks to agree that in general this will be a very good licensing Bill if he gives way on the question of Sunday opening. The Minister said that the cranks have nobody to raise his voice for them in the House&mdash;these people who, as Deputy Lynch said, would regulate everybody else's life&mdash;but I do not think these cranks could make a case against Sunday opening.  I should be much happier in making my case for it if there was somebody in the House who represented these people and who was prepared to say why they would not give Sunday opening in the country.</P>
    <P>If there is any Deputy who thinks there is anything wrong in rural Sunday opening, I should like to hear his reasons.  I can see only two reasons. One is that it might increase drinking in the country and I should be prepared to meet any Deputy, or anybody else, inside or outside the House, and argue that point.  The only other objection would be an objection from the point of view of religious services and if the hours are arranged in a reasonable manner there could be no such objection. But if there is still a type of mentality inside or outside the House which believes that because you give people in the country reasonable facilities they will get drunk, I say that is utter nonsense.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that will be suggested; my reason for making the point is that you will get an undercurrent of criticism outside the House from people who are probably quite pleased because the concession has been granted, but who will go around saying: &ldquo;It is a great pity they made this concession, because there will be murder in the country.&rdquo;  I think there is a great case for Sunday opening, and I believe that if the Minister agrees to move further down the slippery slope or, as I would put it, agrees to progress still higher up the ladder of proper licensing legislation, he will make the Bill quite a good one.</P>

      <P>I propose to make the case against Sunday opening as one <Col N="1780" /> who was reared in the trade and is still in the trade, and I am delighted to be up against Deputy Davin in making that case.  I was computing, while Deputy Davin was speaking, the number of assistants behind the bar in the small village I come from.  They number eight, and Sunday opening, in effect, will mean that, instead of going to their hurling match or other recreation, these eight assistants will be behind the bar during the hours of sunshine from January to December.  For that reason alone, I am opposed to Sunday opening.  There are ten public houses in the village I come from and six of them do not open at all for <i>bona fide</i> trade on Sundays.  In the case of the others, it is the man and his wife, or the son and daughter, who deal with whatever <i>bona fide</i> trade comes along. What will be the result of an acceptance of this amendment?  You will pin down every assistant behind the bar for the seven days of the week.  There will be no 48-hour week for them and no trade union in a little village to look after their rights.</P>

      <P>I am sorry; I thought the Deputy said there was less drinking. I have made the point that the majority of these public houses do not open on Sunday.  They open on a Church holiday and the aggregate drinking in the village is much greater on a Church holiday than on a Sunday. From my own personal knowledge, we have a far bigger turnover on a Church holiday than on a Sunday&mdash;you are going all the time up to the hour of closing at night.  That is the case generally.  I would far sooner see Deputy Allen's amendment, although I <Col N="1781" /> profoundly disagree with his view, by which the Guards would have the right to oppose the licensing of a premises which was abusing the <i>bona fide</i> traffic accepted, than to see this amendment accepted, by which every public house on a Sunday will be open.  I said on Second Reading, and I think Deputy Davin will agree with me in this respect, that I would not like to see a trek from the church or chapel to the public house.  That is one of the worst things that could happen.</P>

      <P>I say that whatever abuses of the <i>bona fide</i> trade exist&mdash;and abuses do exist&mdash;they are nothing to what will occur if you open every public house in the rural parts of Ireland on Sunday.  In these districts there are not the amenities or recreations which exist around the cities, and instead of going out to the fields, to the lake or to the countryside, men will go into the public house when it is open.  On the occasion of a big match in the big towns the public houses have special facilities in respect of opening.</P>

I quite agree that they should get that facility, but what will you do to all the assistants in Mullingar, all these people who go out to Cusack Park for recreation on a Sunday, if you accept this amendment?  You will pin them down behind the bar from Christmas to Christmas, and they will have no recreation at all.  I therefore oppose the amendment.  Bad as the abuses of <Col N="1782" /> the <i>bona fide</i> traffic are, they are nothing to what will occur if the Minister accepts it.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with Deputy Linehan in supporting this proposition, which is also contained in Deputy McMenamin's amendment, the discussion on which was deferred to this amendment.  I have been trying to find out the origin of this differentiation in treatment between the people residing in the boroughs and in the country areas.  I cannot understand what the origin of it was.  The only thing that occurs to me is that it must have been due to the old feeling with regard to the Pale &mdash;that all the people outside the Pale were wild natives, but that inside the Pale you could give facilities which could not be given to the natives outside.</P>
      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle were here, he would remember an incident that occurred when the first party was going across to penal servitude after the Rising.  The Ceann Comhairle was in my bunch, and I remember as we were passing through some English town, the people rushed up to the escort to ask whether the rebellion had been suppressed, and so on.  One young English soldier said in reply to the question: &ldquo;Yes, it is all right now, but some of the 'ill tribes have not yet been brought in.&rdquo; The attitude of this legislation is to deal with the rural population of this country as &ldquo;'ill tribes.&rdquo;  There can be no case made for it except the fact that it has been in our legislation for a very long period.  There is no reason whatever for the differentiation between the boroughs and rural districts.  If anything, a better case could be made for these facilities in rural areas than can be made for the boroughs.  I think the time has now come when we should cut out the differentiation.  In the part of the country to which I belong, quite a number of persons are paid on Sundays. I refer to the fishermen who are paid by the buyers largely on Sundays, and I think that fishermen, after their week's toil, are as much entitled to their bit of relaxation as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> Apart from that, I entirely agree with Deputy Davin that it would not tend to increase the amount of drinking. It would stop the ridiculous flow, which other Deputies referred to, from one town to another in order to become <i>bona fide.</i>  It would provide facilities for the person who wanted a drink to get a drink in his own neighbourhood and then go home about his business.  It would ease matters very considerably for the licensed trade.  If the licensed trade in the rural areas had a few hours' opening on Sundays, they could serve the people who wanted a drink and then let them go. I would be inclined to think that a great many traders would refuse to open at all after these hours for any <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
    <P>As to the point made by Deputy Kennedy, and also by Deputy Hannigan in reference to the last amendment, I think that in a trade of this kind which is carried on under public legislation and which is to a great extent a public service, the assistants must accept the position that they are public servants, just the same as railwaymen and bus men.  These men have to work on Sundays and, so far as I have ever heard, there is no agitation against their hours of work.  Any adjustments that would be required with regard to hours could easily be made.  But I think the principle of differentiating between the residents in boroughs and the people outside the boroughs is wrong.  As we are settling this legislation now for many years to come, I think we should put an end to that differentiation between the rural population and the population in the boroughs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the amendment moved by Deputy Davin. I do so, not with the desire of providing additional facilities for drinking on Sundays, but in order that the whole question of intoxicating liquor legislation shall be put on a basis which bears some relation to realities.  The present position in respect to the opening hours of public houses in rural areas in relation to the position in the county boroughs is entirely anomalous. This is national legislation.  Yet you <Col N="1784" /> have a situation arising in which, for instance, a person can get refreshments in Dublin, or in Cork, or in Waterford.  But persons living a small distance from these cities are not able to get refreshments in their own towns and must therefore travel by some means into the county boroughs where these facilities are provided for them and for the citizens of these particular cities.  Will the Minister say why, for instance, a person can get facilities for refreshments in Dublin on a Sunday and cannot get them in Naas?  Is there any reason why persons living in Naas cannot be trusted to conduct them selves in a public house on a Sunday?</P>
      <P>Why is there the assumption underlying this legislation that it is only in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick you can trust the people to conduct themselves in a public house on Sunday?  I think the present differentiation against persons living in rural areas is entirely indefensible and I should like the Minister to indicate what grounds he considers exist for preventing a person in a rural area from getting facilities for refreshment on Sunday.  I am sure the Minister will claim for his own constituents in Roscommon that if the licensed premises in that county were open on Sundays his constituents would behave themselves with just the same propriety as the citizens of this city. Yet the Minister attempts to stand over a piece of legislation which unfairly penalises the residents in rural areas and provides special refreshment facilities for people living in the large cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may try to argue that the opening of licensed premises for four hours on Sundays in rural areas will provide additional drinking facilities. The Minister is surely living in the clouds if he imagines that these licensed premises are not opened on Sundays at present.  The Minister can go to any town in Ireland on a Sunday and he will find persons frequenting the public houses in these towns; not between the hours of two and six, as is suggested in the amendment, but that they go into these public houses after Mass.  He will even find people in these public houses late on Sunday <Col N="1785" /> evening as well.  Everybody with eyes in his head knows perfectly well that that happens in provincial towns all over the country and in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks, however, to put the legislation on some kind of an equitable basis.  It proposes to provide four hours' facilities in these rural areas, and I do not believe that there is any likelihood that our people will abuse the facilities which would be made available during that short opening period.  I think the Minister ought to recognise that, by allowing licensed premises in rural areas to open on Sundays for the short period of four hours, he is really providing a facility which he admits is necessary in certain cities.  If the Minister were to provide that facility in the rural areas, I think he would do much more to regulate the <i>bona fide</i> traffic and to put our intoxicating liquor legislation on a sound basis than he will by refusing to provide that facility for the people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Look at the anomaly which exists at present.  If, for instance, a person in Newbridge wants to get a drink on a Sunday all he has to do is to cycle into Naas where he can get all the drink he wants.  If a person in Naas wants to get a drink on a Sunday, all he has to do is to cycle to Newbridge.  In that way you have a change-over of the population in order to get behind the present stupid restriction on opening in rural areas on Sundays.  I think the Minister might very well recognise that there is a strong case for opening for a short period in rural areas on Sundays.  If the Minister meets that demand, which I think is founded on reason and equity, and which seeks to eliminate the present differentiation to the disadvantage of the rural dweller, I think he will be taking a more effective step in the way of improving the <i>bona fide</i> and licensing legislation, than by ignoring the strength of the demand which exists at present for a short opening on Sundays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I supported Sunday opening for the rural districts, and I say, frankly, to the Minister that if he is not prepared to give the same facilities to the rural population as are given in <Col N="1786" /> the Cities of Dublin and Cork, to enable them to have a drink on Sunday, he should close down the public houses in Dublin City and Cork City.  Let us have an end to class legislation here in this country.  We have had too much of it.  I do not know what is wrong with Deputy Kennedy, but I can understand his attitude.  I spent a couple of days in the County Westmeath, and the men there do not want a couple of hours on a Sunday to drink at all, because they drink the whole time.  They only work for about two months in the year, saving a crop of hay, or something like that, and they have the rest of the year to drink. They have no trouble there.  I should say that the publicans in Castlepollard would probably get more trade than the publicans in Mullingar on a Sunday in the course of ordinary trade.</P>
      <P>However, what I want really is to see some fair reason being given that entitles any Minister in a national Parliament in this country to class the rural population of the country as some kind of highwaymen who are not to be trusted, whereas the civil servants in Dublin City must get their drink.  According to this kind of legislation, the people of Dublin City and Cork City are allowed to come into the scheme, but the rest of us are not to be trusted, and that is what has turned the licensing laws of this country into a joke&mdash;an ordinary, common joke.  I will guarantee to the Minister that he cannot show me one Gárda station in the rural portions of any of the TwentySix Counties where the Gárdaí are able to enforce the liquor laws, and the reason for that is that it is practically impossible for a man to enforce a law that he himself knows to be wrong, and where the people will not co-operate with him.  After all, there is little enough drink now left for the country people, without having the city topers coming out when they are finished drinking in the city.  I am saying this as one who does not drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that this is an unjust law and, frankly, I will not vote for any Bill that casts such a slur on me or my constituents, because I think that they are just as much entitled to a drink on a Sunday as the city people are.  Quite frankly, I could not stand for such <Col N="1787" /> legislation, so far as my constituents are concerned.  Can the Minister give me any reason why a loafer, living in No. 40 of some particular street in a city, can walk in next door, to No. 41, and get all the drink he wants?  That man can leave at 2.30 and then come back at 3.30 and stop in the pub until it closes, whereas the countryman cannot get a drink at all.  The ordinary, hard-working farmer or farm labourer in the country has to get up on his bicycle and cycle a few miles, or walk it, in order to get the same facilities.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say, on the Second Reading of this Bill, that one of the reasons for this was that these people should be able to get a drink in their own district, and I am asking him now to give the ordinary farmers or farm labourers, who are working, not for the 48 hours a week that the city workers do, but the whole week long, including Sundays and Church holidays, the same facilities as are given to the city workers.  I am referring to the unfortunate fellow who, with the spade and shovel, the plough and the harrow, and so on, is producing food for the drones of this country, and I think that such people should be given the same facilities as the Minister is giving to the drones by this legislation.  We are entitled to a fair crack of the whip and to fair play. I can make that plea as a teetotaller, as one who does not drink, but one who knows what his constituents require. Men have to come to milk the cows on a Sunday afternoon, and they have no way of getting a drink in peace and comfort.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to this picture, and that is definitely one side of it. That is the side of the rural population, and we will not stand for class legislation here, because we had enough of that before.  This country is bigger than Dublin City and bigger than Cork City, and we should consider the rural population, because they are entitled to consideration.  The Minister has told us that he is a democrat and that this is a democratic country, but surely to heaven, if the Gárdaí are giving him any reports at <Col N="1788" /> all as to the operation of the licensing laws in the rural areas, he must realise that, so far as Sunday trading is concerned, these laws are just an ordinary, common joke.  They are not observed, and nobody expects them to be observed.  Is the Minister going to perpetuate that kind of thing?  I would say that if this were left to a free vote of the House, there would not be 20 men voting against the rural population not being entitled to the same facilities as the city population.  The Minister must know that, and if this is going to be democratic rule, let him enforce it and give us those facilities. If it is right that a city public house should be allowed to remain open from 1 to 2 o'clock and from 3 to 7 o'clock on a Sunday, then the same facilities should be given to the countryman, and he should not be asked to cycle or walk three or four miles on a Sunday in order to enjoy a pint of porter in peace.  It is unjust and unfair, and I am sure that the Minister is the last man to impose an injustice on any man if he could avoid it.  I appeal to him to consider the whole position and not let the little whispers of nine or ten cranks in this country prevent him from giving fair play.</P>
    <P>I am not a drinking man myself, but I have sympathy with the man who wants a pint, and who wants to have it in peace and comfort, and, incidentally, they will get their drink in spite of all the Guards, whether they come down through the roof or any other way.  This thing is only nonsense, and it is only making the Guards unpopular in the areas where they try to enforce the law.  It is creating a situation in which the laws of this country are held in contempt and ignored. That is what is happening, and I appeal to the Minister to give fair play and abolish this idea of class legislation. Goodness knows, it has been going on long enough, and I suppose it could be traced back to this matter of the hill tribes, to which Deputy Fionán Lynch referred, where the citizens of cities like Dublin and Cork were specially favoured, and the so-called hill tribes were outside the law.  Let us have an end to this thing of having special laws for one section of the community. <Col N="1789" /> It is unfair and unjust, and nobody wants it.  If a plebiscite were taken in the morning, not 5 per cent. of the people in this country would vote for the total closing of the public houses on Sunday.  This is only perpetuating a rotten law.  Evidently, when the 1927 Act was brought in somebody was too lazy to remove this injustice from the Statute Book.  It is an injustice on the rural population&mdash; a rotten injustice&mdash;and the time has come when it should be wiped out, once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to make up his mind that whatever law is put on the Statute Book will be obeyed.  I am sure the Minister, if he reflects on this matter, will see that the law will not be obeyed and cannot be respected if public houses in the country are closed by law on Sunday.  In spite of all laws, it has been the practice, at least as long as I remember, for people to do a good deal of shopping on Sundays, especially after 12 o'clock Mass. Even though there was not much drink served, some drink was consumed.  The woman might have a bottle of lemonade; the young fellow might have a bottle of lemonade; somebody else would have a bottle of stout or a pint. The shopkeeper was always afraid of his life, while that was going on, that the Gárda would come long.  Sometimes, the person who was doing that trade was brought to the court.  There has been a lot of confusion about it. But if you do not allow public houses to open on Sunday you will have that sort of thing going on all during the whole day on Sunday.  In regard to about 40 or 50 per cent. of public houses there has been illegal trading. Perhaps the other 50 or 60 per cent. of publicans were well-to-do, who did not depend entirely on the drink business and did not do an illegal trade.  Forty or 50 per cent. did an illegal trade and drink was served during the whole day on Sunday, perhaps from 9 or 10 o'clock in the morning until 10 or 11 at night, in spite of anything the Guards might do.  The Minister can help to do away with that by allowing public houses to open on Sunday.  I do not altogether agree with Deputy <Col N="1790" /> Davin's suggestion that it should be a four-hour opening, from 2 to 6 o'clock.  I am looking at it from the point of view of what happens in my part of the country, and I hold that there should be an opening from about one to two, after last Mass, in all the small country towns and villages, so as to give the people that I have referred to a chance of doing their shopping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there should be a break so that the people&mdash;especially the young fellows&mdash;will go home to their dinner; and then have a three- or four-hours' opening later on.  That would also serve the purpose as regards hurling matches and any other amusements. It has been my experience&mdash;and I think every other Deputy in the House will admit it&mdash;that if you go to a strange parish on Sunday to see some people, the first place you are invited to is the public house.  The publican gets afraid and is told it is all right when there is a Deputy present, that the sergeant will not want to see him. If the public house is allowed to open for an hour, and afterwards for a few hours, it would do away with all these illegalities and it would give the Guards a chance of doing their duty. It would also give every decent publican a chance of doing his duty.  A publican must try to oblige his customers even though it is against the law, especially when it has become the rule, as it has for a number of years. I think it was Deputy Kennedy referred to Church holidays and said that the turnover on Church holidays in public houses was greater than on other days.  Naturally, it should be, because on Church holidays nearly all farmers go into the village or town to do their business, and naturally they spend a good few shillings here and there.  Closing on Sundays does a lot of harm to the poor labouring man or the poorer sections of the farming community who have only a few shillings to spend on Sunday.  He has no time before 10 o'clock at night during the week to have a drink.  Perhaps he has not the price of it.  He tries to have a few shillings for tobacco and drink on Sunday.  He has no means of going to pictures.  He does not <Col N="1791" /> want to travel a mile or two to see his neighbour.  His only chance of relaxation is to go to the public house on Sunday, where he can get a couple of pints and have a chat with his friends. If he is not allowed to do that under the law, he will go to the public house and, as I think Deputy Corry mentioned, he will get his pint while somebody is at the door watching the Guard.  He will swallow that pint and get another.  That does him much more harm than if he could sit down with his friends and have a few drinks.  I am not concerned about Dublin, but I would appeal to the Minister to grant the same facilities to the country as he grants in Dublin.  I think he has gone a good way in the Bill but unless he allows some opening on Sunday he is not going to have the law observed.  The law will be broken, no matter what the Guards do.  The Guards will not feel like enforcing the law.  The decent publican will not be able to have the law observed and it will give a chance to the tippler and the fellow who loves drink to continue breaking the law.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 17 is in my name, and is to the effect that the facilities in the city should obtained in the entire country.  Having listened to the discussion here, I do not propose to proceed with that amendment, but to support amendment No. 8, simply for the reason that I was influenced by the attitude of the shop assistants in the City of Dublin, and the fact that the hours that are set down in amendment No. 8 for opening on Sundays are straight hours, from 2 to 6 o'clock.  I believe that to satisfy the consumer, the publican and the assistants, the hours in the City of Dublin should be 2 to 6&mdash;a straight run, with no break.  I appeal to the Minister to have the same hours in the country.  He has made provision in the Bill for <i>bona fide</i> trade between the hours of 1 and 8, but the amendment means that the facilities that exist in <Col N="1792" /> the four county boroughs should be granted in the country areas.  I maintain&mdash;and I have maintained on the Second Reading of the Bill&mdash;that the Mullingar man is as much entitled to have a drink in Mullingar between 2 and 6 p.m. as the Dublin man is to have a drink in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The only person who put up some argument against Sunday opening was Deputy Kennedy.  I had the good luck to be in Deputy Kennedy's premises in Castlepollard where, if I mistake not, he has a hotel.  Hotels have greater facilities than other premises, as local people can go into them to have a substantial meal and all the drink they want.  I am not saying that that was the case in Castlepollard.</P>

      <P>In country districts there has not been any abuse of the licensing laws.  An increased amount of money may have been taken by licensed traders, but no Deputy can say, and the Minister cannot show by statistics, that there has been excessive drinking in villages.  I am sure the Minister realises what a farce it is to have men walking from Rathcoole to Tallaght to get a drink on Sunday, and meeting men half-way from the other end on the same errand.  The natural inclination of some people, with present drinking facilities, is to try to get drink.  They will know that a certain Guard is on duty, that the sergeant is away, and that the Guard will walk to the other end of the town while they slip into the public house. When dinner is over on Sunday the incentive is for people to take a bus, or to cycle to some place over the border line and to stay there until 8 o'clock at night.  The ordinary man, when he is finished his dinner, should be able to go to a public house for a drink, and perhaps play a game of darts.  Why should a man in Donabate who can afford to pay a subscription of three guineas to a golf club, or a <Col N="1793" /> man in Killarney who can afford to pay a subscription of three guineas to a golf club, be able to go to these places and to bring in lady friends to have a drink, while the ordinary working man is not permitted to go into a public house?  I suggest that there would be less drinking and less abuse if people in the different localities were permitted to have a drink on Sundays between the hours of 2 and 6 o'clock, which I hope will be the hours for the city houses.  The Minister has, I hope, learned a good deal since the Bill was introduced.  If some Deputies would not feel comfortable at a public house bar that is no reason why the ordinary countryman should not make himself comfortable.  I hope that people will be able to have a drink in their own districts, if they want it, and not have to walk three miles to get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless legislation of this kind is very carefully handled it may lead to very grave abuses.  I consider the restrictions already in force have gone too far, and that our attitude generally towards the sale of intoxicating liquor is too strict.  The proposal to differentiate between inhabitants in large centres of population and those in other places is an illustration in point.  I have not had an opportunity of looking at the Constitution, but certainly it is an infringement of the spirit of the Constitution to prohibit a man in the country from having a drink at the same time as a man in the city can have it.  Another illustration would be if a book was in question and if censorship would only operate in a country district.  That is similar to the present proposal.  It is something like imposing one kind of taxation in the country and a different form of taxation in the city.  I am altogether opposed to making any differentiation between people living in the city and the country.  An additional point, as regards my constituency, and I am sure there are other constituencies also affected, concerns what I am glad to say is the growing holiday traffic. Many of our holiday resorts which are becoming more important are situate in rural areas.  There is no reason why persons who go on holidays to these <Col N="1794" /> places should not have facilities for having a drink on Sundays, particularly on a wet afternoon.  Such facilities would add to the attractiveness of these places.  I do not think there is any argument in favour of suggesting preferential treatment for one place and not for another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will support the amendment.  I fail to see why there should be any differentiation in the treatment of citizens of the State in one district more than another.  I have always resented the attitude of people who look upon rural residents with eyes of suspicion and as being inferior beings.  There is that type which looks on rural residents as not being at all on a par with city dwellers.  It is also quite common to regard the agricultural labourer as not being a skilled worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When preparing legislation for the country generally I do not see why there should be preferential treatment for one class of citizen as against another class.  So far the amendment has met with support with, perhaps, one exception.  Is the Minister prepared to accept the amendment now? All the arguments have been in its favour.  Many Deputies referred to the inability of the Guards to enforce the present licensing laws.  Everybody knows that the Guards are unable to do so because the laws are ridiculous. Laws that cannot be enforced should not be on the Statute Book.  If we had a regiment of people they could not catch the culprits who break the licensing laws, and accordingly it is hopeless to expect a few Guards to do it.  Everybody knows that the law is being flagrantly broken.  There is every inducement to break it, when it differentiates between residents in rural districts and town dwellers.  In the case of Dublin, Limerick or Cork there is every inducement for a person who wants to get drink illegally on Sunday to go three miles to get it. The local publican says to himself that he might as well have that man's shilling as the city publican, so that what he is prevented by law from doing he does underhand.  It is human nature. He reasons that the law is unfair to him, and that, if it will not do him <Col N="1795" /> justice, then he is going to do justice to himself.</P>
    <P>There is another point to be considered, the effect that the present law has on the man who wants a drink.  I hold that a man in the rural area is just as well able to conduct himself as the city dweller, and if the law considers that it is a good thing for the city dweller to be able to have a drink on a Sunday, I do not see why the man in the rural district should not be entitled by law to the same facility.  No evidence has, so far, been produced that the man in the rural district is not able to conduct himself as well as the city dweller when he takes a drink. In fact, everything points to the contrary. One of the main reasons, so far as I know, why this Bill was brought forward was because a certain section of city dwellers were not able to conduct themselves.  Because of that it has been found necessary to propose that certain disabilities should be inflicted on the rest of the population. That was the argument that was made when this Bill was brought forward, that city dwellers were not able to conduct themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said city dwellers.  I said that what I had to complain of was general all over the country.  I repeat that now, and, what is more, every Deputy knows it to be so.  When I made that assertion I saw heads nodding all around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I unhesitatingly accept what the Minister says of what he intended to say or did say.  I know that he would not wilfully mislead the House in anything.  We all know that if a local man wants a drink he will get it somewhere.  If he can get it locally he will go to the local &ldquo;pub&rdquo; for it, and will take one or perhaps two drinks if he is accompanied by a friend. If that is not possible he will go to the nearest city.  On the way there he will probably be joined by some others, so that there will be several rounds of drink, all of them coming home in the best of humour in the evening.  They will have left all their money with the city publican.  That is an unfair and an unjust law.  We ought to recognise it as such.  No case has been made for <Col N="1796" /> the retention of that section in the original Act in this Bill.  I hope that in this measure we are making a final attempt to draft legislation to control the drink traffic.  We should make the law such that it will be obeyed.  To the knowledge of everybody the present licensing laws are being flagrantly violated.  The framers simply laid down conditions that were an inducement to people to break the law.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see in operation here a set of licensing laws that would have the approval and support of the average citizen, and that would then be ruthlessly carried out by the officers in the service of the State. What is happening at present, and what has happened in the past is this: If the police in town or village are to do their normal job efficiently as policemen, the job of preventing and detecting crime, they have to be on good terms with the public in their area.  The common sense of the Guards and of the ordinary citizen would regard it as unreasonable to have a person, who got into a licensed house on a Sunday and had one drink, taken into custody and brought before the court.  The Guards feel that.  As well as the Guards, every reasonable person in that area would say: &ldquo;Ah, could you not have let him in for a drink; what is the harm in a man having one drink?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no use in talking about the law, since if that man lived in the city he could drink for three hours on a Sunday afternoon, and do that within the law.  People are not fools.  They could never see any just case for that differentiation between the country and the city.  The view of the Guards, men of common sense, coincided with that of the average man, and when they saw a man trying to get a drink on a Sunday they just walked the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister, by sticking to the present legal position, is under the impression that there is no drinking going on in the country, or that there is no drinking going on all over the country on Sunday, then he does not know the country.  Whether or not the <Col N="1797" /> Minister legislates to have an opening all over the country for two or three hours on Sunday will not affect, by one bottle of stout, the amount of drink that is consumed in the country on Sunday.  If people are going to consume drink on a Sunday, or on any other day, I would rather see them consume that drink in the local house where the proprietor will know them and their wives as customers in his shop.  He will have some interest in those individuals.  He will also be interested in not antagonising their wives and losing their custom.  What is happening, as things are, is that people who want a drink go to the next town for it, and simply because they have cycled three or six miles they say to themselves that it was never worth while doing that just to take one drink or two.  They make a whole day of it, and sometimes a whole night of it.  I believe that for those who want a drink the present laws are an inducement to take drink to excess. No man is going to travel seven or eight miles just to take one drink and go home again.  If he goes that journey then, according to his lights, he is going to get value for the journey.  If the local public house were open on a Sunday for a reasonable time it would prevent all this transfer of population, of men going from one town to another to get drink.</P>
    <P>I would not quite subscribe to the full terms of the amendment.  If there is to be Sunday opening, taking into account that Sunday is an idle day, and that in the country you have not the same amount of counter attractions on that day that you have in the cities, I think that a set term of four continuous hours of opening would be overlong.  Some reasonable concession should, I think, be made in regard to the country.  Now that the point has arisen there is, I believe, a responsibility on the Minister to justify the differentiation between the town and the country.  There is a responsibility on him, in piloting this Bill through Parliament, to justify historically, or on class or conduct lines, why it is perfectly legitimate for anybody living in certain zones of the country to walk into a licensed house and drink there, <Col N="1798" /> within the law, for a defined number of hours, and why a man living outside that zone is breaking the law by doing likewise.  There has got to be justification for that discrimination.  It may be said that you have a number of people going to and coming from the city. Those people have been met by the hours for <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  They were always in a position to get a drink.  I cannot see justification for the discrimination. I do honestly believe that if people are to drink&mdash;and the man who wants a drink will get it in spite of any law&mdash;it is better they should drink in their home area, where they are known to the proprietor and to the shop assistant and where it is in the interest of the man who owns the house and the man who works in the house to see that the customer does not go home in such a condition as to bring the wrath of the woman of the house and other members of the family down on the place where he was drinking. I should far rather see people drinking in their own area than doing as they are doing at present, and as they have done in the past&mdash;taking a bus, a tram, a car or a bicycle and going off to the next town where nobody has any interest in them and they are, comparatively speaking, unknown.  I think that there is a sound case for some facilities for the people living in the country.  I think that the demand for four hours is slightly too much, but there is a case for a reasonable opening period on Sundays in the country.  There will, then, be more public opinion behind the Gárda in dealing with the trader who infringes the law.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned that anybody who wants a drink after late Mass will get it.  The Minister may not feel comfortable standing against a public house counter, but he never got where he is without occasionally standing against a public house counter after a meeting down the country.  I am sure that the Minister never experienced any more difficulty than I did in treating a few friends after a country meeting on Sunday.</P>

      <P>That is so in every village, and the reason is that members of the community and members of the Gárda Síochána regard the restrictions on the country as against the city as unreasonable.  The Gárda feel that public opinion would not be behind them in carrying out the present law. It has been stated here that anybody who wants a drink after late Mass is able to get it.  I should rather see people having their midday meal and then having a drink or two than having a drink before their midday meal &mdash;provided that the hours available for drinking on an idle day be not long enough to permit of their doing themselves any harm.  There would be little harm in anybody's drinking at any time if he had food down before the drink.  What did harm and what caused grave scandal on fair and other days was the fact that unfortunate people, before taking quite a moderate quantity of drink, had lost their normal amount of sleep and were starving since perhaps 6 o'clock the night before.  Quite a moderate amount of drink put them, in these circumstances, into a very bad state.  I should like to see a reasonable opening period in the country as well as in the city on Sundays.  I do not see any reason for discrimination, and I should rather see people drink in their own town or village than go to the next town or village to do so.</P>

      <P>This amendment is on all fours with amendment No. 10, and the effect of the combined amendments would be to secure uniform opening hours for licensed houses in city and country.  That is an end which, I understand, the Minister is anxious to secure.  It has been definitely indicated in the debate that the granting <Col N="1800" /> of the facilities which this amendment suggests would go a long way to eliminate the abuses existing under what are termed the <i>bona fide</i> laws.  I urge the Minister not to be too strongly impressed by the views expressed by Deputy Kennedy.  He regards this matter from a very narrow angle&mdash;the interest of the hotel proprietor as opposed to the interest of the owner of licensed premises.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of correcting the misunderstanding that seems to have arisen with regard to the grocers' assistants so far as this matter is concerned.  It would appear from some of the remarks made that these were a body of men who were entirely concerned with their sectional interests.  That is far from being the case.  They are not so much concerned with their own interests as they are with the requirements of the public.  They hold&mdash;I think, rightly&mdash;that they are in as good a position as anybody else to know what the public requirements are in this regard.  I am almost certain that the hours suggested in this amendment would be acceptable to these people because it would eliminate the disadvantage under which some of them already suffer in having to work all day on Sunday.  That is a point of which the Minister should take serious note.  Under the existing law, men have to work all day on Sunday.  I am sure that nobody would condemn that more strongly than the Minister himself. On the Second Stage of the Bill, the Minister stated that he would give earnest consideration to the views expressed by Deputies.  I think that the speeches delivered show that the House is overwhelmingly in favour of this amendment.</P>

I must say that we were met very fairly by the Minister with regard to the every-day opening.  He has done a good day's work for the licensing laws in granting the extra half-hour, because that will stop abuses in the rural areas.  With regard <Col N="1801" /> to this amendment, I would say to the Minister that if he accepts it he will be doing away with a lot of abuses which are taking place on Sundays in rural areas.  If the people are given facilities for having a drink at a reasonable time on Sundays&mdash;say at the same time as in the cities, from 2 to 6 p.m., those abuses will disappear.  I believe that the members of the licensed trade would be very glad of that.  Listening to the speeches made by some of the Deputies here to-day, one would think that those of us who are members of that trade are all the time breaking the law.  I would remind the House that we are a very respectable section of the community.  I was born and reared in a public house, and I am proud of it.

      <P>In line 13 after the word &ldquo;effect&rdquo; to insert the following words: &ldquo;and shall be deemed never to have applied or to have had effect&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to give retrospective effect to the <Col N="1802" /> provisions of Section 4, bringing it back to the year 1939.  The object of the amendment is to secure that the town of Killarney, for instance, and other towns similarly situated should be recouped for their losses over the period during which they had been paying an excess rate to their county councils while receiving only a much smaller rate from the Electricity Supply Board.  The position in Killarney is this: the poor law valuation of the premises of the old Kerry Electric Supply Company in Killarney was £378 when it was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  Under the provisions of the former Electricity Supply Act, the Electricity Supply Board paid rates only on £118 of this property, leaving a difference of £260 on which they paid no rates.  In the period since 1938 the Killarney Urban Council has paid to the Kerry County Council the rates on £378, while they collected from the Electricity Supply Board the rates on only £118.  They were, therefore, in the ludicrous position that they were losing £131 a year, due to the fact that the Electricity Supply Board premises were rateable at all.  It would have paid Killarney better during the past four or five years if the Electricity Supply Board had no rate attached to them, because they had to pay to the Kerry County Council more than twice as much as they were receiving in rates from the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>In the year 1941, for instance, they lost £281, and over the number of years since this provision took effect as far as Killarney is concerned&mdash;since 1938&mdash; Killarney lost in poor rate £868 16s. 8d., and in town rate £522, a total of £1,390.  That was due to the fact that the present provision provided for by Section 4 was not in force over that period.  It has now been recognised by the Minister that that provision in the Electricity Supply Acts prior to this was inequitable, but I think he might go a step further and get the E.S.B. to refund the rates that they should have paid over that period in the town of Killarney.  This is a very serious matter for the town, because 1d. rate in Killarney raises only £30, or a little <Col N="1803" /> bit over it, and they have been losing about £280 a year for the last five or six years; that is the equivalent of a rate of something like 9d. in the £.  It would take a rate of something over 9d. in the £ to produce £280, the amount which Killarney has been losing.  I would ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the proposal to make this provision retrospective at any rate to the year 1939. In order to meet the whole position in Killarney it should go back to 1938, but if the Minister would agree to go back to 1939 or even to 1940 it would help to a considerable extent.  I do appreciate that he has made that provision now for the future, and I need not say that the Killarney people are very glad to see that provision in the Bill. Naturally, they would be still more pleased if he would go the whole way, and see that they are recouped for the amount they have been paying in excess of what they have received.</P>

As Deputy Lynch has pointed out, the revenue from the rates has been very adversely affected and that fact, I think, should reinforce the claim to have this provision made retrospective.  It is very rarely we approach the Government with a request such as we are now putting forward and I think, in justice to our people, and to the people of Killarney in particular, the Minister might see his way to accept the amendment and so enable the urban council to recoup the money which they have lost through the system that has been in operation since this undertaking was acquired.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accede to the demand that has been put forward by Deputy Lynch.</P>

      <P>The two Deputies who have spoken are, of course, concerned <Col N="1804" /> only with the position that exists in the town of Killarney and the effect of this amendment of the law in relation to the rates position there.  It is a fact, however, that the provisions of the 1930 Act affected the income of local authorities elsewhere, although I will admit that in no case, of which I am aware, was there such an increase in the valuation of premises as occurred in the case of Killarney and very few cases where that increase in the valuation of the premises involved the local authority in a loss to the extent to which Killarney Urban Council was involved.  Nevertheless, I think we must not forget that the amendment which it is now proposed to make in the 1930 Act will affect the position in other districts as well as Killarney, and the adoption of the suggestion in the name of Deputy Lynch would also have effect outside the town of Killarney.  I think, therefore, while appreciating the force of the case made by Deputies Lynch and Flynn, that the argument at the moment appears to be in favour of rectifying the position for the future and not attempting to go back over the past even though it must be admitted that the situation which arose in Killarney from the effect of the operation of the Act of 1930 was anomalous and unfair to the citizens of that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I am somewhat at a loss to understand why it is proposed that this amendment of the 1930 Act should be made retrospective to 1939. I presume, if there is a case at all for doing it, it should be just as strong in favour of having the amendment made retrospective to the date on which the Killarney undertaking was acquired by the board, which was in 1937 rather than 1939.  While I admit the force of that position in relation to Killarney, I could not say, and it would be almost impossible to find out without a very elaborate examination, what the circumstances in a number of other areas would be and what the effect of the proposal of Deputy Lynch might be in these other districts.  I will admit that in these other districts it may not involve a very substantial amount of money because there was no case where the increase in valuation was so <Col N="1805" /> great but some complications might arise, and on that account I would prefer if Deputies would agree to accept the Bill as it stands and be satisfied with having the position rectified for the future without this proposal to give retrospective effect to the provision.</P>
    <P>I must confess, however, that I cannot argue very strongly in favour of that course because it is obvious that there is considerable force in the case made on behalf of the Killarney Urban Council.  The ratepayers there might consider that they are entitled to the windfall which this would mean for them.  The adoption of the retrospective proposal would mean a windfall for the ratepayers of Killarney inasmuch as it would put them in a very comfortable position in the near future. On the principle that what is past is past, that the rates which were levied on these premises in Killarney have been collected, and that the injustice which had been imposed on the ratepayers is recognised and is now being rectified, I suggest it would be wiser to leave the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I think that a survey could be made by the Electricity Supply Board with a view to determining the amount involved in these cases. I am not going to press the amendment to a division, but as the Minister has stated there is really no justification for allowing the matter to stand as it is.  I realise that my amendment would apply to other areas as well as Killarney, but would the Minister not consider introducing an amendment on the Report Stage to confine the proposal to Killarney only?</P>

      <P>There is no other case where the amount of money would be so substantial as in the case of Killarney.  I suppose the argument might be made on behalf of other urban authorities outside Killarney that if there is force behind the case of the Killarney Urban Council there is just the same force behind similar claims made by these other authorities, even though the amount might be only a few pounds or a comparatively small amount in comparison with the amount involved in Killarney.  It would be an inconsiderable sum in relation to the revenue of the Electricity Supply Board, but quite a considerable amount in relation to the finances of the Killarney Urban Council.  On the whole, I think the balance of argument &mdash;and I must not try to force through here a provision which is against the balance of argument and the merits of the case&mdash;is in favour of making this amendment of the law retrospective.  I think, however, if we accept the proposal at all, we might as well go the whole way and make it retrospective to the date on which the undertaking was acquired by the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not think we could justify the arbitrary selection of a particular date, and say that the proposal should take effect as from that date only, because it would be illogical.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy would let the matter stand it would give me an opportunity of examining what consequential provisions are necessary, because some consequential provisions might be required fully to safeguard the position.  It might be no harm to give the Minister for Local Government an opportunity of seeing how the accession of this considerable lump sum to the Killarney Urban Council should best be controlled in the interests of the ratepayers of Killarney. I cannot say that he will have any particular views on the matter, but I should like to give him an opportunity of considering it.  If the Deputy would allow the matter to stand until the Report Stage I shall produce an amendment, the effect of which will be to make the adjustment of the position retrospective to the date of the acquisition of the undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to raise on this section.  The section is intended to apply in the main to certain people employed in the Pigeon House and who, at a certain time, were put out of the service of the board and afterwards became employees of the board again.  They had qualified for a pension under an earlier Act and were in receipt of that pension, but when they were taken back the pension service pay was deducted from their wages. In other words, if a man got £3 11s. and 11/- for pension, he did not get £3 11s. wages although that might have been the rate of wages, but got £3 and 11/- pension.  The point is being met now to the extent that these men who have extra years of service in the second &ldquo;life&rdquo; of their service with the board will have those years counted towards final pension, but they suffered in certain other ways. Some of the people, on being taken over from the corporation service, were in receipt of what is called &ldquo;service money&rdquo;.  The corporation had a system under which they gave men an increment of 1/- for every two years that the men remained in their service on the permanent service staff. When they had ten years' service, they got an extra increase of the princely sum of 5/- a week.  When those men with &ldquo;service money&rdquo; were taken over the 5/- was not taken into account and their wages dropped by that amount.  I suggest that this might be a time in which some recognition of that fact could be made by having it counted at least towards the final pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as it stands, one of the conditions precedent to a person becoming <Col N="1808" /> entitled to that pension is that, on the date of the passing of the Act, as sub-paragraph (d) says, they have been in the continuous employment of the board for not less than five years. I do not know why that period was put in.  I understand there are a dozen men involved in this.  I am speaking of Pigeon House men only.  This &ldquo;five years' continuous service&rdquo; after the date of the passing of this Bill would cut out three of the men, and why that should be done I do not know.  There does not seem to be any necessity for a limit.</P>
    <P>The final point is one on which I have not been able to make the calculation myself, but the case has been made to me that, if these people were to have their service, so to speak, deemed to be service under an earlier Act, they would become entitled to a higher pension on final retirement than they will get under the junction of the first pension with what they get under this.  I do not know why they should be deprived of the little extra bit of pension.  It seems to be a little injustice to those men.  They were put out at a particular time when the policy of some members of the board was that it was one way to destroy a man's pension rights.  The station closed down in a particular way, and amending legislation was necessary.  The injustice is clearly shown in the case of these men, as, within some two or three years after they were put out, they were taken back.  Some of them did not come back immediately, as they got other occupations which they regarded as good ones, but eventually the whole twelve returned to the service of the board.  That goes to show there was no great reason why they should have been put out.  If they had stayed on and qualified for a pension without a break, I am told the pension they would secure would be greater than that secured by the addition of these two amounts.</P>
    <P>There is another point which does not appear on the face of this measure. As I read this with the pension scheme in the recent Act I understand that the qualification with regard to 65 years of age will be read in with this measure. It means that some of these men who may qualify will qualify for the full <Col N="1809" /> pension after a limited number of years.  Take one man's case: he will qualify in another 20 years, but he cannot secure any part of his pension unless he serves for another 15 or 17 years.  Anyone who knows the Pigeon House work, or even knows the difficulty in getting down to the Pigeon House, must be aware of the weather conditions these men have to face, and the type of work they have to do.  They would not be considered such good lives, from the point of view of work, as men in other occupations.</P>
    <P>However, if any one of these people fails to carry on to 65&mdash;unless it is what the earlier measure calls failure on account of &ldquo;ill health&rdquo;&mdash; he will forfeit the pension altogether. It has been put to me that representations should be made to the Minister on the point that as these men are not getting the full amount which they would get if the service were regarded as continuous, this point should be taken in conjunction with the second point that they cannot claim anything until they are 65.  The Minister could alleviate the situation by making them qualify for the full pension just as it stands under this Bill, but adding that if any of them have 15 or 20 years to serve after the date on which they would be entitled to get the full pension, then something extra would accrue to them to bring their pension up more nearly to what they would be entitled to under the original measure. On the point of the five years' limitation, I do not know why it is included. The second point is the service money, which the Minister should look into, to see if those people who were in receipt of service money will have that reckoned eventually for pension purposes, even though they may not, in fact, be enjoying it.  I cannot ask the Minister to see that they get it now, as it is pay and not pension.  The third point relates to those people who would qualify for the full rate at an early enough stage, but who have to work 20 years until they reach the 65 pension period.  I suggest that they be allowed some increment of pension for every five years after which they qualify for the full pension, until they reach the age of 65.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the three points made by Deputy McGilligan together.  So far as the five year qualifying clause is concerned in the section, the Deputy should remember that in this section we are dealing not merely with the former employees of the Pigeon House generating station who were re-employed, but also with former employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company's generating station.  Their situation differed from that of the Pigeon House men in so far as they had no pension rights, while the Pigeon House employees had rights secured to them by law and accruing to them in the event of the circumstances arising which did in fact arise&mdash;namely, their service in the station being discontinued when it was taken over by the board.  The tramway station was taken over much later.  It occurred to me while listening to the Deputy that, while we are doing what I regard as reasonable justice to the former employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company's station, in the doing of that we may be acting a little unfairly in the case of these three Pigeon House workers to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
      <P>I would be glad if he would leave that case over, as I may be able to amend the section in such a manner as to meet the case of those three workers without, at the same time, extending the privilege to other workers formerly employed by the Dublin United Tramways Company who would not have the same claim to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can deal with this question of the 5/- which the Pigeon House workers might have got if the circumstances had remained unchanged. The determination of the rate of wages to be paid to employees is, of course, a matter solely for the board, and when the employees reach the end of their period of service and it becomes a matter of assessing their pension rights, clearly those pensions must be determined upon the basis of their actual earnings and not upon some hypothetical figure representing what they might have earned in entirely different circumstances.  I do not think justice requires that we should provide more than is being provided <Col N="1811" /> for here.  The employees in the Pigeon House station are being put in the position that they will get, at the end of their period of service, pensions on the same basis as other employees of the Electricity Supply Board, if they so elect, and I do not think that we should be required to do more than that.  It would, in fact, be unwise to attempt it, because it would have reactions upon the main pension scheme of the board which would be in many respects undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some of the statements made by the few people who came to the Minister's assistance with regard to Sunday opening. It was mentioned by Deputy Kennedy that the Sunday opening would affect the shop assistants. Deputy Kennedy's case was the only strong case made in opposing a reasonable opening on Sunday.  He said if the licensed houses were to open on Sunday the assistants would have to work on Sunday the same as on other days of the week, and he indicated that there would be great hardship in that case.  In a Bill like this, when you are trying to deal in a very general way with the intoxicating liquor business, you cannot allow yourself to be put off any particular principle by the reduction of an argument to some particular case.  It may be said that any alteration of hours, whether on Sundays or week-days, is bound to dislocate the manner in which any business is run; but that is no answer to the arguments put forward in favour of a Sunday opening. Whatever affects the assistants or other people engaged in the business is purely a matter for the trade and not for the broad principle of legislation. When the first Bill was introduced and the split hour was imposed in the boroughs, you had somewhat <Col N="1812" /> similar arguments submitted.  I cannot see any force in suggesting that there should be no country opening on Sunday just because it is going to affect the assistants.  The Minister is aware that a great number of the licensed premises in rural districts are run by the owners and their wives and families.</P>
      <P>The strongest point made on any side of the House in regard to Sunday opening, and I think it is the one point on which the Minister ought to give way, had reference to the due observance of the law.  I think even Deputy Kennedy, who supported the Minister in his viewpoint, did not answer that part of the case.  I have the feeling that when Deputy Kennedy mentioned that in his village there were different types of public houses, some that did not open on Sunday even for the <i>bona fide</i> trade and others that did, he was suggesting that an alteration of the Sunday hours would be completely for the benefit of the houses that catered already for the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  I do not think that that would be so.  There are quite a number of houses in the country that do not open on Sunday to cater for the <i>bona fide</i> trade just for the reason that they do not want to be bothered having to ask people at the door if they are travellers and where they came from, and having to satisfy themselves that by serving callers with drink they are acting within the law. I am quite satisfied that if there were reasonable hours of opening on Sunday in the rural areas the houses that at the moment do not open, even for the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, would be quite prepared to enter into normal trade competition by opening on Sunday afternoons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the hours are concerned, there has not been general agreement, even in the amendments, as to the proper hours for Sunday.  There appear to be two sections of opinion, some who want a few hours in the afternoon in a continuous period, and others who would like an hour early in the day and a couple of hours in the evening.  I do not think there is any great point in what hours the Minister decides upon so long as he grants some hours.  I cannot quite understand <Col N="1813" /> why there should be such Ministerial objection to Sunday opening. I have tried to deal with this Bill, since it was introduced, as fairly as I could, and I have tried to look at it from the point of view of my experience in a professional capacity, being engaged in prosecutions under the Licensing Act and otherwise.  I am convinced that a reasonable Sunday opening will strengthen the hands of the authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said he was sure the Minister must have had experience of what could happen on a Sunday after a meeting.  I am not concerned with whether the Minister was ever guilty of that type of breach of the licensing laws.  What I am concerned with is the normal social life of the countryside.  It is a recógnised fact that so long as a publican in the country is conducting his house properly, is not allowing people to get drunk and is not carrying on a noisy or a rowdy trade, the Guards will overlook people being allowed a certain amount of refreshment, and the reason for that attitude on the part of the Guards is that public opinion would not stand for anything else.  If you allow reasonable hours of opening on Sunday, I am quite satisfied you will have public opinion behind you for the enforcement of the law during closing hours. The best thing in connection with any licensing legislation is to have the force of public opinion behind the Guards in dealing with breaches of the law during prohibited hours.  As the law stands at the moment, they have not got a lot of moral force behind them and, if the Minister can do anything to improve that position, it will be much appreciated by the people.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything in Deputy Kennedy's point about the assistants.  In the towns to which he is referring&mdash;it is certainly so in the south&mdash;I am sure 75 per cent. of the licensed houses are run by the men who own them and by the members of their families.  I think I would be safe in saying that in the rural areas there would be about one assistant employed for every 500 licensed houses.  If there is any question of hardship on assistants, if there is any difficulty about the <Col N="1814" /> treatment assistants should get, it is a purely internal matter for the trade and not a matter affecting the broad principles of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not like to press this matter any further.  I am very anxious to hear from the Minister what his views are as regards Sunday opening.  As I said, the Minister took the first step in the right direction in respect of the first one-third of the Bill&mdash;closing hours. We are now in the second critical stage &mdash;Sunday opening; and we shall meet later on the third stage on which, I understand, he is not as firm as he was. I should like to hear whether he has any stronger reason than I have heard for the continuation of what really is discrimination against the rural areas. I should like to put to him that if he were to agree to Sunday opening, it need not necessarily be based on fixed hours applying to the whole country. If public houses in rural areas are permitted to open for three hours on Sunday, I suggest that the hours be fixed by the justice at the annual licensing court on the application of the superintendent of the Gárda, to whom representations could be made as to what hours were suitable for particular districts.  That would be an easy way of dealing with it.  My experience of district justices and Gárda superintendents with regard to the question of area exemption orders is that they have been very fair and very good, and in a matter like this their assistance would be very valuable.  As I say, I am trying to approach this matter as fairly as I can, and I would like to hear from the Minister if he has any weightier reasons for the continuance of complete Sunday closing in rural areas than we have so far heard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Linehan can be very glib about these matters.  I am living in the country.  I am a publican in the country.  I make my living by selling porter across the counter, and I know my neighbours.  I know well what I am talking about.  Does anyone in this House seriously contend that it will improve the standard of morality or the amenities of rural Ireland to open the public houses for three hours on Sunday?  I say that it will not.  I am one of those who believe that some of the decentest men in this country are publicans.  Any old nationalist&mdash;and I pride myself on being one&mdash;knows that, because whenever we were in a tight jam in the old days, it was to the publicans we went, and when some of the patriots were thumping their craws, it was the publicans who put up the money to keep the flag flying, when the patriots would not give you three-halfpence.  I am for the publicans; I am a publican myself, and anything I can do to help the licensed trade I shall be glad to do out of gratitude to men whose names are green in my memory at this moment, but no Deputy believes that it would be a salutary thing for the people or for the publicans to open the public houses for three hours on Sunday.</P>

      <P>I shall come to that in one minute.  There are in every parish two or three drunks who will come down the chimney, if you lock the door, to get a drink.  The fellows who are slipping into the shebeens through the back door and breaking the law because, they cannot resist the temptation to get a drink are &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;. For the fellow who has to slide in through the back door to get a drink and who cannot keep within the bounds of the law because his thirst has got the better of him, the proper description is a &ldquo;drunk&rdquo;.  Those who frequent shebeens and public houses outside licensed hours and go rolling home to their wives &ldquo;half shot&rdquo; are &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;.  I know them just as well as the Deputy.  I do not believe that anybody's interests will be served by opening the public houses in rural Ireland on a Sunday.  But, if you are going to do it, at least make sure that you will get the public houses closed at the hours you fix, because that is the real problem in rural Ireland at present.  I would not so much mind what hours you fix if you get the Gárdaí to close the public houses at the hours at which they ought to be closed, because it is a scourge and a persecution in rural Ireland to find the same half a dozen fellows in every parish with their wives complaining to the parish priest that their week's wages are being spent in the public house.  In 99 per cent. of cases the bulk of that money is spent after official hours.  The great evil in rural Ireland at present is the failure of the Gárdaí to enforce the closing hours in all public houses.</P>

I saw a case in rural Ireland in which a Gárda sergeant was sent around to close public houses at the closing hour.  That man, who never took a drink in his life, after six months was a dipsomaniac.

      <P>Whatever it was, the devil the many public houses he will close for the rest of his days.  The rest of the Gárdaí are trying to keep him out of the public houses instead of his trying to keep the people out of them.  I do not agree with Deputy Linehan that there is any lack of public opinion about the closing of public houses at a reasonable hour.  I do not know Deputy Linehan's part of the country, but I know my own.  There is no sympathy whatever, either amongst the members of the licensed trade itself, or amongst the public, for the individual who is habitually breaking the law by serving customers after the legal hours.  No respectable house in this country is run on the basis of serving drink to casual customers after the legal hours.  The houses that are doing that are doing it because they cannot get people to deal with them during the legitimate hours, as the stuff they are selling is so rotten that the people would not drink it if they could get anything else.  I know what I am talking about.  I know the houses which are opening and I know what they are selling.  I know what they are putting into what they are selling, and the best they put into it is spring water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement is the vital necessity. I do not think that the question of the hours you fix is of such prime importance; but whatever hours you fix let them be enforced.  I have always been inclined to sound the praises of the Gárda Síochána in this House, because there is much in what they do that is deserving of the highest encomiums.  But certainly their enforcement of the licensing law does not come within that category.  There is a variety of reasons why it is alleged that they are not able to enforce it.  I am sorry to say that I do not believe they will hold water.  I do not agree with Deputy Linehan that it is because there is a lack of public support.  There is not.  I know my neighbours too well. If it were not public spirit that would make my neighbours rejoice at the enforcement of the licensing laws, it would be jealousy.  That is the next most powerful motive which stirs the human heart.  They delight in seeing <Col N="1820" /> a neighbour caught.  The Gárdaí need not worry.  Every time they &ldquo;nab&rdquo; a publican, half the town will rejoice that So-and-so is caught at last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about publicans now.  I say to the Minister that enforcement of the law is the first thing.  I say to him that he ought to sit tight and have the public houses shut on Sunday.  He will get a lot of abuse for doing it.  But the vast majority of the people who do not make themselves heard will be profoundly grateful to him.  I know of no considerable section of the community in rural Ireland&mdash;and I know this country very well&mdash;who really want opening on Sunday.  My experience of rural Ireland leads me to advise the Minister that, if he opens the public houses on Sunday, he will confer no valuable amenity on anyone, but impose a good deal of unwanted competitive work on the members of the licensed trade, and he will create an evil the full magnitude of which I am not prepared to forecast with any degree of precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an important point of principle raised as well.  I know that matters of principle are not matters which commend themselves to Deputy Linehan; he thinks them all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;, and that we should not worry about them.  But, just as there is in the School Attendance Bill an important point of principle, this Bill has an important point of principle in it too.  I am no sabbatarian.  I believe that everybody should enjoy himself on Sunday within certain limits.  I do not believe that we should take up the <Col N="1821" /> Puritan view that you should not cook a dinner on Sunday, that you should have nothing but cold meat for fear anybody would raise his hand in servile work of any kind.  But I think in a Catholic country no servile work should be undertaken on Sunday except that servile work which is manifestly and genuinely necessary.  I suggest to Deputies that it is not an urgent necessity that there should be imposed on small publicans or their employees the duty of discharging the servile work of drawing pints of porter for thirsty citizens of the State on a Sunday; that standing behind your counter for four hours on a Sunday trying to earn your living is servile work.  There may be an urgent necessity for men like tram drivers, ambulance drivers or something of that kind, working on Sunday. Persons holding the Catholic faith have a reasonable and rational attitude towards the problem, and where the necessity is great, no objection is raised.  But I think there is a point beyond which we ought not to impose on people the obligation of doing servile work on Sundays when there is no necessity for it.  Certain Deputies will say that this is purely permissive; that under this Bill no publican need open his house if he does not want to.  That is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  If one opens, they all have to open, because one man cannot tell his neighbours to go away when the publican next door bids them welcome.  He knows well that that is the way trade is built up.  If one opens his door, they all must open.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in the practical down-to-earth atmosphere of this House anyone who dares to mention a matter of principle of this kind is looked upon as a half fool.  But questions of principle do matter.  They matter with regard to the licensed trade just as much as with regard to anything else.  Where is this clamorous demand for opening on Sunday?  I have not heard it in the country.  I submit that there are at least three formidable arguments which I brought forward to be met before the demand is even considered.  Then there ought to be some evidence laid before the House that any considerable body of <Col N="1822" /> the citizens want this before we establish it.  I know of none at all.  Accordingly, I urge the Minister to stick his heels in the ground and stand pat on his original proposal.  Let me say to him that no matter what he proposes in regard to the reform of the law in this matter he will find it difficult to get it through.</P>
    <P>The late Kevin O'Higgins, when he was putting a licensing Bill through this House, was regarded as the worst in the world.  He was denounced in all quarters.  I doubt very much if many people looking back on the licensing Bill carried through this House by Kevin O'Higgins have anything but respect for the memory of the man who had the moral courage to carry it through.  If many of the provisions of that Bill had been followed up with greater persistency than his successors had the courage to show, the situation of the licensed trade would be a great deal better than it is now.  The Minister is going to meet a barrage similar to that which he took a part in directing at the late Kevin O'Higgins.  I do not mean personally, but as a member of the Opposition of the day.  I believe he is a man of moral courage who is prepared to face that if he is convinced of the necessity of so-doing. I think in regard to this matter of Sunday opening he will be well advised to set his face against it and say he will not do it.  If subsequently it transpires that there is a clamorous demand for liquor refreshment on Sunday, we can consider it in a new Bill.  I do not believe that such a demand will ever manifest itself.  I think many hundreds of people, including the vast majority of publicans, will bless him if he puts an end to Sunday opening altogether.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of small publicans in rural Ireland do not want it, but if some of them get that facility, they will all have to work, whereas, if none of them are allowed to open on Sundays they will be able to earn their living on the other six days of the week.  So far as the public is concerned, nobody, except the chronic &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;, will be bothered about Sunday closing, I am quite sure, and, so far as I am concerned, <Col N="1823" /> I think we ought not to be very much worried about the needs of the chronic &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seems to forget that there is a differentiation in this country, and that some have an advantage that others have not.  The fact is that many people have every facility for getting drink on a Sunday&mdash;people who are not deserving of it and who have no work to do&mdash; while others, in the rural areas, who are at least equally deserving, cannot get it.  The Deputy is basing his case on the ten in a parish who are chronic &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;, but he is forgetting about the other 90 who, by their work, are carrying this country on their backs, and who cannot have a drink, from Sunday to Sunday, by reason of the nature of their work.  The Deputy must know that the work these people do is slavish work, and yet he says that they are not entitled to a drink on a Sunday, whereas the people in Dublin City or Cork City can drink to their hearts' content.  I cannot understand Deputy Dillon's attitude in condemning the 90 decent people because there are ten chronic &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; in a parish.</P>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to give these 90 people in a country parish the same opportunity that is given to the people in the cities, because it must be remembered that these 90 people have to work on Sunday morning, Sunday evening and, possibly, during midday on Sunday, because the nature of their work demands it.  Cows must be milked, hens must be fed, outhouses must be cleaned, and so on, and yet those who have nothing to do on a Sunday, except to go gallivanting around in the cities, are entitled to drink to their hearts' content, while the people to whom I am referring, who have to work so hard, are not entitled to a drink.  That is a mentality that I cannot understand, and I am appealing on behalf of the people who are entitled to have their drink in peace and comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that there are abuses at the moment.  The Minister, Deputy Dillon, and every Deputy in this House know that there are abuses, and the <Col N="1824" /> Minister must know that, so long as conditions remain as they are at the moment, the publican will have one eye on the door and the other looking out for the Gárdaí, whereas, if the public houses were open during the hours we are pleading for in the country towns, those abuses would disappear, because the decent people to whom I am referring could come in and take their few pints in comfort and case and then go home to their work.  I hope the Minister will agree to this and then see to it that the law will be strictly enforced afterwards and that there will be no such thing as watching the back doors once definite closing hours are fixed. As Deputy Linehan suggested, the hours could be arranged by the local district justices You cannot fix hours that would suit the whole country. What would suit one part of the country would not suit another, but I hope the Minister will consider this and give a chance to the people who are really deserving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the 1927 Act, but if this principle had been accepted in that Act, I feel sure that you would not have had the breaches of the law that are occurring at present.  Deputy Kennedy claimed that the bartenders would have to work overtime.  Now, as he knows very well, in a country public house the bartender has to be there all day, watching for somebody who might want a pint to be handed out to him.  Under this arrangement, instead of having to be on the watch from morning to night, they would only have the four hours to work on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>These four hours are what I am appealing for, to enable the rural worker &mdash;the man who cannot get a drink from Sunday to Sunday, and who is entitled to a drink&mdash;to have a pint or two in peace and comfort.  I think that the case for this amendment has been so well and ably put by the Deputies who have spoken that it is unanswerable. Deputy Donnchadh O Briain said, in effect, that everything was <i>maith go leór</i>, but I say that it is not good enough, and that if this amendment were accepted, it would certainly tend to make things much better in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that, by opening for trade on Sundays, you are doing away with the Sabbath, the day of rest, and the people who work behind the counters of the country public houses should have some chance of recreation.  Then, no matter what arrangements you may come to with regard to hours, there is still the question of redundant public houses in the country, and many of these publicans indulge in the kind of trade with which Deputy Dillon dealt so effectively. These people are prepared to supply the toper who will come in, no matter what hours you have, and the great mistake in the 1927 Act was that there was no provision for compensating these people and letting them get out of the business.  During the Second Reading I asked the Minister to reintroduce that principle in this Bill, and I again ask him to do so.  If he does so, he will be doing a service to the nation and to the people of the nation, and he would certainly get the applause of the people of the nation if he were to deal with the towns where there is a superabundance of public houses.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hannigan now trims his sail to support this amendment. I want to make that point.  He is supporting this amendment.  I want to say to Deputy Hannigan and others that there is a great responsibility on every Deputy in this House when they are dealing with questions of social legislation.  I claim that this is a very important piece of social legislation and our clear duty, to my mind, is to face up to the facts, irrespective of what the results may be to ourselves as individuals or to our Parties.  I only want to make this point and, if the Minister cannot give way, I, as a member of the Party, will have to go into the Lobby against this amendment, but my reason for supporting this amendment is that I would like to see a code of social legislation enacted here that the Guards will be able to enforce.  That is my point, the only point, and I think it has been made from many sides of the House.  I am perfectly certain that, perhaps within the next 20 years, all these cranks that Deputy Fionán Lynch referred to will come around a table and face up to the realities of the situation.  If we are ever to get anywhere in this country, the first thing we must do is to ensure that any law enacted in this Parliament will be one that can be enforced.  To have it enforced, it must have the respect of the people, and must suit the ordinary convenience of the ordinary people.  Restrictive legislation is a very dangerous thing, even in licensing.  This is a public service.  A Deputy on these benches, who is well known never to have taken a drink, speaking as a public representative, informed this Parliament that every Sunday he was breaking the law, and had to do it, in order to meet his constituents to consider and discuss matters affecting the particular area in which he lives.  That is a very serious matter.  For these reasons, I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

The Minister, if he knows anything about his own area, must admit that abuses do exist in the rural areas.  I would like Deputy Dillon to answer this: Is it better, for the sake of the administration of the licensing laws, to have public houses opened for a reasonably limited period on Sunday than to have people, as they are at the present time, using the back doors of these public houses to get the refreshments they require?</P>

Every Deputy in this House&mdash;no matter what view he may take of the proposals contained in this Bill&mdash;knows that that has been going on in his own area.

      <P>I am sorry to say I could not answer that trap question, but I do know it is going on for a long period of years, before the 1927 Act was brought in.  When buses were running from Dublin to Limerick and from Dublin to Cork, large numbers of individuals would get in at one particular town and were carried on the outward journey to the next town&mdash; three miles or more&mdash;the limit laid down in the Act of 1927.  If you came back by the return bus that night, you would see the same people coming back from the town to which they went in the morning for the purpose of getting drink.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon stated that it did not exist.  Now, apparently, he agrees with Deputy Kennedy and says that it exists amongst 5 per cent. or 10 per cent.  I am not speaking on behalf of any member of my Party, but when moving the amendment I stated that I would be prepared to do away with <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sunday if there was some approach by the Minister. If he would agree to any reasonable number of hours, less than the number suggested, for general opening on Sunday, I would be prepared, in response to such an offer, to do away with <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  I deplore the exchange of population that goes on continuously over a long period in midland counties.  I have no knowledge of conditions in the area represented by Deputy Dillon, but I speak with a fairly intimate knowledge of what is going on in my area, and I should like to end it.  If there is general opening for a limited period on Sunday, public houses that are not closed after that could be dealt with.  It would also be easier to administer the law and to get co-operation from people who believe that they are entitled to reasonable facilities for obtaining refreshments.  The matter was reasonably put by Deputy O'Higgins. He has perhaps greater experience than I have of the abuses that exist. Deputy O'Higgins knows as much as I do about what is going on in my constituency.  The Deputy said he would like shorter hours on Sunday than 2 to 6 p.m., and I will not quibble about that, so long as there is some limited period of opening that will do away with a considerable amount of the abuse that has been going on for years.  May I put another point to Deputy Dillon when he harps on this question?  How does he justify the contents of the Bill?</P>

I wonder if Deputy Davin believes that it would be in the general interests of the community that the whole population of the rural areas should sweep into the towns on Sundays to do their shopping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If people are entitled to buy groceries, then they are entitled to buy hardware, drapery, and everything that shopkeepers sell in every town and village.  That is the really serious objection to the opening of public houses in the country on Sundays. The Deputy must admit that. If these houses are thrown open for the sale of drink, it must be remembered that there is scarcely a public house outside Dublin and the county boroughs that does not sell other goods.  It is only in Dublin that licensed houses are confined to the sale of drink.  Not a dozen licensed houses will be found in the towns that do not sell drink, drapery and hardware.  It is a temptation and an incentive to people to go into these places to invite them to get their requirements on Sundays when the Guards cannot stop them.  No legislation can stop them if the public houses are opened on Sundays. <Col N="1833" /> People will be trooping into them and staying there all day.  The next demand will be to hold fairs on Sundays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with Sundays now.  I can boast that in the Diocese of Ferns no public houses are open on Church holidays, and no fairs are held on these days.  I do not know if that happens in other dioceses.  I expressed my opinion of this Bill on the Second Stage, and I think I was the only Deputy to suggest to the Minister that he should not give way on this question.  Deputy Davin thinks that I have a one-track mind, and that I am a crank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud of the fact that I am a crank, and that I may have a one-track mind on this question.  I think if Deputy Davin and others who advocate Sunday opening of public houses ponder over the position seriously they will come to the same decision.  I believe the country is getting on very well without Sunday opening. Every Deputy can visualise what an abuse Sunday opening would be. If the public houses are thrown open on Sundays in small villages that will encourage working people and agricultural workers to go into these houses and spend their week's wages there. There will be greater abuses than exist now, and the wives and families of these men will have much to say to the Government and to the Minister that allowed Sunday opening.  When there is no work being done there is a temptation to agricultural labourers after a hard week's work to go and spend their week's wages in public houses.  The number of people throughout the country demanding the Sunday opening of public houses would not be half of 1 per cent., while the number would be infinitesimal in any town or village.  I am speaking about rural areas, and I say that not three people in any village want to drink on Sundays. To throw open public houses and invite congregations to go into them after Mass would be bad for the country <Col N="1834" /> and bad for Government, and this House would not be justified in giving such facilities.</P>
      <P>The main burden of the arguments advanced by the Deputies opposite was that the public houses in the country should be open on Sunday because the Dublin public houses are open on Sunday.  What they were really advocating was that the Dublin public houses should be closed, but they were not prepared, in so many words, to say that.  They all suggested that there was a certain amount of jealousy between the countryman and the City of Dublin man.</P>

I would be prepared to stand on a platform with Deputy Davin in any village in this country and have that question put to the people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason given for that is to prevent the city people going out into the country to get drink.  The Minister has already stated that.  It is an attempt to prevent the abuses that have been occurring around the City of Dublin and other cities.  The proposal to extend the opening hours in cities on Sundays by two or three <Col N="1835" /> hours is an effort to shorten the period available to those who have been going out to villages around Dublin and other cities to get drink.</P>

Every Deputy who has spoken on the amendment mentioned the question of Sunday opening in the Cities of Dublin and Cork, and I think I am entitled to do the same.  I do not think there is anything wrong about it.  No case has been made for Sunday opening in the country.  Every licensed trader whom I have spoken to within the last fortnight is, without exception, opposed to it.  They all told me that Sunday is the only day they have for recreation both for themselves and their families.  They are tied up for six days of the week, and are glad to have Sunday free to go to the seaside or elsewhere.  They told me that if the public houses were allowed to open on Sunday it would mean that they would be tied up in them for seven days of the week.</P>

      <P>Even if the Minister were to agree to Deputy Davin's demand, I <Col N="1836" /> am sure that 97 per cent. of those licensed traders would not open on a Sunday.  As Deputy Dillon has said, you will always have 2 or 3 per cent. of them who will be looking for the stray 6d. or 1/-.  I am leaving aside altogether tourist resorts, because there you have a different problem. Taking the ordinary town or village, where you have three, four or half a dozen public houses, and in some cases many more, you will not find more than one or two of them serving drink illegally on a Sunday.  You will also always find the same half dozen people stealing in every Sunday to these same one or two public houses. The big majority of the decent licensed traders in those towns and villages are quite prepared to do a fair trade on ordinary week-days, and never open their houses on a Sunday. There is no demand from them for Sunday opening, or from the general mass of the general population in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>I do not expect that the debate on this amendment will conclude before 8 o'clock when Private Members' time will be taken, but at this stage I would like to make my attitude clear.  I am not prepared to accept this amendment, to have a general opening on Sundays through the country.  Deputy O'Higgins said the onus was on me to justify the present position.  I do not admit that at all.  As I said before, I was not the first person to introduce licensing legislation in this House.  Two licensing Acts have already been passed by the House.  On the whole, the law as it stands, has worked pretty well.  Parts of it are not working well.  I am not going to admit for a moment that that is the fault of the Guards.  I refer in particular to the provisions dealing with the so-called <i>bona fide</i> traffic. Deputy Dillon has referred to these as &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and humbug.  I felt that it was up to me to put an end to that traffic, in so far as it could be done, without causing undue inconvenience.  I tried to get it done away with altogether on week-days, but the House was against me.  I was impressed by the case made for those who had to travel in the early hours of the morning to fairs and <Col N="1837" /> markets.  I suppose there are very few who would get up before 6 o'clock in the morning just to get drink, and for no other purpose.</P>

      <P>It was not in Dublin alone, or in the areas outside of it, that you had rowdy scenes.  They were occurring all through the country.</P>
      <P>I am not going to be forced to give way on the question of Sunday opening in the country.  It may have been unwise on my part to give way on certain points. As a member of a Government in a democratic Parliament, I have given way to the views expressed in the House in regard to certain points. Even while that is so, I still feel that there are many members of the House who, if they wished to do so, could have spoken as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Allen have spoken.  I am sorry they did not do so.  On the matter of the 11 o'clock opening I got practically no support, certainly none in principle. I, therefore, gave way to some extent. I am afraid I went too far in doing so, but I promised to bring in an amendment to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no justification whatever for general Sunday opening.  As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, if all public houses were allowed to be open on Sundays you would get the same results as those which have followed from the legalising of betting. You would have at least ten people going into public houses on Sundays who do not do so now.  I do not believe that there is one in ten of the population who is prepared to break the law.  As Deputy Dillon and Deputy Allen have said, there is undoubtedly a certain number who will try to get drink on a Sunday, but the number is very small.  It is all very well to say that the Guards have not been enforcing the law.  I suppose the reason is the widespread area they have to supervise.  Their numbers are few and they cannot be everywhere. I am convinced, however, that if you were to have a general opening <Col N="1838" /> on Sundays it would result in a very big increase in drinking. That would be a very undesirable thing.  It is a thing that I am not prepared to take responsibility for. Even if the House was against me, I would resist it.  So far as Sunday opening is concerned, I am quite determined about it.  I will not give way on it.  I do not think I would be justified in doing so.  I believe there is a big volume of opinion against it that has not found expression in this debate, except by a few Deputies.  That volume of opinion would, I think, represent the views of the majority of the people on this question.  The suggestion about populations moving from one place to another is not right at all. I agree that, if a man goes off for a walk on Sunday or goes for a cycle run or to a football match, he is entitled to get a drink.  He can get it under the present system.  But if you were to have people sitting drinking in public houses, a very serious situation would arise and some future Minister would, in a short time, be forced to take notice of it.  You would have all sorts of abuses, apart from the point brought out so forcibly by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Allen and Deputy Kennedy as to the opening of shops for general trading.  The whole idea of the Sabbath would be put on one side if you had this Sunday opening. In the city there is no fear of that.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the historical origin of the differentiation between city and country was.  One idea is that it may have been due to the belief that supervision in the larger centres, where the population was more compact, would be easier than in the country and that any abuses which would occur could be readily dealt with.  It was not a question of the &ldquo;hill tribes&rdquo;.  With widely separated public houses and only a few policemen available, scenes might occur without any police being present to deal with them.  There must have been some strong reason for this differentiation and I am satisfied that it has not brought any hardship on the people.  I do not admit that a person cannot enjoy himself unless he is attached to a <Col N="1839" /> beer barrel.  I do not think that that is essential to enjoyment at all.  I agree that an occasional drink does no harm, but some people here give the impression that they believe that a man could not do a day's work without drinking.  Deputy Corry works very hard and he does not drink any beer.</P>

      <P>I am certain of that.  I do not admit that the law is being broken to the extent that some Deputies seem to think.  I am satisfied that the people who break the law now&mdash;both publicans and drinkers&mdash; would contrive to break the law even if you had fixed opening hours.  I tried to meet the House on this Bill and I am afraid that I slipped too far.  However, I am not giving way on this point.  I thought I would get more help, but Deputy Dillon, for the first time in my experience, has been a sort of lifebuoy to me.  He came very strongly to my aid and he was ably backed by Deputy Allen and Deputy Kennedy.  These three Deputies are, probably, speaking for a number of other Deputies who have not contributed to the debate.  I shall, certainly, listen to any arguments put forward, but, having heard the case pro and con, I am satisfied that the law as regards Sunday opening is all right and I do not propose to agree to any change in it.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any particulars&mdash;if he has not them now, I shall take them later&mdash;as to the extent to which persons were brought before the courts for drunkenness in cases where 20,000, 40,000 and 50,000 people assembled in Thurles, Portlaoighise, Tullamore, Wexford and <Col N="1840" /> Kilkenny, when there was a general opening for seven hours?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the number would be at all appreciable, because these people came from a distance and were returning that evening. That was the second reason I was anxious to extend the hours in the county boroughs.  As everybody knows, large crowds come to these centres for football matches.  As Deputy Corry pointed out, I did refer in this connection to people living in the cities. Lately, Association football matches are being played late, and it is only right that the people attending them should be allowed to have a drink.  Because public houses had to close at 5 o'clock, large numbers were on these special occasions trying to get in, and some publicans allowed them in by the back door and were prosecuted.  There is a case for meeting the requirements of large crowds in these big centres, but my main object in extending the city hour was to cut down the difference between the closing hour in the cities and the closing hour in the surrounding districts, and thus stop the exodus of undesirable elements who make the place simply unbearable for ordinary, decent citizens.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Allen in his forecast that, if there is a general Sunday opening for public houses in rural Ireland, Sunday will shortly be turned into a market day.  As Deputy Allen pointed out&mdash; I did not hear anybody else make the point&mdash;the large majority of these public houses are general shops which deal in hardware, drapery, boots or some other line of trade.  It might seem at first that their opening would stop at the opening of the licensed house. I do not think that it would.  If you open a general shop on Sunday, when the whole parish comes into Mass, other shopkeepers, in their own defence, must open and go into competition with them.  Otherwise, a substantial volume of trade would be taken from them without which they might not be able to keep open on other days of the week.  I think that Deputy Allen is perfectly right in that contention.  Deputy Davin's contention that, if you open for two hours on a Sunday, you will end all abuses of the licensing laws is grotesque.  The public houses are open 12 hours every day and is shebeening not still going on when the public houses are closed?</P>

We are now dealing with the specific subject of Sunday opening in rural Ireland. Deputy Kennedy raised a point about redundant licences which did not seem to be relevant to this portion of the <Col N="1842" /> debate.  I want to raise the question of securing that the rural publican be able to get an exemption order for a fair day or similar occasion without the elaborate procedure which he has to go through at present before a district justice.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in order to promote the development of agriculture and industry and to provide employment for our workers and remunerative prices for farm produce without adding to the burden on the taxpayer or the consumer, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should promote legislation taking power to issue for the benefit of the people <Col N="1845" /> money and credit on the security of the State.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for more than 12 months, and I had hoped that when legislation was introduced by the Government purporting to set up a central bank, the purposes for which this motion was put down would be served, and that we would have established in this country a central bank which would undertake to provide for the financing of national development on the security of the community or the State.  We find, however, that a central bank is being established by recent legislation which has practically no power whatever to discharge any of the functions which a central bank should undertake.  It is quite obvious that, having regard to the fact that the agricultural industry is in decay, the population of rural Ireland is rapidly declining, that the output of the agricultural industry has been declining for years, that emigration is increasing, and that we have to maintain permanently in the country over 100,000 people completely unemployed, some machinery should have been set up by the Government to deal with that situation.  The machinery provided by the recent legislation does not offer any hope of a solution for these problems, and, therefore, we are faced with the fact that it is still the obligation of the Government and of this House to promote the legislation which is required to solve these problems.</P>
    <P>If anyone doubts whether recent legislation in the shape of the Central Bank Bill was of any use to the country in this regard, he has only to consider the views recently expressed by Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan said during the debate on, I think, the Fifth Stage of the Central Bank Bill that there were three marks by which a good central bank could be known.  &ldquo;One,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that they have some control over credit, its expansion and contraction; the second is that in some way or another&mdash;and the more immediately they can do it the better&mdash;they can affect interest rates, and the third thing is that they can control the <Col N="1846" /> exchange rate as between currency in the country and its value outside against whatever it is to be exchanged for.  Judged by those three criteria this is not a central bank.  It is the Currency Commission re-created.&rdquo; That is the view of one of the most prominent members of the Opposition, a view with which I entirely agree. We have, therefore, the position that we are still maintaining in this country an antiquated system of finance, a system which has been tried and found wanting in every progressive country, a system which offers no hope of an improvement in our agricultural industry or of any national development whatever.</P>
    <P>It might be asked what we should seek to achieve.  We have to consider whether or not it is desirable that the State has power&mdash;either directly or through a central bank under its control&mdash;to influence the creation of money and to influence the supply of money available to the community. There are many who hold that neither the Government nor a central bank controlled by it should have that power&mdash;that that power should be vested exclusively in private firms. We have to consider how that affects the community.  The central authority in the State has the responsibility on its shoulders to see that every citizen has the means of livelihood.  If it has no power to regulate the supply of money available to the community, then I say it has no real power to rule. If a private monopoly can exercise control over the amount of money available, it is the real government.  If that private monopoly is affiliated to some concern outside the country, it follows that the real government is outside the country altogether.  Therefore, until this Government takes into its hands complete control over the issue of money to the community, it has no real control, it cannot prevent unemployment and cannot ensure that those engaged in production will obtain a steady remunerative reward for their work.</P>
    <P>The purpose of money has been defined: it is simply a medium of exchange by which one citizen may transfer goods to another.  Obviously, <Col N="1847" /> it would be impossible, in a civilised community, to carry on business by the barter system which prevailed in primitive times, when a man could exchange a cow for food, clothing or implements. Money is a reasonable and easy method by which goods can be transferred from one citizen to another. For many years a metallic system was found suitable&mdash;it was found that silver offered a reasonable medium and later gold was found to be a useful and workable medium.  A man could exchange any quantity of goods for gold and could utilise that gold afterwards to purchase anything he required. As the centuries passed, gold alone proved insufficient as a medium of exchange.  Thus we had the banks, first of all as places of safety where gold could be stored, and later as institutions which could supply a medium of exchange in addition to gold, in the form of paper currency and bank credits, such as cheques and other securities.  The question is whether the interests of the community are being safeguarded through having this supply of money controlled and regulated by this private monopoly which controls for profit.  If so, there is no need to change, there is no need for anything more than the imitation central bank which is being set up at present.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that no private institution, no matter how well conducted, can keep the interests of the community before it always.  Every Deputy will acknowledge that our banking institutions have been very well conducted.  They have set a very high standard of efficiency in the transaction of their business and in the management of the affairs of their clients.  However, the supply of money to the community must vary according to the needs of the community, and there must be a central authority which has before it one consideration, and one only&mdash;the needs of the community &mdash;and that central authority must have control over the issue of money.  If money is issued only by a private institution which is mainly interested in making profits for its shareholders, the interests of the community cannot be served.  It would be a remarkable coincidence <Col N="1848" /> if the interests of the entire community coincided with those of a small monopoly out to make profits. The fact of the matter is that they do not coincide, except, perhaps, when a nation is at war.</P>
    <P>We know that, when a great nation is engaged in war, the needs of the community require that money should be issued and made available freely to that nation, so as to conduct the war to its successful conclusion.  It is in the interests of the banks of such a nation that that war should be conducted to a successful conclusion; and in that case the interests of the community coincide with those of banking institutions.  For that reason money is made freely available in war time, and at present we know that one Government is receiving over £1,000,000,000 every three months to finance the war. In the last war, money was made available freely also, through the banking institutions.  However, it is not, and apparently never has been, in the interests of private banking institutions that money should be made available for works of development and reconstruction in peace time.  As we observed after the last war, when it had been brought to a successful conclusion, the provision of money to the community was restricted immediately, with the result that prices collapsed and the agricultural section of the community was plunged into hardship and loss.  That condition extended later to the entire masses of the people, particularly to the working classes, and in trade and industry a very low standard of poverty prevailed. That condition prevailed practically up to the eve of the present war.</P>
    <P>The necessity for providing armaments for another war and the carrying on of that war led to the free issue of money once more, with the result that prices again began to rise.  That is a condition which we have observed in two wars and in the short period of peace between those two wars.  We have found that money is freely available for the production of armaments, the production of weapons of destruction, the production of munitions&mdash; things which are completely destroyed <Col N="1849" /> in the course of a war and which add nothing to the happiness of a community. No money can be provided in time of peace for the construction of permanent assets which would make the people of this and every other country happier.  No money can be provided, except at a very high rate of interest, for housing, road-making or any of those things which we know will add to the welfare and happiness of the community.  Therefore it is not inopportune that a demand should be made now for legislation of the right kind which will enable the State to take into its own hands the functions that are being monopolised by private institutions, institutions which are to a very large extent bound up with similar institutions outside this country.</P>
    <P>We cannot attempt to solve the problem of providing a decent and permanent remuneration for agriculture, we cannot provide work for the unemployed, for drainage, for the improvement of our land, or for the afforestation of our mountains&mdash;we cannot do those things effectively under the present system.  So far as housing is concerned, the rates of interest make it impossible to build houses for our working people, particularly for the people in rural Ireland, except at a prohibitive cost, a cost which would involve a heavy burden on the taxpayers. Whenever suggestions are put forward with regard to works of national development, whether afforestation, drainage, the improvement of land or roads or adding to the amenities of our towns, the question is always asked, where is the money to come from?  The fact of the matter is that permanent assets created in this country are real wealth in themselves, even more so than would be gold if it were mined out of the earth in this country.  Being permanent assets, real wealth, they should be, therefore, ample security for any money in circulation.</P>
    <P>My view of the situation is that we cannot hope to have in this country a condition of permanent prosperity unless we can assure for our most important producers an adequate reward for their work; in other words, what we have to establish is what is <Col N="1850" /> advocated by all orthodox financiers, an honest pound.  We want to ensure that the pound to-day will buy the same amount to-morrow and the same amount a number of years hence.  We want to ensure that prices will remain more or less stable, and you cannot do that unless you have a central authority which will arrange the amount of money issued to the community in accordance with the prices prevailing within the country.  That is what should be the primary function of a central monetary authority.</P>
    <P>We all know the arguments used against any extension of those powers being vested in the State.  We are told that if more money were issued we would have inflation.  Now, inflation occurs only when a large number of people in the country have more money than they require for their needs.  If new money put into circulation were to find its way into the hands of those who have not enough to satisfy their needs, there would be no inflation&mdash; everybody will admit that.  If we were to add to the amount of money in circulation, and if that money were to be utilised for the purpose of providing employment for the unemployed, the result would be that those people would have a purchasing power which would enable them to purchase the necessities of life.  They would not be competing for luxuries and the result would be that prices would remain stable.  There would be no effect on prices, provided, of course, that the necessities of life which those people require are available; that is to say, provided the money was issued to purchase goods according to the increase in the production of goods.</P>
    <P>That is, I think, the answer to those who talk about inflation.  Inflation could occur under the present banking system.  It has occurred, and in some countries it has been deliberately occasioned.  It would not occur if the issue of money were restricted to a scientific relationship with prices prevailing. If, for example, the central bank, or whatever authority would have the issue of money, were to have before it an index of prevailing prices, when it would find prices rising to a dangerous degree it could then restrict <Col N="1851" /> the issue of money, and in that way maintain prices at a stable level.  That seems to be quite apparent to anyone who will give the matter a moment's consideration.  The danger of inflation will not exist provided there is fair and proper control over the issue of money.</P>
    <P>Considering the many economic problems we have to solve, the number of people we have permanently employed, even during this time of emergency, the desperate problem which we have to face when our very much enlarged army is demobilised, and when our workers in Great Britain are forced to return, and the enormous problems we shall have to face, it ought to be obvious to us that we should be preparing to meet these problems by a huge scheme of national development similar in extent and magnitude to what this nation would have to embark upon if it were actually engaged in war. If we were engaged in war, we probably would have to consider an expansion of credit in this country, in proportion to the size and the wealth of our country, on lines similar to the expansion which has taken place in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We know that as a result of war the entire British nation has been aroused into a condition of activity on a scale which could not be considered in time of peace.  There is not only the production of enormous quantities of armaments, but also production in agriculture on an enormously, expanded scale, all of which is due to an expansion of credit necessitated by the war condition.  If a nation fighting for its life, with all the preoccupations of war, can achieve these things&mdash;and I think a great deal has been achieved in industrial and agricultural production in Great Britain, while faced with the awful peril of war&mdash;a nation such as ours, which is, to a great extent, immune from immediate danger, should be able to achieve them to an even greater extent.</P>
    <P>We know that there is apparent prosperity in England.  Everybody can earn good money and there is none of the hopelessness and discontent we <Col N="1852" /> have in this country.  There is no suggestion in Great Britain of offering 5/- per week to men to remain idle for the winter so that they will be available for turf production in the summer. Everybody is working full time and producing at the very highest rate.  We here, immune from the war for the moment, but faced with an emergency as serious as war, an emergency which entails danger to the very existence of our country, should be able to tackle our problems on the same scale in proportion to the extent and resources of our country as Great Britain has tackled her problems, provided we had the control over our own finance which is exercised in Great Britain by the banking system working, as it works at the moment, in the British national interest.</P>
    <P>We can never hope to have the problems of peace, the problems of the construction of permanent assets which will add to our productive capacity of consumable goods, until we get the same control of finance as the British enjoy during this war.  I, therefore, think that I am not asking for any thing beyond the capacity of this Parliament, or beyond the capacity of the Irish nation, when I ask that legislation be introduced giving the State real control over money.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in these proposals. Many years ago, Abraham Lincoln, perhaps one of the most clear-thinking of democratic statesmen, at least in the last century, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Money is the creature of law and the creation of the original issue of money should be maintained as an exclusive monopoly of national government.  The monetary needs of increasing numbers of people advancing towards higher standards of living can and should be met by the Government.  The circulation of a medium of exchange issued and backed by the Government can be properly regulated and redundancy of issue avoided by withdrawing from circulation such amounts as may be necessary by taxation, redeposit and otherwise.  The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of the <Col N="1853" /> Government, but it is the Government's greatest creative opportunity. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity. Democracy will arise superior to money power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These words were spoken many years ago, but they are as true to-day as when they were spoken.  The experience of the last war and of the present war has clearly demonstrated that money can be created, and, when created, can increase enormously the productive capacity of the community and the prosperity of the community. Since that can be done in war, there is no reason why it cannot be done in peace, and no reason why this country should not do it.</P>

This production of money is a very good thing.  It is a great thing&mdash;wave your hand and create it.  I should like to hear Deputy Dillon on it and on what the Government would do with the money it created.  I can say frankly, on the eve of a general election, that I should like to be the Government which would create that money and give it out.

I am only a farmer and I may not understand these things like some of the geniuses of finance, such as Deputy Davin and company. I do not understand where this cash is to come from.  If it was possible to do it, I can understand what that power, in the hands of what Deputy Dillon used to call an unscrupulous Government, would mean.  I can understand that they would dish out £500 for an election fund in County Dublin to beat Deputy Belton, or £500 for an election fund in County Wicklow.  It would be a good idea.  There would be nothing to beat a Government with that power in their hands.  They could outbid anyone.  But it is not practicable. I should like to see it made practicable, this idea of dishing out money to everybody.  But I have not heard where the money is to come from.

      <P>It is a pity that a serious debate of this sort should be interrupted by the buffoonery&mdash;if that is not too strong a word&mdash;and by the comicalities we have just listened to.  I think the House would be well rid of the Deputy.  He is casting the shadow of coming events when he leaves the House, because he is going to be put out.  I understand that Deputy Cogan put down this motion nearly two years ago, and if it were intended to be a pre-election bid, as has been suggested, I think it showed the greatest foresight on the part of Deputy Cogan, and I think he should be congratulated on his foresight rather than the gentleman who has just withdrawn from the House.  I do not think, however, that this matter should be regarded as a bid for election purposes, because anybody talking about the question of the expansion or contraction of credit, in present circumstances, is likely to be regarded as one who should be put in a gallery of cranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the expansion of <Col N="1858" /> credit is a dangerous matter at the moment, and I certainly hope that Deputy Cogan, or anybody else, will not regard this as just a matter of making a bid.  I remember an advertisement which said that money meant industry, that more industry meant more money&mdash;that the more money there was the more industry there would be, and so on&mdash;and the advertisement ended up by asking why it should ever stop.  That was a great bid, and I presume we will get a similar bid on the lines of that old, tattered plan&mdash;the improvement of agriculture, the development of industries, the bringing back of our people from abroad, and employment for everybody.  It seems that we are approaching an election shortly, and I think I can say that Order No. 166 is now nearly burst.  There has been a big change since last June, evidently, and people are now being allowed to distribute money, no matter where it comes from.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan was right in calling attention to a piece of legislation that has been recently passed&mdash;the Central Bank Bill.  Certainly, instead of showing ourselves to be a progressive country, we have to put ourselves very much in the discard, so far as that piece of legislation is concerned.  I think it would have been better, from the national point of view, not to have budged from the position in which we were, than to bring in a piece of legislation such as that, which was reactionary and completely out of tune with the trend of modern thought on such matters.  Deputy Corry has tried to bedevil this motion by saying that all this money must come from somewhere and that, eventually, it must come out of the pockets of the taxpayers. He is evidently still thinking of the old hide-bound traditions of the bankers of Victorian days, who always advanced the proposition that all money comes out of the taxpayers' pockets.  All the money in the country exists only as a nominal matter. Nobody could count the amount of money that is required to run the country even for a week.  There is not that amount of cash in the country, even if you were to conscript every <Col N="1859" /> available asset, including gold ornaments, to be converted into cash.  The credit or money has to be manufactured somewhere, but it is not in the country, although Deputy Corry says that it comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers.  That, of course, is what the bankers have been saying for years. The banker lives on the thesis that when he makes an advance to a customer, he has to get a loan from somebody else, and he makes a rapid calculation to the effect that nobody will make a loan to him except at about 5 per cent., and therefore he charges his customer 6 per cent. or 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent years that it has become universally recognised that when a banker is advancing money to customers he is not advancing other people's money except in the relation of £1,000 to £10,000.  He has, of course, something in the way of cash in the background, but he certainly manufactures the additional £9,000 and makes use of it.  The thing that I never could understand, when discussing the Central Bank Bill, and that I still fail to understand, is why the bankers should present themselves as lending the money of other people and having to be careful about it, while, at the same time, they are lending only about £1,000 out of every £9,000 that they have got from the people.  In that connection, one must remember the interest they get on their investments and the interest they charge to those to whom they make advances.  Evidently, 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. is all right when they are bidding up for other people's services, and perhaps not a usurious sum, but then they could charge 6½ or 7 per cent. on the £1,000 that they advanced and get their own percentage on the £9,000.  That is the point to inquire into&mdash;a point to be inquired into very cautiously and with very much suspicion as against the banking institutions of this country, particularly if we say that in this country we now need a central bank, set up that institution, and then do not give it a single, solitary power with regard to that matter.  Deputy Corry seems to think that there is a terrific danger that a Government, with so much temptation to arrogate <Col N="1860" /> to itself the control of money, might use it wastefully.  It is an amazing abnegation of control to say here that we shall not press our Government to control the money wisely and that we should allow six self-constituted institutions to deal with the manufacture of credit and how they will use it.  I am not attempting to put this on the basis of national discredit.  We may go much further in this country, but we must recognise the fact that, so far as the expansion or contraction of credit is concerned, our joint stock banks or our central bank here are nothing as compared with the Bank of England, and I say that, so far as our present circumstances are concerned, the directors or governors of these banks might as well be the directors or governors of the Bank of England.  I do not think that that is a parody of the situation. The governing body of the Bank of England has been given much more control over the expansion or contraction of credit in this country than our own people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  It was even admitted here.  We are setting up a kind of small sub-station of the Bank of England, so to speak, but we cannot take that sub-station out of their control.  The only thing that was said in that regard, when we were discussing the Central Bank Bill, was that nothing you could do would prevent the inextricable relationships of trade and the amount of money that we had piled up abroad, and that all these things made it inexpedient, if not impossible, to take complete control ourselves.  That is the situation, as we were told, but, in any event, in our legislation we have stereotyped that kind of thing for some time to come. We have so far accepted the situation, even though it may be distasteful to us. In doing that, I say we are going against all modern progress.  Most countries have accepted it as axiomatic that the control of credit is a matter for the Central Government of the State.  That is almost axiomatical, I think; it is accepted as an axiom in every country.  The only thing there is <Col N="1861" /> any doubt, about is, how is that to be given practical effect to.  Is it to be done by an institution which is under the control of Government?  Is it by an institution which is under the control of Parliament?  Is it by an institution over which Parliament will say its say in so far as general policy is concerned, but will leave the details and practical working out to the experts appointed?  But no country has done what we have deliberately done&mdash; handed over the control of her finances to an outside body.  That we have done. In doing that we have not parted with any control over exchange rate.  In fact, it has been said in this House that it would be dangerous to allow the bank, even when the occasion arose, to have any power to interfere with the rate of exchange between this country and England.  We are told that it is easy to pass legislation here and when that danger comes we will meet it.  In any event, it was said in the House&mdash;and that Party voted all other Parties down on this point&mdash;that we could not interfere; we could not even go to the remote point of interference of enabling the bank, when the occasion demanded it, to state the rate at which the exchange would be effected.  We do not, as I said before, allow expansion or contraction of credit to be under our own control and we set up a bank with no effect upon interest rates.  That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we will get to any conclusion in debate in this House, even if pressed to a vote.  I think Deputy Cogan has done a useful service in putting this motion down because the one thing that has to be done is to get education of public opinion in this matter because, undoubtedly, if people were to advance along the lines of that resolution with public opinion moulded as it is at the moment, you would probably have a smash in the institutions which control credit in the country.  It is a very delicate matter and has to be approached with great caution.  I think Deputy Cogan has done a service in putting this motion down.  An eminent publicist in this country, who has written a book on this matter that most of us have read but nobody has <Col N="1862" /> attempted to hint at or refer to in this House, has done a very useful piece of work in breaking down old-time prejudices associated with this subject and trying to bring us to some point of appreciation of the modern view on this subject.  But, as I said, nobody has referred to it.  It is not a question of timidity.  It is just a question of not wanting to have your argument unbalanced in a House such as this by any reference to that particular gentleman. I think, undoubtedly, reference to him would mean you would be regarded as having joined the ranks of the credit cranks and therefore any argument has to be discarded.  A useful service has been done by him for which this country may in a very short period of years find occasion to thank him.</P>
    <P>While saying all that generally on behalf of this motion&mdash;I do not intend to argue this matter in detail&mdash;I want to put in one warning.  I do not think that this matter will be advanced to any extent at all by what I consider to be ill-advised references to the British situation.  I often read in newspapers complaints from people who&mdash; I think it is in a confused state of mind&mdash;say: &ldquo;If Britain can get all the money she requires, and much more than she has in actual cash, for the war she is waging at the moment, why cannot this country get some fraction of that for the other wars that we might wage on such things as poverty, unemployment, housing, and a variety of things?&rdquo;  Of course, there is no comparison.  I do not think the people who ask these things ever stop to think what they are asking.</P>
    <P>If you take the British situation at the moment, they have so closed down on their people that they just allow them to get enough consumers' goods to keep them alive and to keep them sufficiently distracted to enable them to do their work well.  I do not think anybody in this country would like that we would have our people reduced, under central government supervision, to that particular state.  It may be that it will have to be done hereafter, on the occasion of a great slump, but people should know what <Col N="1863" /> they are asking to be imposed upon them before they ask that that should be brought in.  I put that point particularly to those who speak for Labour in this country.</P>
    <P>I have often heard the English situation compared with the position here. In brief, it may be exemplified in this way&mdash;it is only a formula and misses many of the points that will be missed in any generalisation.  Taking a place like Bradford, where the workers were in enjoyment of a week of 44 hours, and nothing more, the position was like this: You went to these people and said to them: &ldquo;In order to get your assistance and the assistance of other towns like Bradford, we want you to work your 44-hour week and an additional 16 hours, and for these 16 hours we will pay you nothing&mdash;that will be your contribution to the war effort.&rdquo;  Multiply that all over England, and, in fact, raise the hours of working much above that, and you will get the situation prevailing in England.  Of course, they are paid, but they are not allowed to spend what they are paid, and there is doubt occurring in many people's minds as to whether they will ever be allowed to spend what they have made at the moment.  Eventually, when this war is over, the situation in England will be that a vast number of the English community will have worked and earned wages which they have not been allowed to spend but which have been put in some form of investment, and hereafter the English public will find themselves in the amazing position of having to tax themselves for the purpose of paying the vast majority of themselves as investment holders in the country.  It is a painful process to extract money from your left-hand pocket, as a taxpayer, in order to pass it over to your right-hand pocket and, when you get it into your right-hand pocket, as an investor, to be faced with administrative expenses&mdash;and in the end the whole thing cleared up&mdash;as happened before&mdash;by consolidation of loans and reduction of interest rates. In the end, the situation may emerge in which many people had been let work many hours' overtime for money <Col N="1864" /> they could not spend and may never be allowed to spend.</P>
    <P>Possibly, Labour, in this country, on a crusade for a laudable object, would agree that they would work many hours' overtime.  They certainly would be helped in that if the Minister for Finance in this State would see that those who make big moneys in other fields in, say, industry and other places, were not allowed to make big moneys during the progress of that crusade or the war.  The effort, in any event, in England is widespread and is equalised.  That is not the situation that obtains here.  There are so very many points of difference as between the situation we have here in peace and the situation that there is in England in time of war, where immense sacrifices are borne because it is a life and death matter with them, that I do not think comparison leads us very far. I would like to avoid the comparison because there is no need to go to that point of extravagance to get some distance along the road this resolution wants us to go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has talked here about this money coming out of the taxpayers' pocket.  Deputy Corry must be an amazing bed fellow for some of the people who find him alongside them. He now snugs in close beside the conservative bankers of the country&mdash;and the whole Fianna Fáil Party are in it with them.  We had one glaring example of a misuse of this power of extending credit.  It came out here during the course of the debates on the Central Bank Bill that the local authorities had been charged interest, and heavy interest, on the advance payments they had to make in connection with turf schemes.  I think the bill all over the country was something short of £1,000,000.  They were charged 9 per cent. on that.  Look at that for a situation.  The local authorities were asked to help in getting turf won and turf transported to different places. Men had to be put to work.  There was no remuneration&mdash;nothing earned, so to speak, by the local authorities&mdash;and they had not the money in their coffers to pay the workers that were put on to this job.  It was a gilt-edged piece of <Col N="1865" /> work if ever there was one because, at the far end, the Government had guaranteed that the turf would be sold at a price which would cover every penny of the expenditure.  All that was required was that somebody would give the first or the second or the third week's wages until some money began to come back.</P>
    <P>This was an amazing example, where credit should have been loosened up at once.  The banks operated in their usual way.  The banks really dealt with them as if they were going to X, Y and Z citizens who had money ready for investment and as if they said to those people: &ldquo;Do not put your money in that 7 per cent. investment that is staring you in the face.  Give it to us. We will have to pay you that money and charge these local authorities a bit more.&rdquo;  Everyone knows that they did not divert a penny from other investments for that purpose.  They manufactured money.  We allowed them to manufacture money&mdash;I do not know whether it was &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;, whether that is the correct word for what happened, or not&mdash;but the various members of the Government who were interested in the development of the turf scheme allowed the local authorities to be mulcted in that particular rate of interest for that very ordinary advance which was required for a gilt-edged scheme&mdash;I mean, gilt-edged in so far as the return was absolutely guaranteed.</P>

      <P>A six months' loan and the money guaranteed at the end. The banks were allowed to do that and that is ordinary banking practice, and that, I suppose, is what Deputy Corry, in his ignorance, believes is taking money out of the taxpayers' pocket. That was a gláring example of what the banks do and will continue to do and what we, apparently, are going to enable them to do under the central bank legislation we passed.  There was an illuminating reference to credit in the course of the debate on the Central Bank Bill which should have made people scrutinise the whole attitude of the banks in this matter.  We passed <Col N="1866" /> the Central Bank Act and we set out, amongst other things, to limit currency, the amount of cash in different guises, but we never bothered our heads to think about cheques.  There is no limitation put upon the amount of cheques under control of the banks. We left them that control.  They can decrease or expand that particular type of money which they allow into circulation.  We thought it right to let them have that power.  In enacting legislation, we gave power to control that vital matter of credit to institutions self-constituted and entirely away from any control by this House or by Government.  I stated previously that many countries found themselves in a dilemma as to how to tackle that problem, but not one failed to establish it as a principle that it is the State governs in that matter.  I do not think more than one argument is required to establish that principle.</P>
      <P>It is now generally recognised that banks lend out far more money than the money they have in their strongrooms or anywhere about their establishments in order to meet those who might demand it.  If a critical occasion arose on which more than one-tenth was demanded they would have to come crawling immediately to the Government to declare a moratorium. They know that it would not do for the Government to allow the credit of the country to collapse.  That only means that the banks know that the State is really behind them.  I never yet knew of a State being behind any group without there being some consideration. What consideration did we get?  The consideration is the acceptance of control and the extension of the control of credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central Government has a great deal to say to rates of interest and has something to say as to rates of exchange between a particular country and others.  We have deprived ourselves of the opportunity which offered, but I think the terms of this motion would lead to a revulsion of public feeling and the fear that we are setting ourselves on a wide course of inflation and that money would be produced by printing presses.  That is an argument we are bound to have again. <Col N="1867" /> It would be trotted out.  Public opinion is not yet educated to the point of seeing a motion such as this given effect.  I fear that there is a bigger need in this completely undeveloped country for some movement in the way of control of credit than there is in many other countries to which we look.  I should hope, if there is any movement made along the lines of the motion&mdash;I do not suppose it will be accepted&mdash;that it would be done cautiously, by way of educating the people so as to show that you can do this without running into inflation of any type, that it is a useful thing to do, and a thing that must be done if certain wheels are to be given momentum at all, the hope being that, once you get certain wheels moving, they will drag other industries in.  You may get some question in the nature of the fatuous, old advertisement of 1932:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why should it ever stop?&rdquo;  You can start a little bit of movement and hope that it will go on.</P>
    <P>Inflation is the great bogey in this matter.  If you get any extra amount of money in circulation than&mdash;inflation! Inflation is a thing of which people were very terrified up to 25 years ago. There is a far better appreciation now of what money is, and how the whole matter can be controlled.  Money is very definitely under control in England. It is not so much under control here, because there is not the same threat of inflation.  This whole business of inflation was a terrific bogey long ago.  It has been shown since that rapid expansion of money can be accomplished without inflation.  Inflation should be relegated to the realms of the bogey man.  So long as a country is merely getting things going, there is no danger of inflation.  There may be a time lag, but once you get people into employment and producing a certain amount of goods you get the balance once more&mdash;a certain amount of money against a certain flow of goods.  Inflation only occurs when you have a vast expansion of money and only a steady production of goods.  If people have more money than they should have, and are fighting for a limited quantity of goods, you get something of an inflationary effect.  In this House, except <Col N="1868" /> in so far as we have to argue against members of the public, we should leave behind us as a bogey this idea of inflation. Money can be controlled, and, I think, can be controlled in this country.  If we could get things going without scaring the timid public, and, particularly, the very timid investing public, we would be doing a good thing for this country.  Anything I have said on this subject I have said as an individual. I do not wish to commit anybody else by what I have said.  I am trying to help the educative effort of Deputy Cogan along what I think are good lines.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a few questions to the proposer and seconder of this motion.  I should like to know what are the potential sources in agriculture and industry that could be tapped.  I should also like to know if under present circumstances we have the implements at hand for the tapping of these resources.  Do the proposers of this motion admit the principle of repayment of the loans, and in how far do they admit the principle of payment of interest?  The motion speaks of remunerative prices for farm produce.  I should like to know how those responsible for the motion arrive at the costings, and how they decide what would be a remunerative price. These are questions which arise out of the motion, and it would be educative to me to be enlightened upon them.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Corry was not listening to the speech made by Deputy McGilligan.  It was interesting to have a Deputy with the master mind of Deputy McGilligan making the statement he made about money.  I should like to know if Deputy Corry has ever taken the trouble to read any books on the subject.  Has he read what Professor O'Rahilly has written about money? If not, I recommend him to give some time to reading up the subject and not go on talking of the printing press in this connection.  Deputy Corry knows, as a member of one of the boards in Cork, that £17,000 was borrowed to build 40 houses in his own constituency. That loan, given by the banks, is repayable in 35 years.  At the end of 35 <Col N="1869" /> years, the board of health of which Deputy Corry is a member will have paid back £35,925 to the banks for the £17,000 it borrowed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGilligan that this is really a question of educating the public.  It was rather annoying to hear Deputy Corry trifling with a serious matter in the way he did.  No later than last Friday, I went to the post office in Cork to send a 12/- money order to New York as my annual subscription to a paper published there.  I could not send out that 12/- to New York until I had filled two green forms. That shows what control we have over money and credit in this country.  I am a member of a public board which is trying to get money to do work of national importance in the port of Cork.  We approached the Government and were turned down.  We approached the banks.  They told us that they would give the money to us if we got State security, and they suggested how it could be done&mdash;by getting the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make an Order earmarking any credits we have as security for what they would give us.  It is about time that every member of the House realised what a fiction this money business is. Herr Hitler was told: &ldquo;You have no money to enter a war.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Very well, we can do without it&rdquo;&mdash; and he did without it.  President Roosevelt advised that the question of tokens and dollars should be forgotten and that they should have no more of this nonsense about finance.  The war is going on and weapons of destruction are being forged on the credit of the nations concerned.  I want to say to the Minister for Finance that it is a fearful injustice to the people that a small group should look upon the credit of this nation as theirs.  Some of these institutions which have an economic grip on this country are not paying income-tax here and they get over £22,000,000 in profits out of a paid-up capital of £9,000,000.  They have us in pawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy asked some questions about the repayment of loans.  I did not hear Deputy Cogan mention loans.  He said that the State should take control of money and credit.  We <Col N="1870" /> have not sufficient supplies for our people of milk, butter, or bacon.  Does Deputy Corry suggest that idle men should not be put to work to produce the goods we need?  I was glad to hear Deputy McGilligan dealing in the able way he did with this bogey of inflation. So long as goods are being produced by men who were previously idle, there can never be inflation. Deputy Cogan has performed a useful service if he did nothing else but educate people's minds on this subject. I hope that Deputy Corry will read Professor O'Rahilly's book and not be indulging in balderdash about the printing press.  I travelled up in the train with crowds of men who were going to Belfast and to England. What were they going there to do? To manufacture weapons of destruction and send back the money they earned to Cork and other places to buy the things needed by their families.  These men could have been set working here in the production of food and in preparing for the post-war period.  We could pay them the money they would earn better than the English people can at the moment.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must think on serious lines.  We had an opportunity of doing something effective on the Central Bank Bill, but we did not avail of it.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy Corry talk as he did, and to hear Deputy Kennedy putting the questions he did.  Why should we have to borrow from people who do not render any service to the community? In Cork, we have houses rented at 13/- and 6/10 of that represents interest. We know that the chairman of the Electricity Supply Board stated that if he had got the money borrowed for the development of electricity at 3¼ per cent. instead of 5 per cent., he would have saved £225,000 a year.  Will the Minister deny that the consumers of electricity are, for four months of the year, paying off the interest on these loans?  Why should we have to go to any group for credit to develop a scheme such as the electricity scheme?  Why should we have to go begging to the banks for credit to build houses or to develop agriculture or to produce food?  The sooner we think along these lines the sooner will <Col N="1871" /> this country be governed as it should be governed.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Hickey, I was interested in the remarks of Deputy McGilligan, and I was amazed at the remarks of both Deputy Corry and Deputy Kennedy.  I remember when Deputy Kennedy was very interested in currency matters and in the establishment of a State bank.  So was his Party.  It was the foremost plank in the Fianna Fáil platform in the general election of 1927.  On the resumption of this debate, I hope to produce a copy of the programme of Fianna Fáil for that election.  A State bank, with control of note issue, was the principal item of that programme. I am not keen on Government <Col N="1872" /> control of money.  Government control of money frequently helps out a needy Finance Minister.  It is the most insidious and dangerous form of taxation when unscrupulously used by a needy Finance Minister.  I remember well the day 15 years ago when I stood alone in this House in opposition to the final passing of the Currency Bill of 1927.  If ever a nation was put in pawn, this nation was put in pawn then.  That pawning process has been repeated in the recent nicknamed Central Bank Act.  The Act is not really a Central Bank Act because it does not establish a central bank.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
