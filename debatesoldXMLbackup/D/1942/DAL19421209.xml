      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the cost to the State of the general elections of (a) 1937, and (b) 1938, and (c) the estimated cost of a general election at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost to the State of the general elections in 1937 and 1938 was £57,750 and £42,450 respectively. A plebiscite was taken in 1937 concurrently with the election.  In 1938 the constituencies of West Donegal and South Kerry were not contested.</P>
      <P>The cost of a general election, if held at the present time, is estimated at £50,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Listowel rate stands at 30/2d. in the £; that the exceptional height of the rate is due to the necessity of repaying the interest on money borrowed at 5¾ per cent. for the purpose of financing the Lacca water scheme, and that this scheme has proved a failure; that <Col N="2" /> the heavy burden involved prevents the commissioners from undertaking much-needed improvements in the town; and whether in all the circumstances, including the present price of money, he is prepared to reduce the rate of interest from 5¾ per cent. to 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The money referred to in the question was advanced to the Listowel Urban District Council at the interest rate applicable generally at the time to loans for public health purposes made out of the Local Loans Fund; this rate was determined by reference to the rate of interest at which the Government itself borrowed the money.  I am precluded by law from making any variation in the terms of issue of a loan which would occasion loss to the fund, and it is not, therefore, open to me to reduce the interest rate as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not consider the question of giving, in some way&mdash;either the way suggested in the question or otherwise&mdash; some help to these ratepayers?  Is he not aware that this is the highest rate paid in any town in the country, and is he not further aware that this high rate is due to the necessity of repaying the interest on money borrowed for the purpose of financing the Lacca water scheme, which was imposed on the town by the Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that, in the meantime, there has been a Conversion Loan, and that the amount of interest paid by the Government for money is less now than it was formerly?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the statement referred to, but I understand that such a statement was issued.</P>
      <P>In March, 1941, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health authorised county councils to cut turf for use and sale, and to hand over their powers in these matters to their county surveyors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> The Kerry County Council did not exercise the option to transfer these functions but retained all authority and responsibility in relation to turf production and disposal to themselves, through a turf committee appointed by and responsible to them.  Under the aegis of this committee there were cut in the year 1941, on the basis of the returns made and at ten cubic yards of raw turf to the ton, 121,000 tons, of which by March, 1942, 2,400 tons had been disposed of by the committee to the Department of Defence and some 19 tons for the council's own use.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of helping the Kerry County Council to realise the remainder of this asset and to liquidate its overdraft the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on the 27th March, 1942, under Emergency Powers Order, brought the administration of the Kerry County Council turf production and disposal into line with that of other counties by transferring the responsibility for its further administration to the county surveyor. Since that date 50,000 tons have been sold and steps are being taken in the interests of the county council's finances to liquidate as rapidly and as profitably as possible the saleable remainder of the turf whether by export or local consumption.</P>
    <P>The rate of interest on turf overdrafts for all county councils up to 4th November, 1942, was 4 per cent. and has since been reduced to 3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary any idea as to whether there is likely to be a considerable quantity non-exportable and unsaleable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unsaleable.  I do not think&mdash;at least I hope&mdash;that there is not going to be anything like 62,000 tons unsaleable.  We are going to <Col N="8" /> stimulate the local consumption of turf.  There are certain light turfs, as the Deputy knows, which one does not like to transport a couple of hundred miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is probably unaware that that seems to conflict with information I got that steps were being taken in certain directions anyway. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might tell me why there is work being done, for instance, on the Fergus, and not on a scheme which is particularly recommended by the Drainage Commission as being urgent?  Is it due to the mere fact that the Taoiseach, by chance, happens to represent Clare, that there is work done in the one case and not in the other?</P>

Though the initial day of operation is immaterial, the choice of Saturday was influenced by the consideration that a large section of the community usually makes weekly purchases on that day and I can see no reason to deviate from the present practice.</P>

      <P>There is a possibility that some supplies of cotton may be made available for use in the manufacture and repair of fishing nets and lines, and, in the meantime, arrangements have been made for the manufacture in this country of a limited quantity of cotton twine for the carrying out of urgent repair work on nets.</P>

There is only one kind of yarn that is suitable for that, that is, what they call a three-ply patent manufactured either in England or in the North of Ireland.  We are quite aware that the British Ministry is refusing to grant a licence but we are equally aware, and so is the Minister, that practically the entire amount of flax produced in this country is going to the North of Ireland.  Is it not possible to negotiate on that basis for what is really essential and without which we will have no salmon fishing? Could the Minister not arrange for an exchange on that basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state, with reference to the present cereal year, (a) the average estimated cost of grist per barrel to the miller; (b) the average net production of flour from 1 cwt. of grist; (c) the average estimated cost of manufacturing 20 stones of flour; (d) the price fixed by the Minister for 20 stones of flour; (e) the subsidy paid to the miller on each sack of flour manufactured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The average cost of the grist to the miller depends on a number of factors which vary from time to time, for example, the percentage of Irish wheat used, and the cost of the imported wheat, which cannot be measured in advance, as well as the amount of subsidy payable.  For these reasons it is not possible to state the average cost of the grist over the present cereal year.  On the basis of the present user of, and the prices paid by the millers for, both wheats the average net cost of grist per barrel to them is 47/8.</P>
      <P>The average net production of flour from 1 cwt. of grist varies according to the flour extraction; 1 cwt. of the present quality flour is produced from 1 cwt. of grist.  The average cost of conversion is 7/1, to which must be added certain selling expenses averaging 4/- per sack.  I must stress that these are average costs over a period for the industry as a whole and do not necessarily represent actual costs in any mill.  Furthermore, these costs vary from time to time due to a number of factors, including, for instance, fluctuation in production.  The cost of the wheat to the millers added to these costs is, therefore, 58/9 per 20 stones.</P>
      <P>The present controlled price for 20 sts. of flour in the case of mills situated within a radius of five miles from the principal post office in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, is 60/- (f.o.r.).  In the case of any other mill it is 60/- (f.o.r.) plus an additional charge not exceeding 2/- according to the distance from the nearest main port.</P>
      <P>Subsidy is not paid direct to millers but an adjustment is made in the prices of imported wheat allocated to them so as to maintain the average grist cost at such a level as will enable flour to be sold at the controlled price. Grain Importers (Éire) Limited, who import the wheat, are recouped from the subsidy in respect of the losses incurred by them in selling the imported wheat below cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the percentage of imported wheat used for grist is evenly distributed <Col N="21" /> over the country?  Is every miller getting the same percentage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  That may not always have been so nor may it, in the future, always be so.  The percentage may change according to the nature of the flour produced in the mill.  There have been occasions upon which a higher percentage of imported wheat was given to mills producing bakers' flour as distinct from those producing only shop flour.  But there is an even distribution as between millers producing the same type of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in saying that in some districts there could be 10 per cent. more foreign wheat in the grist than in others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible for me to answer that question without notice.  Each miller gets the grist at the same price.</P>

      <P>The only information <Col N="23" /> which I have regarding the quantity of sugar used in manufacturing the commodities mentioned by the Deputy during 1939 is that relating to the manufacture of jam and allied products. During that year 5,951 tons of sugar were used in the manufacture of jam and allied products in factories.</P>
      <P>From returns furnished to my Department it has been estimated that 8,867 tons of sugar were used in the manufacture of sweets and other sugar confectionery and 4,912 tons of sugar in the manufacture of jam and allied products during 1940, excluding sugar used in the making of domestic jam for which figures are not available.</P>
      <P>I have no information regarding the quantity of sugar used in manufacturing sweets and jam during 1941.  On the 1st August, 1941, sugar rationing was introduced, and from that date to the end of 1941 permits involving 764 tons of sugar were issued to enable householders to purchase sugar for the making of home-made jam.</P>
      <P>Figures are not available to show the quantity of sugar used in the manufacture of sweets during 1942, but from the 1st January, 1942, up to and including the 30th November, 1942, 5,494 tons of sugar were used in the manufacture of jam and allied products.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the refusal to grant permission for the holding of a race meeting at the Punchestown course in 1943.  The Central Racing Advisory Committee, in conjunction with the appropriate racing authorities, is required by Government Order to prepare a programme of meetings at such courses as will involve minimum demands on transport facilities.  In accordance with this requirement, it has been decided not to sanction meetings at a number of centres including Punchestown. <Col N="26" /> With regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, the Government is concerned only with limiting the demands on transport in connection with racing.

      <P>I am aware that men employed on the rebuilding of Newrath Bridge, Rathnew, have been on strike. According to the records of my Department the strike took place on the 28th June, three days after a resolution was passed by the Wicklow County Council proposing that the workers engaged on the reconstruction of the bridge be paid 1/- per hour so as to give due recognition to these workers as skilled labourers.  The council's resolution of the 23rd June did not reach the Department until the 26th June, so that it is wrong for the Deputy to attribute the strike to the non-approval in my Department of the rate of wages sought by the strikers.  The reconstruction of bridges forms part of the work involved on the maintenance and construction of roads by county councils, and no approval could be given to any increase in wages to labourers employed in connection with the rebuilding of the bridge for the <Col N="38" /> reasons stated in the resolution of the county council of the 23rd June.

The Minister must be aware that it cannot be maintained that men working four feet in water, building up pillars, are engaged on road work.  That is what the Department contends is road work, but no reasonable person will agree with the Department in the contention that men working in four feet of water for eight hours each day are doing road work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the difficulty of obtaining turf in Youghal, and the large number of necessitous persons living in that town, he will consider extending the provisions of the Emergency Fuel Scheme to Youghal, as has already been done in the case of another turf area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to extend the fuel scheme to all urban areas.  The need for ensuring a supply of winter fuel is greatest in the cities <Col N="40" /> and urban areas in the non-turf areas, and it is in these areas that the distribution of fuel is being authorised.  In towns in the turf areas, the necessary provision for necessitous households can be met by voluntary effort, or where necessary by the public assistance authority.  For instance, in a letter received from the Youghal Urban District Council on the 23rd October, it was stated that the parish council have 120 tons of timber on hands for distribution to the poor, and that it appeared to the council that the provision which is being made for the poor is quite sufficient to tide them over the winter months.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The yield this season of the onion crop in the Castlegregory and Cloghane districts of County Kerry is estimated at about 1,300 tons.  The wholesale price of onions in the Dublin market has varied from 16/- to 38/- per cwt. since the beginning of November.  The price to growers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is controlled at a maximum of 25/- per cwt.  I cannot accept the suggestion that growers of <Col N="42" /> onions in the districts referred to, who are not allowed free export, should be indemnified against trading losses.</P>
      <P>The demand for onions grown in these districts has been reasonably good and more than half the crop has already been marketed.  I am aware, however, that a proportion of the remainder still in the hands of growers may deteriorate more rapidly than in other seasons.  In the circumstances I propose to grant export licences for limited quantities of such of these onions as are not of good keeping quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, if it is necessary to keep onions in this country for supplying the towns, say, in the months of February and March, does the Minister not think that that is a burden which should be borne by the people of this country as a whole, and not by the growers in a particular district&mdash;that, since the onion is a national need, as it is, any loss entailed on the growers should be borne by the people of this country generally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

Is it not true that one small group or <Col N="43" /> class are being asked to bear a burden that should be borne nationally, since they are supplying a national need? This is a poor district, as the Minister himself knows, and will he not consider indemnifying these people for any loss they may suffer in this connection by making it a matter to be borne nationally, since they supply a national need?  Is there any reason why one class of the community should be asked to bear the whole loss?</P>

Flatley, Lassiney, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, for a Service Certificate under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, was referred to the Referee who reported to me that on the evidence before him Mr. Flatley was not a person to whom the Act is applicable.  This decision was communicated to Mr. Flatley on the 19th ultimo.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the nature of the services rendered by Mr. Flatley but I understand that before reporting to me the Referee considered the evidence obtained from Mr. Flatley and from officers nominated by the committee of his former brigade.  The Referee did not consider that Mr. Flatley's military service as established by the evidence was such as to be deemed qualifying service under the Act.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> In page 7, Section 21 (1), to delete all from the word &ldquo;consequence&rdquo; in line 55 to the end of the subsection in line 60, and substitute the words &ldquo;its absolute discretion prohibits the issuing of such licence either on the ground of the unfitness or inconvenience of the new premises or on the ground that the existence of a licence in respect of the new premises would be unreasonably detrimental to the business then carried on in some licensed premises in the neighbourhood of the new premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage I promised to introduce an amendment on these lines.  Fears were expressed during the debate that, under the section as it stands, transfers might be granted which would interfere with the interests of other licence holders.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, before Section 31, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A person who is at the one time the holder of a beerhouse licence and the holder of a publican's licence shall, if the premises to which the said licences are respectively attached are situate in the same district or adjoining districts, be entitled, on application at any sitting of the justice of the District Court in whose district are situate the premises to which the beerhouse licence is attached, to have the publican's licence transferred to the premises to which the beerhouse licence is attached, but subject to the condition that, on such transfer being made, the beerhouse licence <Col N="65" /> shall not be renewed and the premises to which the publican's licence was attached before such transfer shall, for the purposes of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, be deemed never to have been licensed.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section, the expressions &ldquo;publican's licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;beerhouse licence&rdquo; have the meanings given to them respectively by Section 52 of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, for the purposes of Part II of that Act, and the word &ldquo;district&rdquo; means a district of the District Court prescribed under Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924).</P>
    <P>This is also an amendment that I promised to bring in on Committee Stage. It is to enable the holder of a beerhouse licence who has bought a full publican's licence to transfer that licence to the beerhouse.  It appears that the holder of a six-day beerhouse licence can at present do this, but the holder of a seven-day licence cannot. The effect of the amendment will be to put the holder of a seven-day beerhouse licence on the same footing as the holder of a six-day beerhouse licence.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before you put that motion, I may say I did promise towards the end of the debate on the last evening to bring in an amendment dealing with residents in hotels.  I thought it would be possible for me to bring in a satisfactory amendment but, on examination, I found I could not do it.  I wrote to the three Deputies who had spoken on the matter, explaining that I could not do it, and I gave them an opportunity to table an amendment.  I see they have not done so.  I feel I should make my position right with the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the original Bill and its passage through the House, as far as I and others associated with me were concerned with amendments, we have nothing to complain about.  On one or two minor details the Minister disagreed, and <Col N="67" /> even if he did disagree, he met us very well indeed.  The only matter of regret outstanding is that the Minister was so strong on the one small item, that is, the question of the Sunday opening. It is the one thing that we broke completely on.</P>
      <P>I am personally of the opinion that, as far as the rural areas are concerned, the extra half hour on five nights a week, and the extra hour on Saturday nights, will certainly make a great difference to the trade and to the ordinary people in the country.  I think that sooner or later some Minister for Justice in this House will have to face the Sunday position in the country as well as in the cities.  I regret very much that the Minister did not do it, because this Bill, in its original form, was quite a different Bill from the one that is now about to leave the House. The Minister may have felt that he was slipping away from the standard that he had set himself in the Bill as originally drafted.  I think that every slip he made was a definite improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the rural areas.  As I have said, I think that every slip he made was a definite improvement.  I have the feeling that if this job is ever going to be done properly, if you are ever going to put on the Statute Book a Licensing Act that will command the confidence of everybody&mdash;those administering the law, the people in the trade and the consumers&mdash;you will have to treat the entire country as a unit, and bring the hours in the rural areas into line with those for the city areas.  I think that the minor amendments that have been made in the Bill do represent an advance and will lead to better trade. The Minister was possibly unwise in not going a bit farther.  One of the things that convinces me of that is the position in regard to Sundays.  Even though that question was debated on a number of occasions in this House we had nothing like the violent opposition from the powers that be outside that one would have expected.  When <Col N="68" /> we first put down some amendments relating to an extension of hours on week nights and on Sundays, I was very much amazed that we were not deluged with protests from people outside against those proposals, but for some reason or another we were not.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit, in regard to some of the amendments that we put down, that I possibly expected the Minister would be firmer.  In view of the original form of the Bill, I did not expect that he would give way on the extra hours of opening.  I do not think there was the great objection to Sunday opening that people expected.  One of the things that frightened me about that situation&mdash;I want to be quite honest in giving my own viewpoint about it&mdash;was this, that I would have been much more strongly in favour of Sunday opening were it not for the fact which Deputy Allen mentioned, namely, the matter of mixed trading. If we had in this country the public house business completely separated from any other trade carried on in the premises, I feel that I could have made a much stronger case for Sunday opening. But the position that we have as regards mixed trading was certainly one good argument against Sunday opening.  As far as the minor amendments that I and other Deputies were concerned with, we are perfectly satisfied.  There is just this one exception which the Minister himself has mentioned.  I had expected that some of the other Deputies who live nearer to Dublin than I do would have done something about that matter.  As I have already explained, there would be no point in my trying to do anything on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the passing of this Bill.  I think that, in many ways, it is one of the most contemptible and humiliating pieces of legislation that has ever been put through this House, and that at a time when the country is facing the danger of economic collapse, when, as it were, we are standing on the brink of a world volcano.  At this moment, this <Col N="69" /> nation of ours is the only one that is immune from actual hostilities.  In view of that, I think it is disgraceful that for weeks this House should have been engaged debating a measure which concerns only a limited number of very wealthy and influential people with vested interests.  One may ask, who wants this measure as it is before us to-day?  The licensed trade as a body do not want it, the employees in that trade do not want it, the people who stand for temperance and for reform in the matter of drinking do not want it, and the most important section of all, our old friends the drinking public, they are not worrying about it, and have made no demand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the sections of the people that the Deputy has referred to must be very badly represented in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, nobody wants it except the particular firm or individual who is having his licence re-established.  In regard to an amendment which I put down, Deputy Linehan raised a constitutional question. This is a free country in which all the citizens are supposed to be equal.  If a plain citizen down the country, the owner of a wayside business house whose licence had been allowed to lapse, were to apply for permission to have his licence restored, does anybody think that a Bill would be drafted and put through the Dáil to benefit him?  I want to know why there should be one law for plain Dan Murphy down the country and another law for Denis Guiney in this city.  That does not seem to be in accordance with the Constitution of this country.  Again, there has never been any public demand for an extension of the hours of opening at night in this city.  An additional half-hour has been added.  Nobody in the city has demanded it.  A very good case was put up for an extension of the hours of opening in the rural areas in the summer time, but no suggestion was ever made that there should be this additional half-hour to the opening hours in the city.  There, again, a small section of the Dublin trade will <Col N="70" /> benefit from that, a section in the centre of the city which caters for people attending cinemas and theatres. The Bill, in that respect, will simply be catering for a small but wealthy and influential section, while adding to the inconvenience of the average city publican as well as putting additional work and inflicting hardship on the employees in licensed houses.</P>
      <P>As originally introduced, the Bill had one outstanding feature.  It set out to abolish completely the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  On the Second Reading, I said that I believed there was no sincerity behind that proposal, and that the Bill would either be hung up until after the general election or be drastically amended.  I was right.  The Bill has been drastically amended. The <i>bona fide</i> trade has been preserved to all intents and purposes insomuch as it preserves up to 12 o'clock midnight and from 6 a.m. the opening hours in the country. Why, I may ask, was this sweeping and drastic change put into the Bill? I can only suggest that it was done to attract the attention of the licensed trade and of other interested parties to the Fianna Fáil Party for election purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My forecast has been confirmed.  I said the Bill would be drastically amended, and it has been.  I knew perfectly well that whatever the Minister's intentions might have been &mdash;and I do not accuse the Minister of being insincere&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party, as a Party, had no intention of putting that section of the Bill into operation.  The Minister stated at various times that he was on a slippery slope and that he was forced to give way on a considerable number of points.  I think the Minister slipped on so many occasions in connection with this Bill that he would have been well advised to have shaken a little sawdust under his feet before he introduced it.  He would be now well advised, having made so many changes in the Bill as he originally introduced it, to withdraw it and draft something in the nature of a real reform.  It is undesirable that changes in the licensing laws <Col N="71" /> should be introduced at frequent intervals.</P>
    <P>Since there is need, as the Minister pointed out, for real reform, it is altogether undesirable to have legislation put through this House which does not touch the main evils which exist in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill.  If he does not feel he would be prepared to face the task of drafting a new measure, he should set up a tribunal to consider the licensing laws and the sale of liquor with all its implications and on the tribunal's report he could base more satisfactory legislation.  In addition to that, he could, in the proposed legislation, provide for a codification of the laws in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor so that every person will know where he stands.  Perhaps the legal profession might not welcome that change, but I think most people will agree that there is need for a codification of the laws.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that the licensing laws, as they stand, are quite all right, and there is no need for reform.  I do not think that view is shared by any considerable section in this House.  We, as the representatives of a Christian country, are compelled to face this question with a sense of responsibility.  Every responsible person realises that there are evils in connection with the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor, evils which ought to be remedied. The main evils which require remedy fall under three headings.  You have, first of all, the fact that there is far too much drinking.  Secondly, there is an alarming increase in the consumption of drink by young women. Thirdly, there is the fact that the licensing laws are not being enforced effectively and impartially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some very slight improvements and many disimprovements in this Bill.  The Minister justified the introduction of this Bill with the plea that there was a new trade growing up, a very undesirable trade, the consumption of intoxicating liquor by women.  He justified this Bill on that ground, but, as the Bill now stands, there is no provision which would bring about a check on that evil.  One check which was suggested was the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade after 10 p.m.  That has gone by the board inasmuch as licensed houses may remain open until 12 midnight.  I suggested that the Bill should have included some provision which would deal with the growing evil of the sale of drink to women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the fact that the Bill contains no provision for a check on that particular trade. As the law stands, there is an age limit below which drink may not be consumed by women on licensed premises. I understand that age limit is 18 years. Commonsense would indicate that that age limit ought to have been raised. Eighteen years is altogether too early an age, so far as women are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>The Deputy should not debate the amendment, and <Col N="73" /> he is obviously doing it&mdash;I trust not deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not deliberately. I think, as the Bill stands, it does not conform with the point the Minister made when introducing it, namely, that it would check the consumption of drink by women.  It makes no provision whatsoever in that connection. For that reason I think the Minister, having failed to justify the plea he put forward when introducing the Bill, has no alternative but to withdraw it.  He expressed himself as pained and grieved by reason of the undesirable traffic that was growing up within a certain radius of the city. What attempt has he made to check that traffic?  It is possible now for any person residing in the city to travel to an area within a certain radius and drink until 12 midnight.  In addition, there is a new evil introduced through the extension of the opening hours in the city.  People who formerly might travel outside the city to get the benefit of the extended hours can now get an additional half hour's drinking in the centre of the city, and this additional half hour will fit in with the closing of the cinemas, theatres and other places of amusement, thus creating an undesirable traffic which, I am sure, the Minister would not wish to see created.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister decided to grant these additional facilities in view of the emergency through which we are passing.  This is not the time for granting additional facilities to special luxury trades; this is not a time for granting special facilities to the airport and to people travelling by air.  Nobody wants them. The number of people affected is very few and the general public are not interested. Here we have this Bill which, while causing annoyance and difficulty to a large section of the licensing trade, confers a very great financial and trading benefit upon a comparatively few wealthy people in the centre of the city and on people travelling by the air line.  Is that not in itself sufficient condemnation of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that the Minister, when introducing the Bill, did not intend <Col N="74" /> that it should drift along the lines it has drifted.  I am certain he had some serious intention of reform in regard to the liquor laws, but the Bill, as introduced, was insufficiently considered and had very obvious faults.  In trying to eliminate these faults the Minister has succeeded in benefiting nobody, except, as I say, the few people in the centre of the city who will benefit by the extended hours of opening and the firm to which I have referred.  If the Minister cannot think up a better Bill than this, he ought to appoint a tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I am making for the withdrawal of this Bill is that it does not reform the present liquor laws.  It does not provide any check on excessive drinking.  Obviously we are all agreed that moderate drinking is quite in order and is no evil in itself, but excessive drinking is certainly an evil, on which this Bill provides no check.  An obvious check would be an increase in the penalty for drunkards, and, in addition to that, a tightening of the law is urgently needed, with more impartiality and efficiency in its enforcement.  The Minister has made no provision for the removal of the outstanding evils which he knows exist in connection with drinking.  He has made no provision for the better enforcement of the law as it exists, and since he has apparently handed over the carrying through of the Bill here to Deputies Cooney and Fogarty and has failed to direct the Bill along any coherent or reasonable lines, I think the only thing he should do, if he values his own self-respect, is to lose his temper now and tear up the Bill.</P>

The Minister has treated me fairly and I should like to treat him fairly.  So far as I recollect, on the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill, any amendments to which the Minister gave way came from the Opposition Benches, and the only amendments which the Minister definitely refused were those put forward by Deputy Cooney relating to hours in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has had a difficult task and he has certainly made one great improvement, that is, compelling certain public houses to close for some time during the night, thus doing away completely with that night trading.  He has to be congratulated on that.  I rise to enter my protest against, and to ask to be recorded as dissenting from, the increased opening period on Sunday in the City of Dublin.  I think it a retrograde step to alter the existing hours of opening on Sunday which were quite sufficient for any man to get what he wanted in decency.  The alteration of the hours to the periods from 2 to 3 o'clock and 4 to 7 o'clock affects the whole life of the working man who went home on Sunday evening, having left the licensed house at 5 o'clock, and enjoyed his cup of tea with his family.  It spoils completely the evening of the licensed trader who wants to close down his establishment at 5 o'clock and, in summer, go out to the seaside or the hills.  It destroys also the assistants' evening, and it is not fair to the assistants after their great struggle for many years for the hours which are now being altered.  I remember in my young days being a member of the committee which fought for the 2 to 5 o'clock opening when the opening hours were 2 to 7 o'clock.  We thought we had won a great victory when the closing hour was fixed at 5 o'clock. Now, we are putting the assistants in the same position as that in which they were in those early days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about that.  I am talking of the grocer's assistant, as he was then known, and the battle put up by the local committee, of which I was a member, to get the closing hour altered from 7 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  We are now breaking that down and compelling an assistant to stay in until 7 o'clock.  By the time be cleans up, it will be 7.30.  You are now spoiling his evening&mdash;whether he wants to go to church, to the theatre, or out to the Phoenix Park on a summer evening for hurling or football&mdash; by making him remain until 7 o'clock, with an extra 20 minutes or so for cleaning up, with the result that it will be too late for him to go to the seaside or the Phoenix Park, and almost too late for him to go to the cinema.</P>
      <P>That is the only thing I see wrong in the Bill.  There are many other wrong features in the Bill according to other Deputies, but I say that the interference with the assistants' hours on Sunday is a retrograde step, and, if it is not too late, I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of these hard-working young men behind the counter who want to have their evening out, to close the houses at 5 o'clock on Sunday &mdash;a right which was won for them 25 years ago.</P>

      <P>I had not intended saying anything on the Final Stage of this Bill, or, indeed, on any stage of the Bill, for many reasons, but I am afraid that I cannot agree with my friend Deputy Cogan.  I think it was considered in legal circles that the improvement of the licensing laws was long overdue, and the Minister for Justice took his courage in his hands when he set about improving those licensing laws.  He was, and I think is, a teetotaller, and that fact was a good qualification for him to take up this matter, and I do not think he showed his prejudices, from the teetotaller's angle.  I was a lifelong teetotaller until I was medically advised to have a little drop now and again.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the Minister recognised the existing abuses, and set about remedying them.  There was this matter of the extended hour or half hour to the city traders, which was a device of the Minister to help to cure an evil&mdash;to help to cure the evil of drinking by women in <i>bona fide</i> public houses&mdash;and he was adamant on the point that he wanted the period between city closing and <i>bona fide</i> closing to be short, so as to stop the rush from the city, when the last drink was got, to catch a <i>bona fide</i> house open.  There was a good deal of reason in what the Minister did in that connection, and when the Minister set out to cure an evil&mdash;and, theoretically, at any rate, this is making, if not for a cure, at least for a minimising of the evil&mdash;it is not fair to accuse the Minister of granting more facilities for drink.  It must be remembered that even if people do get drunk in public houses, the public houses are not there to set people drunk.  The law governing public houses says that it is an offence to give drink to a man who is drunk or on the borderline of drunkenness. I do not know whether all the offences in that connection are punished or not, but it is not the Minister's fault or the fault of the law if, when an offence is committed, punishment is not meted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a youngster&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Cogan knows this as well as I do&mdash;you started out at about 11 o'clock at night behind a batch of cattle to drive them along the roads so as to hit the fair or market at about seven o'clock in the morning.  Now, many middle-aged and elderly people are engaged in that business, and those of them who are fond of a drink feel, when they pass a public house on the way, that they are entitled to a little refreshment, and surely it is not encouraging the sale of drink to leave in the licensing laws the right to open the public houses for such people at six o'clock in the morning.  The Minister has amended the laws, so far as the <i>bona fide</i> question is concerned, by closing the public houses at 12, and <Col N="78" /> I think that, generally, the licences have not much objection to that because, very often, the owners of such houses found themselves in a position that was neither of their making nor their choosing&mdash;a position that they did not want to be in.  They did not want to turn people out and tell their customers that they were shutting up when the customers felt that, according to the law, these houses should be kept open.  The idea of closing at 12 o'clock will settle that matter, and I think that unless it is the case of a really genuine traveller that is quite time for these houses to be closed.</P>
    <P>In that connection perhaps I might be permitted to criticise something that is not in the Bill.  The Minister had trouble in connection with the handling of offences in <i>bona fide</i> houses, and there was a difficulty in the matter of reform.  I always thought that in connection with the infringement of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic laws the law was too harsh on one side and not harsh enough on the other.  When a man comes up and says that he wants to get a drink outside prohibited hours, he is asked by the publican to say where he comes from, and he says that he comes from such-and-such a place. The publican does not really know where he is from, but he lets him in and, if the question should come up in court, and it is proved that the man did come from that place, then the publican is acquitted, but if it is not clearly proved, or if there is a doubt, the Justice convicts the publican and fines him £3 or £4, whereas the really responsible man, the man who told the lie, gets off with, perhaps, a fine of half a dollar.  I think that the greater part of the responsibility should be placed on the customer and that the fines should be at least equal. The customer should be fined as much as the publican, because the customer knows whether he is a genuine traveller or not, but the publican does not know.  There is a doubt there, and I think that if the Minister had enshrined that in the Bill it would make the work of the Civic Guards much easier.  There is another omission in the Bill, it appears to me.  If a man in Dublin can have a drink on a <Col N="79" /> Sunday for four hours, why should not a man in the country also have a drink?</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that they are not in.  On the whole, I think the Bill is a sensible attempt to deal with the licensing trade.  There were many curious features about the law as it stood.  If a publican's premises were in a bad condition, and he had a site on which he could build proper premises beside it, with the best will in the world on the part of everybody concerned he could not construct good premises on a good site.  This Bill enables that to be done.  It enables public houses to be improved&mdash;a lot of them want improvement&mdash;and in that it shows a practical appreciation of what was required.  I am surprised that a Deputy from Carlow, where they grow malting barley, should be so stern about barley juice being sold.</P>

      <P>The Civic Guards are looking after that, and if they get the man who is responsible he will find that there is a place in which he must answer.  I think the Deputy should get it out of his mind that the Minister has forged a weapon here to encourage excessive drinking.  The position is quite the contrary.  On the whole, I think the Bill has given substantial satisfaction.  From inquiries I have made, and from my little personal interest in the matter, I will say that it is a fair and honest attempt to <Col N="80" /> improve the licensing position.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that honest attempt, and on having, I would say without hesitation, made the position better than he found it.</P>

      <P>That is about as much as I can say for the Bill; I think the position is somewhat better than I found it, but it is not as good as I would like to see it.  I think the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, so called, has been a farce for a number of years.  I gave way to a demand from all sides of the House, and I am puzzled to know what Deputy Cogan was talking about.  Surely to goodness the voice of the people, if expressed anywhere, is expressed here, and I found on all sides of the House that my proposal was not acceptable.  I hoped anyway, when I found that there must be some <i>bona fide</i> traffic, that they might have agreed to 11 o'clock.  I was disappointed that that was not accepted.  However, I am satisfied that the 12 o'clock closing makes the position very much better than it was before.  From now on, there cannot be any doubt that a man commits an offence by being on a licensed premises during prohibited hours.  In regard to the question of proving whether a man was a traveller or not, I may say that it simply could not be done.  If a man said he was out for business or pleasure, it was almost impossible for any Guard or any publican to prove that he was not.  That meant that when the public houses closed in one area, a man could simply go out and walk, or cycle, or motor the required three or five miles, as the case may be, and drink there for the round of the clock.  That cannot happen now, and to that extent I am satisfied that the Bill effects a huge improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Cogan what demand there was for the Bill.  There was no demand from the publicans, or, if there was, I did not bother about it. I did not bother about the publicans, and I did not bother about the assistants either.  As was pointed out at some stage of the debate, this is a catering trade.  We do not bother about busmen grumbling about being <Col N="81" /> out until 12 o'clock, because the public must be given reasonable facilities, and in a catering trade you must have those, if you like, unsuitable hours for the workers.  Those workers have a limited working week now anyway, and they need not work any longer. As far as that is concerned, there is nothing to grumble about.  I agree that it is not nice to have to work until 7 o'clock in the evening on a Sunday, and if I could have got agreement to reduce the hours for <i>bona fide</i> trading I would have fixed the closing hour for county boroughs on Sundays at 5 o'clock.  When that was not accepted I was determined to lower the gap between the closing in the city areas and in the country.  That is why I insisted on 7 o'clock.  With regard to the 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock arrangement, I tried to meet the county boroughs which wanted 1 o'clock.  In Dublin, I think, on the whole I interpreted the wish of the Dáil on this matter.  All I was determined on was to lower the gap as much as possible.  I have done that.</P>
    <P>I think I should say here that certain people who have been using the Press and sending resolutions to Deputies about what has been done, stating that extra facilities have been given for drinking, seem to have ignored the big fact that we can now most effectively deal with people drinking after midnight.  That cannot happen any more.  All those people were under the impression that we were giving extra facilities on St. Patrick's Day.  What was really done there was practically nothing at all. It was also stated in the <i>Irish Times</i> that I was abolishing the greatest and most desirable reform which has been introduced into the licensing code by the late Minister for Justice&mdash;the split hour.  There was no foundation whatever for that, but I found people who should have known better coming to me and protesting against it, or actually writing to me and saying that it was a shame to do any such thing. There is nothing whatever of that kind in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am saying this now in the hope that the papers may draw attention to the fact that that has not been done.  I also want to take this opportunity of <Col N="82" /> saying that, in my opinion&mdash;although I am not as well pleased with the Bill as I would have been if I had got the Bill I introduced&mdash;the Bill effects a definite improvement.  The biggest improvement of all is that there will now be no difficulty in proving that a person who is caught in a public house after 12 o'clock, between the hours of 12 and 6, has committed an offence. With regard to the suggestion that the effects of the Bill are confined to Dublin, I intervened several times to say that it was not Dublin alone with which I was dealing.  We all know what happens in country places.  We know that where there is a dance in a village or small town, say, on a Sunday, as soon as midnight comes the public houses open and remain open all night, so the people leave the dance hall and remain drinking for hours. That cannot happen in future.</P>
    <P>I will wind up by appealing to the district justices to take a very serious view of any breaches of the licensing law when this Bill is finally passed. Deputy Belton mentioned the matter of penalties, but, as the Deputy knows, that is not a question for the Minister; it is one for the district justices.  It is for them to say what fine they will impose.  They try the case, and it is not for me to tell them how they should handle it, but I do hope that they will deal very stringently indeed with anyone found on licensed premises during prohibited hours, and with publicans who allow people to drink on their premises during those hours. I do not think the Guards will have any excuse for not enforcing the law from this time onwards.  Up to this, they had genuine difficulty in proving their case.  Now there will not be any difficulty, so I think we may look forward to a proper enforcement of the licensing law, and I think the position will be much better than it was.</P>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy Linehan about Sunday opening, probably a Minister will come along, with more courage than I have, who will face up to it.  I cannot explain why the discrimination was there between town and country.  I found it there, but I did not think it was up to me to justify it.  I found it working well.  I only set out to deal with <Col N="83" /> abuses.  On the whole, I think the licensing laws were working well, except for the <i>bona fide</i> abuses.  Therefore, I am well satisfied, on the whole, that if the Bill goes through the Seanad as it is now, the position in the licensed trade will be much better than it is at present.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes a new section to abolish Section 33 and Section 29 (3) of the original Bill.  The section of the original Bill provided for the payment out of the Sweepstakes Fund in the hands of the existing governing body to the new board and then placed an obligation on the board to apply the moneys towards the cost of providing the new hospital.  These funds will now be transferred by Section 36 to the new board on the first appointed day.  It is only necessary now to place an obligation on the board to apply to the Minister for a grant towards the cost of providing the new hospital.</P>

      <P>in any case where the relatives of a patient dying therein are not known or, by reason of their absence or poverty or otherwise, are unable to provide for the burial of such deceased patient, defray all necessary and proper expenses incurred in the burial of such deceased patient.</P>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say what kind of burial it is proposed to give in these cases?  I would ask him to insert some words before the word &ldquo;burial&rdquo; to make it obligatory that a decent burial, and not one of the cheapest possible kind, will be given to an unknown patient.  We remember what used to happen in this city 25 or 30 years ago when unknown patients were buried in what was called &ldquo;the Pit.&rdquo;  I hope that, in cases where the relatives are not able to give the deceased a decent burial, something will be done to see that a deceased person is not interred in the cheapest possible kind of a deal coffin.  We do not want a repetition of what used to occur 25 years ago.</P>

As we all know, a buyer often purchases cattle at a fair&mdash;and this applies especially to the Dublin market&mdash;and the cattle are shipped the same evening.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before the section but in Part I of the Bill to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever a committee of assessors investigating a claim for compensation under Section 18 of the Principal Act or Section 13 (which relates to compensation in respect of lost or damaged live stock exported via Northern Ireland) of this Act disallows, on or after the appointed day, the claim in whole or in part, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the board shall serve on the claimant notice in writing of the determination of the said committee of assessors,</P>
      <P>(b)  if, but only if, the claimant, within seven days after such service, requests the board in writing to refer his claim to the standing referee and deposits with the board a sum (in this sub-section referred to as the appeal fee) equal to £10 or 5 per cent. of the appointed minimum value of each animal to which the claim relates, whichever is the greater, then&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the board shall refer the claim to the standing referee who shall rehear the claim and the determination (both as to the right to the compensation and the amount (if any) thereof) of the standing referee on such rehearing shall be final and conclusive, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  if on such rehearing the standing referee reverses the determination of the said committee of assessors the board shall refund to the claimant the appeal fee, but otherwise shall retain it and pay it into the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall from time to time as occasion requires appoint a person (who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister) to be the standing referee for the purposes <Col N="98" /> of rehearing claims under sub-section (1) of this section, and there shall be paid by the board to the standing referee out of the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Fund such fees and allowances for expenses as the Minister may direct.</P>
    <P>(3)  Sub-section (4) of Section 21 of the Principal Act shall not apply in respect of any determination of a committee of assessors under the said section made on or after the appointed day.</P>
    <P>This is to meet a point raised by Deputy Corry and others on the Second Stage, and raised also in amendments, as to an appeal from the decision of the board of assessors.  I consulted the cattle trade about it and they see no objection to there being an appeal.  I had thought that it would be preferable if the trade would appoint this appeal referee, but, on consulting the legal authorities, I found that there was considerable difficulty in that respect&mdash;there would have to be all sorts of definitions about the person to be appointed&mdash;and it is simply put in here that the Minister will appoint him.  I did not want the job of appointing this man, but I intend to operate this section by appointing him in consultation with the national executive.  I asked the national executive what they thought about it, and their present opinion is that he should not be a man in the trade&mdash;that he should be a person knowing something about the business but not a man himself in the export of cattle&mdash;and after consultation, I suppose we shall be able to get some suitable person.</P>

This is a compulsory insurance Bill&mdash;it compels a man to insure his cattle whether he wishes to do so or not.  In respect of any other insurance company, <Col N="99" /> there is a court of arbitration and there is afterwards the open court, if one is not satisfied.  Things have happened under the original system which proved that the power given to these people should not be given to any people.

      <P>Absolutely.  The point I am making is that as the Act stood when it left this House, that man had no appeal.  The decision as to whether he should get his full insurance, £5 insurance or no insurance at all, was left entirely in the hands of these people, and he had no redress whatever. I am glad the Minister has gone so far to meet the point, but, as I say, I do not know if he has gone far enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Deputy to give me the name of the shipper, because I think I am familiar with the case.  So far as I know, these cattle were cattle which went to some distant market in England with a number of other cattle.  They went to two or three markets and were turned back to the other end of England again, with the result that these two cattle were dead tired.  They were not injured and the railway company took them on, but they were salvaged because they were <Col N="100" />&ldquo;dead-beat&rdquo;.  If the Deputy would give me the name, I could say whether it is the same case, but every case that has been put up to them that I know of has been met fairly and the money paid, and in fact they have paid money for cattle for which insurance was never paid before.  If you ship cattle to England and they are insured, you get money if they are bruised.  I remember the days, ten or 12 years ago, when I sent cattle to York and other markets in England.  These cattle would be left lying for weeks and you never got a penny for them, unless they were dead; but now if they are bruised, this board pays the money.  As I say, I heard of the case Deputy Corry mentions, and, from what I know of it, the insurance board was perfectly right in not paying. These cattle were the refuse of a number of cattle which went from market to market, and, if they were injured, why would the railway company take them on?</P>

      <P>There was the power of suing in open court.  I am not concerned with what Deputy Fagan heard, and I am not concerned with the case put up by these people.  What I am concerned with is the reply the man got when he applied for the insurance on his cattle.  It was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" />&ldquo;In respect to your claim for compensation in respect of four cows (part lot of 78) shipped from Cork to Frome <i>via</i> Fishguard on 27th February, 1942, I am to inform you that the Committee of Assessors who investigated the claim have, by virtue of the powers conferred on them by the above Act, determined that you are not entitled to compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have 65 of these here.  That man paid on these 78 cattle £39 insurance, on a valuation of £50 apiece.  Four of the cattle were injured in transit.  These cattle were inspected by the insurance company's veterinary surgeon, and were then taken over by the insurance company's agent and sold by him.  For the four cattle, this man received in salvage £24 12s. instead of the sum of somewhere around £200, for which he had insured his cattle.  Instead of getting £100 insurance for the two cattle he had insured previously, he got a cheque for 25/-, and so on through the whole of these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; he got a cheque, in respect of salvage, of 25/- for two cows and £24 for four cows.  The man could salvage his cows without paying any insurance at all.  I am glad the Minister has gone this distance to meet the point, and I prefer to wait until we come to the other amendment to deal with the rest.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,500 be granted to <Col N="102" /> defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate for the current year amounted to £19,000 made up as follows:&mdash;Sub-head A: Honoraria to members of the Bureau (£1,500) and incidental expenses (£250), making a total of £1,750; sub-head B: Grant in Aid of Investigation and Research, £17,250; making a total of £19,000. The sum of £5,500 now required for investigation and research brings the total under that sub-head up to £22,750 and the total net Estimate up to £24,500.</P>
    <P>In moving this Estimate I outlined the method of work of the bureau and the principal investigations in which it was engaged.  Deputies can refer to Vol. 88, No. 2, of the <i>6 o'clock.</i> Official Debates for 14th to 17th July, 1942, if they wish to look up that part of the report, as I do not propose to repeat it now.  I included in my statement a short account of the results which had been obtained, and I indicated the extent to which the bureau had proved to be of assistance to the Government Departments and to industrial firms.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in the current year has been incurred mainly on the following: investigations on fuel problems, the production of supplies for refrigeration and water purification, the manufacture of disinfectants, organic, etc., acids, fish oils, sulphur and phosphorus, also investigations relating to geophysical survey, broadcasting, and marine algae, the production of medical supplies, carbon black, carbon electrodes, batteries, fertilisers, and so on, problems arising from shortages of iron and steel and a number of minor investigations; there was also, of course, expenditure on the office work of the bureau.  The expenditure required for investigations and researches during the full year is now estimated at £24,622, an increase of £7,372 in the amount originally provided. This increase arises from estimated increases amounting to <Col N="103" /> £10,393 on a number of investigations, offset by decreases amounting to £3,021 in the expenditure originally estimated for a number of other investigations. The gross increase is also offset by a sum of £994, being the unexpended balance of the Grant-in-Aid carried forward from 1941-42, and by income in respect of services or investigations carried out on a repayment basis, which will yield certain receipts estimated at about £900.  This results in a net increase of about £5,500.</P>
    <P>The gross increase of £10,393 arises from increased expenditure amounting to £6,345 on various aspects of the fuel problem, £247 on investigations into the production of organic acids, £60 on. the production of fish oils and sulphur, £3,235 on miscellaneous investigations and new work, and £506 on office work. The figure of £6,345 on fuel problems arises from an increase amounting to £6,480 in the investigation into the production of turf charcoal, less reductions totalling £135 in the amounts required for investigations on other aspects of the fuel problem.  The items included in the sum of £3,235 required for miscellaneous investigations and new work are medical supplies, iron and steel, carbon black, carbon electrodes, batteries, fertilisers, marine algae, as well as a number of other investigations.</P>
    <P>Most of the expenditure incurred by the bureau arises from investigations on various aspects of the fuel problem. In the seven months ended 31st October last, about £6,000 has been required for investigations on fuel.  Of this latter amount, over £5,000 has been spent on investigations on the production of turf charcoal.  This investigation is designed to obtain information on the operation of both small units and large plants.</P>
    <P>The expenditure required by the bureau during the current financial year to investigate the production of turf charcoal in large plants is estimated at £10,880.  At the time the Estimate was prepared it was expected that expenditure amounting to about £4,400 would suffice for the year.  Additional <Col N="104" /> expenditure of £2,000 to meet the cost of a power-house, condensing plant and temporary control laboratory, and of £4,480 in respect of operational expenses is, however, now expected.</P>
    <P>When the bureau's plans for the investigation on turf charcoal in large plants were drawn up in July, 1941, it was expected that the power required to operate the plant could be supplied from the existing power station at Turraun.  The load, however, required by the new plant is greater than was originally expected, and could not be provided without interference with the production of turf.  A new power-station is consequently necessary for the bureau's plant.  The condensing plant and temporary control laboratory are required to provide for the recovery of the gaseous by-products of carbonisation.  It was not considered necessary when the plant was originally designed to include plant for this purpose. Subsequently, however, increased interest was aroused in the possibilities of tar, wax, and other by-products obtained from peat carbonisation, so that it became desirable to study methods for the recovery and utilisation of these by-products.</P>
    <P>The experimental plant at Turraun comprises two full-size retorts, one of steel and the other of firebrick.  The erection of these retorts has been completed, and considerable progress has been made in the construction of the power house, condensing plant and control laboratory.  Heating of the producers and retorts has been in progress for some weeks, and it is expected that production of charcoal will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>In carrying out this investigation the bureau has not lost sight of the fact that it may not be possible to set up large plants under existing conditions to produce charcoal on the scale required.  In the course of its work the bureau takes every opportunity presented to it to study methods proposed for the production of turf charcoal, and the lines of investigation which are now being followed by experimental work are those which appear most likely to meet the national need.  The investigation on production <Col N="105" /> in small units has included experimental work both in steel kilns and in pits dug in the ground.  Promising results have been obtained, and it is hoped to conduct further experiments on a number of bogs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The most important of the other matters included in the fuel investigations are a study of the most suitable types of gas producer for use with available fuels, and the investigation of emergency difficulties in the manufacture of town gas.  The work on producers has included work both in the laboratory and on the road into improvements of the filtration system, as well as a study of the most suitable fuels for use in tuyere and grate types of producer. Work on this problem has enabled the bureau to collaborate in a number of investigations being conducted by various commercial concerns.  The bureau's recent work on town gas has been principally devoted to assisting in an examination of the problems relating to the use of turf.  It is hoped to commence shortly to investigate the production of water gas from peat. Arrangements are also being made to commence an investigation on the catalytic enrichment of turf gas.  This might also be important in connection with the possible development, after the emergency, of the production on the bog of gas from turf on the large scale.</P>
    <P>The bureau's investigations into the production of various organic acids have now been discontinued, as it is expected that an industrial firm will set up plants for the production of citric acid and lactic acid.  However, the preliminary work carried out during the year has resulted in greater expenditure than was expected.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time the bureau has devoted attention to the provision of essential medical supplies.  Experimental work has been carried out in collaboration with industrial firms which has resulted in the development of methods for the production of glycerine from concentrated soap lyes. The product so far obtained is suitable for use in the preparation of many medicaments, since it is of pharmaceutical quality in all respects except colour.  An examination has been <Col N="106" /> made into the building up of a reserve stock of solid, insulin, and methods of dissolving this substance have been studied.  Experimental work has been carried out in connection with the standardisation of Irish grown digitalis.</P>
    <P>Investigations under the head of iron and steel include an examination of the possibilities of relieving shortages of special alloy steels by the remanufacture of scrap, experiments on the production of iron by electro-deposition, investigations on the use of substitute fuels for melting iron, and the production of ferro-silicon for foundries.  Following satisfactory laboratory experiments, the production of electrolytic iron on the large scale is now being studied with specially adapted plant and equipment.  It is hoped that production on this plant will commence in the near future. Satisfactory results have been obtained from experiments on the melting of iron with hard turf charcoal made by high temperature carbonisation in gas works retorts.</P>
    <P>In connection with the work on the production of carbon black, an experimental plant has been erected and trial runs made.  Further experiments will be necessary before any conclusion can be reached as to the probable outcome of this investigation.</P>
    <P>During the year an investigation was commenced into the possibilities of producing carbon electrodes suitable for use in electric furnaces.  Preliminary experiments carried out in gas works were sufficiently encouraging to justify further work in collaboration with an industrial firm.  A special furnace has been erected, and electrodes suitable for use in the manufacture of calcium carbide have been produced on a technical scale.</P>
    <P>An investigation is in progress with a view to arrangements being made for the repair and manufacture of lead batteries in the country.  A study has been made of the treatment of wood for the production of the separators, and experimental work has been carried out in a specially constructed furnace on the preparation of the lead oxides required.  Preliminary work is <Col N="107" /> also being conducted into the possibility of recovering zinc from used dry cells.</P>
    <P>It was decided during the year that the bureau should investigate the production of improved fertilisers from indigenous deposits, and experimental work is now in progress.</P>
    <P>The investigation on marine algae is mainly confined to collecting information on the occurrence on the western coast of <i>Gelidium</i> and related seaweeds with a view to providing material for use in the preparation of agar-agar.  This work is a continuation of certain aspects of research on seaweed which has been in progress under the auspices of the Industrial Research Council.  Useful results are being obtained, and one manufacturer has commenced the production of agar by means of a process developed as a result of work carried out under the auspices of the Industrial Research Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us had the privilege of hearing Professor Dowling, who is chairman of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, give an account of the work of the bureau in University College on Monday last. Anybody who heard him would have to feel grateful for and appreciative of the amount of energy and ability that has been devoted to the work of the research bureau.  The Taoiseach has now given us a further list, elaborating the number of matters to which the bureau is paying attention.  Very useful and very important work is being done, and, if I speak in a critical way of the bureau now, it is not because I lack appreciation of the work that is being done.  But I want to emphasise this, that while nobody will grudge the giving of public money to carrying out work and investigations now, keeping our young scientists working now and linking up our scientists with our industrial concerns on work that may be useful after the emergency, such as the production of gas from turf, the real thing that, I take it, we all want the emergency bureau to do now is to help us in the big and urgent problems that are the problems of the emergency. When we consider, from the accounts <Col N="108" /> that we have got, the work done by the bureau that bears, say, on the transport problem&mdash;which, to my mind, is the really big and urgent problem of the emergency&mdash;we have to come to the conclusion, as far as the work that has been done by the bureau to get us over our transport difficulties is concerned, that none of the work is being done in the spirit of the emergency. That, probably, is not the fault of the bureau, but I think we ought to direct our minds to that aspect of our problem&mdash;that is, our transport problem&mdash; and to what the bureau can do in that regard.</P>
      <P>From what we hear from the Minister for Supplies from time to time, and from what we know of matters that are troubling the minds of commercial and business people in the city, our transport position is a very precarious one.  We might at any time, owing to the loss of a tanker or two, find ourselves in the position that transport, may I put it, of persons would be stopped in the City of Dublin, and that all the transport that could be made available would be used up in trying to keep the City of Dublin supplied with food and fuel. From the people connected with the transport business in the city, I understand that it would take at least 3,000 commercial vehicles to keep Dublin supplied with food and fuel in such an emergency as is thought to be a possibility.  If we were left without petrol to do that, I understand it would take 60,000 tons of fuel for gas-producer plant to keep going the fleet of lorries that would be necessary to maintain the life of the citizens here. We are up against the very urgent question: can we have and how can we get the 60,000 tons of fuel that would be required for producer plant for a fleet of 3,000 commercial vehicles?  The answer to that question is that, as we stand at present and from any work that is being done at present, we have not any chance of maintaining such a fleet of commercial vehicles as would keep Dublin in food and fuel.  But there are ideas and there is machinery available that would, if mobilised and directed in an urgent way to the problem, produce the fuel that would give us that plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> With regard to transport, the position seems to be that everything is being monopolised.  The Department of Supplies or the Government generally look to two bodies&mdash;the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin Transport Company.  These are the bodies that are being looked to and that are being depended upon to solve the transport situation in such an emergency as I speak about.  All the brains, ability, equipment and experience elsewhere is being brushed aside, utterly unused.  The emergency mind is being directed to providing a transport monopoly consisting of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin Transport Company.</P>
    <P>Let us first turn to the question of how we are to get the fuel.  I understand that 60,000 tons of fuel would be required for the producer gas plant that would keep 3,000 commercial vehicles running.  As far as I can ascertain, the fuel that would be available from anthracite and from wood charcoal would be only 10,000 tons. Then there is the question of turf charcoal. It might be that we would get a small amount of turf charcoal, but, from the descriptions given of the progress of the work, in University College the other night, I do not think that turf charcoal is going to add materially to the 10,000 tons we might expect from anthracite or wood charcoal. Then there is the question of acetylene.  The amount of calcium carbide that is being produced in the country is only about 500 tons.  Then there is the question of alcohol. Alcohol might run 50 lorries.  But, taking all we might expect from turf charcoal, acetylene and alcohol, there is very little addition to the 10,000 tons from anthracite and wood charcoal.</P>
    <P>The question is, where can we hope to get the rest?  The answer is given by the experience of other people, people outside the two big monopolies that we have here.  It is given by those engineering and motor firms that are plentiful enough in the City of Dublin and that are scattered pretty generally throughout the country, who, at the present moment, have men of intelligence, imagination and experience doing nothing.  Their solution is raw <Col N="110" /> wood, that producer plants made to use raw wood could equip the lorries that would be necessary to deal with the City of Dublin and, as a matter of fact, that these could be put into production now in order to solve the transport difficulty throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I understand that in Germany, at the present time, no private car of any kind can run on anything but a producer plant, using raw wood as fuel. What is necessary in order to get lorries fitted with producer plant for which the fuel is raw wood?  First, there are special materials required, and, secondly, engineering skill.  The special materials are in the country at the present time, I am given to understand. It may be scattered; it may not be very accessible, but it is there in such a way that, if the problem were faced up to in the spirit that is necessary, an emergency Order would provide, I understand, all the necessary special metal that is necessary to build such producer plants.</P>
    <P>As far as engineering skill is concerned, we have motor firms and engineering firms in the City of Dublin and throughout the country where there are brains and equipment.  You have such places as the Leinster Engineering Company, S. and T. Robinson, F.M. Summerfield, Lincoln and Nolan, the Austin Company, the firm of Watt, Thompsons of Carlow, Fords of Cork.  I mention these, not invidiously in any way, but to show that firms of that particular type and standing exist.  Some of them at the present moment are so idle that, I suppose, they are hardly able to keep their shutters painted.  These firms are capable of building the plant with metal that is available.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of raw wood in the country.  Raw wood can be used as fuel for producer plants of this particular kind without being either burned or dried and, with the transport situation what it is, I suggest that it is the first problem the bureau should address itself to.  I do not know why this tendency towards monopoly in transport is being pushed ahead so much.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into it, Sir.  I do want to say that there is ingenuity, imagination, business experience, energy, trained personnel, engineering equipment, idealism&mdash;all there&mdash;widely dispersed throughout the country and kept idle, while we consider the work of a research bureau dealing with emergency problems, a bureau which is energetic and active but which has its mind, apparently, spread over a large number of big and small problems none of which is in any way as urgent or as vital in the people's interests as is the transport problem.</P>
      <P>I did feel, in University College the other night, that I was listening to a very fine description of a rather good and useful extension of the laboratory side of the university.  I do not say that in any kind of disparaging way. Most useful work has been done in matters such as glycerine and other things, but the general atmosphere that was created by the description of the amount of work that was being done and the amount of progress that was being made caused me to feel that this was an excellent development in a kind of post-graduate way, extending the technical and scientific knowledge of people who had a university training, or bringing them up against the rough, big world and introducing them in a very sound way to the problems that had to be tackled.  That was the impression I got.  When I considered the question of transport, there was nothing that would detract in any way from that impression.  If we are to get through this emergency, we will get through it only by the energy, ability, ingenuity and work of people in every part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this to the Taoiseach: how are we going to deal with the transport question in the light of the dangers that the Minister for Supplies and other Ministers suggest may come to us at any time if we do not get the firms that are there to make producer plants that will use raw material?  The idea in connection with this bureau is <Col N="112" /> that it is independent of the Civil Service, that it gets money as a kind of Grant-in-Aid; but I feel that in some way or another it is in the grip of the Civil Service, and is being very inefficiently directed by any direction that it gets from the Civil Service.  I understand the position with regard to the board is that it has no mandate to think, that it has no power to direct its thoughts to any problem not put up to it through the Taoiseach.  I take it that the problems that are put up to it through him are problems that come from the Department of Supplies, or from some other Department responsible for dealing with the emergency. I would appeal to the Taoiseach to open other doors than the doors of the Civil Service for suggestions as to what should be put to the board either as subject matter for its thought, for its agenda or for work on its part.  People connected with the transport side of things who are being pushed aside either by the circumstances of the emergency or the policy of the Department of Supplies, with its monopolistic tendencies, are now idle with little to do but think of the vital things that affect the people as result of the transport situation.  Surely, with their ability, they are the kind of people who could make suggestions.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to tell us what exactly is the approach to this transport problem.  If he is not in a position to do so, then I suggest he should get in touch with those who are connected with transport and with motor engineering in the city, and see what ideas are in their minds for a solution of the situation.  It seems to me that the tendency to hand this work over to the railway company and to take it away from the people who are most alive and imaginative, and are perhaps best able to deal with it: to hand it over to a body that has not anything like their energy or their ability, is a wrong one.  At the moment there are 1,200 cars fitted with gas-producer plants.  Six hundred of these are commercial vehicles, and 600 of them belong to private persons.  How many have the railway company?</P>

      <P>I am talking of the problem that exists, and saying that we cannot feed Dublin in the emergency that is contemplated from time to time by the Minister for Supplies except we get producer plants built and added to some of the lorries that are lying up at the present time.

      <P>We are voting money for the Research Bureau to take the material we have and use it to get us through the emergency.  As I have said, we have something like 13,000 commercial cars in the country. Thousands of these, I suppose, are lying up.  At any rate, thousands of private cars are lying up.  Anybody who knows anything about a car will know that even a new car, if it is left lying up for two years, will require a very considerable amount of expenditure on overhauling to make it usable as a car.  You have all that material lying up.  You also have the material from which you could make the necessary gas-producing equipment.  You have the necessary metal in the country, and you have the necessary engineering skill.  According to the statements that have been made, we are likely to be in the middle of this serious problem: that we cannot feed Dublin or give the necessary fuel to Dublin, and yet nothing that is being done by the Research Bureau has any bearing on <Col N="114" /> the solution of that very serious problem.</P>

      <P>I take it that if we vote money for the bureau then it should be used by the board to pay attention to the most important and urgent work that is there to be done.  Again, I suggest to the Taoiseach that the bureau seems to have no mandate to think.  It ought to be allowed to think.  If the Taoiseach still maintains the present position, that it will not do any work except what is suggested to it by him, I put it to him that he should look around and see whether he could not get some additional machinery, if necessary, to suggest to him the urgency of the transport problem as well as the thoughts and ideas that those connected with that industry have for the solution of it, because my submission is that the energy, the ability, the ingenuity and the materials are there for its solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this to the Taoiseach.  Suppose an industrialist or a merchant in this country finds himself in an industrial or mercantile dilemma can he refer that to this bureau and have the matter investigated without involving himself in an unascertained liability for fees?  This is not a nation of great plutocratic concerns, and there may arise from time to time a variety of problems relating to substitution, or what has become known in the vernacular as ersatz, which the <i>entrepreneurs</i> wish to have investigated but cannot afford it.  It has never been made clear that this research bureau is prepared to take over a problem of that kind and examine it exhaustively, and give to the <i>entrepreneur</i> the result of their research without charging any fee. I think that ought to be made manifest. I think that persons in difficulties ought to be encouraged to approach the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau and be made realise that, far from being regarded as a nuisance or extravagant, the bureau would appreciate <Col N="115" /> their co-operation in propounding difficulties of this kind to it.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach, no doubt, knows, there are a number of firms in England like Baker, Perkins and others who hold themselves out as being firms one branch of whose activity is to solve the insoluble.  They want to be given some problem which has completely defeated the best skill of a firm's experts, so that they can propose a means of overcoming the problem, so that they can design the requisite machinery for meeting the problem and, of course, in exchange for that service, they expect a pretty formidable fee.  That is the approach heretofore available to manufacturers and <i>entrepreneurs</i> in this country and Great Britain, and therefore that procedure is associated in our minds with pretty formidable expense.  It will be necessary to make it very manifest that this Emergency Scientific Research Bureau in Éire is a public service, the skill of which is available <i>gratis</i> to any <i>bona fide</i> person who really stands in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that, so far, the activities of this bureau have been confined to the examination of such problems as he has referred to it.  I want to suggest four problems that the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau ought to address their minds to.  One is the provision of absolute alcohol for the laboratories and hospitals of this country.  I am not going to go into all the technical details of the uses of absolute alcohol, but I do not think I will exaggerate when I say that scientific research generally in our universities and hospitals is materially obstructed for the want of this commodity at the present time.  I understand it could be made available by the industrial alcohol factories, but there may be some problem of special refining which is at present creating a situation in which the laboratories and hospitals are unable to get supplies.  It may be some administrative problem connected with the Revenue Commissioners, some problem relating to duties payable, but, whatever the problem is, I suggest that the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau should examine the matter and, <Col N="116" /> whether it turns out to be an administrative problem or a scientific problem, they should be asked to report to the Taoiseach forthwith, so that steps may be taken to ensure that instead of putting the entire industrial alcohol output into ordinary commercial channels, part, at least, should be diverted to the laboratories and hospitals, where it would be of quite incalculable value at the present time.</P>
    <P>The next point to which I will draw attention concerns a matter that must have arrested the attention of every rural Deputy.  Blacksmiths throughout the country are at the pin of their collar, so to speak, for the wherewithal to heat iron in order that they may make horseshoes.  There is no blacksmiths' coal in the country and there is no immediate likelihood of getting any.  Fifty years ago the blacksmiths in and around Ballaghaderreen reddened most of their iron with charcoal. Their neighbours manufactured the charcoal from turf.  That art seems to have completely died out in the country; nobody seems to know how to do that now.  I suggest that the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau should address themselves to ascertaining how our grandfathers converted turf into charcoal suitable for reddening the iron in blacksmiths' forges.  If they fail to produce as satisfactory a solution as our unsophisticated grandfathers evolved, then I would expect them to produce some other substitute for blacksmiths' coal.</P>
    <P>This matter is very urgent because, with a steady decrease in transport facilities, more particularly motor traffic, the necessity for having horses to travel on the roads is very great. The Taoiseach may not be quite aware of the urgency of this problem because, so far, there has been only a slight outcry.  He may not be aware that horses engaged on purely agricultural work, in fields and so forth, can do without shoes, and many farmers are to-day working them without shoes. But you cannot work horses on the roads without shoes and a great deal of traffic will have to go on the roads within the next six months, and a great deal of employment will depend upon those horses going on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be desirable, but it can be done, and, so long as the thing can be done, you will not get too uproarious an outcry about the scarcity of shoes.  But it cannot be done if you have to put horses on the roads; if you have to work them on the roads under heavy loads they must be shod. In North Mayo motor transport has been taken off the roads.  I refer now to the motor transport available to lorry owners.  The same thing is about to happen in other portions of the country.  Any man living in a town in that area must now get his goods from the station in a horse-drawn vehicle.  Every travelling shop in the area must change to a horse-drawn vehicle.  Various other forms of transport that normally obtained in a country town must now go on to horses and carts.  These horses cannot be kept on the roads if we cannot get the shoes with which to shoe them, and there is no use in providing iron if the blacksmiths cannot convert it into shoes.</P>
      <P>I can see the urgency of this problem. When a blacksmith comes to me I do my best to provide him with slack from Arigna coal or from coal primarily supplied for industrial purposes.  So long as slack of that character is available, the balcksmiths can get on, but with the steady diminution of supplies of coal, even for industrial purposes that source is drying up.  But for the fact that I have some slack which I am able to give the blacksmiths in my area, they would not be able to continue. If we could evolve turf charcoal, that problem would be immediately solved.  Even though there are extensive areas where turf is not available for so essential a matter as I have referred to, it would be quite easy to transport turf charcoal to the individual smiths, wherever they may be, so as to keep the horses on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the astonishing achievement of the Minister for Agriculture. He has done what Oliver <Col N="118" /> Cromwell failed to do&mdash;he has wiped out the pig population of this country. I suggest the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau should be required to examine the food stuffs we are growing and see if they could not be converted into some easily transportable pig food.  So far as I know, in other countries, notably Great Britain and Germany, surplus potatoes have been converted into a very easily handled product suitable for feeding pigs, and which can be kept in store much longer than the potatoes themselves can be kept.  It seems to me to be an insane thing to let potatoes rot in pits rather than convert them, in these areas where there is a surplus, into an easily transportable pig food, so that it may be possible to maintain our bacon supplies.</P>
    <P>This year I think we will be confronted with a very inadequate supply of potatoes, because a large proportion of the potato crop, perhaps 20 per cent., has proved a failure.  Last year we had a very considerable surplus.  If we had put our minds to the task of converting that surplus into a pig food which could be kept, we would have a huge surplus now to stretch out the supply which will be available to us in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Surely these are the kinds of things that would provide full-time work for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, with this added inducement for submitting such problems to them, that research conducted along these lines might provide us with not only temporary expedients requisite to carry us through our present emergency, but discoveries that might stand to us for all time.  I think it would be a good thing if we knew for all time that the potato problem of the Cooley area of County Louth was no longer a problem, and that, in the Cooley area, instead of converting surplus potatoes into motor spirit at 3/6 a gallon, they were converted into a pig food which would be economical, easily transportable and valuable, That would be a piece of scientific research which would be of value to this community for all time.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I think the <Col N="119" /> Emergency Scientific Research Bureau might turn its attention is the question of providing some material from whatever resources we can scrape together in this country wherewith to tan leather.  Does anybody realise what the situation in regard to boots is? I have not got delivery of a pair of boots for the last two months.  The public are not going to feel that for the next six months, because I have very large stocks of boots, and so has every other boot retailer in the country, but do Deputies know that the boot manufacturers are unable to produce any boots at present because there is no leather and that there is no leather because there is no material wherewith to tan it?</P>

All I can tell you is that they will not sell me any boots and the reason they give me is that they have no leather to put into them. The reason they have no leather is that there are no tanning materials wherewith to tan it.  Is that not so? Is there any boot factor in the House who knows anything about the problem? Deputy Allen is a very knowledgeable man but &ldquo;divil a much&rdquo; he knows about boots.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would not know the difference between the leather which goes into the top and the leather which goes into the bottom.  I think it is bottom leather they are short of.  In any case, these are facts as reported to me.  There is an acute shortage of leather which is holding up the boot factories for want <Col N="120" /> of materials wherewith to tan the leather.  I believe that is substantially true and I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should now institute inquiries as to whether that statement is true or false, and invite the bureau to examine the possibilities of getting tanning material out of whatever is growing in this country.  I always understood that it was possible to tan boots with oak bark.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I always understood it was possible to do it.  There is the situation as reported to me, and it may be that there are some other things required which one has to mix with the liquor of oak bark in order to make a suitable tanning medium, and these things are not available.  If it is, we ought to turn our minds at once to trying to discover something which would act as a substitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Taoiseach will readily recognise, it is very difficult to state problems which he may probably refer to the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau in the House.  The proper people to indicate the kind of problems that require investigation are the manufacturers and <i>entrepreneurs</i> who are themselves confronted with the problems that require solution.  The Taoiseach will get that kind of information in plenty, if he publicises the fact that the services of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau are free, gratis and for nothing. The moment an attempt is made to publicise that fact, the Department of Finance will intervene and say: &ldquo;But there must be a fee of 2/6 and there must be an undertaking by the manufacturer even though it is a formality, that, if any exceptional expenditure has to be embarked upon by the bureau, for the investigation of this peculiar problem which cannot conceivably affect anybody else&mdash;it is contrary to Government policy to spend money on the individual property of any citizen&mdash;to recoup the Government for any expenditure which is determined to be of exclusive use to an individual citizen.&rdquo;  The moment that is <Col N="121" /> done, not a single application will come forward, because the moment you sign an undertaking of that kind, you enter into a contingent liability, the end of which nobody can see, and nobody is going to take that risk.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that we ought to drive it home that whatever services are given, whatever research is embarked upon as a result of an inquiry addressed to the bureau by any <i>bona fide</i> person, there will be no expenses for the person making the inquiry. There is the way in which the Taoiseach will get the co-operation of which he stands in need.  May I say this, that at this stage another kind of invitation ought to be issued.  The attention of interested persons ought to be directed to the ancient Irish proverb: &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb&rdquo;&mdash;that they should look forward and should anticipate difficulties that may arise, that they should state their difficulties fully and set an approximate date at which they expect them to develop.  It will then be for the Taoiseach to determine whether the contingency they envisage is too remote to refer to the bureau, or whether, in all the circumstances, it is better to have the problem investigated in good time, so that the solution will be available, if and when the scarcity arises.</P>
    <P>There is no use in approaching the bureau and telling them: &ldquo;An iudustrial and supply problem has arisen and we want a solution by next Monday week.&rdquo;  Their answer will be: &ldquo;We can count ourselves very fortunate if we can present you with a solution this day six months, and it is much more likely to take 12 months.&rdquo;  Nor will the research be conducted in the correct atmosphere if it is almost always a question of great urgency. We should review the supply field and set these men to work now and we should make this clear to the existing personnel of this bureau, that they will not be stinted for money in the employment of young scientists to conduct the laboratory research which must be conducted if the work is to be properly done.</P>
    <P>I am informed that nearly every scientific technician who qualifies in our universities is swept out of the <Col N="122" /> country at once by most lucrative offers from Great Britain, who stands in urgent need of technicians.  I am informed that if you want a higher science master for a school, never mind a technician for an industrial research bureau, it is quite impossible to get one because persons with qualifications which would enable them to become secondary school teachers in science, never mind a laboratory assistant in a bureau of this kind, can command fantastic salaries in Great Britain at present. There is no use in asking the bureau to get the services of competent scientists, to work under the direction of the personnel of the bureau, for £2 15s. 0d. per week, because you will not get them.  Unless you are prepared to pay, and to pay well, for competent technical advice and competent research workers, all you will get is a collection of &ldquo;yobs&rdquo;, and you might as well spend no money at all as to dole it out to fellows who are quite incompetent to do the work they are supposed to be doing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has a winsome way with him when dealing with his colleagues in the Government, and what he wants done he usually gets done. I suppose that that is part of the characteristics of a Pooh-Bah, and I often think that, in considering the question of qualifications of this kind, it might not be a bad thing to have a Pooh-Bah at the head of the Government. Therefore, I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should put on his battle-dress and inform the Department of Finance that he is going to spend that much money on this; that he thinks it necessary to spend that much money on this work, and will then present the bill for it and, if the Minister for Finance, Mr. Seán T.O Ceallaigh, thinks it is a matter purely for the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, unfortunately, is hog-tied on this matter, because all he can do is to ask whether or not the Minister for Finance has <Col N="123" /> sanctioned it.  That is all I can do, as chairman of that committee, in matters of this particular kind.  In other matters, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee has a wide discretion, but I can assure the Taoiseach that if I had a discretion in connection with this particular work, it would be very liberally exercised.  I know, of course, the Taoiseach's reputation in connection with such matters as this, and I cannot imagine his being afraid of using his discretion widely. Possibly I should be a little flattered if the Taoiseach were to adopt my suggestion.  However, the Taoiseach knows that he has got to get good men for this work, and he must also know that if he wants to get good men he will have to pay them well, so that they will not be impeded or held up in the middle of important work while they are trying to prove to the Department of Finance that their work is necessary. Mind you, that is an immensely important thing.  Scientific men, of the type who will man a bureau of this kind, are not qualified to conduct running battles with the experts of the Department of Finance, and if such a thing happens, these people will simply throw their hats at the job and say: &ldquo;We do not know what this is all about and we cannot be bothered about arranging for the necessary certificates, and so on, as to how we are to spend this money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the money should be appropriated here, and that it should then be left to the members of the bureau to decide how it should be spent.  I know that the Department of Finance will say that that would be trifling with public moneys&mdash;that they must have certificates, and so on&mdash;but I also know that there are certain circumstances in which that very necessary and very desirable ordinary practice should be definitely departed from, and one of these circumstances is in regard to this particular Estimate. After all, this refers to a body of men who have not got the Civil Service mind.  I am not decrying the Civil Service mind.  I know that, in connecnection with a great deal of the administration of this State, it is the <Col N="124" /> civil servants who protect the interests of the ordinary tax-paying public, but I believe that here is a case where the powers of the Civil Service should be abrogated, and that whatever sum may be required should be left to the discretion of this bureau to be spent on their appropriate work, because, unless that is done, I believe that very important work may be held up and delayed, with very serious consequences for our people.  I have made four suggestions with regard to this body, and I trust that the Taoiseach will see that every <i>bona fide</i> citizen of this State shall be given the benefits of these researches, free, gratis and for nothing.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that this Scientific Research Bureau has proved to be a very useful institution during this emergency, and that it has justified fully the very considerable amount of money that has been expended on its activities.  I feel sure that it has solved many problems arising from the emergency, and has found very useful substitutes for commodities and essential articles that cannot now be imported.  While I agree absolutely with Deputy Mulcahy that all its time ought to be devoted to problems of the emergency, and that problems of the type referred to in the Taoiseach's statement, such as the possibility of producing gas from turf for post-war purposes, ought not to occupy the time of such a bureau, unless they have no emergency problem to tackle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if it is an emergency problem, I agree that it should be tackled now.  Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="125" /> referred to the transport problem, which, I think, is the major problem of the war.  If there is to be a further curtailment of the petrol that is available to this country, I feel that it will have a paralysing effect, not only on distribution, but on production as well. We have been warned by the Minister for Supplies that that situation is likely to develop, and the Minister for Agriculture, a few nights ago, in a message over the radio, also warned us about that.  I should like to point out to the Taoiseach that, if that is so, there is no possibility, in certain districts in this country, of carrying out the amount of cultivation that is now being done.  I am referring to certain intensive tillage districts, where there is not enough horse power available, and these districts will be very seriously handicapped, if there is any further curtailment in petrol supplies, because there is intensive cultivation there and mechanised methods are largely used.  If that situation is likely to develop, consideration ought to be given at the earliest possible moment to fitting producer-gas equipment to tractors to substitute for paraffin oil on the larger farms.  I feel that this is a pressing problem and I am sure that the Taoiseach himself appreciates the urgency of the matter, if there is to be&mdash;as we are told is almost a certainty&mdash;a further curtailment of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, while I agree that that question of transport is the major problem for this country, there is another very serious problem, not only for the emergency but also from the point of view of post-war conditions, and that is the matter of artificial manures.  I have already referred a question on the matter to the Taoiseach, but I think that, at the time, it was passed over rather lightly.  The Taoiseach, on the 28th October last, I think, when addressing the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, made a passing reference to it, but it seemed to me that he was thinking in terms of post-war planning at the time.  I believe, however, that it is a problem that should command the immediate attention of the Scientific Research Bureau.  I am referring particularly to the question of the conversion <Col N="126" /> of town waste and sewage.  On the 26th May last, I addressed a question to the Taoiseach, and the question and answers will be found in Volume 87, No. 1, of the Official Debates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the manufacture of humus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, finding a substitute for artificial manures.  I asked the Taoiseach on that occasion whether any success had attended the work of the bureau in finding a substitute for imported artificial manures which are not now available, and the answer of the Taoiseach was that the Scientific Research Bureau had concluded, from an examination of the position in regard to the country's requirements of fertilisers, that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the difficulties involved in securing the necessary plant would make it impossible during the emergency to manufacture within the country artificial manures on the scale required.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The bureau has recommended the increased production of native phosphate, the increased use of seaweed as manure, a more intensive search for natural deposits, the winning of which would help to relieve the situation; and these measures have been adopted.  The bureau is aware of the Indore process for the manufacture of humus but has not regarded the possibilities of applying the process to Irish conditions as being worthy of special study by them.  The essential feature of the Indore process, namely, the use of the urine and dung of farm animals in conjunction with waste materials in the production of humus, is based on principles already widely practised in this country in the making of compost and farmyard manure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that question, I referred to Sir Albert Howard's work on this whole matter.  I might say at the start that, in my opinion, the most precious thing we have in this country, the greatest asset that this country possesses, is <Col N="127" /> the fertility of the soil.  It should be the concern of every individual in this State to ensure that that fertility is preserved, and in fact, improved, so that the productive capacity of the soil would, as a corollary to that, be improved.  I feel that in recent years we have drawn substantially on that capital asset.  Even before this emergency, in some of the intensive tillage districts there has been a diminution of that precious possession, which in fact does not really belong to our generation.  We have the right to use it, but the fertility of this country belongs to posterity.  While we have the right to use it, I feel that there is a responsibility on us to care for it as a precious possession, and that it should be our concern to try to hand it down in as good, and if anything, in a better condition than we got it.</P>
    <P>With the scientific knowledge that is available to-day, the work of Sir George Stapleton and the experiments carried on at Aberystwyth, there is no doubt that, using those modern scientific methods of agriculture, a very substantial improvement can be effected in the quality and fertility of the soil. Sir Albert Howard is a man who has interested himself to a very great extent in the provision of humus, a man who was knighted for that work, and who has lectured in various places all over England.  He first came up against the problem when he was charged with responsibility for looking after agriculture in India, and he discovered that there was humus sufficiency in the soil there because in that country they were using dung from domestic animals for fuel purposes.</P>
    <P>Sir Albert Howard tackled that problem and carried out many experiments. As a result of those experiments, and experiments at a later period in Nairobi, he evolved a system of converting town waste and sewage into humus.  The difficulty of converting sewage and sewage sludge into humus is the difficulty in generating fermentation, because Deputies will realise that it is a very cold substance. There is too much liquid there, and it is almost impossible to induce fermentation. While I agree with the reply <Col N="128" /> that was given by the Scientific Research Bureau that Sir Albert Howard's method of conversion is based on well-known composting principles which have been adopted here for a number of years, and that in his earlier system he used farmyard manure to encourage fermentation, people who have experience of composting methods will appreciate that the moment you get fermentation started there is no difficulty after that.  There is this difference: that he realised that it was necessary to control that fermentation.  If you allowed fermentation to rise above a certain level you immediately had gas given off, and you lost nitrogen.  His system controlled fermentation.  There was a number of containers, the first of which was filled with town waste of all descriptions and a certain amount of spraying over by water was done with each layer, so that fermentation was encouraged, and when that developed to a certain temperature it was turned over to the next receptacle or container. In that way, heating was controlled; the solids were disintegrated and the liquids were dried out, and the article finally evolved itself into a very fine powder.</P>

I am speaking from an entirely different angle, the point of view of the eastern counties; we have different methods and different outlook and far greater production.  If we ask nature to produce abundantly, nature has to be paid for what she gives.  If we are not repaying nature for what she is giving, someone is going to suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>There is enough humus in the soil in the Province of Leinster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy ought to be too dogmatic about that.  I know a little about it. I want to remind the Taoiseach that the scientific bureau points out that this cannot be done without the use of farmyard manure, and, if you cannot convert sewage sludge here without the use of farmyard manure, then obviously I do not think it is any use at all.  Sir Albert Howard at a later stage found that it could be done, and in some of his lectures under the auspices of the Royal Society of Arts in England he is reported to have said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The results of this Nairobi experiment are of unusual interest, because they indicate very clearly the solution of the manurial problem in all parts of the Occident: how a successful working compromise between the rival claims of inorganic and organic manures can be achieved.  The first step is to obtain a steady supply of humus.  This can be secured by converting all the <Col N="130" /> organic residues which are now either running to waste or are hardly utilised at all.  These are municipal wastes, crude sewage, sewage sludge and peat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress the word &ldquo;peat&rdquo; for the Taoiseach, because he is very interested in peat.</P>
    <P>Sir Albert Howard proceeds as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The conversion of these materials into humus is a simple matter.  The town wastes and peat, when sprayed with sewage sludge, will produce the conditions necessary for the first stages in humus manufacture.  The limiting factor will be the oxygen supply.  The chief practical problem will be how best to draw from the atmosphere the large quantities of oxygen needed by the fungi and bacteria.  Simple diffusion will not suffice.  I envisage the use of compressed air as the next big development in the application of the Indore process to urban areas.  This compressed air would be needed to start and to maintain the intense oxidation which is involved in the first part of the process.  Such speeding up of the conversion would have other advantages; the area of land required for the composting factory would be automatically reduced (an important consideration on the outskirts of large towns); the output would be increased.  Once the air supply is arranged for, the mechanisation of the rest of the process involves nothing more than the adoption of well-known labour-saving devices, such as rotary mixers, conveyers, and so forth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another place in the lecture he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In pursuing their one-sided chase after quantity, the experiment station workers are not only misleading practice, but are unconsciously doing the greatest possible disservice to the true cause of agricultural research.  They have failed to insist on the effective return to the soil of the waste products contributed by the plant, by the animal, and by the <Col N="131" /> community.  They have speeded up the wheel of life over one-half of its revolution without due thought of the other half.  The steering is thus bound to be erratic; the sense of direction is certain to be lost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another place he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The study of quality; the determination of the factors which go to produce it or to prevent its development; the effect of high quality on the diseases of plants, of animals and of mankind, must be investigated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He finishes up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With all this before our eyes, we as a nation are spending large sums every year on the study of the diseases of our live stock&mdash;such as tuberculosis and foot-and-mouth disease&mdash;in the vain hope that laboratory science will find a remedy for what common sense should prevent. The microscope and the methods of Pasteur and of his successors can never hope to achieve a permanent and effective cure of such diseases. The cause lies much deeper than anything which is likely to be ascertained in the laboratory.  It is in all probability malnutrition following closely in the wake of long-continued mismanagement of the land.  We must attack diseases like tuberculosis and foot-and-mouth disease at the source, see that our animals get grass and fodder worth eating, that the breed is kept robust, and that the hygiene is satisfactory.  We must develop the splendid work which Professor Stapleton and his band of devoted assistants have done at Aberystwyth, and make our grasslands really efficient.  We shall then introduce real quality into our milk, into our milk products, into our meat, and so lay one of the foundations of a sound system of preventive medicine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a school of thought in England at the present time that believes that the quality of food that is produced from artificial manure is inferior and injurious to some extent to the animal that consumes it, and that <Col N="132" /> in fact intensive use of artificial manure over a protracted period induces plant disease and fungus disease of various sorts that reacts on the health of the animal afterwards. Russell of Rothamsted carried out some experiments to try to discover if that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indicating to the Taoiseach, who is responsible for the operation of the bureau, what has been done by scientists in other countries, with regard to the development or the solution of the problem of the conversion of the natural humus that is there and which is simply being wasted, a lot of it flowing down the Liffey and other rivers.  When this was referred to the Taoiseach, he referred it to the scientific bureau.  I got a very unsatisfactory answer at the time, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate <Col N="133" /> that on a Parliamentary Question I could not develop my point as I am developing it now.  The House is asked to vote a sum of money for this purpose, and I think this is the only opportunity that is available to me in this House to raise this whole matter and to go into it in detail.  I submit, Sir, for that reason, that I am in order in discussing this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take full advantage of it now while you are at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very serious matter for the whole House. It is a very advanced idea and possibly some feel that it is a bit farfetched, but I am convinced it is nothing of the sort.  Great Britain at the present time is examining a largescale scheme for the conversion of town waste and sewage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument, I take it, is addressed to the West Britons, not to the Gaels.  The Taoiseach is a Gael and there is no use approaching him on these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is an indication that the people who have given some years to the study of this problem have convinced the authorities on the other side that it is a matter well worthy of attention and examination and well worth spending large sums of money on.  We have in this country valuable humus, valuable natural fertilisers. As I have already stated, there are people who believe that the natural way of fertilising plant life is the ideal way of doing it, and the medium through which you will get the best results and the only way by which you can eliminate plant and animal diseases.  There is a very definite combination between plant and animal life, and if the plant life is inferior and diseased, it reacts on the health of the animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pointing out, Sir, when you questioned as to whether or not I was in order, that Sir John Russell of Rothamsted carried out experiments to see if there was anything in this contention that intensive use of artificial manure was injurious to the health of the plant and that that, in turn, <Col N="134" /> affected the health of the animal.  Over a series of experiments, he came to the conclusion that it did not in fact injure the health of the plant, but Sir Albert Howard pointed out that fresh seed was used each year.  He contended that if he had used the seed of the same plot year after year, he would have got diseased plants as a result of the use of artificial manures. I do not want to elaborate too much on it.  I merely want to say to the Taoiseach that I feel that this is a problem that must be tackled vigorously here, with all due respect for Deputy Dillon's opinion on the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great shortage of potash, nitrogen and phosphates. That is a very different thing from humus deficiency.  They are two different problems altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that you must have humus present in the soil if you are going to have plant life and that this is a medium of supplying nitrogen, phosphates and potash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One way of getting it is to put in a good crop of grass, plenty of which we have in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the part of the country Deputy Dillon comes from you had not very much cultivation.  The land there was allowed to remain in grass for many years.  Obviously, there would be no humus problem there.  But it is quite a different matter in those parts of the country where you have intensive cultivation carried out, and where the land is not allowed to remain in grass for more than one or two years.  I would like to point out that in converting this sewage you can produce a complete manure.  Very satisfactory results were obtained from the series of experiments carried out by Sir A. Howard.  The analysis of the product in its final state is very high. The Taoiseach referred to the manufacture of agar from seaweed.  He did not give us any analysis of it.  Anything manufactured from seaweed should, I take it, have a high potash content. He gave us no information as to what was being done about the conversion of <Col N="135" /> seaweed into potash for agricultural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention that.  That is not the purpose of agar at all.  Agar is used in bacteriological work where a gelatinising medium containing the minimum of nutrients is required.  It is also used for pharmaceutical purposes, and in the textile industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <P>Where straw is ploughed into the land, or where manure is ploughed into the land where the straw is not completely broken down, the immediate effect is that it depresses the nitrogen in the soil.  Bacteria acting on that straw uses up a good deal of the nitrogen present in the soil.  There, again, Deputies will appreciate that it is essential that the straw should be completely broken down if you are to get good results.  I would ask the Taoiseach to have the uses of peat and of straw examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Estimate, the Taoiseach rightly laid emphasis on the research work which is being undertaken by the Scientific Research Bureau in providing a substitute for imported fuel.  I quite agree with the views expressed by other speakers that, as in the past we mainly relied on imported fuel, such as petrol, coal and engine oil, our position in the future is very likely to be serious if there is any further curtailment in the importation of the limited quantities of these commodities coming in.  I think, therefore, that the Taoiseach should direct the attention of the bureau to the necessity of concentrating a large portion of its time on producing a type of fuel which may be used in gas producing plants.  We may, for a long time after the war, have to rely on gas producer plants as a means of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A situation may develop at any moment in which, if we have not available adequate supplies of gasproducing plants, the transportation system of the whole country may be so seriously dislocated that you may have actual want in some areas, due to our inability to transport foodstuffs to them.  While the Taoiseach was speaking of the necessity for producing certain substitute fuels, I could not help thinking that we are neglecting possibilities which lie at our very door. Some time ago a company was established by legislation we passed here providing for the development of the Slievardagh coalfield.  It was a highly desirable thing for the State to engage itself in that type of activity, but I am afraid the results so far have been rather disappointing.  Apparently, every anticipated difficulty has been experienced, while a number of unanticipated ones have also made their appearance.  In this country, in which so little coal is being mined, some effort, I suggest, ought to be made, even if mistakes occur in the process, to win for the people such coal as can be produced from our coal deposits. For a long time I have been trying to <Col N="137" /> induce the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take over a colliery in Carlow known as the Rossmore colliery.  According to the report of a former head of the Geological Survey, there are approximately 30,000,000 tons of anthracite coal there.  That is his statement, not my assertion.  I have been trying to induce the Minister for Industry and Commerce to get this new company at Slievardagh to go into the Leinster coalfield at Rossmore to prospect and develop the mine there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of red tape one that Deputy Dillon referred to which appears to clog every effort that is made to get anything done in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>What was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to develop the matter.  I do not want to prevent the Taoiseach from getting his Estimate before 8 o'clock.  There is a man there working the mine on extremely limited capital.  He is producing, I think, approximately 1,000 tons of coal per month.  His capital and machinery are not sufficient to develop the mine.  Further efforts to get local people, with capital, to go into the thing have not been successful for one reason or another.  It is not too easy to induce people to invest money in the development of coal mines in this country.  I tried to get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to get the Slievardagh Company to take over this mine in Carlow and exploit it, with its resources technical and financial.  The Minister's view is that this company was established for the purpose of developing Slievardagh and that it cannot dissipate its energies in the winning of coal elsewhere. Under pressure, the Slievardagh Company have now come into the Carlow coalfields and made some borings, possibly with a view to developing the mine, but the thing is being done in such an indolent and leisurely fashion that I am appalled at the valuable time that is being <Col N="138" /> wasted in a period of emergency, and when coal is such a vital commodity for the carrying on of many of our essential industries.  As a matter of fact, some of this coal which is being mined in Carlow is being sent to Donegal to keep mills going there, but the limited quantity available in Carlow does not help to satisfy anything but a fragment of the demand.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that in present circumstances the State ought not to allow any punctilio to stand in the way of exploiting whatever coal resources we have.  The Carlow coalfield is a case in point.  If the State stepped in there and, by the formation of a Government controlled company, or by encouraging the Slievardagh Company, the Carlow deposits were taken over and worked, a very substantial contribution to our coal supplies could be made by that colliery. True, the coal is anthracite, but that type of coal is necessary for many of our industrial operations.  If the Department does not move in the matter now, it seems to me that we will never see any exploitation of that coalfield.  I cannot understand why, in circumstances in which we have no coal and in which there is evidence of the existence of coal at our very doors, steps are not being taken to ensure that we get the maximum quantity of coal which is capable of being mined.</P>

I do not propose to go into this matter any further.  I merely direct the attention of the Taoiseach to the existence of this coal in Carlow in the hope that he may take with me the rather radical view that there is an urgent need for the development of this coalfield and in the hope that he may encourage his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to see that that development is not long delayed.</P>

I appreciate very much the attitude of the House towards the bureau.  It is what I would expect, because the bureau was set up with the approval of every Party.  I think everybody appreciates the good work that it has been doing and that it can do for us in this emergency. It was apparent from some speakers that they were under certain <Col N="140" /> misapprehensions.  I would like to say to Deputy Mulcahy, with reference to the lecture which he listened to in University College, that that was not a substitute for a discussion in the Dáil.  That was an explanation to a chemical society.  It was purely an academic matter, dealing with technical points.  It was interesting to everybody, I will admit.  It was a lecture which was intended, I think, for a rather wide audience, but at the same time it was primarily directed to a scientific society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was narrowed down to that, and it would give the impression, perhaps, to those who simply approached it from that point of view, that here was going on a good deal of scientific work which was likely to give valuable results in the training of scientists&mdash;likely to give them a very practical approach and to take them away from the too academic side of their work.  Research students are much more interested in the things they can see the immediate application of.  You will get more effective results from research work of that kind than you will from the purely academic side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a mistake to think that that lecture was an indication of the attitude of mind of the bureau in relation to the present crisis.  No persons are more fully aware than its members that the bureau was established for the emergency.  There would be no point in establishing the bureau for any other purpose.  Already we had an organisation which, with modification. could do the work of the type Deputy Mulcahy seemed to think for the moment they were engaged on as a result of listening to the lecture.  The fact is that the bureau was established purely for emergency research purposes. The problems they are interested in are the problems of the moment and, whilst their research is connected with these problems, they may meet with certain aspects and they may say that these are things that can be developed at a later stage. <Col N="141" /> They realise that time is the essence of their work and they may have to develop a second or third-rate process for a particular type of work in order to have due regard to the time element. Their whole work is intended to deal with problems arising from the emergency. One Deputy seemed to suggest that somehow they were fettered, that everything they did had to be submitted to the Department of Finance and that there was going to be a wrangle between the bureau and the Department with regard to a particular project.  That is not so.  The device of the Grant-in-Aid was chosen in order to give them a considerable amount of freedom. Their proposals come to me for approval.  Issues from the Grant-in-Aid are made by the Department of Finance on my recommendation.  So far we have got along very well together. I appreciate the peculiarity of their type of work.  I am anxious to discharge my duties properly.  It is not right to think that they are being hampered in any particular way from the point of view of any special Departmental control.  There is some control necessary in looking after public funds, but so far there has not been any difficulty.  Whatever they wanted in reason, they have got.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is that in all these discussions we are tending more and more to find fault with the Civil Service, to suggest there is red tape and all the rest in order to hold things up.  There are certain necessary checks which everybody will appreciate.  These checks have to be very carefully exercised in a time of emergency, lest the checks which are intended for efficiency and to save public money should hold the things up.  I think all the Departments of State realise the extent to which the efforts to meet the needs of the emergency might be frustrated by having these checks carried to an unjustifiable extent, and I think it is true generally that the needs of the emergency dominate the method of administration, and, in regard to the bureau, I have had no complaints on that score.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> I agree with all the Deputies who have spoken that there is a certain priority in relation to these problems. A whole lot of problems have arisen as a result of the emergency and there is a natural priority amongst them, and undoubtedly it is desirable that the more important problems, the larger problems, should be those to which greatest attention should be paid.  One of the first problems we asked the bureau to help us with was the problem of fuel for heating purposes and for power, for transport purposes. They naturally looked around to see what were our sources of fuel.  The larger sources we have are our bogs, and the natural place to look for material to meet our present deficiencies would be the peat from our bogs, for heating purposes, even for gas; and especially for charcoal for transport, if we could make it satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to say that Deputy Mulcahy is wrong when he says that the bureau has no mandate to think for itself.  That is not so.  If he will look up the terms of reference of the bureau, he will see that they are (1) to give technical advice to the Government on such special problems relating to industrial processes and the use of substitute materials as may be referred to them&mdash; in other words, the initiative should come from the Government; (2) to advise the Government generally on the use of native and other materials to meet deficiencies caused by the restriction of imported raw materials and commodities&mdash;that is, giving them a free hand; they were to give on their own initiative such advice to the Government as they thought desirable in connection with the obvious deficiencies, and they have done that; and (3) to direct and conduct special researches and inquiries connected with the above.  That is, they were given a free hand both to give advice on problems referred to them by the Government and to start investigations on their own account.</P>
    <P>One of the first things they did was to get in touch with firms which were known by the Department of Supplies to be in need of help.  We did not ask <Col N="143" /> for a list, but I am sure they have been in touch with hundreds of firms, helping them with their particular difficulties, first, giving advice, which they give free, and then, if the particular problems put by the firms are of a character which could be examined from the point of view of the public interest, if they are the larger emergency problems, and if the problems suggested are of such a character that they would warrant investigation, they pursue these investigations themselves. The firms in question are given the results and they are not charged anything.  If, on the other hand, the investigations are of such a character that they benefit a firm alone and do not come into the class of what might be called general public utility or public interest investigations, now and again they charge certain small fees; but the House can see how small the amount of fees is when I recall that I mentioned in my opening statement that they represented about £900 in an expenditure of about £24,000 for the year, so that there is no barrier against firms which have difficulties in regard to matters of public interest sending in their problems.  Even where they are more of a private character&mdash;matters which are really matters of private profit, the charges are really only a contribution to the total cost.</P>
    <P>Of course we could not expect the bureau to solve everybody's problems for them.  They must have discretion in the selection of the things they are to do, and, while we invite all concerned who have problems which are associated immediately with the present emergency, and the solution of which would benefit the community as a whole, to send along their problems and get the advice of the bureau, we do not want everybody who has some idea in his head that something might be useful to himself or to the community to send it along because the whole time of the bureau might very well be taken up with an examination of what these problems are.  Their correspondence, I think, would take all their time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I tell the House that in order that Deputies may realise that the bureau is working really autonomously, in touch with the various concerns and busying itself with the problems of the moment.  If a large number of Deputies had spoken on this matter, I am sure they would all have brought up one type of problem or another for which they thought the bureau should try to get the solution.  There is, of course, the big problem of fuel, but there are smaller problems which affect materials of a very wide class.  It is the old question in a time of emergency of &ldquo;for want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe, the horse was lost,&rdquo; and so on.  Very often it is a relatively small thing which will hold up a big industry.  We may have a lot of the materials, but one particular vital material may be absent, and the whole process has to come to a stop on that account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about boots.  I have not heard that there is a shortage of boots, but, if there is, I do not think it is due to a shortage of leather.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was about to say.  I have already referred to the nail being lost.  It is this thing called grindery&mdash;I think that is the technical name&mdash;which caused the difficulty and not the question of tanning. In regard to tanning, the bureau as a matter of fact was called in at a very early stage and did give a certain amount of help.  I have a note here which I shall read for the House.  Following representations from the industry&mdash;that is, the tanning industry&mdash;investigations were undertaken to assist in the provision of certain supplies required for the tanning industry&mdash;sulphonated oils and sodium sulphide. Successful results were obtained and the results were conveyed to the industry.  Considerable help was given by the bureau in discussions with the industry in regard to the provision of vegetable tanning materials from available resources. Now, that question of tanning was raised, and that was the answer to it. <Col N="145" /> With regard to the larger question, upon which Deputy Mulcahy, very rightly, laid such stress, the importance of transport, the bureau, from the very start, has been at this problem and it has been the problem in which it was most engaged.  Its biggest expenditure has been in connection with trying to get suitable fuel.  It has been suggested by Deputy Mulcahy that we should use raw wood.  I am not in a position to talk of the technical difficulties. I could find out for the Deputy what the technical difficulties are at the moment, but the information I have at present is that the possibilities of down-draft producers, of the type suitable for use with raw wood or raw turf, require special materials which are not thought to be immediately available.</P>

      <P>I am only saying that that is the information from the bureau, and I do think that this problem has been so much before them that, if there is anything else, it has not come to their notice.  It is quite possible that sometimes things are round about and you do not see them, as somebody has said, but I doubt very much that this possibility has escaped the notice of the bureau.  They are certainly aware of the fact that there are special types of producers, but they think the materials are not immediately available.  I have no personal knowledge of it.  Perhaps the Deputy would suggest anything that he has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be perfectly satisfied if the Taoiseach would simply take a personal interest in inquiring into the possibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that there does not seem to be a way out except by using raw material.  I understand that it is a matter of engineering work, to put the apparatus together, and that there is plenty of skill available for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="146" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It says here that such producers require special materials which are not thought to be readily available at present.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such producers could not be immediately adopted on the scale required without further investigation. It is concluded that to convert a large number of vehicles quickly for use with producers it is better to concentrate on the cross-draft or up-draft types, of which the country has already considerable experience. Sufficient materials are available to manufacture quickly, enough producers for essential purposes.  There may not be immediately in sight enough fuel to supply the number of producers required, but there is probably available more producer fuel than there are now producers to use that fuel.  The question of more fuel is being examined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These were the answers to questions that I asked.  Of course, with regard to the types of fuel used, there is, first of all, anthracite, to the extent to which it is available.  Then there is wood charcoal, and then peat charcoal, and the greater part of our investigations have been pursued with the hope that sufficient quantities of suitable fuel will be obtained from peat.  However, with regard to raw wood and raw turf, as I have said, it does appear to have been before the minds of the bureau and they have been engaged in considering the possibilities of down-draft producers, the type suitable for use with raw wood and raw turf.  They are examining the possibilities of that. However, as the Deputy has raised the matter I shall refer it specially to them and ask what is the position in that regard, and see if there is anything they would like to add to our information on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General Mulcahy also spoke about the general tendency towards monopolies in transport.  I think he will admit that if you have a limited supply of fuel available, it is easier to deal with one or two large concerns than to deal with a host of individuals where there would be no co-ordination. On the other hand, as far as I know, there is no stop on anybody who has <Col N="147" /> got ideas&mdash;and I am sure that people who badly need transport must have some ideas on the matter&mdash;and if any firm is prepared to go ahead on its own and is prepared to produce any type of producer plant that would be satisfactory, they would have a very good market for it.  If they want help or advice from the bureau, well and good, they will get that help and advice, and if the thing should prove to be of sufficient interest for the State to take it up, I can assure the Deputy that any proposition of that type, which is worth developing from the point of view of the State's interest at the moment, would have the sympathetic consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we would certainly give every help. So there is every inducement for such people to go ahead, and if there are people, engineers and others, who have any ideas on the matter, we should be very glad to have their ideas.  If the Deputy is talking about the question of the tendency to have large transport companies, more or less like the railways and so on, that is a general question of transport, but if at the present time he wants to see that the brains and abilities in any engineering plant should be availed of for the manufacture of producers, then I say that if there is any good idea, there will be no hesitation on our part to help such people.</P>

      <P>Well, I have not heard any proposition of that kind, but if such a proposition comes forward it will certainly be sympathetically examined, that is from the point of view of people who would be very glad to get any solution of these problems at the present time, and we shall welcome such ideas from any section of the community, engineers or others, who think that they themselves <Col N="148" /> may not be able to exploit them but think it would be worth while to exploit them, and in the national interest to do so.  In such a case, the Government will approach the matter sympathetically, but the trouble is that very many of these suggestious or ideas, when examined home, are not by any means as sound or promising as they appear at first sight.  I think I have dealt with the various points made by the Deputy.  Perhaps he will remind me if there is anything else in his remarks that he wants me to touch upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take that matter up.  I think I have settled, too, that question about their mandate to think.  Deputy Dillon asked about absolute alcohol.  One of the things I have been anxious about, besides the question of fuel, is the provision of certain essential medical supplies. Deputy Dillon seemed to suggest that there was some lack of absolute alcohol.  I have not heard of it in any case.  It may be true, but I do not think that the bureau would have a great deal of difficulty in indicating the process that would be necessary for that.  I do not know what would have to be done, but I am sure the alcohol factories could turn it out in any quantities we want&mdash;at least up to their capacity.  The Deputy also raised on other occasions here the question of smiths' coal.  Turf charcoal, no doubt, <Col N="149" /> would be excellent if we had it in sufficient quantities.  In regard to the question of turf charcoal, Deputy Mulcahy may think, because the plant is set up in Turraun to turn out, I suppose, about three or four tons a day or roughly 10,000 tons a year, that that is the limit.  That is not so.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would tell him of all sorts of experiments which have been tried with kilns, pits and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the older methods.  He said our ancestors dealt with iron, heating up iron and fabricating it with charcoal of some kind, or some type of fuel, and that we should try that out.  I do not know whether turf charcoal was tried. I suppose coal or wood charcoal is the usual method.  The older methods of producing charcoal&mdash;they are trying them partly in steel kilns and in pits also&mdash;are being examined with a view to trying to produce large quantities as quickly as possible.  Deputy Dillon also went on to the question of the preservation of potatoes, so that they could be used for pig food.  We had that question examined very early. It was found to be fairly expensive on fuel.  The question of having the potatoes in chipped form or flour was examined.  It did not appear at the time that there was sufficient to be gained.  It did not appear that the difference between keeping the potatoes ordinarily during the period and preserving them in that form was sufficient to make it worth while to follow it up.  I admit that if you had a very large surplus and wanted to carry it on from year to year it might be worth while, but I very much doubt whether it would be an economic matter having regard to the price at which they could be made available for those who are engaged on pig raising. However, I have not examined the matter in detail, and we can look into it to see whether, from that point of view, it would be economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes raised the question of manures.  I want to tell him, too, that that matter was brought to my attention at an early stage.  I got most of the material which <Col N="150" /> he read here to-night, and I read it myself.  In fact, earlier than that the matter had been examined by one of the Departments from the point of view of seeing whether it was economic.  At first sight it appears to anybody that it is a pity, seeing how important fertilisers are, to see manures apparently going to waste. The difficulty is that it is going in the form of sludge, and by the time it is made available it would be so expensive to cart it that it would be uneconomic, except for allotments and so on around the centres of population where it was being produced, that is in the neighbourhood of cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I do believe that the whole question should be examined from the point of view of seeing whether, keeping questions of hygiene properly in mind, we could find some method of sanitation by which it could be saved at an earlier stage, or something of that sort. At the present time, if we were just to use the sludge, the scientists tell us that the ultimate product would be of little value and, by the time it was made available for use on the farm, would be too expensive.  I do not like digressing on a Vote like this, but from the agricultural point of view I have discussed the matter with representatives of the Department, with the Minister for Agriculture and others, and the general feeling is that a great deal of waste of manure is taking place on the farms themselves, and that if that waste were avoided you would probably have a greater increase in fertilising material for the land than you would get by any other method at the present time.  By eliminating that waste we would probably get the manures we want more quickly and certainly very much more cheaply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of cost.  It is a question of the price you can get per load.  What you pay for it would go up according to your need of it; if your need were very great you might pay a great deal more.  I have referred the matter not once but a number of times to the Department of Agriculture, and they are having it looked into, but I would say that at the moment it is more a question for the Department of Agriculture than for the bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department of Agriculture wants any help from the bureau in that matter, that help will be forthcoming.  That, I think, is all it is fair to ask of the bureau.  It is a problem immediately for the Department of Agriculture.  One of our difficulties at the present moment is that a number of things which could be done in ordinary peace times cannot be done now because plant is very difficult and expensive to get.  However, I think all that Deputies can do here is to impress upon me, upon the Government or the Minister for Agriculture, that this matter should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why we should be opposed to anything of this kind.  As a matter of fact, in all these things it is often surprising why Deputies do not realise that it is altogether to the interests of the Government to take any suggestions that are made from any side of the House and to work them, if they are workable. The only reason why the Government will not at any particular time take suggestions is because it has some good reason for seeing that the thing would not work.  For example&mdash;I am giving an absurd figure, to illustrate <Col N="152" /> what I mean&mdash;supposing we calculated that the price at which this manure would be available would be £100 a ton, and that it was only equivalent to some good farmyard manure, it is quite obvious that there would be no use in going ahead with a project of that kind.  Or, if we heard that it was as bulky as farmyard manure and that we had to transport it, in the present difficulties of transportation, from Dublin, down the country, at the cost which, at the present time, would have to be paid for transport, and that we were to tell you: &ldquo;Very well, no farmer would buy it; it would not pay him to buy it,&rdquo; it is quite obvious that is sufficient answer, at the moment anyhow, to those who would say: &ldquo;Go out and develop this particular project.&rdquo;  But I would like again to say to the House that, apart altogether from its duty in the public interest, even from the narrowest view you take of it, it is to the interests of the Government to take any suggestions from any side or from anywhere they get them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the House can always be assured that there is an open mind to any suggestion.  The only thing is that when the suggestion is examined home in a way that the Deputy who makes the suggestion may not be able to examine it, and you come to the point at which you are satisfied that the possibilities which appeared to be in it were not in it and that it was going to be too costly, then we say we cannot do it.  There may be a difference of opinion at certain stages as to whether a thing, even though it was costly, was worth it for some higher interest; it may be, for instance, that for a social interest of one kind or another it may be regarded as worth while to face the cost.  There may be a difference of opinion on that point.  Well and good, that is legitimate and understandable. But the one thing I do want to make the House realise is that any suggestions as to how the difficulties of the present emergency could be met, naturally, would be received by the Government with an open mind.  I think the same thing is true of the Government officials&mdash;of the State servants everywhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> I think I have gone over all the things I wanted to deal with.  Deputy Norton spoke about the use of materials, such as coal, and he spoke about Carlow.  I am not able to speak about the position at present in Carlow but, from Deputy Norton, I understood that the Slievardagh Company have made borings in that area. I feel pretty certain that if these borings indicate that there are valuable seams there, that it is worth while, and that they are able to get whatever equipment may be necessary, it will be done.  Personally, I am always a bit dissatisfied whenever there are delays.  One naturally likes to hurry things up and to get them done quickly, but when you examine the reasons for the delay one often has to admit that it was no fault of the people who were at work; difficulties arose that had to be overcome.</P>
    <P>I do not think the wool has been pulled over my eyes, but in a lot of these things when I have been impatient at the start I find, when I examine them and ask for the reasons, I have to say that I would be unreasonable if I did not accept the explanations. They seemed to me to be reasonable.  There were good grounds why the delay was incurred and how it became necessary, and so on.  When we want solutions of things, we are all naturally impatient about delay but if we are not to take up the position of being quite unreasonable, when explanations of the delay are given, we have to accept them.  I am quite certain that if there have been any delays in this matter that appear unreasonable, if they are examined home, we will find there are reasonable explanations for them.</P>
    <P>I think I have met the points that have been raised.  I am very glad to see the spirit in which the House has approached this Estimate.  I am sure the members of the bureau will work with all the greater energy when they find that their work is appreciated and they will realise that any suggestions that have been made here this evening are made to them by people who have a public responsibility to try to do the best for the community in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate on the last occasion that this motion was under discussion I asked if there was any hope that the policy of despair and inaction, manifest at the present time in widespread unemployment and in mass emigration from this country, would be changed.  I have before me a statement that appeared in a journal published in the city in 1929.  It is portion of an article contributed by Mr. Eamon de Valera to a journal called <i>Honesty.</i>  It deals with this question in a very striking and illuminating manner.  I would like to quote one paragraph from this statement before I conclude:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have repeatedly said and I wish to reiterate here that I believe it to be the duty of a modern State to provide either work or subsistence for every citizen.  This, in my judgement, is not merely a dictate of charity but an imperative requirement of justice.  Men have a natural right to live of which no law or social convention can justly deprive them.  Normally, this right is exercised through labour, but when, as is true in Ireland to-day, the economic and social system maintained by the community deprives individuals of the power to exercise their rights in the normal way, the <Col N="155" /> community is under an obligation of justice to provide the victims of this system with the means of subsistence.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think a more eloquent condemnation of the system and conditions that prevail at the present time could be found than is found in that passage because, if it was true then, it is quite obviously true now.  The statement was then made by somebody who was not in the position that the Head of the Government is in now.  I recall that statement and I consider it is the most striking indictment of the policy that the Government has pursued that I could find.</P>
      <P>There is nothing further I desire to say except again to express my own condemnation of this system of inaction &mdash;despairing inaction, the Taoiseach called it on the same occasion&mdash;that we see in the country to-day, and ask that now, in this very important and critical juncture of the history of the country, we should have some appreciation of the position, some pronouncement here that that position is going to be met by a forward and progressive policy in the near future. Whether this motion achieves that purpose or not, there should be no mistake about it that the masses of our people are thinking in terms of that kind, and will not be slow to express their condemnation of any continuation of the inaction that has gone on in this country over the last 20 years.  I leave the matter there.  I do not intend to say anything further, in view of the fact that the time allowed for the discussion of the motion is limited.  I feel that I ought to conclude on that note.</P>

      <P>This motion is framed to read that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" />&ldquo;The State should direct its policy towards securing that the citizens may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, and Dáil Eireann requests the Government immediately to formulate proposals for absorbing into useful employment at adequate remuneration all adult citizens able and willing to follow useful occupations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have so far addressed themselves, so far as I can see, to the aspect of that resolution which would place upon the Government the obligation to provide regular employment at fair rates of wages, under reasonable conditions acceptable to free men, permanently.  I want to say quite deliberately that I believe everybody in the House subscribes to the desirability of doing that.  I do not know how to do it.  I do not know how to get for every member of a civilised Christian community 48 hours' work in the week, at a fair rate of pay under reasonable conditions acceptable to free and honourable men, without periods of unemployment.  I do not for a moment wish anybody to imagine that I am happy about that, or that I think that is a normal state of affairs that ought for ever to subsist.</P>
    <P>My difficulty is that I cannot find anybody who will tell me how to avoid it.  I say, and I think most Deputies in this House will say that if anybody will produce a plan which will get for everybody 48 hours' work a week, at a fair rate of wages and on conditions which are acceptable to free Christian men and women, I do not care what cost or what adjustment it involves in the social conditions of our people, I am prepared to go out and campaign for it.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that it is the supreme <i>desideratum</i> in the temporal sphere.  But my difficulty is to find somebody to tell me how to do it, and I am still waiting.  I have read libraries of books on the subject. I have read the publications of the International Labour Office, I have read the works of Keynes and of other writers, and yet I can find nobody who will tell me how free men, living freely together, can produce this eminently desirable ideal.  I have heard with <Col N="157" /> consternation some uninformed fellow-citizens compare the Russian, and even the German, system favourably with our system.  I grant that, at least, in those countries they have no unemployed. We can have that here to-morrow.  By establishing the Nazi system, we can employ every man or woman not 48 hours a week but 72 hours a week, and we can make him do that under the penalty of death, or worse than death, at whatever wage we want to impose on him.  Nero and Caligula were able to do that, they divided the Roman nation into Patricians and slaves.  The slaves worked when they were told to work and under whatever conditions they were told to work under, and if they did not willingly accept that they died.</P>
    <P>I agree that the resources of the State should be used in times when free enterprise and normal business are unable to employ all the persons who are ready and willing to work. State enterprise should be stimulated to provide labour for those people.  I agree that, during periods when there is an abundance of employment in ordinary commercial pursuits, the Government should be busy formulating schemes, which shall be laid to one side, in order that all the preliminary work will have been completed when the time of unemployment and crisis comes and when work on those schemes can be started without delay.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that our Government has fallen short of its duty in that matter.  I think it has not prepared its schemes far enough ahead with the result that we have had intense and acute unemployment in our midst.  Our Government has some ephemeral kind of idea of what it would wish to do in order to provide employment for everybody, but when it comes down to the task of putting those men to work, it finds that the preliminary work in connection with engineering, the acquisition of property and the investigation of title, which may be very necessary before big schemes can be put under way has yet to be done.  It may take nine or 12 months to get this preliminary work completed before you can get men employed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> Bearing all this in mind, Deputies ought not to forget that public works will very often not employ the most deserving among the unemployed. Take the case of a man who has held a responsible clerical position in a mercantile firm, earning £6 or £7 a week. He has his children at school, he has a nice little home and is accustomed to a certain standard of living.  That man loses his job.  He has put something by for the rainy day, but when he comes to the end of his resources he is an unemployed man.  What good is there in telling him that you will provide him with an agricultural wage if he goes out as a labourer on a drainage scheme in the County Westmeath?  It is only adding insult to injury.  The man would go with a heart and a half if only he could handle a shovel or a pick, but he knows perfectly well that if he attempted it he would certainly collapse, and would then leave himself open to the jeer and the gibe that he did not want to do work.  If you are a shop assistant you cannot change yourself into a manual labourer overnight. Neither can you change a clerical worker of 50 years into a ditch digger in competition with young men of 22 and 23 who have been brought up to that extremely technical craft.  Anybody who has not swung a pick cannot realise how utterly exhausting that operation can be if you do not know how to swing it.  People in sedentary occupations marvel at the way in which labourers in the field are able to keep going for eight hours a day and more, because they do not realise the skill of those manual labourers.</P>
    <P>If they were to undertake that work, not having the necessary skill, it would kill them in an hour.  People not trained to manual labour, working beside a country man in the fields, find that they very soon have to lay down the instruments they are using because of sore wrists or a breaking back, the reason being that they had been using the instruments unskilfully.  The trained labourer is able to use the instruments without bringing on himself any pains or aches because of his superior skill.  The answer of the Labour Party to that is that their scheme of public works is going to <Col N="159" /> absorb most of the unemployed.  I do not know how to meet that problem, not because I do not want to meet it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Murphy that it should be a first charge on our national income that all those men who are willing and anxious to work should be given work.  I think it is right to fix the criterion that if they will not work they are deserving of very little sympathy, but it is tragic and cruel to say that the criterion should be fixed by offering a clerk the position of a ditch digger, or, <i>vice versa,</i> offering to the ditch digger the occupation of a clerk and, because the ditch digger cannot fill up his ledger with neat figures and keep his page immaculate and unstained, he is to be stigmatised as a man who does not want to work, or because the clerk is obliged to drop his tools after an hour, as physical exhaustion prevents him carrying on, he is to be stigmatised as too lazy to work.  If that stigma is not to be attached to them, how are we to find for them the work they are able to do?</P>
    <P>Every man, no matter how simple his task, is in some degree a skilled worker and is entitled, I think, to ask this: that either he should be given work analogous to the skill which he has acquired, or that he will be maintained while he is in training for alternative work of a kind which is available.  In Great Britain that is being done, but there you have a vast industrial population.  There it may be said, looking at it from the cold-blooded economic point of view, that it is economically worth while to set up such training centres in the large industrial areas so that individuals may be fitted for some calling.  Is that type of thing practical in our community? If it is let us do it, but I wonder is it?</P>
    <P>I confess, with regard to this problem of unemployment, that I know of no effective means of remedying it except by seeking as best we can by political action to make the prosperity, the productivity and the capacity to produce wealth of our people as great as we can make it.  That is the most effective contribution to the abolition of unemployment that we could make.  I <Col N="160" /> believe that the only way we can make an effective contribution in the present state of our community to the abolition of unemployment is to ensure that every acre of our land will be as productive and as wealth-producing for its owner as it is possible to make it.  I repeat what I have stated a thousand times in this country, that the only natural resource of consequence that we have is 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  If we can make the produce of the 12,000,000 acres profitable, then all the community will prosper and the problem of unemployment will reach its lowest degree of gravity.  If the 12,000,000 acres are rendered unprofitable, I know of no device, financial or otherwise, which will rescue the bulk of the wage-earners from the unemployment that must ensue on the principal natural resource ceasing to produce true wealth.</P>
    <P>The kind of thing that I think makes unemployment inevitable is when our own Government goes to the owners of land and says to them: &ldquo;You must deliver the barley that you sweated to grow to Arthur Guinness, Son and Company, for 35/-,&rdquo; while that brewery is paying 70/- in Great Britain.  The kind of thing that produces unemployment is when the farmers who produce grain on the land are obliged to sell it to the principal consumer in this country for 30/-, as they did last year, while that consumer was paying 70/- in Great Britain.  The result is that the wealth from barley-growing, which should have gone into the pockets of our farmers and enabled them to purchase the things the making of which would have provided employment for large numbers of our people, went to the shareholders of Messrs.  Guinness, whose shares appreciated from 80/- to 115/-. Why?  Because they had in their coffers £1,000,000&mdash;money that rightly belonged to the farmers of this country. Speculators on the stock exchanges of the world were prepared to pay 115/- for shares that were selling for 80/- six months ago.  They were paying that extra 35/- a share in order to have their portion of the plunder that was extracted from the Irish farmers. By paying it they got their share of the purchasing power which <Col N="161" /> should have been in the hands of Irish farmers and which would have meant considerable employment among our people.</P>
    <P>The second contributing factor to unemployment is the curse of tariffs, that loathsome curse which has descended upon mankind through the damnable doctrine of economic self-sufficiency. The blocking of the channels of free trade between nation and nation has resulted in a diabolical competition between communities to starve one another out, and that progress of starvation has been demonstrated to us in our community in the persons of the unemployed.  The cursed and damnable doctrine of economic self-sufficiency has produced poverty and unemployment in Ireland, just as the same cursed doctrine produced 3,000,000 of unemployed in England, and 10,000,000 of unemployed in America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>An abundance which was denied to humanity.  The abundance was there, but our people were forbidden to get any of it by the tariffs that were imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government, with the collaboration of the Irish Labour Party.  The cursed doctrine of economic self-sufficiency is one of the most potent sources of unemployment and pauperism in this country, just as it is in every other country that has adopted it.  There was abundance clamouring at our gates to come in&mdash;materials which our people could have enjoyed, or could have used their skilled labour upon to export to others in a finished condition&mdash;but we were prohibited from using them because of the tariffs and quotas imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government, with the collaboration and assistance of the Irish Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the unemployed men in this country were standing idle because the farmers had no money wherewith to buy the clothes and boots that they wanted to buy, and that they were prepared to pay the unemployed to make for them.  Why did they not have the <Col N="162" /> money?  Because they would not be allowed to make a profit on the pigs they were rearing.  The food they could have bought in and fed to pigs preparatory to exporting them to Great Britain was withheld from them, and they were constrained to pay increased prices for the raw materials of the pig industry, with the result that the production of pigs was made uneconomic; and the farmer who would have reared four pigs and earned on them sufficient to pay for a few pairs of boots, was denied the right to do so, and he could not get the boots.  He had to put on wooden clogs, and the operatives who wanted and were quite willing to work, and had the skill to make the boots, had to remain idle. The people who created that situation are the Fianna Fáil Government and the Irish Labour Party who collaborated with them in order to make the production of the four pigs unprofitable. Is that true or false?</P>

    <P>Now I want to come to that.

They wanted some good men whose word they could believe and ultimately they reached a stage <Col N="166" /> of such utter bewilderment that they wanted some group of men whose voice alone would prevail because they had come to the conclusion that no public argument was genuine, that it was all the merest political chicanery.</P>

I see signs and tokens on some of the Labour platforms&mdash;I do not refer to them all&mdash;where it is suggested that if the Labour Party is returned, all these supply difficulties will vanish overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the situation as we find it and is that not the truth?  If thousands and thousands of our people had not gone to England in the last two years, the unemployment problem of this country would be a great deal worse than it is at present.  Is not that true?  Everybody knows it.  I believe that you ought to tell the people that perfectly plainly, instead of trying to lead them up the garden path and telling them that by putting in some other political Party, that political Party would solve the problem.  I am still waiting to hear from the Labour Party what their proposals are for the solution of that problem.  I put it to the Labour Party that two things should be done.  The first is that economic self-sufficiency should be abolished.  That would help to solve the problem, but what is the Labour Party's plan for giving every man a 48-hour week on terms that would be acceptable to an ordinary man?  I have repeatedly asked how that is going to be done, but nobody can tell me.  Poor as my little suggestions are, at least I have the spunk to get up and make them.  The Labour Party tell us that the theories or suggestions of everybody else are false, but they will not tell us what they themselves will do.  If their policy is effective and if it can be put into effect, well and good, but I have not heard any such policy from them. I have no policy myself.  All I can suggest are measures that will alleviate the problem.  I cannot tell them that the problem will be abolished, because I do not believe it will.  I have been waiting to hear the Labour scheme for abolishing unemployment, but I have not heard it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>What about your own scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My scheme is the abolition of economic self-sufficiency and the preparation, in due time, of schemes of public works which would afford employment only to a very limited number of unemployed.  The general problem is there, and the special emergency problem is there, but they are two separate things.  On <Col N="169" /> the general problem I suggest that the abolition of economic self-sufficiency and the preparation in due time of Government schemes of public works will do a lot to alleviate the problem in time; but on the special emergency problem I do not believe that any of the Parties can provide adequate employment for all our people.  I do not believe there is a single member sitting on the Labour Party Benches who can secure that.  You all know yourselves that you cannot do it, and you should not be stumping the country telling the people that you could solve the problem if only you could put de Valera out, because you know in your hearts that you could not.  Now I come to the second part of this question.  The motion says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann requests the Government immediately to formulate proposals for absorbing into useful employment at adequate remuneration all adult citizens able and willing to follow useful occupations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to say quite deliberately that I do not believe that any scheme that can be evolved, under our present circumstances, is going to provide adequate remuneration for all the working men of this country unless notice is taken of the general rate of wages which these men receive, and of their family responsibilities.  I do not think there is any basis of equity for paying men doing similar work a certain rate of wages, without taking into account the fact that one man is married and has six or seven children, while the other man is single and has no family responsibilities at all.  I hold that there is no basis in equity for paying the same rate of wages there, and I believe that a completely new departure must be made in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in certain countries, notably France and Belgium, an attempt has been made, by a pooling system between manufacturers in certain groups, to ensure that unmarried employees, doing a certain class of work, will receive one rate of wages, while married employees will receive another rate of wages based on the numbers of their families.  In countries where you have large industrial groups <Col N="170" /> such a system may be practicable and workable, but I do not believe that it would be practicable in our country.  I believe that in the question of rendering equitable the remuneration that employees receive, regard should be had to the family responsibilities; that men doing similar work, with due regard to their similarity and skill should receive the same rate of wages, but that, side by side with that system of wage regulation, there should be a national system of family allowances, charged on the national income, to which all sections of the community will jointly contribute through the medium of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to children's allowances?  I want to make sure about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think it is a matter of adaptation to the particular circumstances of the country as to whether it should be the first child or children after the first child.  I want to emphasise that that matter is one which should be fixed by the payment from funds derived from taxation. There is a certain amount of unpopularity in the raising of the revenue necessary to meet all these expenses for benefits of one kind or another, but it is absolutely certain that no greater injury can be done to a community than to lead them on to the slippery slope of seeking to take out of the national income more than production and wealth-making is putting in.  In handling the finances of the State one can, by manipulation over a strictly limited time, appear to extract more from the national income than the community is putting in, but the longer that policy is pursued by the community, the greater will be the disaster when the illusion ceases to blind the eyes of the community and the consequences of living beyond their means for a protracted time are brought home to them.  I do not want to expatiate upon this, because examples are generally to be found in the classic descriptions of the consequences of inflation, but the fact that it is unnecessary to go into them in detail in a deliberative Assembly of this kind does not mean that it may not be necessary to <Col N="171" /> explain them to the people at the cross-roads of the country.  Therefore, whatever family allowances are decided upon should be raised only by taxation, whatever that taxation may be.  Then there should be paid to the mother of every family, in respect of each child, an allowance, in my judgment, of 5/- per week.</P>
      <P>While a good deal can be said for restricting this system of allowances to wage-earners exclusively, I think that in this country it would be a great mistake, because anyone studying the lists of unemployed will find that a very large number of men on them in this country are small farmers whose farms are uneconomic and who cannot live without employment.  This whole question then of the small rural land owner so complicates our position that, in my judgment, in order to come to the aid of the wage-earner in this country it would be necessary to extend the family allowance to every small land owner in this country.  That being true, I think the administrative difficulties of discriminating between the classes entitled to this benefit and those who should be excluded from it far outweigh the objections to making the family allowance available to every citizen in this State without any regard to what his income may be at all&mdash; making it a common allowance available to all.  By doing that we not only avoid the administrative difficulties of segregating the classes to whom we wish to give it, but we also avoid the means test, that bureaucratic investigation of every family's internal arrangements, and that interference in the family life occasioned by an elaborate inquiry into all the sources of income to which that family may have access.</P>

      <P>That is because I submit that adequate remuneration is not available to any person unless due regard is had to family responsibilities. I have made the case that it is impossible for the employers in this country to adopt such a system as operated in France and Belgium, where the employers undertook to make the discrimination and give a family wage. Here we are so circumstanced that we can only hope to pay an equal wage for equal work, and it is the State's responsibility to differentiate between what is an adequate wage for an unmarried man and what is adequate remuneration for a man with family responsibilities.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, I am also anticipating a general election, and the Standing Orders of this House provide that all motions on the Paper vanish when the general election comes. When I come back here after the general election, I shall put down my motion on family allowances again, but God knows when we will get Private Members' time.  I shall return to this House as a private Deputy, as an independent Deputy, and I shall have to wait my turn.  I am not anticipating the motion.  I am merely noting that the Labour Party seems to have overlooked this important reform in the motion they put down months ago, although they do not fail to include it in their election programme.  Incidentally, I may say to my erstwhile and respected colleagues of the Fine Gael Party that, although they proved themselves very able critics of this proposal when I first mooted it in Dáil Eireann, I note with satisfaction that they have included it in their election programme, and I have observed that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, although somewhat indignant when I first mentioned this matter, are now quite angry and upset if it is suggested that they are not as enthusiastic about it as I am.  That is very gratifying. I have no doubt, Sir, that the position is verdant in your memory; at <Col N="173" /> the time, I was a bird alone, but now I feel like one amongst a crowd of jackdaws.</P>

In asking the House to say that this reform is necessary in order to secure adequate remuneration for every employed person in this country, I may say that this will be my swan song on the subject of family allowances.  Having converted the whole of Dáil Eireann to the principle of family allowances I think I may pass on to further reforms, while I leave those who lag behind to the somewhat dull and tedious work of giving practical application to the lead I provided 18 months ago.</P>

I am astonished that they should bring before the House a proposal for adequate remuneration, without dwelling on that positive feature of the proposal which requires <Col N="174" /> adequate remuneration not only for the single man but for the family man. I am astonished that they should have allowed themselves to take up a position in this House which might well be interpreted to be that in their opinion a wage which is adequate for an unmarried man without any family responsibility is, therefore, adequate for a married man with children.  I do not think it is, and I should be glad to hear from them what they propose. Do they think that we should have a means test in connection with the family allowance scheme?</P>

Nevertheless, it is an essential part of any scheme which the Government may produce in answer to this request of the Labour Party.  I have made my proposal, and I have presented my dilemma to the Labour Party.  What is their scheme?  I want to hear it.  I want to help, in so far as in me lies, to give effect to any scheme which will provide 48 hours' work at a fair wage for every man and woman in this country willing to work under conditions acceptable to honourable Christian people.  I have not heard a scheme from the Labour Party which will fulfil those requirements.  I reject the solutions which have been put in practice by the Nazis in Germany and the Communists in Russia.

      <P>When we heard Deputy Dillon say he did not know, I am perfectly sure that <Col N="176" /> we all began to smell a rat.  It was a very useful confession.  We are rather inclined to think that there are a good many things that Deputy Dillon did not know, but we did not know that there was one thing that Deputy Dillon knew that he did not know.  He had no solution for the unemployment problem, nothing to bring happiness and prosperity of unlimited character to this country, and then he turned over to curse, to loathe, to use the strongest possible language of repudiation and condemnation of a system which, he said, was already pauperising, starving and lacerating this country.  If one-quarter of what Deputy Dillon said about this cursed system of self-sufficiency were true, then it would be sufficient to explain a very large amount of the evil which is visible here.  If there were one-fiftieth of the virtue that he claimed in a complete free trade system, which he would be in a position, no doubt, to impose upon all men, then the introduction of that free trade system and the abolition of that cursed system of self-sufficiency ought to have been sufficient to make a new heaven and a new earth here.  But, when he had torn passion into threads, when he had exhausted himself with his own vehemence, he turns around and says that if this cursed system of self-sufficiency were removed, and if this heaven-sent system of free trade were introduced, then a quite negligible proportion of the total number of those now unemployed might be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, not almost abolished &mdash;it must be completely abolished because, if the system which exists is so damnable&mdash;I want to use the sort of language, the sort of enthusiasm which the Deputy put into the matter&mdash;and the new system was so heavenly, then surely the wealth, the productivity, the livelihood-breeding capacity of this country must have gone up right into the skies and there would be no excuse for anybody being poor, for anyone not having a livelihood, for anybody not having a good standard of living <Col N="177" /> in a country from which that evil had been removed and to which that blessing had come.  I must say that that mountain produced a very little mouse but not a mouse any smaller than we would expect that mountain to produce. If he does not know, however, how to remove unemployment, it does not necessarily follow that other people do.  He said that he had read all the books in the world in relation to it and had not found the solution. I think it would be rather a good idea if he were to call together all those eminent authors&mdash;and, no doubt, the editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> would be eager to be invited&mdash;and explain to them the extraordinary potency of removing self-sufficiency and the introduction of free trade.  My recollection is that people have been unhappy, people have been poor, people have been unemployed in this country under both free trade and the other.  Each of them in turn has been the servant of the system which has produced unnecessary unemployment and suffering, but I do not believe that in the abolition of either of them or the bringing in of either of them as such you will find anything in the nature of a complete solution.</P>

      <P>There was a series of small points which the two official sponsors of this motion introduced which I would rather clear out of the way before we get down to the matter at issue.  There was a general tendency to exaggerate the evil of the present position for the purpose of debate: People were afraid to marry; malnutrition was carrying a scourge of death through the country; the St. Vincent de Paul Society was dragged in as a sort of testimony to an existing condition.  The actual position at the <Col N="178" /> present moment, while it is not by any means good, is not, in relation to previous and other times, relatively bad. Anyone who knows the rural districts and the other districts will find it very difficult to say that at the present moment the indication that is given by the vital statistics is wrong.  Deputy Keyes says people are afraid to marry; afraid to have children; the death rate is rising; at any rate, malnutrition must be producing its results.  There are such things as vital statistics. They are published and they are provided free for all the members of the House.  The vital statistics contained in the last copy, the September number, of the <i>Irish Trade Journal,</i> show that the marriage rate is rising rapidly at the present moment, that the birth rate, apparently, is rising even more rapidly, and that the death rate is lower than it has been for a long time.</P>

What I am concerned with is that these vital statistics&mdash;births, marriages and deaths&mdash;are the general indicator. The general indicator indicates that at the present moment, and progressively, apparently, the health of the country on the whole is promising. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for the Land Commission to identify lands held in a particular parish.  The question does not specify whether the ecclesiastical or the civil parish of Bekan is referred to.  So far as can be readily ascertained, the Land Commission have in hands for division in the townland of Tawnagh in the Bekan district four small vacated holdings of migrants, comprising 37a. 3r. Op., and a resumed holding in the townland of Kilknock, comprising 8a. 3r. 20p., making a total of 46a. 2r. 20p. with a total Poor Law Valuation of £20 11s. 0d. Schemes for the division of these lands have not yet been completed and it is not possible at present to state when the lands will be divided.</P>

      <P>In County Mayo, the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board have acquired and divided a total area of approximately 317,000 acres of untenanted land, of which 65,000 acres were acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-39, and 252,000 acres were on estates acquired by the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners under Acts prior to the Land Act of 1923.</P>
      <P>There are in hands for division lands acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-39, to the extent of about 11,750 acres (together with some undivided shares of commonage), of which only about 4,500 acres are arable.  Scarcely any arable land remains on hands in Congested Districts Board estates, but there is a considerable residue of mountain and turbary of little value and difficult to dispose of finally.  The precise area of such land is not readily available.</P>
