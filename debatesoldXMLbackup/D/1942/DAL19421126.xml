      <P>Arrangements have been made with the Irish Red Cross Society for the grant of coupon-equivalent licences by my Department to enable uniforms to be supplied to members of the society without their having to surrender their own clothes coupons.  Surgical bandaging material and surgical dressings are excluded from the operation of the Clothes Rationing Orders and no licences are required for their purchase. Where other bandaging materials (e.g., calico) have to be purchased, coupon-equivalent licences may be applied for.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if it is his intention under Emergency Powers Order 166&mdash;Wages Standard Rate Order&mdash;to establish for any or every industry or trade, basic rates of wages of the nature or kind which were contemplated to be established under Section 50 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936; and, if so, if it is <Col N="2482" /> the intention of the Minister to regard the standard rate determined by such Order as being applicable to every firm in the industry or trade in the area in respect of which such Order is made; and if he will permit the operatives through their unions to enforce, under the Trades Disputes Act of 1906, the rates established by such Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for Wages (Standard Rate) Orders may be made either by a licensed trade union or by a body representative of workers of a particular class in a particular district. It may not be made save on such application.  A Wages (Standard Rate) Order may apply to all workers of a particular class named in the Order, or to such workers when employed in stated areas or by named employers. When such an Order is made the employers concerned are permitted to pay the rates prescribed in the Order, and trade unions may take action under the Trades Disputes Act for their enforcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>If one firm or if workers in one firm make application and succeed in getting it granted, will that apply to all similar workers in similar trades in the area?  Have they to make separate applications?  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I wish to encourage, and I have been trying to encourage, applications of a general nature, but, in so far as the Order stands at present, it can only apply to workers of whom it can be said that those who applied for the Order were representative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Bonus Orders are different.  The purpose of a Standard Rate Order is to have a standard rate fixed for an occupation, and once that standard rate is fixed an employer can pay or a worker take action to enforce that standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <P>If you set up an inter-Departmental committee of this character and it reports specially to the Minister, the form of the report may not be regarded as one that should be published.  It will all depend on the character of the report.  If such reports are intended for publication, and the names of individuals are mentioned, you are not going to get the same sort of information that you would get in the case of a confidential report.  I do not know what the particular character of this report will be, but I think it would be very unwise to establish the precedent that if you ask for a report from an inter-Departmental committee, it should necessarily be published.

Naturally it was assumed that that inter-Departmental report would be one in which the facts were collected.  It was anticipated that the report would be one simply bearing on the facts.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is a hardy annual, which is generally introduced about this time of the year. This year's Bill is slightly shorter than usual.  It is necessary that it be enacted before the end of the calendar year.  The Bill proposes to continue for a further year the statutes set out in Parts I and II of the Schedule.  The Schedule differs from the Schedule in last year's Act in the following respects:&mdash;The Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, are omitted, as they have been repealed by the Public Assistance Act, 1939, which is now in force.  Again, a new Act appears in Part II of the Schedule, namely, the Local Government Act, 1941.  Section 65 of this Act, which expires on the 31st December, 1942, relates to temporary borrowing by local authorities for current expenditure, and it is desired to continue it for a further period, pending consideration of a comprehensive Bill dealing with borrowing by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Schedule differs from the 1941 Schedule in these respects only, and as it is necessary to effect every possible <Col N="2495" /> economy in the use of paper, the customary explanatory memorandum has not been circulated to all Deputies. Of the eight Acts appearing in the Schedule, provision has already been made for the repeal of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, when the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939, comes into operation.  It may not be possible, however, owing to the emergency, to give effect to the 1939 Act before the 1st January next, and it is necessary to continue the 1925 Act for a further period.</P>
    <P>A Rent Restrictions Bill is at present being prepared, and the Minister for Justice hopes to introduce it as soon as possible.  It will not be enacted before the end of this year, and in the meantime it is necessary to continue for a further period the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  The position regarding the remaining Acts is being reviewed, to consider whether legislation could be introduced to give permanence to them in the form of amended Acts, but any such legislation is thought not to be feasible at present.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to continue certain Acts which are regarded as either of a temporary nature or as dealing with matters of duration in respect of which it is not possible to produce some amending legislation.  I have not had time to look up some of these hoary Acts&mdash;the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868 or the Corrupt Practices Commission Expenses Act, 1869&mdash;but I observe from the memorandum issued in connection with this Bill that they are being continued pending revision of the whole law relating to election petitions. In that connection, I would like to refer to one or two matters governing the question of elections which, I think, are not dealt with in the Corrupt Practices Commission Expenses Act, 1869.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our whole legislation in respect of elections is rather archaic.  There is need for the application of modern thought to the manner in which elections should be carried out and the responsibility of the State to ensure that they are conducted in a manner which shows efficiency and good citizenship. The Electoral Act takes no note of parties, and the underlying assumption is that each citizen is invited to vote.  Parliamentary Parties think it wise and advantageous to the electors to notify them of their number on the register and where they are entitled to vote.  There are elections only every four or five years, and if people are likely to move between one election and another, it is obviously an advantage to the elector to know his number on the register and where he is entitled to vote.  That seems to me to be no part of the job of a Parliamentary Party, because Parliamentary Parties are not provided for in the Electoral Acts at all, and if there were no Parliamentary Parties&mdash;if we could <Col N="2497" /> imagine such a concept of life&mdash;there would be no one to do that kind of job. Of course, the Taoiseach, as a member of a political Party, does it or assents to its being done, and is anxious that it should be done.  No doubt, in any constituency, it is regarded as an important function in regard to an election.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Tánaiste that the returning officer should have placed on him the responsibility of notifying each elector as to his number on the register and the particular polling booth in which he is entitled to vote. That is not work which brings any great advantage to a political Party. If it is not done, it may well bring disadvantages to a political Party, as the underlying assumption of that assistance to the elector is that he will be thankful to the Party that notifies him of his rights in this respect.  I suggest to the Tánaiste that serious consideration should be given to the question of putting the obligation on the returning officer to notify the elector of his number and polling booth.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that might be dealt with in this connection.  The whole method of providing transport during elections is of very considerable importance.  We have experience of what has happened here.</P>

      <P>We are all different citizens and I have no interest in some of the Acts.  If the Minister is going to consider the scope of these Acts, he should give consideration to the question of putting the obligation on the returning officer to provide transport for voters in outlying areas. In other words, we believe that, as citizenship entails the exercise of the franchise, it should not be the job of a political Party, but the job of the State, to provide transport, as it provides returning officers, poll clerks and schoolhouses or other buildings in <Col N="2500" /> which votes can be recorded.  We would considerably improve the whole method of voting if we were to do these simple things, which would not involve any wasteful type of national expenditure.  This work is at present done by political Parties in a haphazard way and in a way which leaves a political Party or candidate open to a possible charge of corruption, because the candidate with the cheques can, obviously, spend more than the Party which has not the cheques.  The Minister, in examining corrupt practices in connection with elections, should consider the making of these phases of election activity a charge on State funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  Nobody, except perhaps a rapacious landlord, can pretend to be satisfied with the present position in respect of the Increase of Rent Act.  The whole Act is completely out of date.  It was passed in 1923 and even that Act was an amendment of an earlier Act.  The restrictions in respect of rent do not apply to houses built within the past 25 years.  The only houses caught by this Act are those built before World War No. 1.  Potential tenants of houses can be mulcted in any way landlords like.  It may be asked: &ldquo;Why do they take the houses?&rdquo;  When there is a shortage of goods or services or shelter, people are prepared to pay prices which they should not, in conscience, be required to pay.  They pay those prices only because of the scarcity. We should have a new code in respect of rent-restriction.  The Government has had a report on this subject for a considerable time.  This report represented the labours of a commission for five years and something should be done to expedite the <Col N="2501" /> introduction of a new rent-restriction Bill which would ensure to each tenant &mdash;not merely the tenant in occupation before world war No. 1 but tenants who have taken up residence since then or who are occupying newly-built houses or about to occupy houses being built to-day&mdash;sufficient protection.  The Minister should, as a member of the Cabinet, exercise his influence to secure that there will be no further delay in introducing an amending Bill. It is long overdue and, because of the delay, many people are being forced to pay rents which are exorbitant owing to the famine for houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely disagree with Deputy Norton in his remarks about the Electoral Act.  One of the great failings of democracy is the tendency to spoon-feeding electors. This spoon-feeding has proceeded to an undesirable degree.  It should not be the duty of a returning officer to notify an elector of his number.  If an elector will not take the trouble to ascertain what his number is, he is not of much service to the community.  As regards transport, I think that it would be a good thing if it were made clear that no transport would be provided at general elections.  So far as I know the law, it is illegal to provide transport so as to bring voters to the polling booths, but the law has never been enforced in that respect.  It has been recognised that, so long as the candidate himself does not hire the car but leaves that to somebody else, he is quite safe.  If there is to be any conception of citizenship in the country, I suggest to the Minister that he should not go far along the road indicated by Deputy Norton.  The farther away we keep from inducing people, by this sort of spoon-feeding, to do what they should have sufficient citizenship to do for themselves, the better.  A lot can be said for the system of compulsory voting, which obtains in other countries.  I would not fine a person for failing to vote, as is done in other countries.  If a person did not choose to exercise the franchise, and was without sufficient excuse, such as ill-health, for his failure.  I would deprive him of the franchise for a period of ten years.</P>

      <P>Last year, when this Bill was before the House, I protested against the inclusion of the Rent Restrictions Act.  I thought that, during the past 12 months, the Minister would have seen fit to introduce an amending Bill.  He has not done so. The original Act was passed in the year 1923.  The only serious amendments to that Act were made by the Act of 1926, though a few minor amendments were made in later Acts. Since 1926, there have been decisions by the courts which have inflicted, and are inflicting, very great hardships on both landlord and tenant.  That is common case with everybody who has investigated the matter.  These hardships have existed for a great number of years.  I am not so much concerned with future legislation, as envisaged in this explanatory note which has been sent around, as I am with the necessity for tackling the situation which has arisen as a result of these various decisions.  I do not intend to go into that in detail.  These matters fall under, at least, a dozen headings and they continue to cause great hardship.  I was very disappointed during the past year that there was not an amending Bill dealing with this code.  A very short measure would have been sufficient to deal with the points to which I am referring and of which the Minister is probably aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Norton as to transport in connection with elections, I am not in agreement with his view.  It is well that citizens should do everything possible themselves to exercise their rights and duties as citizens.  They should vote at Parliamentary elections without being fetched to the booths.  I agree with what Deputy Linehan has said.  I should be in favour of bringing some pressure to bear on the public with a view to inducing them to carry out their duty and vote at elections.  It is deplorable that, in some cases, a quota and, in other cases, a quota and a half of electors have abstained from voting.  That does not seem to be right.  Anything which would disabuse the public mind of the idea that electors should be brought to the poll in motor cars would be a good thing. <Col N="2503" /> I should like to see various other reforms, including the abolition of canvassing, if possible.  A candidate has already sufficient ways of placing his views before the public.</P>
    <P>In this country particularly, owing to the circumstances here with the system of proportional representation, I think we should try to get away as much as possible from the old idea and try to make the citizens think out these things for themselves and force them to do these things for themselves. I do not agree with Deputy Norton in his contention that greater facilities should be given to bring people to the polls.  In country districts where old and infirm people live they should be brought to the polls by their neighbours, just as they are brought to Mass on Sundays.  Generally, I think it would be a very good thing to discourage the idea that people should be brought to the polls in motor cars.</P>
    <P>So far as being told where they are to go for voting purposes is concerned, that is another matter.  I think there is something to be said for that.  I have known cases where persons have not known to what particular booth they should go for the purpose of voting. I do not refer particularly to any election in which I was personally concerned. But in elections in previous times they were not in a position to know where they should go.  As we are now facing a situation when within the next few months we must have an election in this country, I think, having regard to the fact that it was usually the practice for motor cars to be used to a large extent, that there should be a greater number of booths provided at more suitable distances.  If such a scheme were adopted, I think it should be made generally known through the country at the earliest opportunity so that people can acclimatise themselves to the fact that a change has been made in order to ensure that the people will get a proper opportunity of voicing their opinions at the coming election.  I am afraid I strayed a little bit away from the matter before the House.</P>

      <P>That is right.  In fact, there is nothing in the two Acts dealing with elections mentioned in this Bill&mdash;the Parliamentary Elections Act and the Corrupt Practices Commission Expenses Act&mdash;having any relation to any of the matters that have been discussed.  They only refer to the trial of election petitions and the expenses of commissions set up in connection with election petitions.  That is the sum total of the subjects dealt with in these two Acts.  However, the matters mentioned are naturally matters of interest to all of us, and probably of some interest to the public as well.  I would go a little bit of the road with the Leader of the Labour Party.  As he rather suggested, I would go some part of the road with him, but not very far.  I would go so far as to suggest that perhaps it would be a wise thing for either the State or the local authority to send to each elector a note at some time or another with the name of his polling booth and his electoral number.  That perhaps could be done when the rate collector is serving his rate notices.  Something of that kind might be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the other suggestion about transport for election purposes, I do not think that is the duty either of the State or the local authority.  Voting is a duty as well as a privilege, and I think a person ought to be encouraged to regard it as a solemn duty to record his vote and to get to the poll, however he gets there.  I think Deputy Linehan is right in suggesting <Col N="2505" /> that too much spoon-feeding is very bad.  People should be encouraged and educated to regard this as a very solemn duty and responsibility and encouraged to get to the poll in whatever way they can.  The lame, the halt, and the blind should have it borne in upon them that they are neglecting a solemn duty if they do not go out to vote.  At present there is rivalry between political Parties and, if they help, that is their own affair.  The public may benefit, but I do not think the State ought to be asked to go that far.  As to the question of the polling booths, the name of the booth and the place and the number, I never heard it suggested before that the State or the local authority ought to do that, but I think it is worth consideration. Perhaps if the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Local Government were considering legislation in regard to this matter a way might be found to do something of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal of foundation for the criticism which has been expressed about the rent restrictions Acts, but I think everybody agrees that it is a frightfully difficult matter to deal with.  The last tribunal which discussed that as well as other matters sat an unconscionably long time and took a long time to furnish their report.  But their excuse was that there was hardly anything more difficult in connection with legislation. I think the Minister has not the report more than about a year.  He has had a pretty full year with other legislation. He did hope to have a Bill introduced before the end of this year.  He has not succeeded, but he has hopes of having it introduced early in the new year.  I do not know what it will be like when it is introduced, but I do know that it certainly will not satisfy everybody&mdash;it would be a miracle if it did.  At any rate, he expects to have legislation ready early in the new year to deal with the rent restrictions Acts.</P>

      <P>I want to make a brief reply to Deputy Linehan.  He says that we should not spoon-feed electors. That seems to be using a phrase which has no application whatever to electors. What do we do for electors?  The electors, probably with more truth, might say that they spoon-feed those they elect.  I never met an elector who felt that he was spoon-fed by the Legislature in the matter of elections.  My concern in raising both these matters &mdash;I am glad the Minister has sympathy with one of them&mdash;is to try to put the thing on a basis of equality as between political Parties.  In my own constituency I have seen very wealthy families turn out in a £1,500 limousine, on a holyday, to aid a particular Party.</P>

    <Title>Superannuation Bill, 1942&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now now read a Second Time.  The present Bill deals principally with the cases of certain officers of the Ordnance Survey who were discharged from their employment during the war of 1914-18.  If these officers had joined the British Army at the time their posts in the Ordnance Survey would have been kept open for them, and the period of their military service would have reckoned for superannuation purposes.  When they failed to join the British Army they were discharged from the Ordnance Survey with the pensions or gratuities to which their service entitled them. They were later reinstated in our service and certified under the Superannuation Act, 1923, or the Superannuation Act, 1936, but as their service prior to discharge had already been reckoned for pension or gratuity, it could not be reckoned again for pension under our superannuation legislation.  Power is now being taken in this Act to aggregate this service with the service which the officers are entitled to reckon for pension under the Superannuation Acts, but credit will be taken, in determining the superannuation to be granted to them, for the pensions or gratuities awarded to them on discharge from the British Civil Service. This will place them in the same position financially as the other victimised civil servants provided for by the Superannuation Acts, 1923 and 1936, who reckon their service for pension <Col N="2508" /> on a continuous basis from the date of their first employment in a pensionable capacity in the British Civil Service. The provisions will apply to officers who have retired before the date of the passing of the Bill as well as to those officers who are still serving.  Any pensions or gratuities granted to retired officers will be reassessed with effect from the date of their retirement.</P>
      <P>Assistants in the Ordnance Survey are required to serve 15 years in an unestablished capacity before becoming established.  Half this period may be reckoned for pension.  The provisions of this Bill will also effect that service in the Ordnance Survey prior to discharge may be reckoned towards the 15 years' unestablished service necessary to qualify for establishment. Hitherto, this service had not been counted towards the qualifying period as the award of pension or gratuity by the British authorities was regarded as destroying all entitlement in respect of the service covered by the award. Most of the officers concerned were established after the expiration of 15 years from the date of discharge from the British service.  A few, however, failed to secure establishment on account of age or ill-health.  If they had not been discharged from the British service, they would, in the normal course, have been established at an earlier date, when considerations of age and ill-health were not present.  It is now proposed to confer on them the entitlement to pension which they would have had if they had not been discharged from the British service and had been established at the normal time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the Ordnance Survey officers, this Bill deals with the case of an officer who retired on pension from the British Civil Service as an alternative to taking the oath of allegiance, and who was subsequently reinstated in the Irish Civil Service and certified under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  The officer is in the same position as the Ordnance Survey officers in that the grant of a pension to her by the British authorities has debarred the reckoning of her British Civil Service for a pension from Irish funds.  It is proposed <Col N="2509" /> to treat her in the same way as the Ordnance Survey officers, namely, to reckon all her service for pension and to take credit for the amount of the British superannuation award.</P>
    <P>When the British meterological stations in Ireland were transferred to the Government in 1937, a few established officers who were serving at Valentia Observatory were transferred to the Irish Civil Service.  An undertaking was given to aggregate their service prior to transfer with their subsequent service for pension on final retirement, and provision to this end has been made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with the recovery from the funds of various local authorities of the expenses incurred by the Local Appointments Commissioners in carrying into effect the provisions of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, some doubt has arisen as regards the inclusion in such &ldquo;Expenses&rdquo; of a contribution towards superannuation liability arising in respect of staff employed on the work of the commission.  In the normal course, repayment for services rendered includes a contribution towards the cost of pension or other superannuation benefits in respect of officers engaged in providing the services, and provision to this end has already been made in a number of statutes.  It is desired to include in this Bill a general provision to secure that in all appropriate cases a charge for superannuation liability may be included as part of the expenses of services rendered by the State, where the cost of such services is being repaid.  The expenses of carrying the Bill into effect will be met by moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give effect to a promise I made to Deputy Cosgrave, I think, more than once, that I would look after certain people, particularly in the Ordnance Survey who, owing to their political action and political views, were claimed to be victimised.  Those who remained in the service, or those who joined the British Army from the Ordnance Survey staff, were in a better position eventually than those who, for political reasons, refused to <Col N="2510" /> join the British Army in the 1914-18 period.  Deputy Cosgrave pressed their case several times here on me.  I think that he might have looked after them himself when he was in office, but he did not do so.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for it?  It does seem rather unnecessary to require a man in such a position as that of a member of the staff of the Ordnance Survey to give 15 years' service unestablished.  I should also like to be clear on the other matter: where a pension was paid by the British to certain people, who are dealt with here, on a small number of years' service.  I presume that their pension would be based on the salary these people were in receipt of at the time they left the service, and that that money has been paid yearly and, I take it, still is being paid yearly to these people.  I understand that it is proposed now to reckon all the service of such persons for pension purposes. Do I understand that the pension they <Col N="2511" /> are in receipt of from the British is now being surrendered?</P>

      <P>I think there is nothing more undesirable than such observations as the Minister has seen fit to make here this evening in connection with this matter.  The question of State administration is a matter which ought to affect everybody.  I am not going to enter into any competition with the Minister, who takes occasional opportunities of advertising what he does for everybody, in connection with that matter.</P>
      <P>But I would say that we had some responsibility for giving these people employment from 1922 up to the date of their superannuation a year or two ago.  That we did not do everything in ten years, I am prepared to admit at once.  It is the duty of somebody who succeeds us and who succeeds the Minister to continue that work and, consequently, I find it no part of my business here this evening to thank the Minister.  That is his responsibility and I do not propose to thank him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if he were placed in the same position, Deputy Norton would do it much more gracefully than the Minister has done it. However, we can ignore that.  I would like to know, in connection with Section 7, whether this has reference to the case of a person who had been formerly in the employment of a local authority and who, let us say, takes up a position in the service of the State and then goes back to render some service to another local authority? Does it refer to a case of that sort, because, as it is written there, while, I presume, a lawyer would say there is no ambiguity about it, it is not particularly clear to the lay mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is anything going to be done for cases of that sort?  Take <Col N="2512" /> another case.  A man for some time serves the State and, having been in the service of the State for a given number of years, is appointed, let us say, to be manager of a county.  He has had service with the State, and such service as he has had would have entitled him to count a certain number of years for pension if he had remained in the service of the State. But if he leaves the service and goes to the local authority there is a gap. After serving the local authority, say, ten or 20 years, he would be entitled to draw pension only in respect of service there.  It may not be one of the matters that are dealt with in this measure, but it must be dealt with sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not dealt with here.  There are cases the reverse of what the Deputy mentioned, where persons serve a local authority and then come to the State.  I have one case in mind.  The Deputy will probably remember the case of the man who was county surveyor in Meath who came into the State's service as chief engineering inspector of the Department of Local Government in the Deputy's time, I think.  That man was paid pension by the State&mdash;I am speaking from recollection and subject to correction&mdash;for the whole service, but the pension accruing to him after the period of his service to the local authority was paid into the State, or else he was paid the pension by the local authority and paid a State pension for the time he was with the State.  I know that the total period of service, both in the local authority and in the State, was taken into account. How exactly it was paid I cannot say. As far as I am acquainted with it, I do not think there is anything in the law that enables a person going from State service to the local authority to count the total service.  I am not certain about that but I do not think there is. There is a Section&mdash;4&mdash;of the Superannuation Act, 1914, that might apply to the case Deputy Cosgrave has in mind but I am not certain of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill that makes provision for the payment of pension <Col N="2513" /> on old age, as a reward for long and faithful service, has a good deal to commend it.  In that spirit I commend this Bill but, seeing that the Minister, by the introduction of this Bill, is interfering with the existing Superannuation Acts of 1834 to 1936, I think he might have gone very much further. I want to bring to his notice the necessity for the provision of pensions for a very deserving class of the community, relatively numerous State servants, but lowly paid, whose conditions are unenviable and yet who serve the State with unflagging zeal for very long periods.  I refer to the case, for instance, of part-time postmen, described as auxiliary postmen.  Many of these people serve the State for 40 and 45 years.  They are paid low rates of wages during their period of service. If they are absent from duty through illness the State pays them nothing whatever.  When they come to retire after 40 and 45 years' service they get no pension from the State.  In fact, they are eligible only for a small gratuity from a compassionate fund that is at the disposal of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if they can show that they are in very necessitous circumstances.  Very necessitous circumstances, as applied to the administration of that fund, is a means test of a pretty rigid character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to bring to the notice of the Minister a case where a private employer had a person in his service for 40 or 45 years, and when that person was leaving his employment through ill-health or old age, he gave him not one halfpenny pension or compensation, the Minister would certainly be loud in his condemnation, I feel sure, that that employee should be treated in such a hard-hearted way. But, in fact, the State does that with the utmost contumely every day in the week when it discharges from its service persons who have served the State and the community for 40 and 45 years.  As I said, these are lowly-paid officers.  Their conditions are nothing to be envied.  Their duties are particularly arduous.  I would wish, if not in this Bill, at least in some other Bill, the Minister would undertake to give sympathetic consideration to the <Col N="2514" /> matter of providing a pension for such persons on retirement.  Their low rates of pay&mdash;anything from 15/- to 30/- a week&mdash;make it impossible for them to make any provision for old age.  They are allowed to remain in the service up to 70 years of age, and then all they can get is an old age pension, if they qualify for such a pension.  The State, as the employer, makes no provision whatever for them, notwithstanding the fact that they have rendered many years of arduous and loyal service to the State.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister could hold out some hope that that matter will be examined sympathetically at an early date with a view to making provision for that class of persons who are at present very badly and indeed harshly treated by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that, on the introduction of this Bill, the Minister would have referred to the question which was the subject of a deputation of which I happened to be a member, over two years ago, namely, a superannuation scheme for all public servants.  At that time the Minister promised us that he would introduce a Bill at an early date.  As a matter of fact, he told us it was in draft.  I would like to know from the Minister what is the difference between servants in public institutions and other public servants.  The Cork Corporation have not yet a pension scheme and each year when we try to give a miserable pension of 10/- a week to employees we are threatened with a surcharge and have to appeal against the surcharge. In my opinion, one class of public servant is as important as another.  I would like to know from the Minister when we are going to have that superannuation scheme that he promised us over two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as I indicated earlier, was brought in to implement a promise I gave here since I became Minister for Finance to Deputy Cosgrave who had been raising the matter.  He probably raised it earlier with my predecessor.  The Bill deals with specific cases of hardship that arose out of political circumstances. <Col N="2515" /> The Bill includes provision for two or three other officers who were put into the meteorological service.  I allowed these to be put in because a promise had also been given in their case, when taken over, that their superannuation would be provided for by law at the earliest opportunity.  I know that there are in the service a considerable number of men who are whole-time servants of the State.  Many of them have already reached the period for retirement, while others will be reaching it shortly.  They are not established, and there is no power to pension them.  That has applied to considerable numbers of them in the past, and is applying to others almost every week now.  The Civil Service, since we took it over in 1922, has included unestablished people in the Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and in a variety of other services, some of them professional men.  Nothing has ever been done about them.  There was no power. They were not established before they reached the retiring age, and there is no legal power to pension them.  I am sure many of them feel that a grave injustice is being done to them, and that they are not being treated as they should be.  It is a very big problem. It is a difficult and a costly one.  There are, as I have said, whole-time people of different status in the service.  Some are ordinary work people, some administrators, and some professional men.</P>
      <P>There are also part-time people in the service, those to whom Deputy Norton referred.  I do not think there is the same case for pensions for people who are only part-time officials.  There is not the same moral obligation at any rate, I think, on the Government. It may be some people's view that there is an obligation on the Government, but I do not think the case is anything like as strong in regard to the part-time people as it is in regard to people who have given 20, 30 or 40 years in the service, and still get no pension.</P>

      <P>Yes, there is a considerable number of them, but I do happen to know that a small number of them have other sources of income, so that their case is not as strong as the other.  I have never had that case examined.  I am speaking offhand now, after hearing the case put by Deputy Norton.  I do know that the problem is there, both in regard to the whole-time people in the various Departments of the Civil Service, and in regard to those part-time people.  I cannot give any promise that it is going to be tackled.  Every year we hear from different sides of the House about the cost of the Civil Service.  It is a very heavy burden indeed.  I know how difficult it is sometimes to stand up to the criticisms that one hears of the cost.  This is something&mdash; though it might in all justice have to be done some time, to provide superannuation at any rate for whole-time servants&mdash;that is going to add, perhaps considerably, to the expense of the Civil Service without giving us any additional service.  However, I am not giving any promise at the present time that I am going to bring in any legislation on the matter.  The cost of the service is so great that I hesitate in present times to add anything to it that is not absolutely essential.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to think that, simply because the scheme is, in his opinion, costly, the State can, therefore, justify riding away from its <Col N="2518" /> responsibilities of providing for persons in their old age.  Now, in so far as there are whole-time employees in the Civil Service or under local authorities, I think the State must face up to its obligation to provide for their old age. The State is the employer, and if it evolves a code of payment in respect of their services which does not enable them to make adequate provision for their old age, then I think there is a moral responsibility on the State to make provision for their old age.  Notwithstanding what the Minister says, I think that if the Post Office Department, for instance, which earns very substantial profits from year to year, employs people at wages ranging from 15/- to 30/- a week, and if, because of their gross underpayment, those people are unable to make provision for their old age, there is surely some obligation on the Government and on the Department concerned to ensure that they are given pensions which will sustain them.  That is the least reward that the State ought to make for those who have served the community for 40 and 45 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the outstanding things that are wrong with this House is that problems are not discussed in it.  In so far as there is a serious problem here and there, Ministers on the one hand endeavour to evade discussion of it, and we can get no help in discussion at all from the members of the Dáil who sit behind the Minister&mdash;when they do sit behind him.  No one would imagine by this Bill that it proposes to make it an offence for a person living in Donegal to send a child under 14 years to school in Derry, or for some one in Cavan to send a child under 14 years to school in Tyrone, without informing the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the passing of this Bill, if parents in Donegal send a child under 14 years of age to school in Derry, and do not tell the local police, as representing the authority under the School Attendance Act, they commit a crime, and are liable, if charged, to be fined £5.  If it is necessary to make that a crime in this country, and legislation specifically directed to making it a crime is introduced into this House, this House ought to be told that that is now being made a crime, and ought <Col N="2521" /> to be told why.  As well as that, the Minister takes certain powers in relation to people who get their education other than through a national school, a suitable school or a recognised school.  He takes certain powers to look into the kind of education they get, and if necessary to examine a child who gets his education in a way other than by attending a national school, a suitable school or a recognised school.  He allows certain what he calls &ldquo;reasonable excuses&rdquo;.  One is sickness, another is the absence of an accessible school, which is defined, and another is &ldquo;an unavoidable cause&rdquo;.  Anything that there is in the line of a loophole is under Section 3 (2) (b), that is,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...that the child is receiving suitable education within the meaning of this Act in a manner other than by attending a national school, a suitable school, or a recognised school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But Section 4 (1) of the Bill circumscribes that, by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A child shall not be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be receiving suitable education in a manner other than by attending a national school, a suitable school, or a recognised school unless such education and the manner in which such child is receiving it have been certified under this section by the Minister to be suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the one loophole is that the child is receiving suitable education; &ldquo;suitable education&rdquo; is qualified by the statement that &ldquo;such education and the manner in which such child is receiving it have been certified under this section by the Minister to be suitable,&rdquo; and the Minister tells this House that he has no means of certifying as &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; education that anybody receives outside this country. We ought to be told in the first case what are the reasons for making it a crime for persons to send their children across the Border to school without telling the police, and we should have some explanation from the Minister as to what is intended here by saying that nothing shall be recognised as alternative suitable education unless <Col N="2522" /> the Minister is able to certify that the education and the manner in which it is being received are satisfactory to him, if at the same time he says that he has no means of certifying that education given outside this country is suitable.  If he wants to say that he is going to have his inspectors examine, when they come back, children who go outside this country to school, and may declare as a result of that examination that that education is unsatisfactory, and that therefore the parents are committing an offence under the Act, then we ought to be told here what exactly the Minister means, and what type of examination is going to be carried out.  It is not stated in this Act what the particular standard or minimum of education is meant to be, but during the discussion here the Minister pointed out one of the reasons which drove him to legislation of this particular kind.  As reported at column 2111 of the Official Debates of 18th November, 1942, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One particular case, at any rate, has arisen and has been the subject of legal proceedings, and a decision has been given upon it which suggests to me that the present provisions are defective.  It may be a matter of opinion whether this situation should be remedied or not. In my opinion, it ought to be remedied.  The decision in this particular case was to the effect that a child may be receiving suitable elementary education according to the provisions of the School Attendance Act, 1926, notwithstanding that the subjects in the ordinary curriculum, we will say, of the national schools are not being taught in such a school.  According to the present programme, the primary school subjects are: Irish, English (optional for Standard I), mathematics, history, geography, needlework for girls, and music.  Therefore, I conceive it to be the policy of the Ministry, in determining whether a particular school which applies for a certificate of suitability is suitable or not, to consider the manner in which it endeavours to provide a curriculum of this nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But when the Minister was asked by <Col N="2523" /> Professor O'Sullivan, as reported at column 2096 of the Official Debates of 18th November:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will it not be an offence if a parent does not send his child to a suitable school in this State?&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the event of such a parent being prosecuted, it will surely be a matter for the court to determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How can the court determine what is a suitable standard of education, or what are the necessary subjects in which a certain standard has to be arrived at, except it is put into the Act?  The court is simply going to be asked to decide, with its prejudices of one kind or another, whether a person is getting a suitable education or not. You have a situation there that is most extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The Minister disclaims that he mentioned Irish as being an operative thing in his mind in moving in the direction in which he is moving; but I think, from what he has said, that it is perfectly obvious that something in connection with Irish as a school subject is moving him.  What standard in Irish is going to be required?  If a case is brought before the courts relating to a person who is sending a child outside and that child is not getting instruction in Irish, and is therefore not being suitably educated, what will the nature of the offence be?  Is there any standard which we can apply?</P>
    <P>If Irish is an impelling matter in the presentation of this legislation, I should like to ask the Minister if he will consider the position of Irish in some Dublin schools.  I raised this question of attendance before.  I do not think that we can pass increasingly stringent legislation with regard to school attendance without adverting to it again.  I will take only one school. In March, 1941, there were 19 classes in it, and in the eight classes dealing with infants in the first standard, there was an average on the roll of 55, and an average attendance of 48.  On the 21st May, 1942, something over a year afterwards, there were 18 classes in the school, and in eight of the earlier <Col N="2524" /> classes the average on the roll was 56, and the average in attendance was 52. What drew my attention to this school was that there was one infant class, with 111 children on the roll, in charge of one teacher.  The Minister explained that that was a temporary situation, and that things would improve after about three months or so.</P>
    <P>What was the position on the 24th September of this year?  Again there were 18 classes, and in the eight first classes there were 66 on the roll&mdash;an average of 66.  The attendance was 52 in the morning and 53 in the afternoon. A month later, on the 29th October, again there were 18 classes in the whole school.  The average on the roll was 63 in the eight first classes, and the attendance was 59 in the morning and 59 in the afternoon.  So far as attendance went in the eight classes, it had gone up from 48 in March, 1941, to 52 in May, 1942, to 52 in September, 1942, and 59 in October, 1942.</P>
    <P>If Irish is the driving motive in this what kind of work is being done for Irish in these schools, and why should more stringent regulations or more stringent laws be passed to force parents to send their children into schools of that particular kind?  It is only discussion that will enable us to understand our problems; it is only discussion that will bring us to the proper way of tackling them.  There has been no presentation of this matter that would indicate in any way what the problem is or that it is being tackled in the right way or that it will be tackled in a successful way. The matter was raised on a very definite point of principle by Deputy O'Sullivan, and he left the House simply because he got no answer to the questions he raised.</P>
    <P>The other point is that in this Bill the Minister is very definitely creating another situation which, to my mind, is serious.  The translation of the Minister's speech says that action against defaulting parents at present is necessarily slow, owing to the requirement that a warning notice of one week must be served on a parent before legal proceedings may be taken following a first offence.  The Bill proposes <Col N="2525" /> to speed up action by abolishing the warning notice and by removing the requirement that for committal of a child to an industrial school the conviction of the parent, for a second or subsequent offence against the Act, is necessary.</P>
    <P>In the first place, this is the first time in which a Bill of this kind makes the punishment, for a first offence, committal to an industrial school.  In the second place, as definitely stated by the Minister, a child may now be committed for a first offence to an industrial school and he will be committed, the Minister indicates, according to traditional practice, for a long period.  That means that if a child of 11 is committed to an industrial school, he will be committed for five years; if a child of 12 is committed, the period will be four years, and so on.  The Minister has intimated that he sees no way of providing special institutions for these children, or providing a limited period by law for the detention of the child.</P>
    <P>No information has been given us by the Minister as to the extent to which it has been necessary in the past to commit children to industrial schools for circumstances that are brought to light by reason of the child's non-attendance. I have ascertained that during the past five years, in the Dublin school attendance area, 351 children have been committed to industrial schools.  I must say that is a very big figure.  All the cases have arisen out of circumstances disclosed through non-attendance at school.  To what extent there are criminal cases mixed up there, I do not know.  Here you have a situation in which, although a person could not be committed to an industrial school for the first offence, you have a large number committed there.  It seems to me that if the policy that existed in the courts during the past seven or eight years is going to continue, with the guards thrown-off, as is implied by dropping the provision with regard to it being a second offence, that figure is going to be raised pretty high.  When a case is presented to the court, who makes it? Is it the school attendance committee, <Col N="2526" /> the school attendance officer or the probation officer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the school attendance officer, as Deputy Hickey says, is he directed by any other authority as to what he shall ask for by way of punishment?  Does he advise that a particular case is one for detention in an industrial school?  Does he do that off his own bat, or is there any higher authority which advises him? If the Minister persists during the discussion in the Seanad on retaining this provision with regard to industrial schools for first offences, he will have to be very clear, and we should all like to be very clear, as to how these cases will be presented to the courts.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his remarks during this discussion that one of the matters that make it difficult for parents to send their children to school is their financial circumstances, and he rather implied that it was better to take a child from a home in which the financial circumstances of the parents were such that the child could not be properly looked after and sent to school, and send it to an industrial school.  In considering how these cases will be presented and dealt with in future, I ask the Minister to give consideration to the point that Deputy Hickey made, that it costs something like 12/6 or 15/- a week to keep a child in an industrial school, made up of 7/6 by the State and an additional sum by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the lengthy period for which children are likely to be kept in industrial schools, and the ease with which they are likely to be put in now, it is important, when we have the rights of the parent with regard to a child's education and the right of the State, that we keep in our minds that the right of the parent comes first, and that there may be cases where intervention on the part of the public relief authorities to make the financial position of the parent easier might enable that parent to keep a child at home and have it properly looked after, and <Col N="2527" /> obviate the necessity of sending the child to an industrial school.</P>
    <P>While I think a certain amount of improvement will be effected by the Bill, particularly as the result of a discussion here, in the school attendance machinery for the future, the two matters I speak of are two very serious blemishes on our law, and I think they should not have been presented to the House in the way in which they have been presented, without very considerably more explanation by the Minister, explanation of a kind which would have enabled the House to discuss more intelligently what he has in his mind, because we are left in the position that we can discuss nothing but the outrageous aspect of these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I make bold to say that were it not for the financial position of parents and the bad social conditions under which children live, we would have a very small school attendance problem.  Legislation of this kind is good in its way, but it does not get to the root of the matter, and while the Minister may say that the matters to which I am about to refer are no concern of his, I say that he cannot separate himself from other Departments of State.  I look on the education of the children as the most important function of the Government of any State.  I was speaking to a member of the Gárda in Cork within the past fortnight and discussing certain crimes.  He told me that 50 per cent.  of the things they have to deal with came from a certain locality.  As I do not want to hurt the feelings of people who may see the Official Reports, I do not propose to mention the locality by name, but it is not one of the old areas of the city.  I asked him if what was responsible for that position had ever dawned on him and he replied: &ldquo;I do not know; but 50 per cent.  of the cases we deal with come from that locality.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Is it not due to the fact that it is there the poverty-stricken masses of the city live?&rdquo;  He said he knew that was so, and then he told me some of the things <Col N="2528" /> he sees, and has seen, in the homes of these people.</P>
      <P>Bringing in legislation of a more drastic kind to compel children to attend school is not safeguarding the children or the rights of the parents. During the past three weeks or so, I saw a number of people prosecuted at the District Court in Cork for non-attendance of their children at school, and in order to find out whether some of the things I spoke on here and elsewhere were based on fact, I inquired into the conditions of some of these parents, and personally I cannot but say that they are marvellous to be as good as they are.  In considering these matters, I ask myself what would be the position if I were living under similar conditions.  I have children of my own, and if I were in receipt of 33/- per week to pay rent and feed and clothe five, six or seven children, I should like to know what would be their anxiety to go to school.  What would be the encouragement to the mother of such a home to force these hungry, ill-clad and ill-nourished little bodies to school; whereas if you give a child sufficient food and happy surroundings, you will find that he is anxious to go to school rather than to stay away.</P>
      <P>It is very little use bringing in legislation of this kind which does not get down to the economic position and the social conditions of the people for whom it is intended.  You cannot make good citizens by legislation of this kind.  You have to deal with it in another way, that is, by giving decent social conditions and the means by which they can send their children to school in comfort and in some kind of cheer.  It is no surprise to me to learn that we have 350 children committed to industrial schools.  Will we have better citizens in the future as a result? Are the children of to-day, or of the future, going to be good citizens while that state of affairs exists?  You cannot make good citizens of children by compelling them to attend school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refer the Minister again to the report of the Cork school attendance officer.  I have already given one or two extracts from it, and I think it <Col N="2529" /> appalling that such men are asked to force children to school and to summon their parents, with the result that these unfortunate people have to go before the court two or three times and then their children are sent to industrial schools.  These people are receiving the big amount of a maximum of 2/6 per week to feed and clothe a child from one year to 14 years for seven days a week.  How can it be done?  The alternative is to send the child to an industrial school, and the State and the local authorities will pay anything up to 15/- a week to keep the child in that industrial school.  Surely that is not legislation of a proper kind. I submit that it would be well if the Minister went to the Executive Council and suggested that something should be done to increase the maintenance allowance for children whose parents have not been given the right to earn a living to support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Bill.  It was needed.  Looking at it from the point of view of school attendance I feel that it is a contribution in that respect.  While I do not want to pursue the economic line Deputy Hickey took, he cannot deny that within the past decade the conditions under which children work in schools have been very considerably improved.</P>

      <P>The conditions under which they do their work in schools have been very considerably improved, particularly in Dublin, and also in Cork where unsuitable premises have been replaced by decent schools.  The effect can be seen already in the mental and physical development of the children, as well as in the way they can assimilate education.  In the last ten years the change, in my experience, has been marvellous.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The meal that they get at midday has had something to do with that.  I should like to see a <Col N="2530" /> matter to which I referred when the Bill was introduced dealt with.  In Dublin the schools' medical service is doing good work.  It could do much better work, if this was an opportune time to dovetail the medical service with better attendance at school.  In Dublin, or in any city, children are much better off, mentally and physically, when they are attending a good school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain difficulty at the present time about the certificates that parents of children hand to principal teachers.  Some of these documents are prescriptions for medicine.  Once some parents get them they very often use them as an excuse for a child's absence for days or weeks. I am sure the medical profession do not want to be troubled with them, and that these people are a source of annoyance to them.  I wonder if it would be possible, before the Bill becomes law, to introduce something in the way of a certain amount of compulsion by making it necessary to get a certificate of some type from the schools' medical service, and in that way lead to an extension of useful social legislation?  As an example of the type of document that the teacher is confronted with, the following came from a reputable doctor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is to certify that X-Y is attending this dispensary and will be unable to attend school until I see fit.  This I cannot at present forecast, not being a prophet.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure that a doctor would not have written that were it not that he felt he was jockeyed into doing so by the present state of things.  As a good deal of money is being spent on the schools' medical service, I do not see why the best possible use should not be made of it, and why it should not develop along the lines of social development in connection with the schools.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty and that this may not be the best time to deal with the question.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I can do anything about the point <Col N="2531" /> raised by Deputy Mullen.  The question of medical certificates bristles with difficulties.  As I pointed out during the discussions on the Bill, it would be a hardship on parents to have to pay for medical certificates, particularly where the children were ill only for a short period.  The Deputy's observation would lead one to believe that sometimes the medical certificates are not as valuable testimony as they might be of the fact that children were really ill and unable to attend school.  Undoubtedly the matter will have to be taken notice of, but I do not see any way of dealing with it at present.  As regards children attending schools in the Six-County area, I pointed out already that these schools are outside my jurisdiction.  That has been the position under the Education Act of 1926, and no considerable difficulty has arisen.  The position now will be, if this measure becomes law, that any doubt that may have existed as to the power of the Minister, that children residing within this State should in fact receive what he considers to be the minimum requirements in education, will be resolved.  The Minister has power to satisfy himself that any child is receiving the minimum education which it is the duty of the State to see is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey referred to the matter of social conditions.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what he said. I wish that a great deal more could be done for our children, but a fair amount has been done.  I am very glad that Deputy Mullen has called attention to the fact that, at any rate, a great many people have been given houses in which their families, if other circumstances are favourable, can be brought up in reasonable conditions of hygiene and decency.  That is certainly an advance.  I am quite certain, no matter what the economic circumstances of the parents may be in those areas where the new housing schemes have been erected, that the growing generation will benefit, that they will not go back to the old conditions, as some of the parents are inclined; that they will realise the advantages <Col N="2532" /> of living in better homes, and that in due course that spirit will permeate the whole of the population.</P>
    <P>The schools' meals scheme is there also, and, while it may not be perfect, it is doing a certain amount of good.  As the Deputy has pointed out, even the midday meal in itself has benefited the children's health enormously. Teachers tell me that they see a vast improvement in the health of the children since the midday interval was instituted and children have been permitted to take part in the family meal at the midday interval. There is also the question of medical records and medical inspection services. We have records of the condition of the children.  We know we shall be able to judge as to whether or not the position has improved from year to year.  I think the medical reports indicate that there is a steady improvement. No doubt, a great many children are suffering from diseases of one kind or another.  Sometimes there is, unfortunately, an amount of uncleanliness which could be avoided, I think&mdash;speaking as one who has no direct responsibility in the matter of medical services&mdash;if more attention were paid to this matter by parents. Very often these undesirable conditions of uncleanliness arise just from neglect or carelessness.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should bear in mind that this Bill does not propose to treat all parents of children who may be absent from school as recalcitrant persons, but it proposes that the law should be speeded up to deal with those parents who are neglecting their duty. We have to draw a distinction between parents who are doing their best to look after their children and those who are not.  We know, and Deputy Hickey knows, that some of the best servants of the State and some of its most distinguished sons have come from very humble homes.  Their parents were interested in them; they made sacrifices in order to enable their children to be educated and one sees the results every day.  One sees these boys and girls taking a very high place in examinations and acquitting themselves, not alone with credit to their parents, but with credit to the places <Col N="2533" /> from which they come.  But we have the other type of parent whom, unfortunately, no amount of lecturing, no amount of advice, will induce to do what is necessary and beneficial in the interest of their children.  I have no sympathy with those parents, and, if the position is that they will not take the necessary steps to provide their children with the minimum education that the Constitution prescribes as necessary, I think that everything that is possible should be done under the law to bring them to justice and to see that their children are not going to suffer in this very important matter, that they are not going to lose something which they cannot regain afterwards, as a result of the dereliction of their parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some parents who, even if they were given £5 a week, would seem to be unable to care their children properly.  There are children on the other hand whose fathers are in receipt of a very small sum weekly and they are a credit to their parents and to everybody else. These parents are not the first to whine or complain that their conditions are not as good as we should like them to be.  A certain number of children have been committed to industrial schools and I think they all belong to that first class to which I have referred.  In fact, it might be argued from the figures before me, if we are to take committal to industrial schools in any numbers as an indication whether or not the School Attendance Act is being enforced, that there must be a serious doubt whether the Act is really being enforced throughout the State in the way it should be.  In the area of the Dublin Corporation I find that in the period from 1st June, 1941, to 31st May, 1942, 64 boys and five girls, out of a total of 106 boys and 11 girls, were committed to industrial schools for failure to attend school.  In 14 counties, no children whatever were committed, and in only six counties were there girls sent to industrial schools.  That <Col N="2534" /> indicates that it is in Dublin apparently the problem of children having to be sent to industrial schools, because of non-attendance, arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The attendance throughout the country as a whole for the year ending 30th June, 1941, was 83.6, which would indicate that 16.4 per cent. on the average have been absent from school, amounting, I think, to some 60,000 children per day.  I have reason to believe, having regard to the fact that the attendance is somewhat higher in the urban and city areas&mdash; 86.8, for example, in Dublin City&mdash; that there are rural areas where there has been a serious falling off in attendance. It may be that people will attempt to justify that by reason of the emergency conditions, by the fact that children whose parents are working on the land have been called on to give additional assistance, and have, therefore, been taken away from school.  I think that only a serious crisis could really justify taking children away from normal attendance at school.  I notice in some of the country newspapers that even the district justices have had to comment on the very large numbers of cases that have been brought before them. May I say, with all respect, that I hope that the district justices will take more effective steps than merely lamenting the fact that this disease, if it is a disease, exists, that they will take steps to end it, because it certainly can be ended, I think, without imposing severe penalties, punishment or even inconvenience, upon parents who honestly wish to do the best they can for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2535" /> With regard to the Dublin City area, the position is, as Deputies are aware, that before children are brought before the court their parents are generally brought before the school attendance committee.  In a case in which a parent is prosecuted, we may assume that the parent has been visited, not once but several times, by the school attendance officer, in an endeavour to get the child to attend school.  Then, if the case is a bad one, the parent is generally brought before the school attendance committee, and this might happen on several occasions.  The school attendance committees are composed of kindhearted people, in my opinion, and they do not want to take penal action if it can be avoided.  The same can be said about the district justices.  The justices in Dublin do not wish to send children to industrial schools if there is any other way, but they have to see that their plain duty to the community and to the children is fulfilled.</P>
    <P>If it is quite clear that the children are not being properly looked after and properly educated, some steps must be taken to deal with the situation.  Every chance is given to parents who are brought before the courts, before a committal order is made by the district justice in Dublin. If we find that children are committed where the cases have been before the court only once or twice, we may assume&mdash;and I have full particulars here which corroborate the statement&mdash; that there are special circumstances involved in the cases, such as the children being out of control, utter neglect by the parents, the child definitely refusing in court&mdash;even to the district justice&mdash;to go to school, or perhaps a charge is made by the Gárdaí against the child for some offence necessitating action by the court.  Therefore it is not merely non-attendance at school that is in question where children are committed to industrial schools for their benefit, but it includes incorrigibility, being out of control, parental neglect, and so on.</P>
    <P>In some cases the parents ask that the children be committed; and although a number of cases come under my notice where petitions are made for the release of children, it is <Col N="2536" /> noticeable that there are very many cases where the parents do not take even that step.  We cannot assume that those parents are not interested in their children's welfare: we must assume that they feel that the children are better off and better cared for, and that they have a better chance in the industrial school of being prepared for life, than they would have if left under their own supervision.  I have a case here, for example, of a boy aged 11 years, who was three times before the court before he was committed in July, 1941.  In August, 1941, I ordered his release.  He did not attend school, and during the period after I ordered his release in August, 1941, and before October, 1942, when he was recommitted, he was before the court no less than six times.  It cannot be said that, in that case, the justice did not seek every possible avenue before recommitting the boy, even though the fact that he had been committed already would seem to give a certain good ground for recommitting him.</P>
    <P>I have a long list of cases here of boys who were out of control or incorrigible. We all know that the fathers, in a good many cases, are out of the country and that, therefore, there is much lack of parental control.  I am afraid that was always the case, but, under present circumstances, parental control seems to be less in evidence. There are those types of cases where no control is being exercised, where nobody is in a position to exercise it, and the district justice, while anxious not to send the child away if there were any alternative which he considered practical and useful, adjourns the case for a short time, or may make inquiries through the probation officers, or through the police, or he may issue a warning from the Bench.  In the long run, there always will be a certain number of cases where no advice is likely to be of benefit and no guidance will be accepted.  The authorities concerned must see that the education of such children is provided for, and there is no way of doing that except by committal.</P>
    <P>It is true that the justices generally commit the boys and girls until they reach the age of 16 years, but they <Col N="2537" /> have discretion in that matter under the 1908 Act, Section 65, paragraph (b). The justice may commit a child for a shorter period&mdash;&ldquo;for such time as to the court may seem proper for the teaching and training of the child, but not in any case extending beyond the time when the child will, in the opinion of the court, attain the age of 16 years.&rdquo;  There is no anxiety whatever on the part of justices to fill up these institutions.  Quite the contrary: every justice realises, as we all realise, that it would be much better if these children could be brought up at home. It is not merely a financial question: even if some parents were granted a greatly increased bounty from the State, there would still be, unfortunately, these recalcitrant cases, and there is no use in pretending that it is merely a question of finance.  Some parents do not seem to have the fibre, character or willingness to do what other parents consider to be their first and elemental duty to their children. Therefore, unfortunately and regrettably, their children must be taken away from them until they have been given the necessary education.</P>
    <P>I have been asked why it is not possible to see that the children are taken away for a shorter period than two or three years or until they are 16 years of age.  Some of these children have been playing truant for considerable periods, some of them are completely out of control, some of them have, in court, defied all authority, and I do not envy the managers of schools who have to deal with them.  If the schools were to take them for a short period, they would, inevitably, be up again before the courts and you would have the same problem.</P>

      <P>The thing has happened and it shows that the representations the Minister receives are not always what they should be, that those who make them have not regard to all the circumstances, or to the primary aim, which is the ultimate welfare and benefit of the child, not whether the parents should get Johnny home again but whether it is in Johnny's interest to be sent back to a home where he will not be properly looked after. These children have a very low standard of education in relation to their years and, in committing them for a fairly long period, the district justice wishes to make certain that they will reach a certain minimum standard of education.  If he adopted any other course, the children would, in many cases, not receive any other education. It takes them a considerable time to fit into the life of the school and accustom themselves to the routine and discipline.  It has often been argued by the school authorities that if some boys are taken away, for reasons that are not good and sufficient, after spending only a few months in the school, it seems very unfair to other boys who have to remain there for a period of years.  It is found, generally, that committal up to the age of 16 years is necessary to enable these boys and girls whose education has been neglected and who, very often, have a deplorably low level of attainment, to acquire the ordinary national school education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to differentiate between types of cases.  We have that large class of children against whom no crime or offence is alleged, whose parents are destitute and who have to go to industrial schools.  In these cases it is purely a question of poverty. These children have to remain in the school unless their parents' condition <Col N="2539" /> improves to such an extent that they can support the children, in which case I have no alternative, nor would I seek one, but to release them to their parents' care.  Normally, these children have to remain for a considerable period, and it would be an extraordinary differentiation if truants and children completely beyond control should receive special treatment over and above these children.  As I have said already, the Minister has power, when representations are made to him and where he is satisfied that the child's interest will not suffer but that it will be, on the whole, for his benefit to be taken from an industrial school, to discharge the child.  The total number of cases does not seem to indicate that there is any great disposition on the part of justices to commit children if there is any way out.  I have given information&mdash;I could read out the cases in detail but I do not wish unduly to delay the House&mdash;to show that, of the 69 cases committed during the last yearly period, a large number&mdash;I think I could say the whole&mdash;were committed, not solely on the ground of non-attendance at school, but because there were other factors which the justices had to take into account.</P>
    <P>I have already informed Deputy Mulcahy that the question of the large classes is receiving attention.  Where it is quite clear that the attendance on rolls has permanently increased, then there is ground for increasing the staff, according to the ordinary staffing regulations. But there is the question of whether, in fact, the increase is permanent. What I have been told&mdash;I visited some of the schools myself&mdash; corroborates what I have already stated in the House&mdash;that the infants, instead of coming in at the beginning of the school year, come in over the months up to the autumn period.  Then, immediately the weather gets bad, the tendency is to keep them at home.  At the same time, there is a constant drop in the enrolment of the pupils in the senior standards.  From the Christmas period onwards, the senior pupils who have reached the age of 14 are leaving school.  Two cases were referred to by <Col N="2540" /> the Deputy.  In what was, I think, one of these cases, extra teachers had been provided at the time he was asking me Parliamentary Questions about the matter.  Inquiries are going ahead in connection with the whole matter. When we speak of infants' classes, we must realise that no formal teaching takes place in these classes, nor is such possible.  The most that can be done is to keep the youngsters amused and occupied over what, to them, must be a very tedious day.  Undoubtedly, it requires a strong and active teacher to keep them fully occupied.  If it is possible to improve the position as regards staffing, it will be done.  The matter is being investigated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, Section 3, before sub-section <Col N="2541" /> (8), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(8) Nothing in this section shall apply to prejudice or affect any proceedings instituted in the High Court or in the Circuit Court by a transferred employee before the 17th day of July, 1942, so far as such proceedings were grounded on the want of the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to an act to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of this Bill is to prevent legal action being taken by any former employee of the Electricity Supply Board.  Section 3 (7) provides that, while other persons are prevented from taking any action against the Electricity Supply Board for compensation in respect of loss of earnings, the Bill, and the section, of course,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;shall not operate to invalidate any judgment of the High Court pronounced before the 17th day of July, 1942, declaring the dismissal of a transferred employee by the board to have been invalid for want of the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, nor shall this section apply to, prejudice or affect any proceedings in the High Court to recover from the board arrears of salary which were instituted before the 17th day of July, 1942, by a transferred employee in respect of whom such judgment and declaration was so pronounced and made by the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Minister intends in this Bill to prevent any other persons coming along and making a claim against the Electricity Supply Board.  He is providing for the recognition of such legal rights as Mr. Cox had sustained for himself in the course of his proceedings against the Electricity Supply Board.  While one could understand that the Minister does not desire to leave a door open on technical grounds through which a very large number of persons might ultimately pass, unless there was some control over the door and some filtering of the folk who are likely to get through, I <Col N="2542" /> think the Minister is unconsciously doing an injustice to other persons.</P>
    <P>Before the judgment of the High Court was pronounced on the 17th July last, three other persons claimed that they were aggrieved by decisions of the Electricity Supply Board terminating their services for various reasons.  They claimed to be entitled to compensation from the Electricity Supply Board, the compensation representing the difference between the amount of pension they got on their premature superannuation and the amount which they would have got if they had continued to be employees of the Electricity Supply Board.  These three persons consulted a solicitor on the matter, and the solicitor in question communicated with the solicitor of the Electricity Supply Board.  In fact, in these three cases originating summonses were issued before 17th July, 1942.  In one case the originating summons was issued on 3rd December, 1941, the statement of claim was delivered on the 28th January, 1942, and a reply made by the solicitor to the Electricity Supply Board on the 11th May, 1942.  In that particular case the action was ripe for trial, but the Electricity Supply Board's solicitor, I understand, advised the plaintiffs' solicitor not to proceed with the matter until such time as it was ascertained what was likely to happen arising out of what is known as the Cox judgment. The solicitor for the plaintiffs, believing the matter would be discussed in relation to any judgment delivered in the Cox case, held his hand.  Nevertheless, in order to keep the door open for his clients, he issued an originating summons in another case on the 3rd January, 1942, and in a third case on the 21st January, 1942.</P>
    <P>I understand that these cases were the subject of correspondence and discussions between the solicitor for the Electricity Supply Board and the plaintiffs' solicitor.  There are only three cases concerned.  Were it not for the fact that the solicitor for the plaintiffs had been led to believe that their cases would be dealt with arising out of the Cox judgment or, in any case, that they would not be statute barred either by existing or prospective legislation, <Col N="2543" /> the solicitor for the plaintiffs held his hand and did not definitely institute the action in the courts which, in ordinary circumstances, he would have instituted.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are only three persons so affected.  Even if the entire claim were conceded it would not involve the Electricity Supply Board in an expenditure of more than £2,500.  As a matter of fact, the courts might well hold that these people were not entitled to any compensation, but in view of the fact that the originating summonses were issued before the critical date mentioned in Section 3 (7), that in fact the statement of claim had been submitted in one case and a reply filed by the Electricity Supply Board's solicitor, I think the Minister is unconsciously acting unfairly by not permitting these cases to be decided by the courts. Nobody wants to go to court to get recognition of his rights if it is possible to get recognition of his rights without going to court.  If the Minister is not prepared to agree to allow these persons to go to court in order to establish such rights as they feel they have, I think the least he should do is to ensure that the Electricity Supply Board, either on its own, or by the appointment of a civilian arbitrator, will allow the merits of the cases to be adjudicated upon and the persons concerned allowed to ventilate their grievances and to recover, either by arbitration or in law, such compensation as they feel they are entitled to, having regard to the extent of the loss which they have suffered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to accept this amendment under any circumstances whatever.  What the three persons now claim as a right is in fact a ground of action against the Electricity Supply Board on a most technical point of law.  On the basis of that very technical point, they are endeavouring to obtain something which it was never intended they should have and which they never thought themselves they had.  Employees of a local authority cannot be dismissed or retired without the consent of the <Col N="2544" /> Minister for Local Government.  A number of employees of the Dublin Corporation were transferred to the Electricity Supply Board, and the statute stated that they had on transfer the same rights as they had before being transferred.  A person named Cox, employed by the Electricity Supply Board, was dismissed from their employment, and properly dismissed. Nobody who had any dealings with the case, the judge who determined it, or myself, or any other person familiar with the facts, would express the opinion that Cox was not properly dismissed.  After a number of years had passed, he took an action against the Electricity Supply Board on the grounds that he should not have been dismissed without the consent of the Minister for Local Government. The court decided in his favour.  The Minister for Local Government had many years ago sought legal advice on the matter and had been advised that the consent was not necessary in cases of that kind.  I was urged from many quarters to bring, and I might have been justified in bringing forward here proposals to annul the decision in the Cox case.  I did not do so because I thought that, irrespective of the merits of the individual case, it would be a bad precedent to establish.  But certainly there could be no justification for giving the three other individuals who were retired from the service of the Electricity Supply Board a claim to large sums of money on the same technical point which they only realised existed after Cox had succeeded in getting his judgment.</P>

      <P>That is the judgment which appeared to give him a legal right to have been retained in the employment of the Electricity Supply Board, the judgment which held that his dismissal by the Electricity Supply Board many years previously was invalid on the technical point to which I have referred.  Why should we pick out these three people and give them a large sum of money?  Why not give the same right to all the employees of the Electricity Supply Board who, during the past ten years, were retired or dismissed from its service?  If there is, in fact, a basis of justice for the claim of these three individuals, it surely applies to all the other individuals in the same position.  These individuals have no claim whatever.  They were taken over by the Electricity Supply Board as transferred officers, they served in the Electricity Supply Board, and retired from its service, in the ordinary course of events, for one reason or another.  Now, because of this pure technicality they think that they can sustain a claim that they should not have been retired from the Electricity Supply Board and that they can recover from the Electricity Supply Board the full amount that they would have earned in salaries if they had been retained in employment in the Electricity Supply Board during those years.  It is solely on theoretical grounds that we are not moving to annual the judgment in the Cox case. He succeeded in getting a judgment in the court in his favour, was awarded a sum of money, and is getting away with it.  We are trying to stop anything like that happening in future, although, in the case of such people who had instituted proceedings, which were founded on the want of consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, we are proposing that they shall recover from the Electricity Supply Board any taxed costs which they incurred up to the date of the introduction of the Bill.  I think that that is the farthest that justice requires that we should go.  I could not, under any circumstances, agree to what Deputy Norton suggests.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not represent me as thinking, or setting forth in this Bill, that Mr. Cox had a right to the sum of money that he is going to get from the Electricity Supply Board.  He got a legal judgment in favour of his getting the money, but that, as I said, was awarded on a technical point of law. There is no question of his having a right to it, nor can there be any question of any other person having a right to it.  If the Minister for Local Government <Col N="2547" /> had been advised in 1931, or whenever it was that he sought advice, that his consent was technically required before a transferred officer could possibly be retired from the board, then this case would not have arisen.  He was not so advised, and when the matter went before the court and it was decided that the Minister for Local Government should have given his prior consent to the dismissal of the man.  These people, however, have no right.  They could have, before this Bill was introduced, sustained a legal claim to it, which is very different from a natural right.  In so far as they were concerned, they were employed by the Dublin Corporation, transferred to the Electricity Supply Board, employed by the Electricity Supply Board, and, on retirement, got the pensions which the 1927 Act provided for.</P>

      <P>(1)  This section applies to every person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  at any time after the passing of the Principal Act and before the passing of this Act, suffered loss of employment by reason of the closing of a generating station in pursuance of an Order under Section 61 of the Principal Act; and</P>
      <P>(b)  was awarded, under the First Schedule to the Principal Act, a pension for his life on account of such loss of employment; and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In this section the expression &ldquo;appropriate superannuation scheme&rdquo; means, in relation to a person to whom this section applies, the superannuation scheme under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942 (No. 17 of 1942), which would apply to him but <Col N="2549" /> for the provisions of sub-section (6) of section 7 of that Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person to whom this section applies may, by application in writing made to the board not later than one month after the confirmation by the Minister of the appropriate superannuation scheme, elect to receive from the board the like superannuation benefits as those which he would be entitled to receive under the appropriate superannuation scheme if that scheme applied to him.</P>
    <P>(4)  The following provisions shall have effect in relation to every person to whom this section applies who makes, within the time limited by the next preceding sub-section of this section, the application mentioned in that sub-section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where such person leaves the service of the board otherwise than on account of being discharged for misconduct, the pension awarded to him under the First Schedule to the Principal Act shall cease;</P>
    <P>(b)  such person shall be entitled to receive from the board the like superannuation benefits as those which he would be entitled to receive under the appropriate superannuation scheme if that scheme applied to him;</P>
    <P>(c)  for the purposes of the superannuation benefits to which he is entitled under the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section, the remuneration and the service of such person shall be computed in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this section;</P>
    <P>(d)  the provisions contained in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of sub-section (3) and in sub-sections (4) and (6) of Section 13 of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942 (No. 17 of 1942), shall apply as if herein reenacted in relation to such person.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a person to whom this section applies who has not made, within the time limited by sub-section (3) of this section, the application mentioned in that sub-section, leaves the service of the board otherwise <Col N="2550" /> than on account of being discharged for misconduct, the pension awarded to him under the First Schedule to the Principal Act shall cease and, in lieu thereof, he shall be paid by the board an allowance for life, not exceeding two-thirds of his remuneration, calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his remuneration for each year of his service.</P>
    <P>(6)  For the purposes of whichever of the two next preceding sub-sections of this section apply to him&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the remuneration of a person to whom this section applies shall be taken to be the aggregate of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the annual amount of the pension awarded to him under the First Schedule to the Principal Act, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the average annual amount paid to him by the board (otherwise than on account of the said pension) during the three years ending on the day on which he leaves the service of the board, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the service of a person to whom this section applies shall be taken to be the aggregate of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the service in respect of which he was awarded his pension under the First Schedule to the Principal Act, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  his continuous service (both before and after the passing of this Act) in the employment of the board after his entry into that employment subsequent to being awarded the said pension.</P>
    <P>(7)  No superannuation scheme under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942 (No. 17 of 1942), shall apply to or enable superannuation benefits thereunder to be received by any person to whom this section applies.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where a person is entitled to superannuation benefit or an allowance under this section from the board, he shall not be entitled to any other superannuation benefits or allowance from the board.</P>
    <P>(9)  All expenses incurred by the board under this section shall be defrayed <Col N="2551" /> as part of the general expenses of the board.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment, which, I think, meets the point in Deputy McGilligan's amendment, No. 4, is to give to the persons to whom it relates &mdash;that is, those persons who lost their employment on the closing of a generating station and who were subsequently employed by the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;a choice of benefits, on what might be termed the local government scale, or, alternatively, on the basis of whichever of the board's superannuation schemes applies in any particular case.  The section also enables service, up to the date of loss of employment, to be aggregated with service following resumption of work for the purpose of the calculation of benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £35,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for Allowances in Kind to certain Beneficiaries under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 to 1940, the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1938, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1940, and the <Col N="2552" /> National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1942 (No. 28 of 1939).</P>
    <P>As Deputies will remember, one of the reasons why it was decided to supplement the cash payments, available under various social services to necessitous people, by vouchers entitling them to receive specified quantities of certain foodstuffs was because, in present circumstances, the value of money is unstable.  It was appreciated that if additional cash benefits were given, the added purchasing power of the recipients would fluctuate with alterations in the prices of essential commodities and, under present circumstances, would tend to move downwards. It was considered that the more satisfactory method of dealing with an unstable situation such as the present was to supplement the cash allowances by these food vouchers, which would secure for the recipients thereof stated allowances of food, irrespective of what the prices of these foodstuffs might be from time to time.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the introduction of that system was that the actual cost of the food allowances scheme would vary with the variations in the price of foodstuffs and that additional funds would have to be provided to meet the cost of the food vouchers if the prices of the foodstuffs available on the vouchers should rise. Since the main Estimate for the year was introduced, there have been increases in the price of bread and in the price of butter.  The price of batch bread was increased by a penny per 4-lb. loaf from the 21st September and the retail price of butter was raised from 1/7 to 1/9 a pound, in May, and, on the 10th September, was further increased to 2/- a pound.  Consequently, the value of the vouchers represented in terms of cash has increased. The cost of cashing these vouchers when presented by the traders who have supplied the foodstuffs has risen and a Supplementary Estimate is necessary.  It is also necessary for another reason: When the price of bread rose by a penny per 4-lb. loaf.  in September, the Government decided to off-set the effect of that increase on persons coming within <Col N="2553" /> the scope of the food voucher scheme by increasing the quantity of bread which such persons could receive on their vouchers by 50 per cent.  That decision of the Government has also involved an increase in the cost of the food voucher scheme which is being provided for in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The effect of the decision to make an increase of 50 per cent. in the allowance of bread available on food vouchers was to improve the position of recipients of those vouchers to a greater extent than the actual increase in the cost of bread would have necessitated. A single person who ordinarily consumed, say, four 2-lb. loaves in the week, before the increase in the price of bread, would have received one loaf free on a voucher and would have had to purchase three loaves. In other words, such a person would have paid 1/6 in cash for his bread supply for the week.  Following the increase in the price of bread, off-set, as I have said, by the increased allowance of bread under the food voucher scheme, such a person would have to pay in cash, not 1/6, but 1/4½d. for his weekly bread supply, his bread supply remaining unchanged.  Similarly, the case of a family receiving, say, four food vouchers per week and using 20 2-lb. loaves in the week, the total cost of the bread prior to the 21st September was 10/- per week.  Of that, 2/- per week was met by the food vouchers and 8/- had to be provided in cash.  Consequent on the introduction of the revised arrangement, that family, although the total cost of the bread consumed by it had increased from 10/- to 10/10d., would have to provide only 7/7, instead of 8/-, in cash to obtain the same quantity of bread. These figures or any other comparisons that might be made substantiate the case that the position of the recipients of food vouchers was improved rather than disimproved as a result of the changes made by the Government following the increase in the price of bread.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year there were periods during which shortage of bread and of butter was experienced either generally or in particular districts <Col N="2554" /> and in these periods in the districts concerned some difficulty was experienced in meeting the requirements of food voucher holders.  Nevertheless, I think it can be said that the scheme has successfully withstood the periodic fluctuations in the supplies position and any difficulties which did arise have not been protracted. Towards the end of last spring, there was a brief period during which a widespread shortage of butter existed and complaints were received from some voucher holders in many areas of difficulties experienced by them in exchanging their butter vouchers for butter.  When the position improved, towards the end of May, arrangements were made through the post offices whereby holders of out-of-date butter vouchers, which could not be exchanged for butter during the period of scarcity, were enabled to obtain the quantity of butter represented by such vouchers.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies are aware that the introduction of butter rationing in Dublin has not affected the position of holders of butter vouchers under the food voucher scheme.  Persons in receipt of these vouchers are entitled to get the quantity of butter for which the vouchers provide and, in addition, if they so choose, to purchase the full ration available to citizens generally. The position in regard to butter, so far as the food allowances scheme is concerned, is now satisfactory and every effort is being made to ensure that the demands of the scheme in general are fully met at all periods of the year. Detailed arrangements for the allocation of butter in the Dublin area are in the hands of the Butter Marketing Committee set up by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to know how the scheme is operating.  It has now been in existence for over a year and, at the present time, food vouchers are being issued every week to approximately 84,000 persons.  Of the 84,000 persons who are receiving food vouchers, very nearly one half, that is to say, 40,000 of them are resident in the City of Dublin or in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.</P>

At the beginning, there was some difficulty, due to a misunderstanding amongst traders, as to the operation of the scheme, but it has completely disappeared.  The number of complaints received concerning the operation of the scheme are much fewer than I have experienced in connection with any other scheme operated by the Government.</P>

      <P>There is one thing that I would like to bring home to the Minister, and that is the large number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance to a maximum of 10/6 a week who have got no increase of any kind and are not entitled to food vouchers.  Does the Minister realise the difficulties and the hardships that such men are labouring under?  My views on food vouchers have not changed.  Even though the Minister may praise this scheme, I am and always have been of the opinion that, instead of providing men and women with food vouchers, they should be given a weekly income to be spent by them to the best advantage.  No increase whatever has been given to those unfortunate men in receipt of a maximum weekly sum of 10/6.  Their ages may range from 50 to 69 years.  How does the Minister justify not giving them an increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCann had a question down to-day about a number of them who are living in hostels in this city. They cannot even get free fuel. Does the Minister realise that it costs those men 7/6 a week to <Col N="2558" /> live in a hostel?  If they go to a doss house they have to pay 6d. or 8d.  a night.  That will cost them 4/6 a week.  How can they be expected to feed and clothe themselves on the 6/- which remain?  It is time, I think, that we got down to fundamentals instead of praising a scheme of food vouchers for a certain section of the community. Many of those unfortunate men have given 50 years in the service of the community.  Industry has now no further use for them and they are expected to live on this 10/6 a week. They are not entitled to free fuel or to the food vouchers.  Suppose those men were to go into the county homes what would it cost to maintain them there?  I suggest to the Minister that he should include them in this scheme.</P>

      <P>I addressed a question on this matter to the Minister for Local Government to-day.  I have been informed by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary that there are some 500 or 600 of those unfortunate men in the City of Dublin who are not being given the benefits of this scheme.  What I am pleading for is that the scheme should be extended so as to take in the recipients of 10/6 a week under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  These particular men are really forgotten men. They are in a special category.  They are not of military age and cannot fend for themselves.  They live in hostels and lodging houses.  All they have is the 10/6 a week.  Approximately 100 of them are staying in Iveagh House.  They are permanently resident there, and out of the 10/6 they have to give 7/- a week for their lodging.  What I want to bring home to the Minister is that the Dublin Board of Assistance has refused to relieve those men.</P>

If it is not within the power of his Department to do that, then I would ask him to have representations made on their behalf to the appropriate Department.

They are hoping to live until they become qualified to receive it.  What is to become of those elderly, unwanted people &mdash;unwanted so far as employment is concerned&mdash;between the ages of 65 and 70?  Through a wave of economy, the board of assistance in many cases curtailed the benefits and in others refused to provide for the type I have just mentioned.  I was grateful to the Minister for saying that there is an obligation on them to provide for the destitute.  I have a case in mind&mdash;I already mentioned it by way of interruption, probably at a wrong time, but I could not resist&mdash;where a man of 30 years of age had 10/6 unemployment assistance, 5/- or 6/- national health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I may be mixed up for the moment.  In any case, he had 10/6 from one source, I think 8/- from another, and 3/- fuel money from the <Col N="2560" /> Dublin Board of Assistance.  In all he had about £1 per week.  He was suffering from T.B., and went into hospital, where his arm was taken off.  After he came home, he came to me one morning and told me that 8/- had been deducted from him when he came out of the Dublin Union Hospital minus his arm.  He is going around this city, an unfortunate T.B. sufferer, with 10/6 a week and nothing else.  Some authority in this State, in order to justify their existence, took 8/- from him. Now I have given the case, and I gave the number.  The man's name is Fitzsimons. I was debarred from putting a question down on the grounds that I was probably using the Order Paper to get the Minister to instruct the authorities as to what to do; my question was disallowed.  I would ask the Minister to inquire how many applications for assistance, in those border-line cases of destitution, have been refused.</P>

I tried to start it myself a year or two years ago.  I did not get very far, but I was interviewing those T.B. patients regularly, and I saw their harsh treatment.

Some of those unfortunate men have to spend cold nights in 6d. lodging houses.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something for them.  God knows the time has come for this native Government to take people out of the destitution in which we see them.  I know that every other member of the House has the same experience as I have.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a small but very serious cross-section of what is a very big problem.  In all parts of the world where the impact of the war is felt&mdash;and that is pretty nearly everywhere on the globe&mdash;the ordinary attitude of those who are administering funds of this kind is that the people who have sub&mdash;standard wages or substandard conditions should be particularly attended to.  Recently, I asked the Minister a question in regard to people who were lucky enough to be at work.  I asked what was the percentage increase in wages since the war broke out, and I wanted to get a comparison between that increase in wages and the increase in the cost of living.  As far as I remember his figures, he said that there was an increase of about 3 per cent. in the wages of those engaged in the building industry, about 9 per cent. in a series of 25 protected industries, and about 20 per cent. in agriculture, but the cost of living all round had risen by over 40 per cent.  One can see immediately the amazing disadvantage <Col N="2562" /> that those people are under, owing to the fact that the war has come and that prices in this country have not been, either by subsidy or some other means, kept down to the pre-war level. How much more is the situation oppressive on the people whose case has been pleaded here to-day?  I would ask the Minister to take some better view of this situation, in the sense of trying to meet the acknowledged needs of the people who are at the point of having to get those food vouchers.  He must remember that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, came into this House about a year and a half ago and announced that the Revenue Commissioners, after their examination of the accounts of certain business people in this country, had told him that those people had definitely been taking advantage of the war situation to make greater profits than that Minister thought should be allowed.  He said that, through the taxation which he was going to impose, a sum of about £750,000 was to be got in that particular year.  Subsequently, he said he was not going to impose that taxation; he threw that £750,000 back to those people who were making extravagant profits.  What fraction of that sum would it take to do what Deputies here have pleaded for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a plea for the necessitous people in villages and towns, and in fact in the rural areas.  What case can the Minister make for not extending this scheme to those people?  Is not the cost of living as high in the towns as it is in the cities?  Is the cost of living any lower in towns which have not the privilege, if you like to put it that way, of having town commissioners or an urban council?  I think that distinction between the people who live outside those areas and the people who live inside them is one which requires some explanation.  This is not a very big additional allowance to give the people who live inside those areas, because, as Deputy McGilligan has said, the cost of living has increased considerably, and consequently the position of those people has been worsened. What then must be the position of people who have got no increase over <Col N="2563" /> and above the allowance they had before the war?  I think the Minister should address himself to that side of the matter and not pass so lightly over it.  He should not assume that he has done his duty completely by dealing with people in certain areas.  I have in mind places immediately outside the City of Cork, places like Douglas and Blarney, where there are necessitous people who do not come under the scope of this Estimate at all.  They are certainly not in any better position than the people who live inside the city, and there does not seem to be any adequate reason for their exclusion.  I would ask the Minister for some explanation as to his attitude towards those people.  Why is it that he has not extended the benefits of a scheme like this to the people who live in those areas where the cost of living is just as high as it is inside the cities and towns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been approached by people who are in receipt of national health benefits. The Minister referred to people who are in receipt of disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, but as far as I know some of them do not derive any benefit under this scheme, although in some cases they are in receipt of only 7/- or 8/- a week.  As other Deputies have pointed out, the cost of living in the small towns and in the rural areas has gone up, and I think this scheme is not properly developed in so far as these places are concerned.  The people living there are, in the main, deprived of the benefits of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own district I know of one man in receipt of national health.  He was disabled and he does not derive any benefit under this scheme.  I mention that matter so that the Minister may have an opportunity of looking into it.  He will then be in a position to see whether it is through a lack of publicity, or organisation amongst the different Departments, that these people are deprived of benefit under this scheme.  I am speaking mainly of the small towns and the rural areas where people are as badly off, if not <Col N="2564" /> worse off, than are the people in Dublin and other important centres of population.  It must be remembered that the cost of living has gone up in these places by leaps and bounds.  It is about time that the Minister should consider these people in the same light as he considers the others.  I shall be grateful if he will look into this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with previous speakers in appealing to the Minister to arrange for an extension of the food voucher system.  Seeing that the voucher system has been applied to widows and orphans and old age pensioners, I think we are entitled to ask why a line is drawn between widows and others in the country districts and those who reside in the urban and municipal areas.  Provision has been made in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act to give widows a certain stipend, but I should like Deputies to contemplate the position of a widow in a rural area trying to exist under present conditions on 5/- a week and being denied access to these food vouchers.  Imagine how she feels when she realises that she is denied access to this food voucher scheme.</P>
      <P>I have had repeated representations made to me pointing out the injustice that exists because of the line drawn between poor people living in the rural areas and poor people residing in the cities and towns.  Taking Limerick as an example, we find the people living in the municipal area entitled to avail of this scheme, while those living under similar conditions in an area immediately adjacent are not permitted to avail of it.  The same thing applies to other cities and towns in Éire.  These unfortunate people in the rural districts are condemned to live on 5/- a week, and I think, in all fairness, they should be permitted access to the food voucher scheme.  In view of the increase in the cost of living, many of these people are absolutely destitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy McCann, Deputy Byrne and other speakers in appealing to the Minister to extend this scheme indefinitely.  The widows who are placed on the lower scales under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act <Col N="2565" /> are the hardest hit, by reason of the very high cost of living, and I think there is a really strong case to be made for an extension of the food voucher system in that connection.  I do not think that in an extension of the scheme the Minister need fear opposition from any portion of the House.  He will be assured of general support, I feel certain, if he will extend this scheme so as to ensure that these food vouchers will be made available to the widows and their dependents who reside in areas outside those for which he has already catered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies have urged an extension of the food voucher scheme to classes of persons at present not covered by it. Deputy Keyes was anxious to assure us that if we do extend the scheme we will meet with no opposition from Parties in the House.  That may be quite true.  If proposals for extending the scheme were discussed here, there probably would be no opposition but when, say next May, the Budget is introduced, and taxation is proposed in order to find money to meet the cost of the scheme, Deputy Keyes, Deputy Hurley and all their colleagues will vote solidly against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am historically accurate, but perhaps the Deputies may be inclined to reform in the future and adopt a more consistent line; up to the present they have not done so.  Deputy Hurley asked that this scheme should be extended to recipients of unemployment assistance in rural areas, and Deputy Keyes suggested that it should be extended to other types of recipients in rural areas.  One of the difficulties of extending the food voucher scheme to <Col N="2566" /> rural areas is that it cannot be administered with the same facility, if at all, in rural areas as in urban areas.  I should say that in the majority of rural areas a food voucher scheme is impracticable, because the same type of trade organisation does not exist in these areas as exists in urban areas which would enable vouchers given to persons to be easily translated into specified quantities of goods.</P>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Hurley has been ignoring the announcements in the papers recently.  If he had been keeping in touch with events, he would have found that from a date early in this month unemployment assistance recipients in rural areas and in unincorporated towns have been receiving additional cash allowances equivalent to 1/6 in respect of each dependent, representing a very substantial addition to the amount of unemployment assistance payable in these areas.  It is true, on the basis of city prices of foodstuffs, that the cash addition to the dependents' allowances under the Unemployment Assistance Act in rural areas is not fully equivalent to the value of the food vouchers, but on the basis of rural costs, it probably is.  It certainly represents a substantial addition to the amount payable to persons with dependents in rural areas under the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not talk about them when he was speaking. He introduces them only by way of interruption.  When he was speaking he referred to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  That practical difficulty which I have mentioned will prevent the adoption of the suggestion made by Deputy Keyes, that food vouchers should be granted to other classes resident in the rural areas.  It may be that the periodic review of the position which the Government undertake will occasion an alteration in the rates of assistance under each of the social services in rural areas as well as in urban areas.  None of these arrangements is static.  They all will be, and some already have been modified to meet the changing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2567" /> Deputy McGilligan, who spoke about the need for making special provision for those who are at the bottom of the social scale, persons who are dependent on the assistance which they get through the social services, missed a significant fact.  It may be that the amounts provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, the Old Age Pensions Act, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act&mdash;all these measures designed to establish or extend the social services of the State&mdash; were, before the war, inadequate to deal with the then existing conditions.</P>
    <P>That case was often made here and I do not know that it was ever seriously contested.  In fact, the attitude of the Government then was that the measure of the assistance given was determined only by the resources of the country and the extent to which these resources could be earmarked for that specific purpose; but, on the assumption that the unemployment assistance payments and other social service allowances before the war were as much as the State could be expected to contribute, they are no worse now. In fact, in consequence of the introduction of this food voucher scheme and the expansion of the dependants' allowances to unemployment assistance recipients in rural areas, there has taken place a proportionately greater increase in the amounts available to unemployment assistance recipients than the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>Reference was made here to the case of single men.  It is correct that the food voucher scheme does not apply to single men without dependents.  Deputies, however, have spoken as if all these men without dependents were elderly people and incapable of working.  A number of them are, of course, young men.  In fact, statistics show that the majority of the single men without dependents registered under the Unemployment Assistance Act are comparatively young men, and I do not think we should leave out of account in present circumstances the fact that a number of these men are eligible to enrol in the Defence Forces.  We have not got anything like military or industrial conscription in this country, but the obligation on the community to provide maintenance for young single men must obviously be conditioned by the willingness of these people to give service to the nation of a kind which is very urgently required.  I have said, however, that the existing scheme of food vouchers, or any of the social services provided by the State, are not static. They are capable of being modified, and will be modified as changing circumstances appear to make it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn raised the question of persons in receipt of national health <Col N="2571" /> insurance benefits.  The national health insurance scheme is, of course, an insurance scheme.  Persons coming under that scheme pay contributions which entitle them to receive certain benefits when in ill-health.  These benefits are payable to them as of right and they are payable to them irrespective of their personal circumstances. There is no means test for the receipt of these benefits, and it would be wrong to assume that all the persons who are entitled to national health insurance benefits are in need, to the extent that the State must step in to provide additional assistance for them by means of food vouchers or otherwise.  In so far as these persons are in need, it may be necessary to provide for them, but not on the ground that they are national health insurance benefit recipients.  That ground alone is not sufficient to qualify them, nor would it be advisable to extend the food voucher scheme to all such persons without some effort to ascertain their need for additional assistance from the community, the doing of which would involve substantial increases.</P>
    <P>We must not leave out of our minds, as Deputies are frequently inclined to do, that the social services provided by the State are supplemented, and intended to be supplemented, by the assistance from local authorities.  The Government has given substantial financial assistance to the home assistance authorities to enable them to make additional assistance available in present emergency circumstances to cases of various kinds.  The only persons coming under the national health insurance scheme who are receiving food vouchers are those who are in receipt of disability pensions.  It is necessary in administering a scheme of this kind to have the persons to whom it applies more or less easily identifiable.  Persons receiving disability pensions under the national health insurance scheme are in much the same category as old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans.  Their status is not likely to change, and arrangements are made to deal with them on the assumption <Col N="2572" /> that their conditions are not likely to be changed at all.</P>
    <P>That could not be said about persons receiving ordinary national health insurance benefit.  A person may be ill for a week, a fortnight, a month, or for varying times, and the adaptation of a scheme of this kind to the varying circumstances of a number of individuals such as these would be a matter of administrative difficulty.  It is possible to do it under the Unemployment Assistance Act because we have an arrangement which involves the constant attendance of unemployment assistance benefit recipients at State offices at which their conditions are checked.  They have, in fact, to prove in each week that the conditions under which they receive unemployment assistance have been maintained.  That administrative machine does exist to deal with unemployment assistance benefit and that is why it was possible to extend the voucher scheme in their cases.  I appreciate perhaps more than most Deputies that conditions now existing are likely to disimprove rather than to improve while the war lasts, and that normally the provision now being made by the State to alleviate hardship arising from those conditions will prove to be inadequate in future, if the war persists.  The only thing I can say to the House is that the Government is fully aware of its responsibility in the matter, and within the limit of the resources available to it will try to discharge it.  We must not, however, leave out of account the fact that the national resources are, at the same time, diminishing, that the effect of the war on productive activity here has been serious, and that it is with constricting resources the State is trying to discharge its liability to its own people.  The resources of this community are not unlimited, and we cannot make provision that would ensure everybody against the possibility of hardship.  Hardship is almost inevitable in circumstances like the present, but the Government will do its best in order to minimise it, and to ensure that the burden falling upon particular individuals will not be unduly severe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,862 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When presenting the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting for the current financial year to the Dáil in June last, I intimated that while I regarded the programme of Radio Eireann as of satisfactory standard taking existing broadcasting resources into account, I considered that the standard fell below what might reasonably be expected from the national station.  Taking the view, with which there will be no disagreement, that the programmes should reflect the national culture at its highest, I said that it would be in <Col N="2574" /> the best interests of the country that, consistent with national finances, the broadcasting service should have at its disposal resources sufficient to enable it to function on a level worthy of Irish cultural tradition, presenting programmes of good standard, varied, educative and entertaining, reflective of the best and most characteristic of the national activities.  I indicated certain aspects which I considered reasonably called for improvement and said that when the examination of a scheme for the purpose, on which I was at the time engaged, had been completed, I hoped again to approach the Dáil for approval of such additional financial provision as might be involved.</P>
    <P>A scheme of programme improvements estimated to cost £11,150 in a full year has been prepared and the Supplementary Estimate which I am now submitting represents the cost up to the end of the current financial year, March, 1943&mdash;estimated at £3,862.  The additional expenditure falls wholly under sub-heads A and B, and the following are the details:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The additional outlay under sub-head A, representing an increase of £1,265, will be wholly on the orchestra.  The present orchestra consists of 28 members, a combination which is inadequate for all round programme work.  I am proposing an increase of 12, i.e., to 40 members, which I regard as the minimum necessary to secure an adequate standard of per formance.  I would like indeed to see an even larger augmentation, but at present circumstances do not admit of the proper utilisation of an orchestra of greater size in general programme work.  In time I hope it may be possible for broadcasting to have a full symphony orchestra of 60 members regularly engaged.  With such a combination the status of Irish broadcasting would be immensely raised and, through the influence of the highly artistic and varied broadcasts which would become practicable, national musical effort and appreciation would be materially stimulated.  Meantime the lesser augmentation from 28 to 40 which is proposed will effect a marked and most desirable improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2575" /> With the object of utilising the enlarged orchestra to the utmost advantage and, incidentally, of effecting a reduction in the time now occupied by gramophone records it is proposed to increase the attendance of the members for the purpose of both rehearsals and broadcasts by about 20 or 25 per cent.  Improved rates of pay for existing personnel are also contemplated, viz., £6 a week for men (instead of £5); £5 a week for women (instead of £4).  For new entrants the existing rates of £5 a week (men), and £4 a week (women), would be operative during a probationary period of not less than a year, after which, if their services were being retained, they would be allowed the higher rates.  The remuneration of the leader of the orchestra, under the new conditions, will be £8 a week for a man, and £7 a week for a woman.  In addition to their remuneration as ordinary members the deputy leader and the leading strings will receive an extra 10/- a week, and the leading wood wind and brass 5/- a week.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B, representing an increase of £2,597 an important item of this provision is the contemplated setting up of a radio chorus.  The production of opera from the studios at suitable intervals is an extremely desirable feature, and it will be necessary to have a chorus available for the purpose, as well as for part-singing and general choir work.  I have in mind a chorus of 24 members whose remuneration will be on an engagement basis. Very careful selection will be necessary, as it is of the utmost importance that the most suitable voices available be secured.</P>
    <P>Funds are also being provided to enable improved fees to be paid to &ldquo;outside&rdquo; artists&mdash;musicians, authors, actors, etc.  What I have in mind is not that the increased funds shall, automatically, mean increased fees for all broadcasting artists, but that the prospect of larger fees than we have been hitherto able to afford will attract to broadcasting people of particular competence who have heretofore felt that the fees paid were not commensurate with their professional standing and have consequently kept <Col N="2576" /> aloof.  It is, of course, our intention also to pay better fees to certain artists who, more or less, frequently participate in the performances and who, on account of the high standard of their work, are not adequately remunerated under the present scale of fees.</P>
    <P>In submitting the Broadcasting Estimate for the current year, I mentioned that the innovation of presenting the Abbey Players and Longford Productions in representative plays on Sunday evenings had proved particularly popular; and that these, alternating with the station production of important original plays and the dramatisations of such works as <i>Knocknagow,</i> etc., had produced a marked increase of public interest in radio plays.  The extra expenditure incurred by the broadcasting of these plays and dramatisations in the year 1941-42 was made possible only by economies effected through the extension of the use of recorded programmes during the summer months.  It is hoped, with the increased funds which will now be available, that we shall be able to extend still further the presentation of plays and dramatisations on these lines without interfering in any way with our plans for the improvement of the programmes generally.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious to encourage the development of musical activities in the provinces and, with that object, broadcasting will be prepared to take relays and to contribute to the cost of a limited number of good class concerts in various provincial centres where there are musical societies of standing&mdash;subject, of course, to the director being satisfied as to the general standard of the concert programmes. The acting music director has already made contacts in this connection, and seven concerts which have been taken on the new basis have proved reasonably successful.</P>
    <P>In view of its great national importance the development of Irish music will in future receive special attention. While there has been a certain revival in respect of Irish compositions and arrangements to meet requirements in recent years, it has been inconsiderable <Col N="2577" /> in volume and too restricted in scope.  There is a considerable amount of national music which is practically unknown.  The great bulk of the people are only acquainted with Irish music through the traditional fiddle, piano accordeon, choirs and ceilidhe bands.  Arrangements for orchestral and small string and wind combinations are badly needed, and funds for the purpose are being provided experimentally in the hope and expectation that very useful results will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The public symphony concerts held fortnightly in the Mansion House are this season again proving most successful and popular.  These performances were undertaken as an experiment and with a certain amount of misgiving, and their success is clear proof that there is a definite and increasing public demand for what is best in music.  A most gratifying feature of the concerts is, as I mentioned in June last, that the audiences are for the most part composed of young people, indicating the existence of a widespread cultural trend amongst our younger generation, which in their own and in the general interests should be encouraged to the utmost.  I trust that the improved broadcasting programmes in the studios and before the public, which I hope to provide under the financial authority I am now seeking from the Dáil, may prove to be a helpful factor.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can quarrel with this additional expenditure. I think there has been an improvement in the programmes recently, particularly in regard to the programmes contributed by the orchestra. I am very glad that the Minister has decided to encourage the broadcasting of more Irish music and Irish tunes that are not generally known.  Taken generally, his statement has been quite satisfactory, but there are one or two matters to which I should like to call attention.  Firstly, I think that broadcasting from our station is of too limited a duration.  The station is closed down for a considerable portion of the day.  I see no reason why the station should not be kept going practically <Col N="2578" /> the whole day, I think this is one of the services which not only pays for itself, but out of which there is a considerable sum left over at the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I am disappointed with the statement of the Minister on this Estimate.  I had hoped that consequent upon the debate on the main Estimate that the Minister would have brought in, as he promised &mdash;he did not promise to bring forward an Estimate that would allow of a 100 per cent. increase in the expenditure on the daily programme, but he promised to bring in an Estimate that would permit of a substantial increase in fees in the case of programmes generally&mdash;an Estimate that would allow of a substantial increase in fees. What does this £11,000 in a full year mean?  Even taking salaries, wages and allowances, which, of course, cover the salaries of members of the orchestra, it really means, roughly, an increase of 40 per cent. all round in fees.  When we of the Writers', Actors', Authors' and Musicians' Association, submitted a memorandum to the Minister on this question, we hoped, as I have said, that there would be a considerable increase in fees, but a 40 per cent. increase upon a copyright fee of £1 is very small indeed.  The Minister has stated that it is the intention of Radio Eireann to use this additional money to induce authors, who are more or less famous and who have made a name for themselves, to contribute to the programmes. If the Minister intends to pay these men in any degree adequately, there will be very little left for the young Irish author who is trying to make his way at home and with whom I have always been concerned&mdash;the young man who comes into Radio Eireann, hands in a script which it has taken him probably a month to write, and receives 10/6 for his trouble.  I am not blaming the Minister so much, and I find it very difficult to blame the director of Radio Eireann.  I think he is an excellent director and that he has a very competent staff, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are mysterious mandarins over in the Department of Finance who hold sway.  I am sure the Minister has done his best.

      <P>I would like to see Radio Eireann a truly national station and reaching a high cultural standard.  It will never reach a national cultural standard while it is regarded by certain people merely as an amateur concert hall. You will not get talent, you will not get writers, unless you pay for it.

      <P>While that point is being cleared up, I would like to join with Deputy McCann in the representations he is making on behalf of artists.  I understand that some improvement was <Col N="2584" /> made in the situation that obtained three or four years ago, when people were invited to come a distance&mdash;as far as from Donegal&mdash;and then offered something like two or three guineas for their contribution to the programme. It must be manifest to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that, if the standard of culture of Radio Eireann is to be of such a character as to do credit to the station, some kind of attractive fee must be offered to people who broadcast. Otherwise, as Deputy McCann says, the station will get nobody but enterprising amateurs.  Those who are in a position to demand a reasonable fee simply will not bother to go to Radio Eireann.  That would not matter so much if Radio Eireann were heard within the confines of this country and nowhere else, but Radio Eireann is heard abroad&mdash;all over Great Britain and in other parts of the world, I believe&mdash;and people are prone to form a judgment on the general cultural level of this country on what they hear from Radio Eireann.  I do not think the best friend of Radio Eireann at the present time would maintain that the programmes disseminated from that station represent the cultural level of this country.  What does sub-head B cover in the main Estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I shall wait.  I do urge that Deputy McCann's representations receive favourable consideration. A fee which might be reasonable in the case of an artist whose services would be retained repeatedly over 12 months might be grossly inadequate in the case of a person without any reasonable expectation of being retained more than two or three times in the year. I think that it would be reasonable to tender to a musician or singer of distinction a fee as large as £10 10s.  If the Minister were giving a party in his house and invited a singer to come and sing to his company, would he be quite satisfied if the Minister offered him two or three guineas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We have paid even more than £10 10s. to a really distinguished artist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, the question arises: what does the Minister mean by &ldquo;distinguished artist&rdquo;?  I think that artists who are invited to give a programme of music from Radio Eireann ought to be distinguished artists within the meaning of that term when you restrict it to Irish nationals. You ought not to ask people who have no claim to distinction to entertain the listening public here and, in addition, those in Great Britain or Northern Ireland who may be listening.  The effect of engaging so many artists who have no claim to distinction, and who are glad to get three guineas is that distinguished artists are reluctant to come forward, as the station has the reputation of paying inadequate fees. No person would care to enter into a wrangle with officers of Radio Eireann as to whether he was a distinguished singer or not.  The artist comes forward and offers his modest talent for what it is, and he does not want a preliminary <Col N="2586" /> argument as to whether he comes within the term &ldquo;distinguished artist&rdquo; or not.  All that he undertakes to do is to sing his best and, if that is good enough, he ought to be paid for his contribution.</P>
      <P>It is a bad thing to segregate artists into two classes&mdash;those who are distinguished and entitled to an adequate fee and those who are indistinguished and are glad to get what they can.  I suggest that any artist invited to sing for Radio Eireann, particularly during the evening hours when the listening public are supposed to have their sets turned on, ought to be deemed to be a distinguished artist.  Nobody but those who come within that category ought to be invited to sing for Radio Eireann.  It would be better to put on a gramophone record than to invite them.  If the matter is not approached from that point of view, the level of performance of Radio Eireann will continually tend to fall.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the constant pressure&mdash;which is quite natural when dealing with public money&mdash;to reduce expenditure and the fact that every spending Department is being urged by the Department of Finance to cut down expenses, I foresee the danger that, even if the opportunity presented itself to Radio Eireann to retain a distinguished artist, within the Ministerial meaning, every night of the year, pressure by the Department of Finance might easily induce Radio Eireann to decide that they would only have a distinguished artist on four nights of the week and provide a cheaper programme on the remaining nights.  That would be a wholly mistaken policy.  The more excellent you make the wares you have to sell, the greater custom you create.  I have detected throughout the whole Department of Posts and Telegraphs and this Department of Wireless Broadcasting, for which the Minister is responsible, a tendency consistently to lag behind demand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to programmes and so forth.  Instead of waiting on revenue to rise to such levels that they might venture to be extravagant, their duty is to raise the programmes to so high a level as will induce a larger number to take out licences and thus increase the revenue. They are always afraid to do that They want to wait until revenue rises in order to make improvements.  That is a wholly fallacious and mistaken policy to pursue.  The way to increase the revenue is to improve the programmes. No business has succeeded that did not overspend in the initial stages and reap the benefits of that overspending in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would, for about 12 months, try the policy of presenting programmes far more expensive and of far higher quality than the present revenue would appear to justify, he would be astonished to discover that the increased revenue acquired by that policy would make the rate of expenditure appear modest and would enable him in future years to build up a standard of entertainment analogous to that presented by the B.B.C., which is none too high, or, better still, to that the commercial programmes at present being diffused on American networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It often strikes me as odd&mdash;I suppose it is due to the policy of national self-sufficiency&mdash;that we, in this country, do not deem it our duty to compare our achievements with those of other countries.  We are a small country, with limited resources, but if you compare the programmes being provided by Radio Eireann with the programmes of the Columbia Broadcasting Company or any other member of the broadcasting chain in America, you will realise that, if the American public were offered what we are offered, there would be no revenue at all.  These immensely wealthy corporations <Col N="2588" /> would not exist under these conditions.  These great corporations built up their immense strength and present wealth by consistently giving the public more than the public expected, until they succeeded in planting a radio set in practically every house in America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to spend more money and to spend it courageously.  I think that he ought to tell us, when he is winding up, something with regard to the advertising position.  Are we to assume that this specific appropriation is over and above the revenue he expects to derive from advertising or are we to assume that it is made in anticipation of a diminution of the advertising revenue in the time to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a proper answer to me to say that of course the great American broadcasting organisations are enabled to provide the high standard of entertainment they give and to pay the high fees they pay as a result of the advertising revenue mainly, not as a result of fees paid for licences.  What is the Minister's intention in regard to that matter?  Does he intend to go on looking for more advertising revenue, or does he intend to adopt the B.B.C. policy and drop advertising revenue altogether and finance the station from the licence fees and subsidies from the Exchequer?  If he does mean to drop the advertising revenue altogether, I think there is a good deal to be said for that policy.  But I suggest to him that he ought to go with his ears back and his head down and insist that the Department of Finance will give him <Col N="2589" /> sufficient money to provide programmes of which this country can be proud and of which nobody in the country need be ashamed if we have reason to believe that they are being overheard in Great Britain, France, or in any other part of the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon was not here when the Minister introduced the Supplementary Estimate or he would have been as surprised as I was to hear that there was such a deficiency on the side of reality in the Minister's association with the station as to enable him to use this phrase; that what he was aiming at, and apparently hoping to achieve to some degree, was to make this station representative of national culture at its highest.  I should like to see that written up over the station as, so to speak, the objective that this station should aim at.  But anybody who would say that we are within 100 years of it would, I think, he speaking in terms of the highest exaggeration.  As to the £100,000 which is got in the way of revenue, I put it to the Minister that if he closed down this station he would, in fact, get the greater part of that revenue still.  There are very few who pay for the joy of listening to this particular station.  They pay because they can get programmes from outside, and I am certain that the greater part of his revenue would still be assured to him if the station were wiped off the face of the earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How far he will get towards a realisation of the ideal which he raised to a very high pitch by a lot of the matter he gave to the House in introducing the Estimate, how far he is going to get this station to be representative of national culture at its highest by this expenditure of nearly £4,000 or £11,000 for a full year, I do not know, but I have great doubts whether he will get any length at all.  The numerical strength of the orchestra is to be added to, and, secondly, those in the orchestra are to get something higher in the way of the rate of pay.  It will take a very selective ear in the near future to detect the difference made in the wood-wind and brass performers by <Col N="2590" /> the 5/- a week extra they will get by this amazing effort on the part of the Minister.  What he is going to give by way of strength I do not know.  I do not know where he is going to get the people or where he thinks he will recruit people of quality for the wages he finds it possible to offer under this increase.</P>
    <P>The station has always suffered from the Department of Finance.  There is no question of secrecy about that. Always it has been looked upon as a poor thing by Ministers of Finance in succession, right from the start.  They have always crabbed the efforts of those trying to get good entertainment for the people.  I think Deputy Dillon is right in saying that the past was not too glowing.  From what we can look back upon there will not be very much achieved by the additional moneys now being granted.  Personally, I cannot speak from close attention to the programmes of Radio Eireann, because I have got into the habit simply of taking samples from time to time. Apart from the symphony concerts that the Minister spoke of, I find it impossible to discover any improvement. If I judge by the old test we used to apply&mdash;not to the big corporations in America, or even the B.B.C.&mdash;when there was a station in the North of Ireland, I do not think our station would stand out happily in comparison with that station when it was going.  Now we are to get this addition of £11,000, part of which is to be spent on increasing the strength of the orchestra and £2,597 of which is to be spent in the engagement of artists to achieve the development which we are to get.  I suppose more frequently we will get an opportunity of listening to some better type of artist than is at present being put on.  I do not know how far that sum will allow the Minister any great development.  I see very little prospect of it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, as Deputy Dillon has suggested, that he should ask the Department of Finance to let him go on a &ldquo;burst&rdquo; for a year, have a good fling for a year and spend the whole revenue.  It would only set the country back £30,000.  If I were to select a couple of profiteers, I would <Col N="2591" /> get that £30,000 back immediately and not a penny need lie on the community. You might get a few well-earned squeals from some people, but I think the public would love to hear even their squeals over the radio if it were pointed out who they were and that the reason they were squealing was because of the ill-gotten gains which had been extracted from them.  The relatively small sum of £30,000, which is the remnant of what the station earns but does not spend, would enable the Minister, in any event, to do this: he could make some attempt at showing the people what could be done by the application of an extra sum of money.</P>
    <P>I am not sure, however, that money is the whole thing.  I am not sure that the mere provision of money for the engagement of artists, or for making better provision by way of money for artists, will mend matters.  I have always felt that there was a certain amount of lack of imagination about the whole running of the station.  I am not sure that it is a question of people not coming forward, even possibly reluctantly and regretfully, for the particular money offered.  I think some people still in the country could be induced to come forward if they felt they were going into a proper setting.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people feel that they are being presented in a very peculiar atmosphere, that they are not being presented in a successful show, that they are staging something which is almost decrepit and run down and about to be wound up.  The general feeling with regard to the whole service is very much like that.  It may be that money is at the back of the whole thing.  But, apart from money, I think there is something else, something to do with the particular way in which the station is run and the particular viewpoint expressed there.</P>
    <P>The matter Deputy Dillon was speaking about, the matter which is not indicated by &ldquo;etc.&rdquo;, would, apparently, not be in order.  I can only say that this is another example of the institutions in this country, which are <Col N="2592" /> so definitely being conducted on the spoils system that, when a change is made, there will be no alternative except, in the main, to pitch out those connected with the worst feature, the prejudiced running of the station at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde objects to the number of hours being too short. One of the limiting factors there is the fact that we have to be economic in regard to the amount of electricity used.  The amount of electricity used by the station is very large indeed and, in present circumstances, we have to keep that down.  When introducing the original Estimate, I had in mind that we would have to increase the hours. But, having regard to the shortage of electricity during the summer months and the shortage which may occur again at any time, there was no use in changing our hours because we might have to disappoint the public suddenly by another change.  Of course it would be quite impossible to have the station going all day, because that would mean an enormous cost which would be far beyond our revenue.  As a matter of fact, the amount mentioned here&mdash;that total of £70,000&mdash;does not include services from the Post Office, and so on, which bring up the expenditure to £97,353, and the amount of money that we are getting in this year is only £104,000.  So we are getting closer to the mark, so far as the amount of money at our disposal is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so, but it still means that we have to pay the cost of electricity, engineers, and so on.  Frankly, I should like to be able to take part in this attack on the Department of Finance.  I should very much like to be able to do so, if it <Col N="2593" /> meant that we could get some more money from them, but after all you have only to refer to the last Estimate to which we listened in this House to realise that the national revenue and expenditure on other matters of a much more serious nature from the point of view of the necessities of the people have all to be taken into consideration, and I have to have regard to that, no matter how much I may want to improve the station.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy McGilligan has not taken a more continuous interest in the station because I think that, if he had, he would have found that the production, for instance, of the Abbey plays or of the Longford Productions has been very excellent indeed, and that some of the other dramatisations have been of a very high standard also.  I do not mean that every item is of a high standard. After all, when you have programmes on every night, for so many hours, and with continuous programmes, it would be absurd to claim that they are all of a very high standard.  Some of them, however, are extremely good.  My own idea would be to have shorter hours and maintain a high standard rather than to have longer hours and try to fill in the time with secondary matter, but I think that if the Deputy would listen in to some of our dramatisations, and to some of the other things, on which we rather fancy ourselves, to put it that way, he would find that we compare very favourably with other countries Certainly, our dramatic productions compare very favourably with those of any other country&mdash;the Columbia Productions of America or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I may also say that the orchestra have improved enormously, partly owing to the encouragement given to them by an enthusiastic public.  We have certainly nothing to be ashamed of, so far as the orchestra is concerned. They have not, perhaps, reached as high a standard as we should like, but when we are able to pay more, I am sure that they will reach a very high standard, because the Irish people are extremely musical and are capable of producing very excellent music.</P>

      <Col N="2594" /> I think that Deputy McCann, in his remarks, was adverting to the fees that were paid some years ago, and did not advert to the fact that the fees paid now are much higher.  We pay £3 for 15 minutes, and £2 very occasionally, and, on the whole, I think there is something to be said for paying such fees to the younger people who are coming along for the first time and getting an advertisement all over the country by getting the script on at all. Even so, however, they will not get less than two guineas even now, and some people get four to five guineas, if they are of a high standard.  A very distinguished artist&mdash;say, a well-known concert artist&mdash;gets from £10 to £20. Others get £3 for 15 minutes, and some get £4 or £5, while others get £2 for ten minutes.</P>
    <P>As to what you are going to pay an artist, it is just exactly the same as if you were running a theatre or a variety entertainment.  The directorate must decide, in their own judgment, which artist is to be considered worth more money and which is to be considered worth less money, and there is no use in people here, or even the Minister, intervening in matters like that.  It must be left to those who are in an expert position&mdash;unless, of course, there was some crying scandal which required to have attention drawn to it, which certainly has not occurred.</P>
    <P>With reference to advertising, that does not exactly arise here.  The fact is that we are always prepared to accept advertisements at our rates, and we have even offered to accept them at reduced rates, but at the present time there does not seem to be any desire on the part either of the agencies or of advertisers generally to avail of that.  I need hardly say that we would be very pleased if people did come forward.</P>
    <P>We did expect that, owing to the shortage of paper and the limitation on newspapers, we might have some more advertising offered to us.  We have laid down rules by which the advertisements would compete as little as possible with the smaller advertisements by, say, retail traders, in the newspapers, <Col N="2595" /> but apart from that we were hoping that other types of advertisements would come our way, and we are willing to co-operate with the newspapers in an advertising scheme, but I am sorry to say that it has not come to anything so far.  However, we are always open to accept co-operation in that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say.  I am very optimistic about the prospects and I think, considering the times that are in it, that we are <Col N="2596" /> not doing too badly at the moment, and, like Oliver Twist, I feel that I shall come back for more later, and that it would be reasonable, from the point of view of the country in general, for me to ask for more money.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Estimate reported and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. Wednesday, 9th December.</P>
