      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he received the signed statements of five Irish seamen concerning their arrest, imprisonment, trial and acquittal in Lisbon in the early part of the present year; whether he is aware these men allege that on January 21st they were improperly arrested by the Portuguese police; that they were detained in a prison in which for several weeks they were obliged to sleep in their clothes on prison boards; that two of them were herded with disease-infected criminals in a filthy and verminous condition; that their food in the prison, Cadeis Civis Limeerio, consisted only of soup twice a day; that some of them contracted fever; that after three months' detention they were brought to trial and acquitted of the charges preferred against them; whether he is aware that no compensation was paid these men in respect of arrest and treatment during detention; that they were not paid money due to them by the Irish shipping companies by which they were employed; and that their property was not restored to them by the Portuguese police authorities; and whether he will state what steps he is taking to obtain compensation for these men from the Portuguese Government, and the payment of the money due to them by their employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="628" /> for External Affairs whether his attention was directed to the allegation of the seamen, Francis Maher and Christopher Eastwood, that during their incarceration in a Portuguese prison from January 21st to April 28th, 1942, they were not once visited by the Irish Chargé d'Affaires in Lisbon; that they wrote several letters to the Chargé d'Affaires at the Irish Legation, asking for an interview for the purpose of obtaining his advice in regard to their imprisonment and the intolerable conditions of the prison; that the only reply to these communications was a message from the Legation stating that the matter was receiving attention; that, in contrast with the inattention of our representative in Lisbon, the British Consul visited the men in prison and secured their removal to another place of detention; whether the Minister has taken any and, if so, what action on the information in the matter supplied to him on June 11th; and, further, whether he will make available the papers in this case with an intimation that an inquiry will be undertaken into the neglect of duty alleged against the Chargé d'Affaires in Lisbon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I have an extensive file about this matter, and my knowledge of it is not confined to the statements referred to by the Deputy.  From what I know of it, I am satisfied that there is no case for making any representations or claim for compensation to the Portuguese authorities.</P>
      <P>As regards the payment of any moneys due to these men by their employers, that is obviously a matter between the men and the companies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statements made in the second question are inaccurate and misleading. The arrest of these men took place on 21st January.  The Chargé d'Affaires took up office in Lisbon on 6th February.  Shortly afterwards the arrangements for the transfer of the <Col N="629" /> men to a place of detention providing improved conditions were made by the men's employers through their agents in Lisbon at the instance of the Chargé d'Affaires.  The Chargé d'Affaires visited the Portuguese Foreign Ministry about the case on the 10th February and on five subsequent occasions.  The men were visited by the Acting Secretary of the Legation on 23rd March.  The Chargé d'Affaires wrote to them on 26th March, and again on 15th, 17th and 24th April, giving them necessary advice and information.  A member of the staff of the Legation attended the trial which took place on 28th April.</P>
    <P>The information at my disposal shows that, far from being negligent, the Chargé d'Affaires at Lisbon was active and zealous in looking after the interests of these men, and that there is good reason why they should be grateful for his efforts.  The allegation of neglect of duty contained in the question is, in my opinion, to say the least of it, unwarranted.</P>

      <P>The reinstated officers at present serving in the Civil Service resigned or were dismissed from the British Civil Service for a variety of political reasons.  No statistics have been compiled of the number of such officers who refused to take the Oath of Allegiance in the years 1918 to 1921, and all the cases have long since been finally disposed of by the issue of certificates under the Superannuation and Pensions Act; 1923, or the Superannuation Act, 1936. In view of the length of time that has elapsed, the number of officers who refused to take the oath could not now be ascertained except at an altogether disproportionate expenditure of time and labour.  If the Deputy is seeking information regarding any particular case or cases, my Department will be glad to facilitate him with any information which is available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there are a number of mills throughout the country worked by water power and fully equipped for the manufacture of flour from wheat; if he will grant to those of them who are prepared to purchase wheat and mill it into flour a licence under the same conditions, including subsidy, as those held by other flour millers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative. I am not at present prepared to grant any further milling licences.  I am prepared to consider, however, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="632" /> applications for permits to mill home-grown wheat only.  Under the provisions of Emergency Powers Order No. 165 such permitted mills may mill only for growers, but not for sale, and only to the extent indicated in the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, will he or the Minister not consider that at the moment it is advisable to grant licences to such millers as I have referred to, in view of the state of transport?  It would mean the saving of the cartage of the wheat 35 and 40 miles to mills, and the cartage of the flour the same distance back from the mills, which is an important consideration at the moment, when the Minister tells us that we shall have no transport at all very shortly.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider going into this matter with a view to seeing that the milling will be done by these water mills, where the wheat can be milled as efficiently as it can be by other mills at present, and thus save the transport involved in the cartage of the wheat or flour?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Messrs. Molloy and Company, building contractors, Cathedral Place, <Col N="633" /> Limerick, have notified their employees that an increase in wages granted by them on June 5th has been withdrawn as from July 4th by direction of his Department; whether, in fact, the firm was notified that proceedings would be instituted against them by his Department unless the wages were reduced; whether he is aware that the men have now suffered a reduction of 1½d. per hour as a result of the action of his Department; and if he can now say whether men in similar employment adjacent to Messrs.  Molloy's jobs are being paid the higher rate; and, if so, on what grounds his Department interfered to reduce the wages of Messrs.  Molloy's men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware generally of the circumstances of the case referred to by the Deputy.  Messrs. Molloy and Co. increased the wages of certain workers as and from June 5th, contrary to the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order, 1942.  The attention of the employers was directed to the terms of the Order and they were advised that no increase in rates of remuneration should be made except in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Order. This procedure would permit of an application for the making of a Wages (Standard Rate) Order in respect of the class of workers concerned, employed in that area.  The standard rate of wages is defined in the Order at the rate recognised on the operative date by trade unions and employers as applicable to such employees or the rate of wages paid as at the operative date by good employers to such employees.  I understand that an application for a Wages (Standard Rates) Order is about to be made.  With regard to the Deputy's query whether men in similar employment in the same locality are being paid at higher rates, I am having inquiries made to satisfy myself that in such cases there has not been a breach of the Order also. If there has been no such breach, the rates paid to such workers at the appropriate date would constitute evidence of value in the determination <Col N="634" /> of the impending application for a Wages (Standard Rate) Order.</P>

On an examination of the proposal certain information was required from the board of health before arrangements could be completed for the holding of the necessary public inquiry.  The information was received from the board in November last and the inquiry was held on various dates between the 8th and 20th January.  Subsequent to the inquiry each plot had to be examined and <Col N="636" /> reported on by the inspector.  Owing to transit difficulties and to the fact that the plots are scattered over the county health district the inspections could not be carried out as expeditiously as formerly.  It is hoped to have the inspections completed at an early date, when consideration will be given to the confirmation of the board's order.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of farmers in Monaghan have some quantities of old potatoes on <Col N="637" /> hands, but it is considered that when deliveries to the alcohol factory in Cooley have been completed, and when farmers' own needs have been fully met, the stocks remaining should not present any serious problem.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that actually there are potatoes in railway wagons on sidings in Monaghan, and that, as a result of some misunderstanding between the consignor and the alcohol factories as to the terms on which they should have been consigned, they are being left in the sun to perish?  If this state of affairs continues will the Minister consider some emergency plan to reduce these potatoes to a form of pig feeding of some kind so that it may be kept over for use in the coming autumn to supplement whatever ration of pig feeding may then be available in the Monaghan area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad when I noticed that a motion had been tabled to refer back this Estimate for reconsideration. I felt very strongly that when Estimates for other Departments were proposed to be referred back and were opposed it was only right that the Estimate for the Department of the head of the Government, the man who is responsible for the direction of Government policy, should also be challenged. I considered putting down a motion to refer back this Estimate but, owing to my incurable humility.  I considered it was the duty of the bigger Opposition Party to undertake that task.  Anyhow, I think it is wrong that <Col N="643" /> the head of the Government should be permitted to remain sublimely immune on his pedestal from the strong criticism which has been directed against the Department of Supplies, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Parliamentary Secretary in control of turf production. All these Departments are operating as a portion of general Government policy directed by the Taoiseach, and that Government policy has had very disastrous results during the past year.</P>
      <P>Time prohibited me last night from referring to the credit side of the Government's activities, in other words from paying some compliment to some of the operations which have been beneficial.  But, being confined as I am to dealing with events of the past year or the operations of the Government for the past year, I am more or less compelled to concentrate upon the more unsatisfactory features of Government policy which have demonstrated themselves during the past 12 months.  We have found that as a result of Governmental action the more important branches of the agricultural industry have been forced into a very grave condition.  The dairying industry has declined to such an extent that it seems as if this agricultural country will be unable to provide itself with supplies of butter and other dairy produce.  Notwithstanding the fact that in the past our big problem has always been to find considerable external markets and suitable prices, it appears now that our problem will be to provide ourselves with these essential foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the pig industry, the position is even more desperate.  There you have a position in which the Government, notwithstanding the appeals made to them by farmers and farmers' representatives in this House, drastically cut the price of pigs at a time when the then existing price was not sufficient to cover the cost of production. This price was cut on the plea that a certain amount of human food was being fed to pigs.  Such a plea could not justify a reduction in price because, since wheaten foodstuffs <Col N="644" /> were cheaper than any other foodstuffs that could have been fed to pigs, it was only to be expected that a reduction in the price of pigs, so far from having the effect of preventing the use of wheat for pigs, would naturally tend to increase its consumption.  For that reason it would seem to be a ridiculous course for a Government Department to adopt.  If the Department acted on the plea that the price of pigs was too high and that it would place bacon out of the reach of the consumer, one would understand that there might be some justification for that policy.  But that case was never made for the reduction in the price of pigs.  As a matter of fact, the price was cut and the result of the reduction was not to reduce the price of bacon, but to enlarge the profits of the curers.  We have the position to-day that the curers, in order to keep the bacon industry going in spite of Government regulations, have been paying a considerably higher price than that fixed by Government Order and for doing so they have been brought into court and severely fined.</P>
    <P>It seems an intolerable state of affairs when farmers and pig producers generally&mdash;they are not all farmers, but they represent the poorer sections of the community, the agricultural workers and the smallholders who are engaged in the rearing and fattening of pigs and who are unable to secure an economic price for them&mdash;find that when the bacon curers, whether for conscientious reasons, for business reasons or otherwise, decided out of their profits to increase the price of pigs, they are being penalised in the court.  The result of this is clearly shown by the fact that the pig industry is almost wiped out of existence and many of the bacon curers are getting less than a quarter of their normal supplies.  That presents an alarming problem and it clearly demonstrates lack of planning on the part of the Department of Agriculture and a complete lack of competence and efficiency, for which the Head of the Government must take his own share of responsibility, since he declines to make any change in the head of the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> Farmers are frequently told that they are eternally agitating for higher prices for every item they produce and that there is no justification for such agitation.  Recently a professor of Cork University investigated farmers' production costs over a very large area in the County Cork.  He carried out investigations on 61 farms. The net result of his investigations was that he discovered that every male adult member of a farmer's family engaged on agricultural work was earning approximately 24/- per week.  In face of that fact emerging from careful investigation, it is difficult to understand how anyone can claim that farmers are receiving undue profits or excessive prices for their produce.  The minimum wage for the agricultural worker is 33/- a week.  It was discovered by Professor Murphy that, if the average farmer on each of the farms he inspected was to pay the members of his family the fixed legal wage payable to agricultural workers, it would mean a loss of £19 10/- a year. If he were to make an allowance for the interest on the capital he invested on his farm, such as every manufacturer and business man makes, his loss would amount to £46 a year, based on a wage of 33/- per week, which nobody can claim is an excessive wage for agricultural workers at the present time.  The most that the average boy who decides to settle down and work on a farm can hope to earn is 24/- a week.</P>
    <P>We worry at the rapid reduction in the population of rural Ireland and at the tendency of the best of the young people in rural areas to get away from the land.  Apologists for the Government, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, have stated that there is no fight from the land.  Indeed, one person has used the argument that there is a livelihood on the land for only one member of each farmer's family and therefore the second and third sons must find a means of livelihood elsewhere.  Others have used the argument that if a city publican has two or three sons, the second and third sons must leave their father's homestead and seek a living elsewhere.  Similarly, if a doctor has two sons the second son must earn his <Col N="646" /> living outside.  If we were to follow that line of argument we could condemn the flight from the publichouse and from the dispensary just the same as we condemn the flight from the land.  But I suggest those arguments are false.  While it is true that the second or third son of a business man or a doctor must find the means of livelihood elsewhere, it must be realised that the population of our towns and cities is steadily increasing, and the population of rural Ireland is steadily declining.</P>
    <P>That proves how ridiculous and false and absurd are the arguments put forward by those who tell us there is no flight from the land.  That flight from the land must continue until the standard of income in rural Ireland is brought up to the standard prevailing in all industrial and urban occupations. In the face of all that we have the Government recklessly and, without any sense of responsibility, ruthlessly cutting the prices of pigs and permitting a state of affairs to continue in which the price of butter is below the cost of production.</P>
    <P>Professor Murphy in the course of his investigations discovered that the lowest price at which milk can be produced and supplied to creameries in this country economically is 8½d. per gallon, yet at the present time the maximum that farmers are able to obtain in the creamery areas is 7d. which leaves a net loss on every gallon produced.  That is a clear indication of the complete failure on the part of the Government to face up to the fundamental problems of agriculture. The result of their failure is the steady decline in agricultural production and the creation of a situation in which this country is faced with complete economic collapse, because it is quite obvious that the entire economic structure of this country must depend upon a prosperous and healthy condition of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach interrupted me last night to say that it is easy to be wise after the event but in connection with the pig industry I think the majority of farmer Deputies in this House were wise before the event.  They warned <Col N="647" /> the Government of what would happen if they were to persist in their policy of uneconomic prices for pigs produced in this country.  I do not refer to these matters simply for the pleasure of finding fault with the Government. The matter is more serious than that. It is absolutely imperative that the Government should now take a lesson from the mistakes they have made in the past and plan intelligently for the future.  If agricultural production is to be maintained and increased, as it must be increased, the time is now overdue when there must be a complete change of Governmental policy. The situation in which agricultural income compares unfavourably to a very alarming extent with the income obtainable in urban and industrial occupations must end.  Agricultural income must be raised to the level of industrial income, no matter what difficulties lie in the way of effecting that change.</P>
    <P>We have been frequently told in the past that agricultural prices must be governed by external market prices. That is an absolutely ridiculous contention. In this country we export less than one-third of our total agricultural output and there is no reason in the world why the other two-thirds of our agricultural output should be governed by export prices.  After all, what are export prices but the prices at which other nations decide to dump their produce on some external market? Very often they bear no relation to the prices prevailing within the exporting nations.  In addition to that, conditions under which production is carried on in many nations competing with us bear no relationship to the conditions of production here.  Labour conditions, where coloured labour is employed, may be inferior to the labour conditions here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The coloured labourer is much better off than the agricultural labourer in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the consideration that climates vary, and in <Col N="648" /> tropical climates commodities can be produced much cheaper than they can be produced in this country.  There is also the fact that through manipulation of currency and through other protective arrangements, nations export their exportable surplus at prices very considerably below the prices prevailing within the country of production. Therefore, it is sheer madness to base our agricultural prices on the export level.  We have got to fix a level of prices for agricultural produce based on the cost of production, and we have got to adhere to that level regardless of the prices that may prevail externally. That ought to be the fundamental guiding principle of Government policy.  If we are to prevent further decline in the agricultural industry and in agricultural production, there is no alternative.  We cannot expect farmers or farmers' sons to remain blind to their own interests. We cannot expect people to work on the land for less than half what can be carned elsewhere.  There is only one course open, and that is to raise the standard of income in rural Ireland.  Of course, the Taoiseach might suggest another alternative, namely, to lower the standard of living in our urban and industrial areas, but I do not think that any sane person would advocate such a revolutionary, retrograde course.  Having regard to the fact that we have the other alternative, there is no fundamental difficulty in raising the prices of agricultural produce to a level which will cover the cost of production, and which will earn incomes for those engaged in agriculture comparable with the incomes earned by other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have observed how the standard of income and of wages in agriculture has been raised in Great Britain.  We have observed how the standard of income and of wages has been raised in Great Britain for various kinds of manual work, in war industries, in the manufacture of war munitions and armaments, and even in the production of coal.  The incomes of workers engaged in all those industries have been enormously increased.  We may ask how the British nation, beset with difficulties, <Col N="649" /> engaged in a desperate struggle for survival, has been able to increase the standard of living and the earning power of practically the entire working population without any apparent difficulty while we, a neutral country, immune from involvement in war, have been unable to do anything for the most important section of the community, the people engaged in the production of food and the people engaged in the production of turf.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may ask how is such a plan to be carried into effect.  It can only be carried into effect, I say, by the adoption of the same attitude of mind as a Government involved in war adopts towards its military and national problems.  We must adopt that attitude of mind towards our economic problems, and, no matter from what source the money requires to be raised to finance an increase in the prices payable for agricultural produce and the prices paid to people engaged in the production of fuel, that money must be found, and I suggest it can be found as easily as money is being found for war purposes by nations involved in war.  Orthodox financiers, people in big business, people engaged in our export and import trade, may raise objections, but all those objections have been raised in Great Britain again and again, and they have all been over-ruled by the necessities and the difficulties of the situation and the needs of the people.  The essential purpose of the nation of surviving and of surmounting all difficulties has over-ruled the objections of the vested interests. Without any intention of infringing on the copyright of the British Prime Minister, I might say of the financial interests which have obstructed the solution of economic problems both in Great Britain and in this country that, in the past, they held a light that flamed; that, at present, they hold a light that flickers; but, in the future, they will be looking for themselves in a complete blackout.  The war has brought a complete change of outlook in regard to economic and financial questions.  It has revealed the power of the community to solve such problems, and it is only right that the <Col N="650" /> people in this country should appeal to the Government to face and to solve these problems on the same lines as those on which they have been solved in other countries.</P>
    <P>We are facing another cereal year when the problem of providing this nation's food must be very carefully thought out and we have to consider the many blunders made during the present year.  We have to consider the fact that the amount of wheat grown was not sufficient for home needs; we have to consider the fact that the total amount of grain grown was not sufficient to supply our needs; and we have the right to ask what plans are now being considered by the Government for facing these problems in the coming year.  It is imperative that, in this year, at any rate, the plough shall be hitched to the reaper, that is to say, the land required for the growing of wheat next year must be put under cultivation as soon as possible after the reaping of this season's harvest.</P>
    <P>Has any decision been reached as to the remuneration to be paid to farmers for the production of next year's crop?  Have the facts disclosed by Professor Murphy in relation to the income of farmers engaged in production been taken into consideration in considering the prices to be fixed for next year's wheat crops?  I suggest they ought to be, and the prices ought to show a considerable increase over this year's prices.  In addition, farmers engaged in the production of wheat and of other cereal crops required directly for human consumption, ought to be guaranteed in respect of prices not for one year but for a period of years, so that we shall have a stabilised and settled policy extending over a number of years and so that the farmer can face the incurring of expenditure upon the provision of tillage equipment with an easy mind, in the realisation that it is the fixed Government policy that prices of tillage produce will be stabilised over a considerable period.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why that should not be so.  The people will always require bread; they will always require porridge and the other foodstuffs produced <Col N="651" /> from cereal crops, including stout, beer and whiskey, and, since there is a substantial home market for these products, there is no reason why prices should not be guaranteed for a period of years.  It can be done and it requires only bold planning and bold action to put such a policy into operation. We shall still be told that we cannot foresee the future, but we have to lay our plans for the future on some basis, and the only basis upon which we can devise plans for the future is that this country will remain an independent State for a considerable period, that it will still be an independent State when this emergency is over, and that any plans for feeding and providing for our people shall be based on the consideration that the people living within this State have complete control over the political and economic affairs of their country, and, therefore, can plan far into the future so far as the commodities required for the home market are concerned. Therefore, there is no earthly reason why prices for tillage produce should not be guaranteed over a considerable period.</P>
    <P>At least 3,000,000 acres of tillage are required in order to provide the country's needs for man and beast.  We are entitled to ask what plans have been adopted by the Government to get that acreage.  Last year, so far as I know, the total area under tillage was 2,250,000 acres.  I suppose there are no figures available yet as to the area under tillage this year, but the community requires a tillage area of at least 3,000,000 acres, and I have frequently pointed out, and it is no harm to remind the Government again, that there is a complete miscalculation in regard to the total area of arable land in the country.  It has been frequently stated by Ministers, and by the Taoiseach himself, that there are 11,500,000 acres of arable land in the country.  So far as I know, there is nothing of the kind.  There has never been any survey of the total area of arable land, but I think the estimate of 11,500,000 acres is a complete miscalculation and could be out by as much as 2,000,000 acres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> This fact will be quite clear to anyone who looks at statistics or who knows anything about agriculture. Deputy Cooney laughs, because he does not know anything about agriculture. From the statistics supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce, we find that the total area under tillage, meadowing and pasture is 11½ million acres.  It must be clearly understood, however, that a very considerable proportion of the area under pasture is not suitable for tillage, and for that reason the calculations of the Department of Agriculture have been almost invariably erratic.  In planning for the future, therefore, I hope that this fact will be taken into consideration and that adequate steps will be taken to ensure that we will have at least 3,000,000 acres under tillage in the coming season and, what is most important of all, that the farmer who is engaged in that tillage, the members of the farmer's family who are assisting him, and the workers employed on that farm will be permitted to have a sufficient remuneration to enable them to continue in production. There is no use in fixing a minimum acreage of tillage if the prices guaranteed for the tillage produced are not adequate to cover the cost of production, because, inevitably, there will be failure, there will be a break-down somewhere if the farmer is not able to make his cost of production. He may carry on for a few months or for a year, but sooner or later he is bound to come to the wall, and, in doing so, the nation will suffer.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that since the object of this motion to refer back this Estimate has been to fix the responsibility for the Government failures over the past year fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Taoiseach, he should now take steps to ensure that his Ministers carry out their obligations to the community and deliver the goods both in the industrial and the agricultural sphere and also in the sphere of fuel production.  If the Taoiseach entered this House recently from Kildare Street, he might have noticed, outside the House, at the entry <Col N="653" /> to the College of Art, the statues of two very miserable-looking men.  I do not know how they got there or why they were put there, but it seems to me that they might be taken as representing the ordinary working people of this country, the common, decent electors, and the people who voted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most significant statements that has been made in this House since the Government came into office was that made by the Minister for Supplies recently on his own Estimate: &ldquo;Our bargaining power is nil.&rdquo;  It is a strange commentary, a remarkable statement, coming from a Minister, and one as to the causes of which the Government would be well advised to examine.  During the whole period of the Great War of 1914-18, this country was in a state of generous production.  There were very large stocks of agricultural produce of one kind or another for sale and available, and now, in the third year of the present conflict, or emergency, or war, we are faced with three problems in connection with agriculture, which ought to engage the attention of the Government.  The first is as regards dairying.  There is scarcely any Deputy of this House who comes from a dairying district but has pointed out <Col N="654" /> that the present economic position of the dairying industry is at a much lower standard than it has been for some years past.  The information given to this House within the last 12 months shows that our pig killings have gone down from about 21,000 per week to about 6,000&mdash;the average of the last six weeks.</P>
      <P>Poultry production is also on the decline. One of the root causes of the present situation is that our imports of animal feeding stuffs have almost ceased since the war commenced, and those wheat offals, which were available until the shortage of flour became so noticeable, are no longer available for live stock.  The Government may ask, in this situation, what is our suggestion. After all, before we answer that question, I think we must admit to one another that, so far as they are concerned, their plans, if they had any; their programme, if they had one; their scheme of operations, have not been a success, but have been a colossal failure.  The first suggestion that I would make in connection with the matter is that if they require a larger quantity of wheat grown in this country, they ought to take steps to ensure that it will be grown: either to increase the acreage under tillage or to ensure that in respect of each holding a certain proportion of it would be devoted to wheat growing, and that it should be planned so that there will be available, for feeding live stock, bran and pollard, and that sufficient wheat will be grown in order to make that available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that we have in this country a deposit of phosphates.  Why it is that the Government have not done everything possible to get out the maximum amount of that is beyond my comprehension.  It is a matter that has been talked about from the very start, and in looking over the returns of imports for years past, during the period of the economic war, and so on, it can be seen that we were importing less and less phosphates than formerly.  If we have any plan at all either for the present or the future, it is obvious <Col N="655" /> that the first consideration present to the minds of any agriculturist ought to be to maintain the fertility of the land.  It matters little what prospects there are for getting, either this year or next year, a good return, if we are to envisage then, for the future, a lowering of production.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion is that we should make a generous, as well as a minute, examination of the dairying industry.  In that industry we are facing competition now from the ends of the earth.  After the war we will be facing competition from Northern Europe as well as from New Zealand and Australia.  In either place, in the north or in the south, the milk yield of the cows there is greater than ours. Why should that be?  Why a country like ours, famed as it is for its live stock and for the fertility of its soil, should have lower milk yields from its stock than other countries is something which, I think, the Department ought to answer for.  In this matter the Government should endeavour to get the co-operation and assistance of the veterinary profession to eliminate any wasteful stock that we have as well as diseases which are peculiar to quite a number of our live stock; to advise as to how to get the best results from the animals that we have by, for example, a better class of winter feeding or something on that line.  It is obvious that if you are going to do these things, with the price of milk at approximately 7d. per gallon, production costs must be reduced in every direction possible, because at present they are a hindrance to the profitability of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a remarkable increase in central taxation as well as in local taxation.  He would be a super-optimist who could conceive of the possibility of production costs being reduced while you have central and local taxation increasing.  If the dairying industry should happen to come upon a bad time, there will be smaller quantities of milk going to the creameries.  Members of the House who come from the creamery areas say that is happening.  If so, it is obvious <Col N="656" /> that there will be a reduction in the number of pigs produced.  That will be a loss, not only to those who are engaged in agriculture, who could employ in pig production feeding stuffs that might otherwise be wasted, but as well to the bacon factories and curing companies which provide considerable employment in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin and elsewhere.  We learned from this morning's newspapers that it is expected that, within the next week or ten days, something like 300 men will be disemployed in the factories in Cork City.  Already a very big number of Cork workers have emigrated to Great Britain.  The Government seem to think that there is no answer, no way out, to that problem. Of course, if we allow those activities to deteriorate and go to rot it is obvious there will be no employment there for our people.</P>
    <P>What we want in a case of this sort is intelligent planning.  It does not require a super-abundance of intelligence to realise that the feeding stuffs which we had been accustomed to import must be provided locally, or else that the stocks to which they are fed will decrease in numbers.  In February last, at almost a moment's notice, the price paid for pigs was reduced.  Speaking from recollection, the reduction amounted to 6/- per cwt. Various reasons were given for that, one being that we had no feeding stuffs to spare.  In the presence of the Minister for Agriculture at the time I said that the action taken appeared to me to amount to Government robbery&mdash; little short of it&mdash;so far as those who had pigs for sale at that time were concerned.  If the Government had given notice a month or two earlier that the price was going to be reduced, at least we could not charge them with being dishonest, of trying to take from people something to which they were entitled and which the Government were not entitled to take from them. If the policy was to ensure that there would be fewer pigs in the country then there is no earthly reason why the people should not have been told that in advance.  One of the reasons alleged for this departure in policy was that wheat was being fed to live stock. <Col N="657" /> Some time about February I heard from a clergyman in the country, who is a friend of mine, that when a farmer in his neighbourhood tendered his wheat to the mill it was refused on the ground that it was not up to millable quality.  He brought it home and sold it for feeding in his own neighbourhood at a price which was 6/- per barrel more than he would have got for it if it had been up to the quality of millable wheat.  Those who have had the experience of the difficulty of getting feeding stuffs will realise that that was not a bad bargain for the man who bought it, if the quality was at all what might be expected.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I desire to refer is the price of turf, the wage paid to those engaged in its production, and the price charged for turf in Dublin and Cork.  The price at which turf is produced in the country areas varies from 10/- to 15/- per ton. The price to the consumer in Dublin or Cork is 64/- a ton.  One need not be surprised that those engaged in cutting turf, putting it on the railway or motor lorries to have it brought to the cities, are dissatisfied with their wage of 33/- per week.  It was alleged in this House by, I think, the Taoiseach himself that, if we increase wages, we are going to increase the price of the turf.  Of course that does not follow at all, as any man in business knows. Let us take the case of two men engaged in producing turf.  One is being paid 33/- per week, and the other 40/- per week.  If the man getting 40/- produces one and a half tons of turf, while the man paid 33/- produces only one ton, which is the cheaper labour, and which gives the better result? Obviously, the man who produces the most.  His labour is far cheaper.  It would represent about 28/- as against the 33/-.  It is said that it is impossible to avoid this increase in cost.  I should say that it is as long as we adopt the methods that have been adopted by the Government for the transportation of turf to Dublin or Cork.  Why not hand over a matter of that sort to people who are experienced in transport affairs?</P>
    <P>What does the Minister know about <Col N="658" /> transport?  The surface of it.  What do civil servants know about it?  They, too, have surface information.  Even engineers, able as they may be, and qualified as they are in their profession, are not as well adapted to deal with questions of transport as are the men engaged in the transport industry. I have no doubt whatever that if tenders had been issued in connection with the transport of turf to Dublin it would be done at a far cheaper rate and with much less messing about.</P>
    <P>Some men engaged at turf cutting by one of the parish councils around Dublin are paid 40/- a week.  They have saved a quantity of turf, but it has been so parcelled out that there is no road to transport it from the bog. Then the Government decide to get a road made and they want men to do road-making work at 36/- a week, whereas the men cutting the turf get 40/-.  Obviously no ordinary man will work at 36/- a week when he sees other men getting 40/-.  That is one of the anomalies of the situation. Ministers have not to live on 36/- or 40/- a week, but those who have, have to make up their minds where the best value is to be got.  Another case came to my notice recently which would stagger this standstill Order No. 83.  A man wrote to me and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am at present in receipt of unemployment assistance, home assistance and food allowance.  I have nine children and my total income is worth £2 2s. per week to me.  I have been told to go to work at a distance of eight miles at 36/- a week.  I cannot afford to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could he?  I should like to see a Minister supporting a wife and nine children on 36/- a week.  It would not be such a laughing matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the remedies, anyhow, is to increase the 36/- a week. When we pointed out that there is one particular class in the community excluded from that standstill Order, the <Col N="659" /> explanation given to us is that some men who were getting £6 or £8 per week have been replaced or were to be replaced by men at lower wages.  Let the Government bring in a standstill Order to deal with that, and not make the excuse of preventing a man with 36/- or 40/- a week from getting an increase that he cannot look for any more and is not entitled according to law to get any more.  It is an unjust law.  It is no wonder that institutions of Government, and even Parliament itself, are brought into contempt when you have laws such as that.  This turf at £3 4s. 0d. per ton is no solution of the fuel problem.  It is intensifying it. The sooner it is reconsidered, and this whole business of the standstill Order is reconsidered, the better it will be for the Government and this House.  I do not think any Government in the world has got the consideration, the support, and the co-operation which this Government have got, not alone from this House but from outside.  It is time that we saw some results from that, and that they gave some value to the people for the money that is being paid to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us have become more or less attuned to the characteristic note of pessimism struck by the Government in relation to the social and economic conditions now prevailing in the country.  The statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we had no bargaining power left is, I suppose, the culminating point of the policy of the Government which has been guilty of every type of the wildest extravagance.  The hopeless position to which the country has been reduced during the past 12 months is largely due to the dismal failure of the Government to apply any vision or foresight to the tactics and strategy of the conduct of the affairs of the country during the whole period of the emergency.  When the censure and blame for this situation come to be apportioned, a large portion must fall on the shoulders of the Taoiseach and his Department, because the words &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; and &ldquo;Government&rdquo; are <Col N="660" /> in the public minds almost synonymous. The Taoiseach's failures are regarded as the Government's failures and the Government's failures are regarded as the Taoiseach's failures.</P>
      <P>At no time since the beginning of this emergency has any considered plan emanated from the Taoiseach with regard to the preservation of our industries.  At no time has the Minister specially charged with the responsibilities connected with the Department of Industry and Commerce come before the House with any plan to protect or promote the interests of our native industries.  I think all of us will agree that the preservation of these industries is no less a part of our defensive measures than the maintenance of a large and costly Army. The tendency all the time has been for the Government to attribute our failures to sinister external circumstances over which the Government had no control.  At a time when man-power was never more sorely needed for the service of the State and for national development schemes such as fuel and food production, emigration has been allowed to proceed unchecked on a scale unprecedented except perhaps during the exodus following the famine years of the last century.</P>
      <P>We cannot blame people for emigrating. Their lot is a hard one owing to the pangs of separation from their families and uprooting from their homes.  Our people are fleeing in their thousands and in their tens of thousands from a land of starvation wages, from a land of submerged and depressed standards of living, from a land of black marketeers and racketeers and from a land wherein once more wealth accumulates and men decay.  Emigration has been encouraged by the Government because it must have appeared to them that it would serve as a kind of palliative, if not a solution of our unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now witnessing a widespread dislocation of our transport services, I might almost say a partial collapse in many parts of the country.  But the Government were aware from the beginning of the emergency of the <Col N="661" /> precarious financial position of the Great Southern Railways Company. They were aware that the Great Southern Railways Company was not able to carry, because of lack of credit facilities, any more than two or three weeks' stock of coal at the outbreak of the war.  They were aware of the mismanagement in that company for years, yet things were allowed to proceed without any guidance or assistance from the Government, any attempt to ease the situation or to do anything that might ensure an improvement of the position.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in this connection which I think is worthy of notice. The transport services in the City of Dublin have been very much curtailed. I suggest it is the Government's business to pay some attention to the grave inconvenience that thousands of citizens have to suffer by having to wait in all kinds of weather at tram and bus stops.  They are exposed to the rain and the wind and, as the winter months approach, they will have to contend with the snow and frost. The Government ought to take the initiative in the erection of shelters at various points throughout the city and suburbs.</P>
    <P>Throughout the whole emergency situation the Government have failed to foresee the difficulties that have arisen.  The competence of a Government in an emergency situation is usually gauged by their ability to foresee difficulties and provide ways and means to surmount them.  I believe the failure of our Government in this matter is largely due not only to their lack of foresight and vision, but to their almost complete dependence for supplies of money on financial concerns disposed to give money only on considerations of self-interest and profit.  I believe a large part of the failure in this emergency is due to the reluctance of the Government to apply and extend the principle of State ownership to public utility undertakings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>General Government policy falls to be reviewed to-day.  I want to refer briefly to the observations of the Leader of the Opposition. I agree entirely with him in deploring <Col N="662" /> the virtual destruction of the pig industry, and I share his amazement that, at a time like this, we find ourselves without bacon wherewith to feed our people.  Shopkeepers and distributors throughout the West of Ireland and in Donegal and Monaghan will receive about one-fifth of their weekly requirements of bacon between now and next April.  In my considered opinion there will not be in half the shops in rural Ireland next Christmas a pound of hard salt bacon for the consuming public.  What that will mean west of the Shannon only those of us who live there can guess.</P>
      <P>This House seems to have lost sight of the fundamental reason for that disaster.  The reason is plain and simple for those who will think.  The Government have decided to promote the growth of wheat by fixing a price of 50/- per barrel.  That being their policy, they are determined that no other cereal will be allowed to compete with that crop in its attractions for the farmer.  Therefore, no other cereal will be allowed to command, directly or indirectly, a price which compares with 50/- a barrel for wheat.  For this reason the price of pigs is kept artifically low, the price of barley is kept artifically low, and the price of oats is kept artifically low.  If the price of pigs were allowed to reach its normal level, people would grow barley and oats and feed them to pigs, thus cashing their crop indirectly, and they would have a much more substantial return from their land than if they employed it in growing wheat at 50/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That policy is wrong.  In the situation in which we find ourselves, the correct policy is to fix the price of wheat at 50/- per barrel, to compel every farmer with more than a certain acreage of land to sow a percentage of his land under wheat and, if he complains that that obligation involves him in loss, then let him increase the acreage of the rest of his land under oats and barley and, by selling these crops as cash crops, or by feeding them to live stock, let him make up on the remaining acres for the loss on the wheat that he has been constrained to grow.  People wangling <Col N="663" /> and twangling around this problem, while our supplies grow less. Ultimately they must come to the view that I have enunciated, because it is the only solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>Unless we take this course now, we will find ourselves very soon without wheat, oats, barley, bacon, fowl or eggs.  That is absolutely certain.  If, on the other hand, we fix 50/- for wheat and compel those with an acreage over 20 acres to sow a certain percentage under wheat and let there be a free field for oats, barley and the live stock to which these cereals are ordinarily fed, then I suggest there will be an abundance for our people and a surplus available for export, as was the case in the last war.</P>
    <P>The other point in the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition to which I wish to refer has relation to the dairying industry.  It is time that we stopped talking tripe about the dairying industry.  Butter for export is as dead as Queen Anne. Make up your minds to that.  You may not like to face the fact; you may think that you are going to get a few votes in Limerick, Cork or Tipperary by pretending that you do not believe it, but the fact is that butter for export is as dead as Queen Anne and the dairying industry as we know it must investigate the possibilities of &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; for our own people, and the development of casein as a by-product of the live-stock industry.  Should these things fail, the dairying industry will have to be recast and we may have to face the consequences of seeing it destroyed.  I do not think it will be destroyed.  I think it can be saved and preserved as the keystone of our whole agricultural industry, as it ought to be, but if it is to be done it must be done by courageous action and by a clearheaded contemplation of the problem we have got to face and overcome.</P>
    <P>The first certainty is that butter for export is as dead as Queen Anne. &ldquo;Drink More Milk&rdquo; is capable of consuming vastly increased quantities of liquid milk.  The problem of its transport from the dairy counties to Dublin, <Col N="664" /> Cork.  Limerick and other large centres of population is a trivial problem, a problem which is met and surmounted every day as an ordinary economic enterprise in the United States.  There is no such thing in Ireland as a long haul in terms of transport.  To haul stuff from Cork to Dublin is a short haul in terms of modern transport. With glass-lined milk-conveyor cars, milk can be hauled from any dairy centre in this country into the large centres of population, and there pasteurised and distributed amongst the hungry people.  So long as there are hungry people in this country there is no dairy problem.  We have plenty of hungry people within 100 yards of Leinster House.  If needs be, let that milk be brought into Dublin in glass-lined tanks and given away to our people, who require it.  In the long run, the cost of that operation, less the saving on public health services, less the saving on tuberculosis, less the saving on maintaining cripples who have grown up to be cripples through malnutrition, will amply compensate us for any assistance that it is necessary to give the dairy industry in order to enable it to carry out that service.</P>
    <P>The development of casein, I believe, will assume very great proportions post-war, with the development of the plastics industry throughout the world. I am not going to go at length into the technical problems of the plastics industry but I say to the dairy farmers of this country the redemption of their industry as at present constituted is to be found in plastics and, if it is not to be found there, there is no redemption for it.  I believe that it is to be found there.  I believe that the Taoiseach's Industrial Research Council and cognate bodies should be busying themselves now to investigate the services that can be rendered to the dairy industries by the plastic industries in America and Great Britain and the other countries of Europe so that immediately post-war we can proceed to exploit the dairy industry with casein as its by-product and milk and store cattle as the main products for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, while I felt moved to refer <Col N="665" /> to these matters because they have been given special significance to-day by the reference by the Leader of the Opposition to them, I cannot help feeling that dwelling at length on the petty domestic problems that confront us here in a time like this is to leave ourselves in this House open to the charge that we are turning our backs upon reality and misleading our own people as to the true situation which confronts us.  At this moment, while Dáil Eireann is sitting, a world revolution is being determined the issue of which will determine the fate of our country. I say that the policy of our Government <i>vis-a-vis</i> that world situation is wrong.</P>

      <P>I am certainly not going to challenge that ruling, but I am going to proceed with my speech.  This House is the last citadel where an elected representative of the Irish people can speak his mind freely. Until that right is denied the elected representatives of the Irish people I propose to exercise it freely here.  I say that the policy of the Government of Éire, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the world revolution which is proceeding, corresponds neither to the honour nor the interests of Ireland.  I take first the honour of our country, for this is that imperishable asset for which we stand trustee and by the effective stewardship of which our record before posterity will ultimately be judged.  If this country has stood for anything in the world, it stood for the principle of justice, and whatever the cost in material goods or human suffering, we have defended that principle.  We have refused to purchase peace or prosperity or temporal happiness by purchasing them with a consent, tacit or expressed, to that which we believed to violate justice.  I believe that in the present war, amidst the multiplicity of issues involved, the only issue that really matters is the issue which is being contested all over the world, and that is, whether after this war men will be free to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's.</P>

      <P>I know I shall not and it is because I know that to be true that I am bound, so long as I am in public life, to tell my fellow-countrymen of the danger that confronts them.  That is the danger.  If the Axis prevail in this war, I tell my fellow-countrymen and fellow Deputies in this House that our freedom is at an end because the first concern of the German Reich will be to seize this country for its own world-dominion ends and, having established bases in our country for the control of the Atlantic approaches to Europe and having converted our country into a German Gibraltar of the Atlantic, they will be faced with this problem: that we have never submitted to the unjust aggression by any foreign power against our State and, with God's help, we never will.  Faced with that knowledge, the German General Staff must tell its own Government that if these bases which they have seized on our west coast are to be rendered safe, the hinterland behind them must be made safe, lest, at some future date, a potential enemy should use that hinterland as a bridgehead from which to attack the German bases on our territory.</P>

I tell my colleagues in the House and the people in the country that, if the Germans attempt to Nazify this country, there will ensue a religious persecution more ferocious than has ever been seen in Ireland.</P>

For us to lose sight of that fundamental fact is, in my submission to the House, suicidal, because it will mean that in the futile hope of preserving our people from temporal suffering, which I know animates the great majority of those who believe in the policy of neutrality, it will bring down upon their heads a degree of temporal and spiritual disaster incomparably greater than the very formidable trials to which they would be exposed, were they to place at the disposal of Great Britain and the United States of America such <Col N="669" /> facilities as these States at present require for the defence of the lifeline which connects America and Great Britain at present.</P>

      <P>Every man must let his own conscience be his guide and do what he thinks is right.  That is the sole criterion by which any person can regulate his conduct in face of the situation with which we are confronted at present.  I recognise the anxiety which disturbs the minds of those Deputies who have complete confidence in the omniscience, the wisdom and the discretion of the Taoiseach, and I recognise also that the Taoiseach, with supreme political skill, has managed to identify, in the minds of our people, neutrality and Ireland's right to freedom.  My submission is that this identification is a complete illusion.  Our freedom and sovereign independence place upon us, the sovereign Parliament of Ireland, the duty of determining from day to day, from week to week and from year to year, what our policy shall be, and to say to us that to depart from one policy and adopt another is to sacrifice that sovereignty is a travesty of the facts.  It is only because we are a <Col N="670" /> sovereign people; it is only because it is we, the people of Ireland, who have the right to determine what we, the people of Ireland, should do, that we have the privilege and duty now of reviewing from week to week the policy of this nation and of determining on behalf of the Irish people what that policy shall be.  Ours to decide; ours the responsibility; ours the duty; and ours the trust to determine what this country will do in this period of world crisis.  We, the elected representatives of the people, are under no bond of honour or obligation to follow one policy or another.  Our only duty is to follow the policy which we, the elected representatives of the people, believe to be right.  That is our duty, and it is because it is my duty to argue with the elected representatives of the people for the establishment of what is right that I feel constrained to speak as I speak here to-day.</P>

No one but a very foolish man believes that he can long survive without a friend in the world.  What would each one of us as individual men think of a friend who protested his friendship for us and who, when the hour of crisis came, when we stood in mortal peril, turned to us and told us that he regretted he was not in a position to be of any assistance? Would we not feel that his friendship was of questionable value?  Twentytwo years ago, the Taoiseach of to-day <Col N="671" /> represented the Irish nation in America, and, speaking at Birmingham, Alabama, he said that if there had been no United States, there would never have been an Irish Republic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Land of the free and home of the brave, Farewell!  May you ever remain as I have known you, land of the generous-hearted and the kindly.  May you stand through time as they would have you who love you&mdash;Liberty's chosen champion; and oh, may you never know yourself the agony of a foreign master's lash.  I came to you on a holy mission, a mission of Freedom; I return to my people who sent me, not indeed, as I had dreamed it, with the mission accomplished, but, withal, a message that will cheer in the dark days that have come upon them, and that will inspire the acceptance of such sacrifices as must yet be made.  So farewell&mdash;young, fortunate, mighty land; no wish that I can express can measure the depth of my esteem for you and my desire for your welfare and glory.  And farewell the many dear friends I have made and the tens of thousands who, <Col N="672" /> for the reason that I was the representative of a noble nation and a storied, appealing cause, gave me honours they denied to princes&mdash;you will not need to be assured that Ireland will not forget and that Ireland will not be ungrateful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are fine words.  On July 31st, 1919, Mr. de Valera, as he then was, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is in this fact, ...that American ideals and American traditions are ideals and traditions of liberty and fearless justice, that Ireland's hope lies; and, with Ireland's, the hope of the world.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These words ring as true to-day as they rang 23 years ago, and my submission to this House is that in that extract of July 31, 1919, the Taoiseach displayed a very rare political perspicacity. The sovereignty and independence of this country depend on the Irish-American alliance.  We have for generations maintained, in the very teeth of a powerful, military, imperial nation, a struggle for freedom, and its ultimate success and the maintenance of an independent State during the last three years of war, because we enjoyed the goodwill of the American nation.</P>
      <P>It was the knowledge that any quarrel with our country would immediately create ill-feeling in the United States that strengthened our diplomacy during those difficult times and enabled us, in times of extraordinary difficulty and gravity, to survive the disaster that must otherwise have overtaken us. I say that if we lose that now, we will find ourselves, post-war, without a single friend in the world.  I say that if Great Britain is destroyed in this war, we will find ourselves with the markets upon which we have been accustomed to depend, the employment which our people are at present enjoying and have enjoyed for generations through the absorption of our surplus university graduates, vanished overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my judgment, no material considerations, great as they are, and though I have felt it my duty to recapitulate them here, would justify me or any other elected representative of our people in advocating the shedding of one drop of Irish blood.  I would not stake the life or the safety of one single mother's son in this country on any material considerations, however great or however valuable to those who held them.  But a situation arises when, side by side with these material considerations, or indeed completely independent of them, we are confronted with a position in which our personal honour, <Col N="674" /> as the friends beholden to the people of the United State of America, is involved.</P>
    <P>We have leant on them in times of stress and difficulty and have turned to them individually and collectively, never to be turned down, never to be rejected, never to be disowned, but always to be welcomed, always to be championed, always to be helped.  We find them now turning to us for the first time and saying: &ldquo;In the extraordinary world situation which now envelops our nation of 120,000,000 backed with every material wealth and power that the mind of man can conceive, we find in your keeping&mdash;the people of Ireland&mdash;something of incalculable value to us in an hour when our very survival is at stake; something in your keeping which may mean the difference between survival for the United States of America and its dismemberment and destruction by those who are regarded as the enemies of democracy and individual liberty and who want to see them go.&rdquo;  When they turn to us and ask for that thing, knowing that it will cost us dear to give it, knowing that it may involve us in great suffering, in fierce ordeal, and in mighty jeopardy, I was brought up to believe that ours was a people and ours was a nation who would reply: &ldquo;Whatever the jeopardy, whatever the cost, whatever the suffering, we know the obligations of friendship and we discharge them.&rdquo;  That, as I see it, would be the proper standard for our people, but it no longer seems to be so.  Over and above that, however, if that standard has gone by the board, if that be a wrong standard, there is another consideration.</P>

      <P>I am going to say what I conceive to be my duty to say, and I will ask no greater indulgence from the Chair than it affords to every other Deputy.  That is all, but I claim that as a right and will defend it, not only for myself, but for every elected representative in this House, because it is the right of us all, and it may not be taken from the least amongst us without striking at the most eminent of our numbers.  I say that over and above every other issue that obsesses my mind is the question of whether men in this country may continue freely to render to God the things that are God's, and to Caesar the things that are Caesar's.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that all over the world people are being denied that right at the present time.  I say that a denial of that right was first forecast in the Encyclical Letter, &ldquo;Mit Brennender Sorge,&rdquo; of Pope Pius XI.  I say that the forecast contained in that letter has been amply vindicated by the events in Poland, Czechoslovakia, France and every other country which <Col N="677" /> the Nazis have conquered, and the testimony of that is to be found in the bitter protests of bishops not only of the Catholic Church but of the Protestant Christian Churches of Europe.  I beg our people to open their eyes to the fact in time, that it is that essential freedom, without which we cannot live, which is at present in jeopardy in the world, and that if it perishes this country will be the last citadel in which it will be defended and as the last citadel will suffer indescribable horrors.</P>
      <P>My concern is to protect our own people from that suffering.  I know that the vast majority of informed Deputies of this House realise that, in the event of a Nazi victory, my prognostications are true.  I know that some ill-informed Deputies do not foresee these appalling contingencies, and imagine that such a victory can eventuate without any serious repercussions on our own country.  I am trying to warn them, while there is still time, of the knowledge that if such a disaster as a Nazi triumph should come upon Europe and the world Ireland will be engulfed in it, and will be one of the most cruel sufferers because the keystone of Nazi ascendancy is the destruction of Christianity, and the only effective champion&mdash;I say effective champion&mdash;in my judgment that is left of true Christianity in the world is the Catholic Church to which 98 per cent. of our people belong.  The persecution and attempted extirpation will involve our people in suffering compared with which that of past times would be as nothing.  This country has still time to take its stand upon these issues.  It has still the opportunity to take that stand with friends about us.  If we do not want to let disaster come upon the world, and Nazism to prevail, then a moral obligation will drive our people into taking that stand or they will live to fight alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the deep consciousness of those facts that constrains me to raise this issue straightly and bluntly on the Taoiseach's Vote.  I suppose there are some who will adopt the sneering reference of the Minister for the Co-ordination <Col N="678" /> of Defensive Measures who described me as a minority of one. Maybe I am a minority of one, but there was a figure in classical history that had that distinction, too, and the events justified her.  Cassandra warned the Trojan people of their dangers and of how, what they thought to be the policy of conciliation and forbearance would precipitate disaster on the Trojan people.  She was rejected. She knew the torture of seeing the future with certainty and of being unable to convince her people.  She saw with horror and consternation flame and ruin envelop her native city and destroy her people and its leaders. God forbid that that should ever overtake this country, but worse than the flame, worse than the destruction and worse than the extermination of our leaders would be the generation of persecution which we would certainly have to face if Nazism should prevail in the world.</P>
    <P>I am saying deliberately that in the conflict at present proceeding there is no room for neutrals.  If people agree with me, that the mighty issues to which I have referred are really joined between the parties, then those who are not with right and justice are against them.  I say that in my judgment those who withhold from the United States of America and Great Britain and the united nations the help which would assist them to overcome this world peril are, in fact, helping that peril to prevail.</P>

In that full knowledge I say that a united nation, loyally accepting the decision of the legitimate Government, is capable of acting.  I deny that any external power by any threat, seduction or corruption can divide our people in civil war.  The Irish people are capable of accepting a verdict freely given by their own Government.  The Irish people are capable of loyally serving the constitutional legitimate Government of the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is but one Government, the Government of Oireachtas Eireann headed at this moment by Eamon de Valera.  There is only one legitimate Government in this country and I say that no power on earth can start a civil war in this country or question the authority of that Government. So long as it retains the confidence of the majority of our people, there will be found Deputies on these benches, on the Fine Gael Benches and on the Labour Benches, if there are none on the Fianna Fáil Benches, to defend that authority with their lives if needs be, whether that Government pursues what we consider to be the right or the wrong course.  I do not accept the Taoiseach's classical dictum that the people have no right to do wrong.  I say that the people have the right to go politically wrong, though, of course, they have no right to override the moral law of God. They have the right to choose their own Government, whether it is the best or the worst Government, and <Col N="680" /> their choice of that Government imposes an obligation upon me and on every other citizen of this State, under the law of God, loyally to accept its dictates and give effect to them, but it does not impose an obligation to silence our voices and to deny our consciences, to remain silent when we believe that it is our duty to speak out.  It does not constrain us to give tacit assent to that which we believe not to be in the best interests of our country.  On the contrary, the best testimony to the solidity and to the unshakableness of the legitimate Government is that every well-intentioned and law-abiding citizen shall have the right to speak freely, fully protected in the knowledge that in this country we have no longer need to fear the threat of civil war.</P>
      <P>Let no external elements imagine that they can coerce our people by the threat of fomenting civil war.  Let no external Government, who employs secret agents in this country for the purpose of stirring up civil war, and imagine that these agents will succeed. We have seen them come by parachute, with money to purchase civil war, and they have learned over the last two years that their best effort to that end has failed, in face of devoted service from the voluntary public servants of this State in the L.D.F., the L.S.F., and the Army, who are neither Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, or otherwise, but Irishmen who recognise that the first obligation they have after their duty to God is to support the legitimate Government of the country and the authority of that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dismiss from your minds all questions of civil war.  This country is capable of taking a firm decision and acting on it, and no threat of civil war will unseat the sovereign authority of Oireachtas Eireann, so firmly established by the sacrifices of generation after generation of our people.  Deputy Cooney's threat of civil war does not frighten me.  Let them come on, whoever wants civil war in this country, and they will find a Government and an Oireachtas who will put an end to civil war, and who will demonstrate for all <Col N="681" /> time that there is no rule of law in this country but the law of the majority of our people freely expressed.</P>
    <P>There is a Government headed by Eamon de Valera, elected by the free vote of the people.  So long as it is there, no threat of civil war will supplant it, and I believe the life of every Deputy in this House is warrant for that undertaking.  No threat of civil war, nor, as I hope, any other threat, will affect the minds of Deputies in determining what is the proper course to pursue.  My submission is that there is one test and one test only and that is: what is it right for this Government to do and, having determined what it is right for us to do, to do it, using the best resources we may command to mitigate the consequences of our action, however grave and onerous they may be.  The day we renege upon that resolution we become the plaything of every blackmailer who chooses to threaten us.</P>
    <P>I have told this House, as I have told my constituents and as I have told my fellow-countrymen, what I think it is the right thing to do.  I have to-day wrought with my associates in this House to persuade them that the course of conduct I have in mind is the course of conduct which should commend itself to them.  If and when the march of events or the power of argument should bring them round to my view, then let all sides of the House say, now that decision, deliberately taken by the sole governing authority of this country as to what the policy of Ireland will be, will receive the same loyal united support from a sovereign Irish people as this Government have received so far in pursuit of the policy which they deemed it their duty to prescribe for Ireland up to now.</P>
    <P>I do not want to conclude my observations without re-affirming a matter of fact which it is my duty, as an advocate of a certain course of conduct, to place on record.  I still believe that the neutrality policy of the Government and of the leading Opposition Party in this House is a policy which at the present time commends itself to the vast majority of the Irish people.  That is a fact which I am <Col N="682" /> obliged to place on record as a public duty.  I believe the vast majority of my fellow-countrymen to be wrong in that conclusion.  I believe it to be my duty to argue with them against that conclusion.  But it would be a dishonest thing on my part if any words of mine were to mislead my friends in this country or this country's friends outside.  Much as I desire to see our country play its part in the mighty drama that is at present being enacted in the world, that desire is not shared by the majority of my fellow-countrymen. I would to God it were.  I hope and pray it yet may be.  But I thank God that we still have in this country the freedom and the right to argue and to strive with our fellow-countrymen so that what we believe to be truth may be made to prevail, and that they, seeking truth, may be afforded the opportunity of finding it.</P>

    <P>Certainly the wisdom of that old Irish saying was never more fully <Col N="683" /> demonstrated than it has been this evening by Deputy Dillon in the words he has addressed to this House, words calculated to cause disquiet, uneasiness and disunion in this country to a higher degree than anything the least learned Deputy could possibly contribute. Immediately following the outbreak of war in September, 1939, this House by unanimous resolution decided that the policy of the country towards the hostilities then prevailing was that of neutrality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>It is true.  That decision then come to had the approval of more than 95 per cent. of the people of the country.  Notwithstanding that fact, the Deputy, vacillating politician that he is, shifted from one side to another, changed his mind after September, 1939, and spoke in the country in defiance of that decision.  In this House he denies that the people have the right to pursue a policy of neutrality. Was there ever such a display of effrontery?  The Deputy comes into this House and, notwithstanding that he admits that more than 95 per cent. of the people support the policy of neutrality, he denies their right to do that.  He assumes that he has more grey matter in his skull than 95 per cent. of the people added together.  In my opinion it was the greatest demonstration of vanity that was ever presented in this House, vanity personified in the person of Deputy James M. Dillon.  You all probably heard the story of the old lady who was standing on the side-walk waiting for the march <Col N="684" /> past of a regiment of which her son was a member.  As the section in which her son was marched passed, it was observed by everybody that the son was out of step, but the old lady rubbed her hands with glee and she said: &ldquo;My James is the only one who has the step.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterJosephOLoghlen" hpid="Mr. O'Loghlen Mr. O'Loghlen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy is the marshal.  I am satisfied that every enemy of this country, both inside and outside the country, will rub his hands with glee when he reads what Deputy Dillon said in the House this evening. The Deputy has definitely asserted that neutrality will bring temporal and spiritual disaster to this country. Therefore, the judgement of 95 per cent. of our people is a judgement conducive to the bringing of spiritual and temporal disaster to this island.  As I have stated, I am convinced that it will give comfort, consolation and joy to every enemy of this land, whether inside or outside our territory, to read the words that Deputy Dillon has uttered this evening.  The Deputy is welcome to the approval of these people, but I would prefer to stand in with the men and women who are determined to preserve that neutrality, with the men and women who are prepared even to die in defence of that neutrality.  I prefer to stand in with the ordinary men and women of this country, with the type of people who are cutting their turf on the bogs of Shrah, because I believe they have more national and political wisdom than this highly vocal Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those vocal powers he has exercised in addressing words to this House that are of a highly disturbing character. They are words that he is free to utter because of his position as a Deputy of this House.  If any ordinary man at the cross-roads in Clare spoke words similar to those spoken by Deputy Dillon this evening, or if any person addressing a meeting in Cathal Brugha Street to-night spoke words similar to those used by Deputy Dillon in this House, he would find himself inside prison walls by to-morrow morning. <Col N="685" /> There are many men within prison walls in this country who have done less to disturb the peace of the country than Deputy Dillon has by his words this evening, and I am not satisfied that the Minister for Justice is doing his duty when men like Deputy Dillon are not placed in a position where it would not be possible for them to do anything further to disturb peace and good order in this country. It is quite true, it cannot be gainsaid. No doubt the Deputy, before he entered the House, took steps to ensure that the contribution he has made would find its way to publication outside this country, whether the Censor agreed or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  The statement that has just been made by the Deputy is without a shadow of foundation, is quite untrue.  Is it right or sensible for the Deputy, or is it in order openly to accuse me of something illegal, of a breach of the law?  It would be quite illegal even to attempt to communicate any matter outside this country whether the Censor approved it or not.  Of course, it is unthinkable I should do it, but is it right for the Deputy to allege I did it?  Surely not?</P>

      <P>After the last couple of speeches, anyone who gets up at this moment must be taken at a disadvantage. Before returning to the Vote of the Taoiseach, I wish to say that, speaking for my constituents, neutrality is the only hope for this country and can be and must be the only policy of an Irish Government. The country is united on that and, no matter what Party becomes the Government of this country, no other policy will be accepted or tolerated by the people.  I am aware of the fact that all Deputies in the House are united on that issue and, please God, the policy of neutrality will prevail and get the support of every member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I be permitted to get back to the ordinary things affecting the everyday life of our people that one has a right, I believe, to discuss on this Estimate?  Discussion has arisen on the danger of a wheat shortage and it has been put to the Taoiseach that he should consult with his Ministers with a view to securing a sufficient acreage of wheat under the Compulsory Tillage Order.  Two months ago I raised the question in the House, that the Minister, through the Compulsory Tillage Order, should make an Order for the production of a certain amount of <Col N="692" /> wheat so as to safeguard the supply of flour and bread for our people. When I raised that question, bread queues were to be seen at every bread shop in the City of Dublin.  The people are still suffering the hardship of having only half an ounce of tea per person.  We are now threatened with a shortage of sugar and only this morning I was telephoned to and told that certain retail shops could not get a sufficient supply of sugar from the wholesaler for the people who dealt with them.  I suggest that the Taoiseach give an instruction to his Ministers in the matter, because he appointed them and he had to see that their qualifications were up to the standard required for the big posts they undertook.  There is no oatmeal. We used to call it &ldquo;stirabout&rdquo; in the old days when it was plentiful, but now we call it porridge, and the working people in the cottages and tenements have no porridge.  Something should be done to see that the position in relation to tea, sugar and oatmeal is attended to.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have dealt with the shortage of bacon, a shortage which was regarded as almost impossible in this country.  There is a scarcity of bacon in all the retail shops in Dublin and the customers will scarcely believe them when they say they have none. They think they have it under the counter.  The bacon scarcity, following the scarcities of tea, sugar, oatmeal, coal, paraffin and petrol, is a source of great irritation to our people.  I read quite recently that the British Government expected an increased output of coal, following the release of a large number of men for work in the coal mines, and I asked the Minister for Supplies lately whether he thought it desirable to try to arrange a barter system and to get some of the increased coal output for our people, for the Gas Company and for our industries.  I was amazed to hear him say that our position in regard to bargaining counts for nothing.  I am still satisfied that if the Minister, and not one of his clerks, went across and asked for more coal, he would get coal in exchange for the cattle which we <Col N="693" /> are sending over, instead of our being paid with paper money as at present. I wish we had sufficient of that paper money, but if we want goods and they have goods to exchange, we ought to make arrangements for that exchange and get for our people some of the surplus tea and coal which we believe they have in exchange for fats and meats.</P>
    <P>The country was amazed when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance insinuated, in relation to the unemployed people who are going across to England and earning wages there which they send back to this country, that these people were no good to their country.  I replied at the time, by way of interjection, that they might not be good for the country which wanted them to work at turf for small wages, but the money which they send home was good money for their families.  This Government appear to have accepted England, its works and its money, as a relief scheme for our unemployed.  I understand that a new Order has recently been issued under which our unemployed will not be permitted to go across to England and under which they have to get certain permits from the labour exchange. They are to be offered work at turf-cutting for 34/- a week, and if the skilled man, who earned £4 a week, does not accept that work, his unemployment benefit is to be taken from him.  I say that that is robbery because these men paid for their stamps, and this Government, or any other Government, has no right to take from them that which they have subscribed.</P>
    <P>If one goes down the North Wall, which used to be a hive of industry, one will see the railway tracks there red with rust.  There is one ship on the north side and one on the south side, and the place has the appearance of a deserted village.  Surely, the Government will not say to the checkers on the North Wall, and to the sailors and firemen who are unemployed, and who used to earn £4 or £5 a week, that they have work for them at cutting turf for 34/- a week.  There is a type of strong man to whom the 34/- a week might be acceptable&mdash;men who are used <Col N="694" /> to country life and who live near the bogs on which the turf is to be cut. Such a man might be happy, or might have to be content, with what he is offered, and might take the 34/- a week for providing fuel for our people; but I think the Government ought to pay the turf cutters a decent wage, and, also, pay our agricultural workers a decent wage, and not force them to seek these passports to earn across the water the money which the Parliamentary Secretary belittles.  What I should like to see is more of it coming to some of the people I represent.  The problem of unemployment is a matter for which the Taoiseach should immediately seek remedies.  There are unemployed people in this city undergoing very grave hardships.</P>
    <P>It might be regarded as an exaggeration, but I can tell the House that I get 250 letters a week, two out of three of which tell a story of great hardship being borne by a man and his wife and eight or ten children.  There are people being evicted, and being threatened with eviction, because they are unable to pay their rent.  What is to become of these people?  We have a rigid operation of the means test, as a result of which, if a boy in a family gets employment at 14/- or 15/- a week, a couple of shillings are taken from the father's unemployment benefit.  In the administration of all kinds of assistance and Government grants, the same thing is happening. I raised a question a few days ago, which shocked every member of the House, about a sailor who lost his life on the &ldquo;Clonlara,&rdquo; which was carrying food to our people.  A grateful Government gave his father 5/- a week and the labour exchange reduced the payments to him by 4/6 the next day, so that the father of this sailor got 6d. per week which was to expire in August, 1942.  In other words, for 52 weeks, he got 6d. a week, which is a measure of the compensation offered to our sailors who sign on at Limerick and the North Wall.</P>
    <P>I say the time has come for the Government to sit down and consider these everyday problems as well as the big problems which require to be <Col N="695" /> dealt with.  I had a case a few days ago of two sisters and two boys living in one of these working-class houses. There was assistance of some kind given to them, but there was one girl of 21 who had spent six years in Cappagh Hospital.  As a result of one of Cappagh's famous miracles&mdash;a miracle to be written about and talked about everywhere&mdash;this girl, after being six years under the surgical and T.B. doctors, was cured.  She came out of Cappagh and went home to her tenement rooms, where her mother and father had died, and she got 7/6 per week to buy nourishment for herself. Her brothers aged 15, and 16, got employment at 15/- a week each, bringing the income of the house over the means test level and the sum of 7/6 which that girl, after spending six years in Cappagh Hospital, had got and was using for the purchase of cod liver oil and medicines, was taken from her. Because her two brothers got employment, her 7/6 a week was taken from her. That girl's six years in Cappagh cost the City of Dublin £600.  It works out at £100 a year to keep a patient in Cappagh.  But because of the means test her 7/6 a week for nourishment was taken from her.  I know there are other cases in all Departments where the means test is being applied too rigidly, and I would ask the Taoiseach to see that it is not so severely enforced by his officials.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach too, whether he has anything further to tell us about a mercantile marine. Before America went into the war I was informed by a very reliable group of people in this city that they had an offer of 12 or 14 ships at a very reasonable price.  I remember that when the matter was raised in this House one of the Ministers asked what we would put in them.  We could bring in wheat in them; we could bring in newsprint, and keep our workers employed.  In order to safeguard those who are still in employment, materials must be provided, and I would ask the Taoiseach to see that those materials are forthcoming. The building trade is almost <Col N="696" /> at a standstill because of shortage of material.  If those people had been given assistance by the Government to buy those ships, the timber for the building trade would be here now.</P>
    <P>I have a number of letters here before me&mdash;all dated within the last few days&mdash;from wives of soldiers, complaining about being paid fortnightly.  This woman, who has six children, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I get £2 0s. 3d. per week.  Now, Mr. Byrne, what woman could feed and cover six healthy boys on that money?  I am nearly a mad woman trying to do it.  My boys have not had a dinner since Monday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a letter from the wife of one of our soldiers.  I think the Government should immediately take steps to inquire and report on family allowances.  This House will probably adjourn this week and we will not meet again for two or three months. There has been a family allowances motion on the agenda for the last month or two, and we will not hear a word about it.  Yet we have those people writing and saying they cannot feed their children on the allowance they get.</P>
    <P>I had another sad case brought to my notice.  It is that of a soldier who deserted from the army.  He has been confined to barracks, and his wife and children may go and starve.  I am not defending the action of any soldier who deserts, but his wife and children should be looked after.  There is poor law assistance, no doubt, but on account of the small allowance given we have that man's wife writing to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have a little baby only ten months old drinking water out of her bottle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The moment I got that letter from the soldier's wife, I telephoned to the authorities and asked them if they would increase the allowance that they gave by way of public assistance.  I also telephoned to the infant aid milk depot.  They sent an inspector out immediately, and, because of their efforts, the ten months old baby will <Col N="697" /> not be drinking water out of her bottle; she will be drinking good milk. The whole social system in this country is all wrong when it comes to dealing with women and children.  There is something rotten somewhere.  No matter what the father does, there should be no hungry children.  There should be ways and means of helping them.  I would ask the Taoiseach to inquire into those matters.  I will not worry him with all the letters from soldiers' wives asking if I could get them an increase in their allowance as they are not able to live on what they are getting.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I had another sad case brought to my notice.  It was that of a young girl who had been 12 months married.  She married a soldier who had not got the consent of his superior officer.  This young woman is paying 10/- for a room, which means that she has 5/- left.  What are they to live on?  The regulations say that a soldier must not get married within two years of joining up, but having got married&mdash;and surely a country like this is not going to blame or condemn him for doing so&mdash;he and his wife are left to pay 10/- a week out of a single soldier's pay.  I put it to the authorities that, when a reasonable explanation is given, the young soldier should be given a married man's pay, in order at least to prevent them from being evicted.  My job is to try to get them a room for 1/6 or 2/-.  That soldier is serving the country.  Those are things which some people will not bother about, but they are the things which are affecting the everyday life of the ordinary man in the street, especially the down and out, and I do feel that the Government ought to take a more lenient view of offences which eventually bring hardship on the wives and children of those who commit them.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say that some of the Ministers have looked with complacency upon those hardships, but on opening my postbag every morning I get 20 or 30 or 40 letters, all telling the same story: they cannot get milk, or they cannot get bread or tea or sugar, or they enclose eviction notices from their landlords.  Those are the <Col N="698" /> conditions in Dublin, and, if it were not for the money which is coming back from our people on the other side, Dublin City would be in a bad way.  I leave it at that.</P>

      <P>In taking part in this debate, it is hardly fair to blame the Taoiseach for all the complaints from one end of the country to the other. No matter where you go at the moment, if you speak to the more intelligent people of the community, they will say: &ldquo;It is a pity.  The Taoiseach is all right, but his Ministers are not doing their job.&rdquo;  That is a general thing, from one end of the country to the other, especially amongst the more intelligent people.  If the Ministers are not doing their job, that is a matter for the Taoiseach.  Seeing the way things are, it is no wonder there are grumblings and complaints on this Vote.  In fact, it is very hard to get a definite answer from some of the Ministers in regard to many matters. We have had here in the House for a couple of years many complaints about a black market in the country.</P>
      <P>The black market has gone so far that is is now an open black market. The Government are spending a lot of money on advertisements about the control of prices and many other matters, but the steps taken to carry out that control do not seem to be of any avail.  I want to bring that matter to the notice of the Taoiseach, and to ask whether more effective steps can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I mentioned in a question to-day&mdash;the Minister was not here but the Parliamentary Secretary was&mdash;and that is the matter of flour milling.  It is not so much a question of flour milling as of carting the wheat to and from the mills.  We have flour milling concentrated amongst a small number of people and we have a fair number of mills driven by water-power and fully fitted for the milling of flour for the public.  The owners of these mills are prepared to buy wheat, mill it into flour, abide by the decision of the Department and distribute that flour to the public.  There would be practically no carting involved.  If a mill, <Col N="699" /> besides doing its ordinary work, obtains 4,000 or 5,000 tons of wheat locally, it would be carted to the mill in an ordinary cart and it would be distributed locally with the expenditure of very little petrol.  Instead of these millers being allowed to do that, the wheat has to be brought to agent's premises, generally by motor lorry, and brought from the agent's premises &mdash;in most cases a distance of 40 miles and in some cases from 30 to 35 miles &mdash;to the mill.  After delivering the wheat, the lorries go back empty unless they happen to be taking back flour for themselves.  The flour has to be carted back, then, 35 or 40 miles. In the past 12 months, there was a scare about petrol, followed by severe rationing.  In the way I have mentioned, we could improve the flour position and, at the same time, save thousands of gallons of petrol.  Besides, a few decent millowners might get a share of the profits which are at present going to those who have complete control of Irish milling.  I mention that matter in the hope that the Taoiseach will take it up with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the petrol situation gets worse, you may, in 12 months, be asking these people to mill flour for you, so as to save transport over a distance of 30 or 40 miles and back.</P>
    <P>Another matter has been so often discussed here that I do not like to mention it.  The Taoiseach may, however, take it up with the Department of Agriculture.  I refer to the pig and dairying industries.  Unless some bold step is taken and money is found to support these industries, as it has been found to build up the Army, then we can talk here until doomsday and no physic that can be applied will effect any improvement so far as milk production and bacon production are concerned. No farmer or cottier will produce butter or bacon until production is subsidised to such an extent that it will pay.  In no business will people continue to engage unless it pays. Farmers and cottiers have almost ceased to produce milk and bacon. Unless a bold step is taken and the taxpayer's money is spent, both industries <Col N="700" /> will die.  There is no use in talking about any other remedy.  The pig industry is, in fact, dead and the dairying industry is following in its path.  A year or two after the war ends the people will be back to the position in which they were at the end of the last Great War and there will be nothing for them to fall back upon. I ask the Taoiseach to take up this matter with the Department of Agriculture at the earliest moment and, no matter what it costs, to see that these two industries are kept going.  It will be cheaper to do that now than to try to revive the industries when they are dead.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture refused to increase the price of wheat by 5/-.  When the position was put before the Taoiseach later, the price was increased to 50/-.  If that had been done earlier, a much greater acreage of wheat would have been sown and there would have been much more winter wheat.  If the Taoiseach was able to get the Department to do that, he should be able to secure that these other industries are maintained so that, when the war ends, the people concerned will be able to live economically.  It is as easy to find money for that purpose as it is to find money for the Army.  Our economic life will be as important during the next four or five years as defence is now.  It will matter very little what happens to the country if we are in a state of starvation.  The people would care little about nationality or about the Taoiseach, or anybody in this House, if they were in a state of semi-starvation.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to take the steps I have indicated, so that we may not find ourselves in a state of economic distress when the war is over.</P>

      <P>In addressing myself to this Vote for the Taoiseach's Department, I want, in the first place, to refer to certain matters discussed by Deputy Dillon earlier this evening, for the simple purpose of dissociating myself as widely as possible from the statements he made, and, more particularly, digging the widest possible margin between myself and, I think, this Party and him, in so far as that <Col N="701" /> speech of his did propose, suggest, or intend to suggest a change of policy in the attitude of this country in regard to the war.  I want to have the greatest possible margin between myself and him on that matter, but I want to have an abyss dug between myself and those in this House who would attempt to destroy freedom of speech.  When, in the month of September, 1939, we met to allow the Government certain powers, one of the promises we got was that the most complete freedom of debate would still be accorded to us in this House.  I remember asking a question on one point myself, regarding things that might seem to come within the ambit of the Official Secrets Act, and was assured that Deputies here in this House would be protected from any sort of action outside.  I have often accused the Government of breaking promises, but that promise has been kept; and full freedom has been allowed to Deputies, no matter how provocatively they spoke, no matter if they touched on a nerve that was sore, and no matter how jarring the remarks might be.  While I disagree entirely with the content of Deputy Dillon's speech, I do want all the while to applaud him for the way in which he maintained his point and continued to maintain it.  I am an upholder of order in this House, and I recognise that, if order is not maintained, the decencies of debate will be sacrificed.  But I feel gleeful that a narrow-minded rule that it was sought to impose on the debate to-day was not pressed by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>When an Estimate is referred back for reconsideration the general policy of the Department may be discussed.  Without a motion to so refer back, policy has, however, more than once been discussed.  The Vote for External Affairs was not referred back, therefore general policy of External Affairs or questions of neutrality did not properly arise.  Neutrality is undoubtedly a matter of Government policy which could arise on this Vote.  The Deputy, however, might realise that, possibly, there was a very natural misunderstanding in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept anything the Chair says.  I wish to make the point that I definitely feel glad, as an upholder of order in this House, that Deputy James Dillon, speaking on matters with which I thoroughly disagree, maintained his position.  I do not know what limitations of space I could impose on the difference between myself and, say, Deputy O'Loghlen, who suggested that Deputy Dillon should be put in jail because of his temerity to think differently from Deputy O'Loghlen on certain matters, and to express his view here.  I feel that the House gave, in one point this evening, a very definite example of freedom in debate.  It was quite clear and easy to recognise, as Deputy Dillon spoke, that his views did not command the assent and support of anybody at all in the House; nevertheless, the House was able, up to a certain point, to tolerate what he was saying.  It is a good thing that that was the situation, and it was a shocking thing that there should be any breakaway from that situation in later stages of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that I cannot emphasise too strongly my most complete disagreement with what the Deputy said, in so far as it tended to sway policy on an important matter.  As a private individual, I have given myself the luxury of reading, studying and trying to investigate the attitude of the main belligerents in the war, and as a private citizen I may have views which might coincide with those which Deputy Dillon has in certain aspects of the war; but, as a representative of a huddled, densely-populated part of this almost defenceless city, I would have to pause before I began to consider that, as a Deputy, I might announce here in public some of the views which, as a private citizen.  I might be bold enough to hold.  The Deputy has said to-night, as before that in this matter he would probably agree that he is in a minority of one. <Col N="703" /> If he is, it should be stated here in the House, in contradistinction to Deputy O'Loghlen's view, that he is not in any minority of one on an issue positively put before the House in respect of neutrality.  Deputy O'Loghlen is of the opinion that, on the 3rd September, 1939, this House voted on such a resolution.  I do not think that any such resolution was passed.  I do not remember it.  I have asked my colleagues about it, but none of them remembers that the matter ever was decided by resolution.  However, that is a merely formal point.  If Deputy O'Loghlen had avoided this matter of a resolution having been passed by an almost unanimous vote, he would have been on secure and possibly on good grounds in saying that the policy commands almost universal support in the House and in the country at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn away from that matter of our relation to this great struggle, and fix our eyes on the country itself, to find out whether the Taoiseach, as Head of the Government, is satisfied, either with the Ministers whom he has under his control, in relation to the work associated with their particular Departments, or whether he can pretend even to be satisfied with himself, as the controller of that particular Governmental team.  It is one of the difficulties of Government, particularly in a time of emergency, that events crowd so thickly in that people at the seat of Government have not much time to go outside their offices, to meet people and to hear the casual conversation of the folk they are governing.  I do not know what contacts the Ministers maintain or the Taoiseach himself maintains at the moment with the outside world.  One knows that they are living a very definitely cloistered life, and that, in the main, their advice comes from members of the Civil Service, who have been living an equally cloistered life since the emergency started, and a somewhat cloistered life for 20 years before that.</P>
    <P>That is borne in upon Deputies like myself, who come to this House and see the complacency with which members <Col N="704" /> of the Government regard the situation, and who contrast that with the criticism that any Deputy can hear outside.  People have various feelings over this matter.  There is a sense of anger that certain things are allowed to occur, there is a definite sense of irritation at the way the Government behaves, in face of a certain situation, which they themselves have allowed to develop.  There is a feeling among the people that not alone is there not so much ability with regard to many things, but that there is not even energy now.  There does not seem to be anybody left capable of grappling with the situation or able to think ahead of what is likely to develop, even from the present position, or even a short time ahead.  Nobody seems to have the initiative to plot or to plan, even a few months ahead of the situation in which we find ourselves.  There is definitely a feeling in the country that fatigue and lethargy have overcome the members of the Government. Even if the policy were not exactly right, there could be energy in the promotion of whatever policy they had. We have seen examples in this House very often in the last two or three months of the welter of inconsistencies in the past in regard to policy, when members of the Government began to speak.  Above all, there is a feeling in the country of not merely disillusionment but something approaching despair.</P>
    <P>I read a comment recently by a member of one of the belligerent nations&mdash;a person who had migrated from his own country because he did not believe in the institutions set up there at a particular time.  He said that, looking back on those institutions now, when he sees how heroically that country is now fighting for those institutions, he has to confess that he made mistakes when he thought that he was leaving behind a people cowed into submission and without leadership enough to face their fears and seek a way out of the situation. It seemed then that there was no ability, no scheme of planning, and that the people would not be behind those rulers when the strain came.  He now writes a very definite recantation, and says he has to confess that there <Col N="705" /> must be, and must have been all along, a very high degree of preparedness and leadership; and that there was in the people, arising from these two things, a very high degree of discipline and the deepest possible loyalty.  I wonder how our people would fare if we applied that test.  Would we, by examination of the leadership of this country find a reason there for the condition the people are in?</P>
    <P>A matter that has been commented upon over and over again is that we are losing our population faster and faster as the months go by.  Statements were made from Government Benches, with which one must have some sort of sympathetic view, to the effect that it is hard to retain people in this country and prevent them from going to another country, where they can earn their livelihood, if an opportunity for work cannot be provided for them here, and yet, at the back of all that, there is also this to be thought of. Our people have been loyal, generally, to our own country and to whatever institutions we have, but suppose that there is here the same loyalty to our country and to whatever institutions: we have that exists in other countries that are now fighting for their own countries and their own institutions: would our young people be so ready to leave us simply because of the bait that is offered to them of a certain amount of moneys to be earned, moneys which they cannot get the chance of spending and the greater part of which has to be sent back to this country?  I think there is no great loyalty to the particular institutions that this country has, because there is no great belief in the institutions that we have, and there is certainly no belief that the people who are in control of these institutions are showing a high degree of preparedness or leadership of the kind that would induce both discipline in the people and a deep sense of loyalty.</P>
    <P>There are two Departments of Government upon which public attention has been focussed more and more.  The people's gaze is fixed definitely upon the two production Departments in the country, the Department of Agriculture <Col N="706" /> and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  When they would look at the Department of Industry and Commerce they would also have to view the situation with regard to supplies, and who could ask the people of this country to stay here if they had only what the Ministers in charge of those two Departments have to offer as a bait to keep these young people of ours in the country?  The Minister for Supplies speaks here of a worsening situation.  Apparently, he believes his duty is done when he paints as gloomy a picture as he can.  It certainly never occurs to him that, from time to time, he ought to have given the public some indication of what he did to prevent the situation becoming as bad as it is and how his efforts were frustrated.  As far as industry is concerned, there is a definite recognition that there is no possibility of development, and all the talk about self-sufficiency is only used now and again in an attempt to bolster up a political system or a politically-biassed system of economics, which broke down the moment the war made its first impact on us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in recent speeches, one made in Cork and the other made here in the outskirts of Dublin, has told us that the dairying industry is done and finished.  We have got very nearly the same comment with regard to bacon in recent weeks, and, no doubt, instructed by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government announced to the people that after the war was over he could not see any possibility that the live-stock trade in this country would continue.  That is what we are faced with, according to these two people who are in control of the production and development situation here in this country.  One of them tells us that two of our mainstays, as far as agriculture is concerned, are done and finished that they are gone.  The other attempts to boast now and again, and I think that if there was any good psychology about the Government or the Taoiseach himself in announcing what had been done in connection with post war development, they would not have allowed a statement to be made. <Col N="707" /> such as the one that was made by the Minister for Supplies.  Speaking here, on the 7th July, that Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Mulcahy also spoke about post-war planning.  The Dáil can assume that the matter of planning for the post-war situation has received very careful and continuous consideration from the Government. It is difficult to visualise the international situation in which this country will find itself when the war is over, and, consequently, in matters relating to the development of trade and economic conditions generally, it is not easy to embark on any programme of planning for that period with any confidence that the work done now will be of value when the time comes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But all that starts with the preamble that the matter of planning for the post-war situation had received very careful and continuous consideration from the Government.  Immediately, then, he discussed the question of organisation and said, with regard to that, that of course the Government had to depend on the report of the Vocational Commission which, he said, &ldquo;must be taken into account in that relationship and is about to appear&rdquo;. The moment those words were read in the Press the next day, members of the Vocational Commission jumped into print to say that the report would probably not be ready for a year.  Of course, when the Minister for Supplies talks about careful consideration being given to post-war planning, he reminds people of his own statement with regard to how his work was interrupted, pre-war, in order to get ready plans against an emergency.  I have referred to it often before, and it is made very relevant at the moment when the Minister, on 7th July, boasted in almost the same way about post-war development. In September of 1938 he announced:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Both myself and the officials of our Departments have been compelled during the last few weeks to neglect our ordinary activities, and, instead of exploring the new industrial possibilities and the necessary legislation, we have been <Col N="708" /> hastily devising plans to meet the possible emergency of a European war, including the rationing of petrol, the provision of necessary supplies, and the control of distribution. It is an unfortunate thing that so much energy, which should be available for the promotion of the prosperity of this country, has to be devoted now to work of that kind. I sincerely hope that the fruit of the work we have been doing for the past month or two will never see the light of day and that these plans will lie in their pigeon holes in the Department and accumulate the dust with the years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in September, 1938, a year before the war broke out, and the Minister had been hastily devising plans against the emergency; the whole programme was there mapped out&mdash;rationing, the provision of necessary supplies, and the control of distribution. The plans were there and pigeon-holed; they were to accumulate dust with the years.  When the war broke out, on the 27th September, a question was asked of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was Deputy MacEntee, and he referred to that time.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the general work of the trade and industries branch and, in particular, in relation to the maintenance and extension of normal employment in industry, I would say that a survey of our industrial activities undertaken so far back as the summer of 1938, by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, disclosed that such unemployment as would be occasioned here by a major war in Europe would be mainly due to interruption in the overseas supply of raw and partly-finished materials, fuel, machinery, and mechanical replacements and stores.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since that time, the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;in consultation with the representatives of our principal industries&mdash;has endeavoured by every means in its power to ensure that the largest practicable stocks of material and <Col N="709" /> machinery would be built up here so as to be available in such a situation as we are now facing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The comment on that, first of all, is that the great apostle of self-sufficiency, having surveyed the situation here in the summer of 1938, had come to the conclusion that the only repercussion of a major war in Europe on this country would be in the interruption of the following things: raw and partly-finished materials, fuel, machinery, and mechanical replacements and stores.  That was not much of a tribute to the self-sufficiency policy as carried out up to date.</P>
    <P>When the interruption of the war was going to mean a dislocation of our supplies in all these things, the Minister had foreseen that that was going to be met and made arrangements with the representatives of the principal industries to build up the largest possible stocks of machinery and so on. That is what we are told, but it is the memory of that sort of nonsense which has been revived by the Minister's latest statement that he is giving post-war planning the most careful and continuous consideration.  As I have expressed it here before, that Department is a joke amongst the community. On various occasions here we have asked the Minister to do this much for the people: that, of all the commodities which this country finds itself in need of, he would select one and tell us how his Department aided the community by getting in stocks of it, that he would tell us what the imports of it used to be year by year, and show us that there was extensive importing of it in the year that he had at his disposal from September, 1938, until the outbreak of war or, indeed, until April, 1940.  We have asked him from time to time to do that with regard to one or a number of commodities, and, having shown us that there were great importations of those things on which we had to depend from outside, to relate them to his own endeavours and show how he helped firms, whether it was by bank credit, Government loan, Government guarantee or mere suggestion, to get in those commodities.  We have asked him if <Col N="710" /> he could even tell us in respect of one commodity how, by mere suggestion, he had got stocks of it built up in the country.  If he were able to do that he would remove from himself some of the public ridicule and derision that is day by day being poured upon him and his whole Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hannigan touched upon a nervous point here this evening.  It is one of the kind of things that stupefies the community.  People have from time to time offered their ideas as to what this country has.  To start off with, you have the gentleman who says that it is richly endowed by nature, and has got everything, down to the individual who says that it has certain supplies of certain commodities, and that they should be used.  But if there is one thing that the people have been assured the country has it is all the turf that we need.  Yet, in spite of that, this city went through a bad time last winter and is promised a worse time ahead according to the Parliamentary Secretary.  When you inquire why this overpowering sufficiency of turf cannot be made available here in the city, the chief reason given is the lack of transport. Of course, transport was also thought out.  The present Minister for Local Government, speaking when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that &ldquo;despite the difficulty of the problem it had been thought out, and it was a relatively easy matter to get turf brought into Dublin.&rdquo;  The Minister for Education said that &ldquo;it was not necessary to wait until some newspapers told the Government to prepare plans; they had already been prepared&rdquo;&mdash;that was <i>apropos</i> of getting turf into the city.  Deputy Hannigan said that the turf situation at the moment is confounded by the fact that the railways cannot haul turf here, and the railways cannot do that because they have not enough fuel.</P>
    <P>I remember that the Minister for Industry and Commerce set up a special sub-section of his Department about the summer of 1938 to consider the possible emergence of a European war.  At that time a tribunal was sitting to consider the matter of transport. It was considered to be so urgent that the ordinary procedure of taking <Col N="711" /> evidence before the commission was abandoned.  The commission's labours were rushed.  The report of that tribunal was released to the public before the war broke out&mdash;about the last week of August, 1939.  The Government had the report in their hands from the early summer of 1939.  There were members of the Civil Service on the commission, and they no doubt made reports from time to time as to the type of evidence that was coming before them.  One of the surprising things that emerged from the report when it was published was the statement that the Great Southern Railways Company, because of financial stringency, had found it necessary to abandon their old habit of carrying a three weeks' supply of coal, and were driven to satisfy themselves with having one week's supply of coal in advance.  That report, as I have said, was in the hands of the Government, and was released to the public before the war broke out.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, was that the Government were fully apprised of the situation in regard to the main railway system of the country, a situation in which, owing to financial stringency, it could only carry one week's supply of coal in advance.  That is a single thing that the Minister for Supplies might attack.  What did he do about that situation?  Did he think it necessary to approach the directors of the railway to see whether they could finance further supplies of coal?  It was easy to get coal at that time and for months afterwards.  In fact, up to about the early spring of the following year coal was on offer in abundance.  The Minister has never told the public what he did in the emergency which that report revealed.  Of course, later on, when the question of the transport of turf into the city was under discussion, the present Minister for Local Government was able to say that it was an easy enough matter, that the whole thing had been thought out and that plans had been arranged.  We know now that there were no plans.  We know that the main railway system of the country was allowed to go lumbering along with only one week's supply of coal, with no suggestion from the <Col N="712" /> Government as to how the company might be financed to get coal, no suggestion to the banks as to whether the situation could be eased for the railways company, and no suggestion even from the Government to buy coal for the railway.  We do not even know if the Government had any touch with the Great Southern Railways Company on that matter.  What we do know is that the situation was not eased, and that we ran into the height of the war without any extra coal being procured.  We now find ourselves in this position, that while we have an amazing sufficiency of turf in the country it cannot be transported to Dublin for relief of the poor people in this city.</P>
    <P>What we suggest is that if the Government want to get any loyalty from the people they must do something to induce the belief that there is activity and ability in control.  If the Government have a case to make on supplies why cannot they adopt the suggestion so often put forward here: that the Minister would take a single commodity, or a range of commodities, and let us see what was done during the period when supplies were available? Instead of doing that, the Government adopt the device of handing out confidential reports to Deputies dealing with imports and exports, making them so confidential that they cannot be discussed in the Dáil.  The Minister for Supplies, in desperation one day, did say that if the import returns for eight months in the year 1939 were examined they would show the work done by his Department in the way of building up as large stocks as was practicable of certain essentials. Without revealing the contents of these reports, it is possible to say that if you take six or seven of the commodities the Minister mentioned on that occasion, an examination of the eight months' report will not bear out his statement that any great stocks of these materials were built up.  They do show that about a month's or six weeks' supplies were brought in in the eight months, and these over a range of six commodities.</P>
    <P>There is the situation in which the Government find themselves.  They ask <Col N="713" /> for co-operation.  It is difficult to find an occasion on which a Minister steps on a platform that he does not ask for the co-operation of people in defence matters.  The Government agree that they have got the fullest co-operation from Parties in this House and, so far as we have been able to affect people who adhere to us politically, they have got the fullest support of those people through the country on defence.  They ask for co-operation in every other way.  Do they not think that there is something due from them, that they must induce that co-operation, that they must show they are worthy of having that co-operation granted?  The only way they can show that is by showing that they did their work effectively or, if they have not done it, that they will make such a change as will secure that some new mind, some new energy, some new initiative will be brought to bear on the problems which face us.</P>
    <P>In connection with that co-operation, again the public are puzzled.  Possibly without knowing it, possibly because each man is simply living at the head of his own Department, is not in communion with his own colleagues, or certainly with the people outside, things apparent to the public may be escaping the vision of the Government.  But there is one thing which will not escape anyone and that is, while the Government ask for co-operation, they refuse co-operation themselves.  One has only to think of the different Ministers who have appeared here discussing Estimates this Session to realise that on every occasion an Estimate was discussed it has been found possible to bring forward something in connection with the Department that has been mooted by people, some way in which people have been touched by the Department, something that has caused immediate contact to be looked for between the Department and some section of the community, and on each occasion one finds that the Government attitude to criticism is that it is insulting. The Government know well&mdash;they have only to look back over the last two or three months&mdash;that they refused co-operation to the clothing trade when the question of rationing came on, and they refused it for a reason which was <Col N="714" /> definitely insulting to the people in that business.  They said they could not consult them beforehand because there would be a leakage of information. But they themselves adopted a plan which ensured that there would be a leakage, as there was.  They failed to get any support from the people who could give them help and the leakage was there all the time.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the Vote for the Department of Education, the question was raised in this House of a very ably written pamphlet, the result of certain questions sent out to certain teachers with regard to the teaching of various subjects through the medium of Irish.  It was a well-done piece of work.  A great deal of labour had gone to the preparation of it, a great deal of thought had gone to the setting out of the questions, and a variety of teachers throughout the country had responded.  There was no compulsion on them to do that, but they thought they were doing some good; that they were getting together a body of information which possibly would lead to a change of policy, or might further the policy which was being developed at the moment.  The attitude of the Minister for Education in regard to that was that he was definitely insulted by what these teachers had done.  He reprimanded them for their activity.  Of course, it was easy in the end, when there was no other argument to be used against what these teachers had done, to accuse them of being unnational, to say that all the answers they had given were simply founded upon the detestation of the language and an attempt to reverse a policy that the State had adopted 20 years ago, and had followed ever since.</P>
    <P>One could go through every Department of Government and say that the Government are at loggerheads with that section of the community with which that Department ought to be in most intimate contact.  Yet the Minister for Local Government, at war with pretty nearly every local authority which exists, could take to the boards on some platform about recruiting, and ask for the co-operation of the people. The Minister for Supplies, who refuses <Col N="715" /> to co-operate with anybody on any of the things he does, also asks for help. The Minister for Defence finally, in connection with this matter about which there is general agreement that there was co-operation, laments that the young people of the country are not doing their duty, that they are not coming into the Defence Forces as rapidly as one would expect.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the background to all that is that you will not get the people to help, at some hardship to themselves, nor will you get the same enthusiasm about people going into the Defence Forces to fight for the country unless they are satisfied that there is something worth fighting for and that whatever little resources we have are being handled with the best possible ability and with the greatest possible application and energy.  I suggest that what is lacking in this community at present is that there is no belief in the Government, and if the Government want to induce that belief in themselves and want to rehabilitate themselves to any degree in the eyes of the people, they will have to give some explanation of their conduct in relation to the different Departments.</P>
    <P>There are two matters about which the people are anxious.  One is the question of how far whatever resources we have will be handled to enable us to get through the war period more or less unscathed, certainly not bearing any more in the way of suffering than ought to be imposed upon us.  Outside that, people's minds are turning to the post-war period and they are asking themselves: is it possible that the people who have so mishandled the recent past and the present are capable of providing the ability and the effort required, even to sketch out in a skeleton way any policy for the post-war period for this country? Whatever belief they might have had that the Government, by the incidence of events, would be roused to think of a post-war policy, whatever little hope they might have had of that will be dissipated by the fact that the person allowed to announce in this House the Government attitude post-war is the <Col N="716" /> man who was capable of boasting in 1938, when facing the emergency of a European war, and even in the early stages of the war, about the great stocks of supplies built up in the country.</P>
    <P>We are neutral in this struggle; we are isolated from the events of the war.  But we cannot isolate ourselves from the ideas that the war is creating.  There are new policies being thought out all over the world. Certain moorings to which people were tied have been definitely destroyed.  They will never have these attachments again.  Wealth has been destroyed to such an extent that the post-war economics of certain of the belligerents must undergo remarkable change.  A mere reading of the daily newspapers will show that all over the world these things are being spoken of and thought of.  Even though the post-war organisation is not perfected and the end of the war is not yet and it is not possible to fashion a new policy to fit into new circumstances, minds are alert to what is required, and people are thinking and trying to plan out, even in a fumbling way, for what is ahead.  Their thoughts range very widely; housing, education, systems of work, the interlocking of one national economy with another, the question of how exchange control is to be got rid of or maintained, the question of whether in the post-war world it is to be individual activity and enterprise or whether it is to be the State intervening with some sort of public utility corporation.  All these problems are being discussed, but not here.  So far, we have had no hint that any thought is being given to any of these things beyond what was stated on the 7th July, which was of a kind to cause a chill of disappointment to everybody: &ldquo;The Dáil can assume that the matter of planning for the post-war situation is receiving very careful and continuous consideration from the Government.&rdquo;  Relating that to the activities of the individual who spoke it, and testing him by what he previously boasted he was doing in 1938, and facing 1939, testing him by the accuracy of that, there could be nothing but disappointment about the first Government contribution to this <Col N="717" /> idea of post-war planning, and that he was the person put up to speak about it.</P>
    <P>We have been discussing, and we will discuss almost immediately, the question of credit in connection with this State.  There may be many views, conservative and forward, with regard to credit, but I doubt if there is any parliamentary assembly in the world in which so much in the way of conservatism in connection with public credit has been spoken as in this House within the last couple of months. Every country has taken at least a modern view of the banking system. There are divergencies here and there as to what amount of public control is to be associated with such an institution as a central bank, and there are divergencies here and there as to how the control should be exercised.  There is no country which set out to shape such an institution in the year 1942, and laid the plan of it along such conservative lines as we have laid it. Why the Government moved in this matter along such lines, I do not know. But they have shown their hand; they have presented this as something they did make some shaping of.  It cannot be anything but a disappointment to find that views that are regarded as out-dated by at least 25 years are still regarded by the Government as good and as proper to project into the immediate future in respect of credit conditions in this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that they cannot hope to survive, nor can the institutions of the State survive, unless the people can be made believe in the necessity of government as such. I suggest that there must be leadership, and around the individual leader there must be people who will recognise the problems that the future is bringing, and who will show some talent in their approach to these problems, and some way of handling them.  Anything we have had from the Government so far has shown them as helpless in facing up to problems, unable to attend to anything, their main effort being to excuse themselves for the omissions of the past.  The Government cannot get along without the <Col N="718" /> co-operation of the community and that co-operation, no matter how much they plead for it, will not be given unless they show they deserve it.  Their activities so far do not show they deserve it.</P>

      <P>Recently a decision was arrived at to hold local elections. It was hoped to be able to conduct them on a non-Party basis, but, according to the reports going around, the Fianna Fáil organisation would seem to be active.  I do not suggest that the Taoiseach has inspired this; I do not know whether he approves it or merely connives at it, but I suggest that the sooner there is a clarification of the position by the Taoiseach, the better for the country. It would be well to let the people know what the intentions are.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policy of the Government on agriculture, I believe that is the most important matter that concerns the people at the present time.  The Government's policy in regard to wheat growing is open to criticism in various ways.  Untimely propaganda has been responsible for a very serious reduction in the yield. I remember last winter when large areas of land were covered with water and the land was most unsuitable to put anything into it.  I asked a representative of the Department would he advise farmers to sow wheat at that time. He looked at me to see whether I was sane and serious.  Apparently he satisfied himself I looked serious enough and he said: &ldquo;I wonder at a practical farmer asking such a question. You would be mad to put anything in the land now.&rdquo;  I said I wondered why the Department were using the radio to send out propaganda night after night calling on the farmers to sow wheat.  He shook his head and said that he was not responsible for that type of propaganda.  Who is responsible for it?  It was very untimely and it did a considerable amount of harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers will be more or less influenced by statements made over the radio.  They regard these people as authorised to speak on behalf of the Department and they are disposed to credit them with knowing what they <Col N="719" /> are talking about.  The mistake is that the people in the city, although they may be experts in agriculture, are not aware of the conditions in the country districts.  No doubt if they were in the country they would be able to give more helpful advice.  They would know the state of the weather.  I suggest that before they make statements on the radio they should communicate with agricultural instructors and gather their opinions as to when the sowing of wheat and other crops could best be undertaken.  The instructors would acquaint them of the weather conditions and the state of the land. Last year, when the really good time for sowing wheat came round, there was not a word about it.  It so happened that at the wrong time they recommended wheat sowing.  Last October was an excellent time for sowing wheat.  As a rule that is the best period of the year, yet there was not a word about it then.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Department should use the radio and the newspapers to encourage the sowing of wheat in October.  They could advise the people to prepare the land, to sow the wheat and they would be almost certain of an excellent crop.  Unfortunately, they advised the farmers to sow wheat in December and January, when the land was unsuitable, and that was responsible for the wheat shortage and it meant a serious loss to thousands of farmers.  I hope that mistake will not be repeated this year and that the Department will be more careful in giving advice to farmers.  The proper time is in October, because then the land is in a very suitable condition. Anything missed at that time should be left over until the conditions are suitable for a spring crop.</P>
    <P>I might also call attention to the question of sheep dipping.  Sheep are not dipped at the proper time.  That is the general opinion of practical farmers down the country.  They are dipped too late in the season and many of them suffer from skin diseases and diseases caused by insects through failure to dip them in time. I believe that dipping should be carried out earlier and, if it were, there would be less disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am briefly referring to it.  I am not going to dwell upon it.  This matter is very important and we will not have another opportunity of discussing it and time is going on.  I wish the Department would take a note of it.  The policy of the Government with regard to pigs is ruinous, not only to the farmers, but to the consumers, the traders and the curers.  The factories are being closed and we see the comments that have been made in court by the judges about the mess that has been made of the whole pig business.  The curers are paying big fines for trying to get pigs to fill the quota.  They are breaking the law if they do not fill their quota and they are breaking the law when they try to fill the quota.  The only alternative is to close the factories. What is responsible for this position? The Government is responsible, through the Pigs and Bacon Board, for lowering the price at a time when they should have increased it and by trying to force agricultural producers to feed the people of this nation without giving them the cost of production, compelling them to do what nobody would be expected to do, that is, to produce at a loss.  In such a situation, the inevitable result is the disorganisation of the nation's food production. That has happened.  The pigs are gone.  There is no bacon.  The consumer has not benefited; he has lost. The consumer is prepared to pay a decent price if he is allowed to and even the curer who could afford to pay a better price without increasing the cost of bacon and who would be anxious to pay more is not allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deliberate policy of the Government, it appears, is to persecute the people on the land, with what object nobody can understand.  Certainly the country is losing by it in many ways. Employees of the bacon industry are being dismissed.  People are left without bacon.  What does the consumer gain?  What do the workers gain?  The farmers certainly have lost.  The pig trade is disorganised for, at least, the <Col N="721" /> next 12 months.  I think the Government should look into this matter.  I would recommend one thing, that they should abolish the Pigs and Bacon Board.  It has proved a failure.  It does not understand its business at all. I would recommend that it should be abolished unless it is carried on in a different way and consults with some agricultural council, some representative body representing agriculture, that would be of some use and give sensible advice to enable pig production to be carried on.  Without pigs, what can be done?</P>
    <P>At the present time we have a surplus of potatoes.  I saw a question on the Order Paper to-day about it, but I do not know what the reply was.  The position in County Monaghan has been the position generally throughout the country.  We were blessed with a good season last year and the whole country was full of potatoes.  They had to be sold at from 3d to 4d. a stone all over the country, and there were no pigs to consume them because the price fixed for bacon pigs was not sufficient to encourage people to go in for pig breeding.  In order to keep up a supply of pigs people must be able to see at least 12 months ahead before they will keep sows and take the risk of rearing pigs and having them on their hands.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more important to consider than the question of pig rearing and the use to be made of surplus potatoes.  I pointed out in March last to the Minister for Agriculture, just before he lowered the prices, that I thought he should increase the prices, that it was the wiser thing to do.  If that had been done and if a guarantee had been given at that time that a remunerative price would be forthcoming for pigs, people would be encouraged to breed more pigs and to grow more potatoes.  People who got bitten this time by growing more potatoes than there was a decent price for did not put in so much this year. They will put in less next year unless there is a change of policy.  I pointed this out before, and time will tell whether I was right or wrong.  People will not produce potatoes to sell them at 3d. or 6d. a stone.  That is what <Col N="722" /> they got.  Potatoes could not be produced at anything like that price.  The only profitable use that surplus potatoes can be put to is to feed them to pigs.  A surplus of potatoes is a good thing to have in this country, because if other things run short we will never be short of food if we have a surplus of potatoes.  The growing of potatoes should be encouraged, and the way in which it can be encouraged is to see that people get a return for their work.</P>
    <P>I know it may be desirable, and perhaps even necessary, to take control of the pig trade in a time like the present, but unless there is a little foresight and efficiency in exercising this control, we would be much better without it.  I think whatever control should be maintained, the Pigs and Bacon Board should be abolished.  It has proved itself unfit for its job.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach is interested in turf.  We hear a lot about production of turf and the tonnage.  A lot of the turf I see contains a great deal of water.  I see it in the city and down the country&mdash;turf produced at the expense of the ratepayers by the county engineer&mdash;and it is worth nothing.  It is not worth carting to the bog road to bury it.  It would not be fit for clamping.  At the end of 12 months it would be a heap of useless mud that would cost the ratepayers money to cart away and bury it.  I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the Turf Controller that they should get people who understand something about turf.</P>

      <P>I am only just making a passing reference to it.  There is a shortage of transport at present, and just imagine the waste of petrol, the waste of transport, in drawing water from the bogs when it should be used for drawing fuel.  That is a matter to which the Taoiseach might call the attention of the Turf Controller. It would be for the general benefit if he did so, because I pity the people sitting trembling, on a cold winter's night, beside the fire when they have to pay for fuel at the rate of £3 4s. for a ton&mdash;for a ton of water.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House because the Taoiseach has undoubtedly heard already about the condition of affairs in the country.  I quite appreciate that the Taoiseach is not a superman, and that he cannot cure all the evils from which the country suffers, and the suggestions I want to make are put forward with a view to helping the Taoiseach because we have to consider the position at the moment in the light of the position of the world at present.  The matter on which I propose to speak now has been referred to by most Deputies, but I think it my duty to bring it to the notice of the Taoiseach again.  It is that many farmers in County Louth feel irritated as a result of the price they are receiving for pigs. In all seriousness, I suggest to the Taoiseach that the Pigs and Bacon Board should be dispensed with at present. In the name of common sense, what is the use of having a board which costs a good deal annually when there is very little for it to do and when anything it does is more harmful than beneficial to the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the case which appeared in the papers in which bacon curers were prosecuted for giving a higher price for pigs than the controlled price.  That, in my opinion, is deplorable.  It is unpardonable to pursue such a policy at the present juncture, more especially as there is a scarcity of pigs, and particularly as most farmers are going out of pig production because the price paid is not an economic price.  Why not let these curers buy pigs in the open <Col N="724" /> market and finish, once and for all, with control so far as this industry is concerned?  There is another matter which is more or less ancillary, that is, the question of potatoes.  It is my firm belief, and I have examined the situation for the past week or two, that there would not be the surplus of potatoes which at present exists in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth were it not for the controlled price of pigs.  Most of the farmers there are going out of pig production simply because of the price, and these surplus potatoes would have been used long ago if the price were anywhere near satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate the reasons behind the Government's decision to have controlled prices.  I quite agree that there are sound arguments for it, but those arguments do not hold in this particular emergency, because the people want the bacon and are prepared to pay the price.  The farmers will rear them, but they cannot rear them on the prices they are getting. I saw small pigs sold at the fair of Dundalk at from £2 to £3 each, and anybody who knows anything about rearing pigs knows that a few months' feeding would be necessary before those pigs would realise £5.  No man is going to give £3 for a pig when, after feeding it for three or four months, he will be offered £5.  The proof that it is impossible is only a matter of figures, and I suggest that the Taoiseach would be very well advised to dispense with that board at present and to let the curers buy in the open market.  There would be none of these prosecutions, with senior counsel and all the expense that is incurred in presenting the case and in the curers defending it.  It is about time that something serious was done in regard to the prices paid for pigs.</P>
    <P>There is another matter and I mention it, in all seriousness, for the peace of the country.  I have spoken of it before and I am not one to make things awkward for the Government. Sometimes the speeches delivered here are, I think, too doleful.  We need to get a little cheery because we are not as down and out as we are supposed to be.  We are a people who are supposed to face all difficulties courageously <Col N="725" /> and we do not usually put up the white flag very quickly and, therefore, I am not to be taken as casting reflections on the Government for everything they do, but is it not about time the Taoiseach decided to remove the Standstill Order?  If there are employers prepared to give a small increase in wages, let them do so.  They will not jeopardise their financial position by paying wages which they cannot afford to pay.  There are firms which can afford to pay a few shillings extra and why not let them do so? The workers are entitled to it, and in that connection I think the Taoiseach must pay a tribute to the workers. They have not gone out of their way to make things awkward for the Government. They have stood more or less loyally by the Standstill Order and have not gone out of their way to create disturbance.  There may be threats, but I know the working class as well as any Deputy on the Labour Benches or any other benches and, taking them all round, they are just as good citizens as any other section.</P>
    <P>I do know for a fact, however, that they feel a great grievance at present and I think the Taoiseach would be well advised to modify, or to remove in its entirety, this Standstill Order, which prevents men from getting a few shillings extra in the week in order to purchase the necessaries of life, the costs of which are going up almost day by day.  I do not attribute these increased costs entirely to the Government.  They are due to circumstances over which they have no control.  The scarcity of materials and so forth tends to create these increased prices, and these men are entitled to a few shillings a week more.  The Government have modified the Order in certain respects, and why they did not do it long ago passes my comprehension, especially in so far as it affected men who were being paid no more than 30/- a week at that time.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter which I should like the Taoiseach to keep before his mind.  It is that, when making public announcements, they should be as near the mark as possible.  The scarcity of wheat last year was, in the main, responsible for the quantities of potatoes in the <Col N="726" /> country at present.  Farmers naturally thought that potatoes would fetch a much higher price in March, April and May than the price obtaining in the winter months, and the effect of the statements as to the scarcity of wheat, although at the time the Minister was possibly quite right in warning the people, was that large quantities of potatoes were kept over.  With the reduction in the price of pigs, the position which exists at the moment in relation to pigs and potatoes was brought about.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the area under crops, I have been listening to discussions week after week about the wheat supplies that are available but, candidly, I must confess that I am somewhat bewildered.  After all, it should not be very difficult for the Minister responsible to say that we have 500,000, 400,000 or 350,000 acres of wheat, as the case may be, sown and that the yield will be so many tons. Assuming that the yield is a ton to the acre, it should not be a very difficult thing to say that we would have 500,000, 400,000 or 350,000 tons of wheat for the year, but last year the Minister was out in his calculations as to the yield by about 100,000 tons. That is a big margin of error in calculations so vital to the people.  I seriously suggest that the Government or the Minister responsible should be in as good a position to give fairly exact information to the people of this country as the Food Controller in England is when he gets up in the House of Commons and says: &ldquo;I can promise you, as Food Controller, that you will have a sufficient supply of such-and-such a commodity.&rdquo;  We have never any statement of that kind here, but I cannot see why we should not be in a position to tell the people whether there will be next year sufficient wheat, oats, barley or any of the other necessary cereals that enter into the family diet.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the matters that I should like to bring before the Taoiseach.  I do not propose to deal with the question of turf further than to say that up till recently we could make allowance for the fact that we had very little previous experience in so far as the production of turf was <Col N="727" /> concerned, but the time has now arrived when the people who are buying turf at 64/- per ton deserve at least some little consideration.  They deserve good quality turf.  Again, I do not want to exaggerate the position, but I personally have seen some turf which should not have been brought to the dumps at all.  It is a waste of petrol, a waste of railway transport, and a waste of labour to bring such turf to the dumps.  I am afraid much of this turf will not be purchased, and if it is purchased it will have the effect of arousing very considerable criticism for the Government amongst the purchasers. That may be a very small matter in the eyes of some people, but anyone who has any experience of the conditions under which the working classes live, who, for instance, sees a poor woman buying a bag of turf at 3/- or 3/6, and who considers that she will have very little of that turf left at the end of the day, must realise that expenditure on fuel alone works out at somewhere in the region of £1 a week. Surely to goodness, these people ought to get as good quality as possible, not the type of turf that we see in the various dumps in the city and all over the country.</P>
    <P>We are passing through very difficult times, and we have all got to help one another.  There is no use in our losing our heads or getting into a temper, as Deputy O'Loghlen did this evening. Deputy Dillon made his speech, and that is that.  There is no use getting excited over these matters.  Only by co-operation and making allowance for the feelings of others, and we all have our feelings, can we make any progress. We cannot work miracles.  We have learned our lesson here, especially those members of the Government Benches who were of opinion that we could live without help from any other country.  That idea is exploded.  We must all recognise that we are a very small nation here, and that our best efforts are needed to get through the very difficult and exceptional time facing us.  We can best get through that difficult period by co-operation, but if we do co-operate, we want some little thing in return.  We want the <Col N="728" /> Government to be up and doing, especially in regard to the matters that have been brought to the notice of the House this evening.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by impressing on the Taoiseach the necessity for removing the Pigs and Bacon Board and allowing the curers to buy their pigs in the open market.  I am almost certain that if that were done, there would be a very large increase in the number of pigs produced by farmers in the coming year.  When all is said and done, the farmers have stood up well to the test to which they were subjected. They have done their bit.  They have answered the call so far as increased tillage and increased production are concerned and they deserve well of the country.  If these matters which are at present causing a great deal of irritation to the farming section of the community were attended to, a very big grievance would be removed.</P>

      <P>I think that in future years before the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach comes on, there should be some arrangement made through the Committee of Procedure and Privileges so that the debate on an occasion like this would be of some real value, that it would not be simply used as an opportunity to go over all the other Estimates again, to take up points that were dealt with by Ministers when presenting their various Estimates, and to go into details which I could not possibly get except from these Ministers.  If there are questions that concern a particular Department, then by all means address these questions to the head of the Department, to the Minister, particularly if there are questions of policy involved when his Estimate is under consideration. That does not mean for one moment that the Taoiseach, the head of the Government, can in any way dissociate himself from the work of the various Departments.  The Constitutional position, the position of the Executive, is known to every Deputy here.  The Government must be one and must bear full collective responsibility. I agree absolutely with the statement that the head of the Government <Col N="729" /> for the time being has to bear full responsibility for any faults that are in the Government.  I do not want to avoid that question for one moment in asking that when the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach is under consideration, an attempt should be made on that Estimate to deal with the broader points of national policy and that if possible the method formerly adopted should be followed, namely, that notice be given to the Government by the Opposition of the points which they intend to bring forward in the debate so that the necessary details could be made available and so that one would not find it necessary to send for statistics to all sorts of Departments when a Deputy makes some statement about a Department which may or may not be true.</P>
      <P>That is purely on the question of order, and of making the debates here valuable.  I think the debate on this occasion was probably the worst, from that point of view, that has taken place here so far as the Department of the Taoiseach is concerned.  I do not propose for a moment to take up the various points of detail, such as the question of whether trucks are going empty or not.  Naturally, if I were to deal with that, I would say that, if an arrangement can be made by which there can be loads for the lorries on the return journey, it will be done by all means.  That is common sense.  I have not the slightest doubt that those who are responsible considered the possibility of that, and, if it is not being done, I for one am fairly well satisfied that the organisation of it would give results which would not be worth while; that there would be a great deal of effort, and that, in the nature of things, the results would be very little.</P>

I think every Department and every Minister would be very happy to consider suggestions which would be of help at the present moment.  I just mention that in passing.  I will not set myself the task of answering in detail the various points connected with the Department of Supplies, or connected with the Department of Agriculture.  Take, for instance, the bacon question.  The bacon question is down for a motion before the Dáil adjourns.  Is it not very much better that that should be dealt with as a definite motion, and that all the implications of policy should be fully discussed with regard to one particular thing rather than in a debate of this kind?</P>

      <P>I am only suggesting that we want to make the debate valuable. It ought to be the most important debate of the year, a debate with regard to the large points of the national policy as a whole.  The matter which Deputy Dillon raised was one in which he stands alone, practically, and I do not want to follow him up.  Still, he could defend it on those grounds, that it was a large matter of national policy, and I, for one, could not object to his raising it on this Vote, although I doubt the wisdom of it.</P>

      <P>I am not going into that at the moment, but if it were to be raised there is no doubt that it could be claimed to be a matter which naturally would come up for discussion when the Taoiseach's Vote was being debated.  I tried to recollect a few of the things that were said which I would <Col N="731" /> regard as of major importance.  There is, first of all, the whole question of administration&mdash;the responsibility of the Head of the Government for everything that is done.  There is nobody in the country who has any doubt whatever, no matter what is suggested, that for the things which are done by the Government I have to bear full responsibility, a greater responsibility even than that of the particular Minister who is involved, because it is true that I took the responsibility of nominating the Ministers, and that, both as Head of the Government and as the person who nominated the Ministers to their posts, I have to take full responsibility. I have not the slightest intention of shirking any responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that I am glad to stand behind the work that has been done by those two Ministers.  There is a suggestion that they are tired, or something else.  One would imagine that Deputies were talking about people who were 70 or 80 years of age.  Those two men are relatively young men. The members of this Government are relatively young men.  I am the oldest. The majority of the members are so young that, if you were to take the Governments of the world, you probably would not find members of that age in them.  I would say that the average age of the members of this Government is less than the average age of the members of most Governments in the world.  There can be no suggestion that, at a time of crisis like this, we have people in office here who are too old to bear the burdens of that office.  That is not true, and I say this, that if I had the choice of every single member of this House&mdash;which I have not, of course&mdash;and I were choosing a Minister to take charge of Supplies, I would choose the present Minister.  I would choose him because I know him to be a man of energy, a man who works.  I should like to say that a scandalous campaign, underground, has been carried on against that same Minister for months.  Even if I could, I certainly have not the slightest desire in any way to dissociate myself from the work which he is doing in his office.  I believe honestly at the moment that there is not a single person <Col N="732" /> in this House who could substitute him in doing the work.  He was called upon at a time of great crisis to bear by far the heaviest burden, a burden which I should certainly hesitate to put on old shoulders.  There were no precedents which would guide him. He was the first Irish Minister, in a war situation, to have to take upon himself the burden of trying to see that supplies were made available under the complex conditions of modern society.  I think the attacks upon him were most unfair, and I do believe that, of the people who were making attacks upon him for the conduct of his work, there is not a single one who, deep down in his heart, believes he could improve the position.</P>
    <P>We are working in a war situation. As I have said, there are no precedents. There was no organisation. Relatively speaking, it came quickly. Very few people could clearly see ahead the nature of the situation in which we are involved.  Nations which have much more experience of wars and their consequences than we have were not able to foresee it, or to take measures that would see them right through the whole period.  If ever there was a country that had experience Britain had.  They had experience of the last war.  They knew the dangers they would run through shortage of shipping; they knew the dangers they would run through shortage of supplies; they knew the dangers in which they would be involved if they were not fully equipped and armed and all the rest of it.  They had experience.  Read the British papers and you will easily satisfy yourself that they were not able to foresee all the circumstances with which they had to deal, and that they were not able, with all these experiences, with all their wealth and with all their power, to make provision in advance to save their citizens during the present time from shortages of various kinds.</P>
    <P>It will be said that Britain is at war and that we are not at war.  That is true.  If we were at war, over and above the difficulties and burdens we have at the present time we would have all the cruelties of war, all the hardships <Col N="733" /> which a direct physical war would impose.  When the war began, I feel certain that one of the first statements I made to the people was that, even though we are spared from being physically involved in this conflict, modern society and modern economic organisation are such that we cannot save ourselves from the various repercussions of a clash of the magnitude of that which is taking place.  I think&mdash;and I have spoken to people who have been visiting this country&mdash;that, as a people, we ought to be extremely thankful to Almighty God for having saved us from the dangers from which we have so far been saved.</P>
    <P>As regards the hardships which, undoubtedly, a considerable section of our people are suffering, these are small compared with the hardships we might have expected.  If we, as a community, try to help those who are suffering most, if those who are relatively strong make up their minds to lend their aid to the community so as to help the weak and those who are suffering, and if they regard that help as their share of the burden, I think we shall be able to carry on.  If the war were to end to-morrow, I do not think that anybody could honestly say that we had suffered tremendously during the past three years.  We have suffered through shortages.  I do not want to rub in anything about our policy in the past.  I am taking it as admitted that, whatever differences there may have been between us in the past, there is no difference between Parties about the advisability of making the fullest possible use of our resources at the moment. But I do say that it was fortunate that the preparation over a number of years in trying to get our people to organise themselves so as to make most use of their resources had taken place.</P>
    <P>As regards wheat, the figure I have got for this year is 585,000 acres, more than was produced in this part of the country back to '48 or thereabouts. Would anybody here think it would have been possible to jump from 21,000 acres, which was the figure about the time we took office, to <Col N="734" /> 585,000 acres in the course of a few years, remembering that the country had to be educated as regards the possibility of growing wheat to any large extent?  Now, there is a swing round and we are told that we ought to compel each farmer to grow his quota of wheat, quite irrespective of whether his farm could grow that particular proportion of wheat or not. We did not adopt that policy.  If there had been a poorer response, we might have had to do that.  If conditions get worse and we require a still greater quantity of wheat, we may have to do that.  Like rationing and other things, it would be an extremely complicated job.  It would be necessary to have inspectors on practically every farm in order to be satisfied that a particular farm could reasonably grow wheat.  I do believe that wheat can be grown in a far greater variety of soils than was admitted in the past and that if we want&mdash;as we really do want&mdash;100,000 acres more we can get them.  What we tried to do was to give a reasonable price for wheat, to point out to the farmers what was needed and to ask them to do their part in giving that particular food to the country.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that there had been no planning.  That is not true.  We were the first Government&mdash;I admit we have not had many successions of Governments in this part of the country, and that there would be no use in making comparisons with the conditions in which our predecessors took office which may not have lent themselves to this particular development&mdash; to set out definitely several points in a programme covering the political, social, economic and cultural fields.  I remember that, many times, when challenged in this House about that programme, I could stand up and read it and tick off each item which had been carried out.  Some of these items in the political, cultural, economic and social fields are not yet completed, but it is not true to say that there was no plan.  So far as looking to post-war conditions is concerned, if we were to swing around to post-war conditions, I, if I were requesting the people again to entrust us with Executive authority, <Col N="735" /> would ask to be permitted to complete the programme of self-sufficiency&mdash;I am leaving the political aspect for the moment aside&mdash;to the extent we had always envisaged, not an extravagant extent, as some people would like to make it appear.  They would represent us as wanting to grow oranges and bananas.  We did not say anything of the kind, but we did say we could produce from the soil of this country the food the people needed.  If we could not have oranges and bananas, we could have apples and pears and other things.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If people want to get bananas, they can get them.  We are not going to stop the importation of bananas.  We want to do everything in our power to see that the soil of this country produces the things which it, naturally, can produce and which are needed for our own population&mdash;wheat, sugar, and so forth.  If we were to go for re-election to-morrow, I would say to the people: &ldquo;I intend to complete that programme to the fullest extent possible.&rdquo;  I believe that it would be a much easier task for any succeeding Government to get the wheat we require produced than it was for us to secure production.  It has been proved that it can be done.  The importance of doing it can be realised, and from the community point of view, the value of doing it would be appreciated in a way it was not appreciated eight or ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing to set out to do is to produce the food&mdash;in that term I include fruits and such things&mdash;required by our people.  We should produce these by the labour of our own people on their own farms.  I realise, and we have always realised, that there are a number of things which we have not got.  Our aim should be to get these things produced here or substitutes for them.  Even when we shall have gone a good distance in that direction, there is no doubt that a number of things will have to be got from outside.  We have not got certain raw materials.  We shall have to strive to get these raw materials.  It should be the aim of our scientists and industrialists <Col N="736" /> to substitute these foreign raw materials by home raw materials, when possible.  When that is practicable, it should always be regarded as a great advance.  I have always thought that we should make far greater use of our native wool in the manufacture of our clothing than has been done.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce several times about the progress that was being made in that direction.  We were met by the industrialists&mdash;the cloth manufacturers&mdash; with all sorts of difficulties&mdash;the same sort of difficulties that were raised by the farmers in connection with the growing of wheat.  We encountered the same sort of opposition from other people.  There is a very natural physical law, which, I am told, runs even beyond the physical world, the law of inertia.  We like to keep on in the same direction, we like to say that we are getting on very well as we are, and we do not want to put ourselves to all the expense, risk and trouble of doing something new.  That inertia is always there, and always will be one of the obstacles in the way of any progressive Government.  There always will be people who can find a thousand and one reasons why a thing should not be done and deep down the real reason is that they do not want to be put out of the old rut by having to do something new or novel or something to which they were not accustomed.</P>
    <P>Very often, Governments have to choose between taking a certain risk and ignoring the opposition of people like that, or of succumbing to them. Sometimes it is said that these people know their business very much better than we do.  It is a very dangerous thing for the Government, with only general ideas and a certain programme, to try to barge through opposition of that sort; but we have had to do it and, thank God, we have succeeded. All I am sorry for&mdash;if I have any regrets&mdash;is that we did not barge much more stubbornly and much more quickly than we did.  If I were talking to other people who might possibly be here, I would say: &ldquo;Do not allow the people who will not see the needs in the main and who think only of their own narrow portion, to stop you if <Col N="737" /> you are satisfied in general that you are facing for the right objective.&rdquo;  We have had to do that on a number of occasions in the past, and the only regret I have is that the war came upon us when we had not advanced sufficiently.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not here when Deputy McGilligan was speaking, but I have a picture of him in my mind when he was saying how impossible it was to make boots and shoes, and so on, here, as we had not got the operatives to work the machines nor the managers to manage such businesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, if you are planning on this basis, you have to go down to the very last thing and know that, when you have added a little fraction to the price, you have to face it&mdash;and I believe in facing it.  That is why, when there was opposition from the farmers on account of the increased cost of the things they had to buy, I said, and felt, that there was a balance here between manufacturing industries and the agricultural industry.  The agricultural industry would benefit in a thousand ways by having other industries built up side by side with them.  I am not going to deal with all the advantages there were.  I used to point them out, and I am repeating now the substance of speeches I made at practically every cross-roads in the country, and I think Deputies will admit that I am talking plain common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the farmers, a farm can only keep a succession of one male member as owner of the farm, unless it is large enough to be divided up. Therefore, if there is one more than one boy in a family, ultimately that boy must go somewhere else, and must be provided for.  There is nothing for him to do but go to undeveloped countries. When there are four or five boys <Col N="738" /> in a family, the father tries to get a farm for one boy somewhere else, and in most cases he leaves his own farm to the youngest son, I believe.  It is not easy to get land here, and even a successful farmer with four or five sons finds it difficult to get another farm of land for one who may be interested in farming.  That farmer is faced with the problem of placing his sons.  He thinks of a profession for one.  If there is a variety of industries, and if the life of the community is varied, there is a possibility of putting one son into one of the various industries.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the past, most of them had to go in for the professions, as our industrial life was not sufficiently wide to absorb them.  Then the professions became overcrowded, and it was necessary to seek an opening in other countries for those qualified in that particular way.  I have regarded that as a pity from the national point of view.  If we had large families&mdash; and it is a pity that we have not many marriages in the rural parts of the country&mdash;we could afford to let some of our people go, and keep the stock, so as to have a reasonable increase at home.  I have said in the past, and I believe still, that if there were twice as large a population here some of our economic problems would be easier. We should try to build up towards that and work in that direction.</P>
    <P>We set out to build up our manufacturing industries side by side with agriculture.  If the war were over to-morrow, and we had to start again, I believe that would be the right policy for the country.  Though I admit I have modified my views in a number of respects, and found, perhaps, that the limit to which we could go was somewhat shorter than I had supposed, in the main I have to confess that my experience here has strengthened me in the views I had when coming into office; and the programme which we had in mind then is the programme which I would suggest to our people for the post-war period.</P>

      <P>I assure him that if anything can be put from the opposite benches, that will improve it and give us a more real power than we appear to have got, there is nobody in the country who would welcome it more than I would.  Now, that is honest and true.  I say, however, that, looking at the situation from outside, it seemed to us that our country was becoming more and more a cattle ranch, that we were being put in the position of having to compete in our agricultural products here, under a comparatively high standard of living&mdash;relatively high &mdash;with the vast undeveloped countries which were competing with us, and that we were being brought into the position in which our people could not compete successfully because they would not get prices which would keep them in production. The Deputy may not think so, but that is how it appeared to me. I felt that that was a wrong policy, and, therefore, what we had to do was to try to produce the food for our own people and to try to do our utmost to see that the population here was on the increase, because every additional person kept in this country was an additional consumer for our farmers' produce.  Consequently, we would have a certain balance between the <Col N="740" /> manufacturing industries, and those who were engaged in them, and the farming industry.</P>
      <P>My own belief&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash; is that up to the present the farmer has got the worst of the bargain.  We have inherited a standard here&mdash;I am talking now in general terms&mdash;which was the standard of a great manufacturing country, and side by side with that we had conditions that were more or less the same as theirs.  I believe that under these conditions our farmers got the worst of it, and that when we took over, the position again was that the reward which the rural population got, from the point of view of the work they did, and the importance of their function in regard to the community as a whole, was not commensurate with the reward that the people in the towns got.  That was my view, but I did believe that as we went on, and if our industries developed more, we would be able to get that balance internally. I believe that that is so, so far as the future is concerned, and that the Government that is able to build up these industries to such an extent as will enable them to keep an increase of population, is ultimately going to be of the best benefit to the farmers, if there was a balance.</P>
      <P>Over and above producing the things that were necessary for our own people, there was also, of course, the problem of paying for the things which, we all admit, we could not produce, and for which, at the moment anyhow, there were no substitutes.  Again, I believe that it should be the daily task of those in charge to try to get substitutes and more and more of the materials which we could produce here at home, but there were a number of raw materials and other things which we could not produce here, or at least which could only be produced here at an absurdly uneconomic cost.  Mind you, I am slow to use that, because I think that very often people are inclined to take a very narrow view of these economic costs, but, at any rate, we would have to get these supplies. Now, how were we to do it?  We could only do it by having a surplus to export.  Where were we to look for that surplus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Undoubtedly, if there were manufacturing industries ancillary to agriculture&mdash;and there were some&mdash;if we had industries where the raw materials and other things put them in the position that we would be able to compete outside, these, if we were able to export their products, would naturally be a line which we should try. We have to have some exports in order to pay for the imports and, consequently, we should endeavour to seek out all the various things which we could produce, and which kind of things we should particularly concentrate on. When we speak of our exportable surplus, everybody thinks, naturally, of agriculture, but Deputy Dillon has pointed out here&mdash;and I think he is right&mdash;that in the case of butter, for instance, of which we could export a considerable quantity formerly, we are no longer able to regard it as something which we have to export in return for the things which we get from outside.  We did, by stabilisation and by various means, over a long period of eight or ten years, support the dairying industry by subsidising butter&mdash;that is what it meant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by getting for butter a price beyond that which could have been got in the market in England, and that is the old price.  If that had not been done, I believe that the dairying industry was threatened at the time we came into power.  I come from a dairying county and, if I know anything about local conditions, I know the dairying position there&mdash;not recently perhaps&mdash;and I was satisfied at that particular time that if we did not come to the rescue of that industry, it was going to be destroyed.  We have a subsidy of, I think, about £1,000,000 a year in respect of butter&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; in a general way.  It was said that we were supplying the English with cheap butter.  Well, the position was that we could not get a bigger price for it in the British market.  We had to choose whether we would allow the production, in regard <Col N="742" /> to a basal industry, to go down or not, and if we did subsidise it, my defence of that subsidy is this: that we have to select the value of things we export in order to purchase our raw commodities with them, and we naturally select those which we think are best in our own interests, and if it is to our interest, in order to keep the dairying industry, as a basal industry, producing, then our defence of the subsidy would be that we had to give something, that if we had not something better to give and regarded that as the best thing to give, we would give it, and that it was just the same as if it were in barter exchange because the money item there was simply an indication of the value of the particular commodity.</P>
      <P>Even though it was estimated in money values, the fact was that it was a certain amount of butter that was being sent out, and if we were to go over the whole field of our production we would single out the items on which we would concentrate, and so on.  That has been the plan on which we were working up to the war, and as far as the future is concerned, after the war, we will have to work on the same broad, general principles.  It may happen that we may have to give up attempting to use butter as part of the exportable surplus.  We may have to do what Deputy Dillon suggested. Indeed, I have often thought that it would be a very good thing if we could use more of our milk, and if we could devise a proper scheme in that connection. I think it is the commonsense thing to do, because milk is known to be the best type of food, and it ought to be possible to organise it so that that food is used in its best form.  I am altogether in favour of that and I do think that it is a much better way, to the extent to which it can be done.  Deputy Dillon, I think, mentioned casein, but my information is that casein got from milk would only be worth about 1d. a gallon.  It is only a by-product, and would not make up for our production of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the casein would only amount to a trifle, and if <Col N="743" /> you want to get the full value, you will have to get butter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I think there is no point in talking very much about casein, because it is a relatively small item and I understand that we are producing very much more of it than is used.  However, it would take some time to go into that matter.  What I want to insist on is this: that there has been a definite, national, economic policy being worked, and that after the war, from the economic point of view&mdash; there may be some modifications, as I have said, with regard to butter and things of that sort&mdash;fundamentally, the policy must be to try to produce from our own lands the requirements of our own people&mdash;the home market that I have always said is the safe market&mdash; and that we must continue to do that.</P>
      <P>In regard to that exportable surplus, the direction in which we will go will depend largely on the condition of the outside markets.  At the moment we do not know what it will be, but the Department of Agriculture has definitely been given the job of taking stock of the situation, of watching the trends, so as to be ready to operate a policy such as I have indicated, and of being ready to work in the details when the time for that comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I think I can pass on from agriculture to the general industries. I have been talking about the post-war period, not that I am in the slightest way oblivious of the present problems.  This matter of war planning was raised and I wanted to deal with it first.  If there is anybody who thinks that we have no end in view I want to disabuse him of that idea.  I want to point out to him that we have, and that we have always had, an end in view.  We have tried to work towards that end, day in and day out. I do not want to give to the House at this stage the results, but I have them here on a sheet of paper and they show what has been accomplished in accordance with that plan.  They prove very definitely, not merely that we have a definite plan in view, but that <Col N="744" /> we are working consistently towards it.  We have had very valuable results in the direction in which we were aiming, so that what we have to do afterwards is to move on in the same direction and try, if possible, to get up more speed.  I believe that when you get more people accustomed to the industrial habit&mdash;operatives of various kinds&mdash;after a time, you can make very much more progress than you can in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>Leaving agriculture, our basic industry, and coming for the moment to our industries generally, nobody, I am sure, will deny that there is still the possibility of establishing quite a large number of them.  When you speak of industries, you naturally think of power and fuel.  From the beginning we have tried to develop our own fuel resources.  It was not when the war began that we spoke about turf.  I am quite willing to admit that the progress made in that direction was not satisfactory.  By co-operative effort, and otherwise, we made various attempts to get our fuel resources developed. At the beginning we experienced the same sort of opposition to the use of turf that we had encountered in the case of wheat growing and, to a certain extent, in the case of beet.</P>
    <P>But, is there anybody in the country at the present time who does not think that we would be much better off if we had been able to make much more progress in the development of turf? Are any of those who wished to exchange our products for coal satisfied to-day?  Were we not unwise in not pushing our policy in regard to peat development much harder than we did? You may have, perhaps in the neighbourhood of the City of Dublin, some industries that require coal, and find it difficult to adapt themselves to the use of turf, but I think it is true to say that over more than two-thirds of the country the people there are able to get along in a situation in which there is no coal coming in, and are not suffering any severe hardships in consequence of that.  The only place in which there is any real hardship felt in regard to fuel is in the City of Dublin.  If the fuel problem in Dublin is going to be solved by the use of peat, <Col N="745" /> and if we make that a peace-time policy for Dublin City, then we will have to try to get it in some form in which the transport costs will be much less than they are.  The difficulty about peat is that it is relatively bulky, much more so than coal, and that transport costs are very heavy. The storage of it also presents a difficulty. Another point is that the grates in city houses have not been adapted to the use of it, but in that connection considerable progress has been made in getting stoves and ranges to burn the fuel.  As I have said, in over two-thirds of the country we have no great difficulty in the case of fuel.  There the people are burning turf to-day.  I hope they will continue to do so after the war, and that an intensive effort will be made to get more economic burners for peat than we have been accustomed to use.  In the city here, if we are to use peat to a larger extent then, apart from trying to get more suitable methods for burning it, the best way I think would be to get it in a more concentrated form.  An effort in that direction has been made.  I have seen turf from Claremorris burned here in the city.  It was as hard almost as coal.  That may be an exception.  You cannot guarantee that you are going to get that quality right through.  In fact, it may, perhaps be desirable to have a little lighter turf in order to make the other burn well. The machine-made turf from Turraun that I have seen is magnificent fuel. The ideal thing, so far as the city is concerned, would be to get the turf in a more concentrated form.  For one thing, it would be easier to transport. It would be better still to turn it into electric power in the bog so as to make it available in that form.  It is possible to get electrical power from it. As a matter of fact, we were on the point of getting plants set up in the bogs to supply us with electrical power for the cities.  It is also possible to get gas manufactured from peat on the bogs.  That problem has still to be examined, and it may perhaps be a little premature to speak about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two problems to deal with: what we are doing at present, and what we are doing about the post-war period.  I am meeting the suggestion that there has been no general planning at any time from the Governmental point of view.  I am trying to prove that is wrong, that it is without foundation, and is contrary to all truth.  Not merely that, I believe that the programme or policy which we have before us is, in its main foundations, an economically sound, good policy.  There are a number of social problems that will have to be dealt with side by side with it, but if we were to go to the people after the war and put a programme before them, I would go on that programme.  I am satisfied that it is as sound nationally now as it was when we sat on the benches opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before Deputy McGilligan came in, the whole of my experience has been that if we made one mistake it was to allow ourselves to pause very often when obstacles of various kinds were put forward by people who never believed in this policy, and who, therefore, were all the time pooh-poohing it, saying that it would not work, and that it was fundamentally unsound. During my period of office I have not learned the lesson that it is unsound. The lesson I have learned is that, if any mistake has been made by the Government, it is that we have not barged ahead through all the obstacles that were being put up in some particular case; that we could have done a certain amount.  If I were completely disappearing off this planet and suggesting what should be done to somebody who asked about it, I should say <Col N="747" /> that the right thing was to continue that policy.  By pursuing definitely a single policy of that kind, ultimately you will get results from it.  If you are hesitating and changing policies you will get the worst of all possible worlds.  There will be certain difficulties. When we came into office a number of people lost their employment temporarily.  Those who were agents for foreign manufacturers here, which were being substituted, lost their positions.  It was rather hard on that particular section; but they got positions afterwards.  The fact that there was a good deal of activity going an meant that opportunities were being offered elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was talking about industry, and fundamental in regard to the question of industry is power.  Fuel is one of the necessities of life.  I say that our aim after the war should be to develop to the utmost the possibilities of our peat resources, both by using fuel in a raw state and by coking it and concentrating it from that point of view; also by turning it into electric power in the bog, and, in regard to Dublin, by trying whether it is not possible to instal gas plants on the bogs and convey the gas to Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are a number of other industries that we could have developed.  I regret very much that we have not to-day a paper industry. There is no doubt that that is an industry we could have developed.  It was stated that we wanted pulp for that.  I hope that the policy of afforestation will be pursued to a point in which the coming generations anyhow will not be in the position in which we find ourselves through lack of timber that could be grown here.  When I was going around speaking at the crossroads I pointed out on many occasions that we have food, clothing and shelter; that one of the materials necessary for the building of houses that appeared to be lacking and that we did not seem to be able to supply ourselves was timber.  There is no reason why we cannot get that timber. Undoubtedly there are a lot of difficulties. But ultimately it ought to be put forward as a national policy and <Col N="748" /> any opposition there may be to it barged through if necessary.  We will not get through otherwise.  It is true that all these difficulties in regard to it are there.  If we take over lands from people for afforestation they will have to be compensated.  There is no use in talking about omelettes if we are not prepared to break eggs.  If the omelette is worth having, the egg is worth breaking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that, you have to consider what is for the common good as a whole.  You cannot possibly arrange a system in which everybody will be exactly in the same position as he is at the moment.  If we are to help the weaker sections, the strong may have to bear burdens they have not been bearing up to the present.  If it is necessary in the common interest, in order to supply timber which is necessary for one of the fundamental needs of life, namely shelter, to take over land that people are using for grazing purposes, you can give them compensation or give them land elsewhere if it is available.  By all means do everything in your power to be fair to them, but do not let yourself be stopped from providing a national necessity by the fact that some people will have to be interfered with.  You cannot improve the present conditions unless you make up your mind that what has to be done will be done.  If the aim is worth while, the community must provide the means. There is no use in saying that there are obstacles in the way.  There will be obstacles to every course put up, and the point is to try and get rid of these obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that power and fuel were fundamental.  I think we can, to a large extent, meet these needs from our peat resources.  I do not say we can do it at once; but the aim must be to try to do it to the utmost extent possible.  I referred to the question of paper and that brought me to the question of pulp and timber.  There are other materials also which naturally should be tried for the manufacture of different kinds of paper, and I think <Col N="749" /> that the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau in one form or another should be a permanent institution in this State.  I do not think that it should be simply for the emergency.  It ought to be developed.  As in all research work, you draw many a blank, but you will be getting something which will repay you for all the trouble and all the failures which you may encounter.  I am altogether in favour of making that a permanent part of our organisation here, of having something like the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau. Up to the present it has justified itself, although working under extreme difficulties, being newly set up for the work.  In ordinary peace time I think it would be an extremely valuable addition to our general organisation.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of steel. I do not know how far you can go down along the line.  The trouble about many industries is that you can only go down to a certain point.  The danger is that if you do not go the whole way a shortage of raw materials will stop the whole thing.  We were speaking about the shoe being lost for want of a nail, so to speak, a few minutes ago. The same is true of a number of industries. If we want to guard against the possibility of a crisis like this and to put ourselves in a position to carry on with the policy I have been indicating, it is obvious that we ought to go down along the line as far as it is humanly possible to go.  I have mentioned steel.  There are a number of minor industries which would suggest themselves to anybody who looks over our list of imports.  We will have nice questions of balance at certain points. For instance, it may be suggested that if we try to grow our own feeding stuffs for pigs, we cannot use pigs as part of our exportable surplus.  That may be; we will have to consider that.  You have to ask yourself in a case like that whether you should have the double trade, so to speak, the import of certain cereals in order that you might convert these cereals into bacon and export the bacon.  You may have to consider that.  But, if we find it difficult to get other markets, if we find that the bacon market is not so good, that there are difficulties of any kind, it may be a very much better policy for <Col N="750" /> us not to try to export bacon at all, but to produce it for our own people from cereals grown on our own land. I cannot, on an occasion like this, go into details.  I want, however, to let Deputies realise that there are the main elements of a general economic policy.  We are wedded to that policy. We are pursuing it.  People may complain that we have not gone as fast as we ought to have gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You have done quite enough damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it damage to be growing wheat?  Is it damage to be growing beet?  Is it damage to be using peat to the extent we are using it?  All these things were so damaging that Deputy Dillon and those who thought like him would rather be dead than see them adopted as a policy. Whatever advantage we have to-day in our present position, it is due to the adoption of such a policy.  We may have difficulties, but our difficulties would be increased ten-fold if we had not some of these basic things.  So far as the present position is concerned, we ought not to starve in this country &mdash;that is fundamental, anyhow.  We ought to be able to clothe ourselves in any crisis.  So far as the damage we did is concerned, there are many houses available at the present time that were not available ten years ago. We have food, clothing and shelter. With regard to clothing, there are certain difficulties.  As regards wool, I still believe, notwithstanding what others may think, that that could be pushed to a far greater extent in the manufacture of cloth.  Fuel is a difficulty, admittedly, for this part of the country.  I am very concerned about the prospects for the coming winter. This is one of the matters in which we should have got support from every Party in the House and every individual in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of food, I went all over the country last year indicating the national needs.  I pointed out we required some 600,000 acres of land under wheat to meet our bread requirements. I pointed out that if we wanted to maintain our stock we would have to grow some 1,350,000 <Col N="751" /> acres of oats and barley and, if we did not have that, we would be short of food for our cattle, and, if there was a shortage, we would inevitably have to see that it was the cattle that went down and not human beings.  If there is a shortage of bacon, it is because we have not produced sufficient wheat, oats and barley.  We did not produce the oats in sufficient quantities to substitute them for the maize we formerly imported.  In some cases we had agitation.  We were told the farmer was not getting enough, that every person in the country was not getting enough.  Every section of the community, instead of trying to see how they could stand together in a crisis, began to agitate, declaring that they were not getting enough.  We must realise that there were certain commodities short.  Many people were accustomed to using petrol.  If there is available only a fraction of the petrol we formerly used, then every person can get only a fraction of what he was getting before, and the Minister for Supplies cannot change that situation.  The same applies to other commodities that are short.  These burdens will have to be borne by the community, and if supplies have to be distributed fairly every section of the community must bear its part of the burden.</P>
    <P>When we thought of 50/- as a price for wheat we felt it was a fair price. We got all the facts and figures we could and we felt it was a reasonable price for the farmer.  It was generally regarded as a fair price.  Quite a number of people wanted, for one reason or another, to make it appear to the farmers that they were not getting enough.  There was practically a suggestion to the farmers that they should not grow wheat, that they had the community in a position in which they could force them to pay more and that they would do good business for themselves by doing so.  I think that was wrong.  The attitude of the community ought to be to live and let live during the present emergency and, if a reasonable price is given for a crop, then the farmers ought to be satisfied. Again, if a reasonable wage is given, people ought to be satisfied with <Col N="752" /> it.  If it is unreasonable, that is another story.</P>
    <P>Last year, in regard to wheat, there was an agitation started, the only effect of which could be to stop the production of wheat, to induce the farmers not to produce wheat.  That was bad nationally.  The farmers must remember, like other sections of the community, that if the community generally suffers severely they will share in the general suffering.  Therefore, it is advisable in these cases, when production is possible, that the articles required should be produced. There has been an increase in the acreage under cereals.  I asked that the increase should not be at the expense of root crops but, unfortunately, the root crops have gone down.  A failure of the cereal crop would be a serious matter and we ought to make sure there is not going to be a famine.</P>
    <P>If it is necessary, we may make some provision by which, if surplus potatoes come here, these potatoes would be purchased on behalf of the community. It may be necessary to take steps to have that done, because we must not allow the acreage under potatoes to be depleted.  It is at the moment considerably less than it was last year.  In the same way the acreage under other root crops has gone down.  The acreage under beet has declined, and that is wrong.  It will be suggested the crop is not so good because we have not artificial manures.  That may be, but that is not a good reason from the community point of view.  It is an argument in favour of an increased acreage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it convenient for the Taoiseach to give us figures of the increased acreage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give those figures.  I have here preliminary figures representing the June returns, and I expect the Deputy understands how they were got.  For wheat the figure is 584,600 acres, representing an increase of 26.2 per cent.; for oats, 881,400 acres, an increase of 12.7 per cent.; for barley, 186,200 acres, an increase of 14 per cent.  With regard to rye, beans and peas, the figure is 5,500 acres, or an increase of 25 per cent.  That figure ought to be increased much more than <Col N="753" /> it is, and it is capable of very great increase.  At any rate, we have under cereals 1,657,700 acres&mdash;roughly 1? million acres&mdash;representing an increase of about 17.3 per cent.  That is not enough.  We have to go out in the coming year and increase that in order to ensure that we have food in the way of cereals for man and beast.  I think the figure I was looking for in regard to all these was about 2,000,000 acres. That is a considerable shortage, and that shortage next year, unless we are able to substitute otherwise, or if we have such a shortage again the year after, will be the reason why, for instance, the amount of bacon produced will be less because we will not have feeding stuffs.  No matter how important bacon is, wheat is still more important, and we cannot allow wheat, which is used for bread, to be fed to pigs.</P>
      <P>Under root crops, as I have said, there is a reduction.  In the case of potatoes the new acreage is 424,300. That represents a decrease of .9 per cent.  That is not a big decrease but, seeing that it is the great substitute food for all purposes and that it is the great stand-by, I am sorry to see any reduction.  Even though it may be said at the present time that in some places we have an excess, we may not have the same conditions at all next spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decrease this year is .9 per cent.  It is not very big.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the acreage. What will the yield be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at the moment what the yield will be.  With regard to turnips, we have 144,300 acres.  That is a decrease of 8.1 per cent.  It is a serious decrease and, as we know, turnips are used in dairying and other branches of agriculture.  In mangels we have 83,000 acres.  That is a decrease of 13.4 per cent. and in sugar beet&mdash;more serious still&mdash;cabbage, and so on, the total amount is 97,500 acres, a decrease of 17 per cent.  In the case of beet there are 54,800 acres.  That is very far short of what we really want and set out to get.  It is a decrease of 30.1 per cent. <Col N="754" /> Altogether we have in root crops 749,100 acres and that is a decrease in the total of 6.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The figures I have given indicate that we have not come up to the mark in regard to cereals, that we will have in next year's campaign to try to get a still greater increase in these, but we are within sight anyhow of the goal we have aimed at.  In regard to root crops there is a diminution and the two together give us a total acreage of something like 2,400,000.  I remember, when I went through the country, the figure I gave that we required as a minimum was 2,800,000 acres under tillage, and that was somewhat over one-fourth of the total acreage of arable land.  One Deputy has thrown a doubt on that.  I will have to look into it and see on what it is based, to see if there is anything in the suggestion he made that we have not as much arable land as is indicated there.  I have never heard it questioned before. I will look into it and see on what it is based, because it would be a serious matter if there was any considerable difference between that figure and what is the fact.  Up to the present I accept the figure&mdash;that there are between 11,000,000 and 12,000,000 acres of arable land&mdash;as being a reasonably accurate figure, a figure on which you could work for all sorts of estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are short, and the most important thing for the country to set itself to for the coming year is to see that that food shortage will be made up.  We can do it.  There is no question of bargaining for that.  We have the power within ourselves.  What we have got to do is to give a reasonable price for doing it, and we have to remember again that all these prices will have to be reflected in the price that the consumer pays.  One cannot have it both ways unless the community as a whole comes in by way of subsidy.  That is not an easy thing to do either, and it would have its consequences.  Very often you feel that, allowing the ordinary law to operate to the extent that ultimate prices will have to include all the costs, the State should not come in to interfere with that.  You feel that that will bring the <Col N="755" /> people to a greater realisation of the actual position than if the State comes in and gives a subsidy, because when the State gives a subsidy everybody thinks that subsidy can come from nowhere, and that nobody has to pay for it at any time or any place.  Of course, that is absurd.  You cannot continue at that rate, for any length of time anyhow. You may during a particular crisis have to deal with it in that particular way.  There may be no other way out of it, but it is a remedy which we ought to be very slow in adopting, and should only adopt when we are absolutely driven to it.</P>
    <P>Food is the first item.  I think if we have the right spirit in the country, a realisation that on ourselves it depends whether there is to be a food shortage or not, that that is one thing we do not need to ration.  The Government has only two weapons.  One is the weapon of persuasion, and the other the weapon of coercion.  The weapon of coercion is one which we dislike using if we can possibly avoid it. Naturally, the method of inducement and persuasion is the one we would like to adopt.  I believe that public representatives ought to make it their duty in going through the country to get the people as a whole to realise that there is a crisis, that we are not in another planet where the war is not going to affect us; that we are in a serious situation even with regard to matters like food and supplies of that kind.</P>
    <P>But that is one thing in respect of which there need be no rationing&mdash;we may have difficulties about distribution and so on&mdash;but there is no need to ration if our people set out to supply the food that can be produced in abundance.  There is scarcely a thing that is needed for the healthy life of our people, from the infant to the old person, that cannot be produced here in abundance if we set out to do it.  It is the Government's policy to try to get that done and I ask for co-operation, notwithstanding temptations that will come to people who are members of political Parties and so on.  I ask that they will try to resist that <Col N="756" /> temptation and will realise that it is vital for the community to get all the food that is asked for produced.</P>
    <P>The one commodity that one thinks of immediately in connection with food is tea.  Unfortunately, tea has to come in from outside.  We have no control over it.  Deputy Byrne spoke about a surplus of tea in Britain.  I have not heard that there are these surpluses at all.  I think the people in Great Britain have their own rationing system and I think they are anxious about their own supplies.</P>

      <P>Do not imagine that people in times of crisis feel it is their duty to share with you.  That brings us to this question we have been talking about, namely, bargaining.  There are people who talk in this House as if they thought that if you kissed the Blarney Stone, or something of that sort, you could wheedle everything you want from people who are trading with you.  That is not the position at all. This is hard business.  They will naturally say: &ldquo;We are short of these things.  We have difficulty in getting these things.  Are we going to give them to you?&rdquo;  They ask you: &ldquo;Would you give them to us in similar circumstances?&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are giving us a certain amount, yes, and it is wrong to say we are getting nothing for the things we are exporting.  That is not true.  We are getting, and have got, a number of things, but naturally if they have a food controller who is getting food from the ends of the earth&mdash; from New Zealand or whatever places he gets it from&mdash;some good, some bad and some indifferent, he is going to try to bargain and to say to us: &ldquo;I am getting this food.  Why should I take it from you?&rdquo;  We naturally put up all sorts of what we think are proper arguments to get them to change their minds, and it is nonsense to talk as if we here made no attempt to get an understanding with the <Col N="757" /> British with regard to the things we could send them and the things they could give us.  That has been going on continually.  At the beginning of the war, things were somewhat better than they were after a certain period. Their difficulties, I suppose, increased, and, when they were making their arrangements, they felt that our particular supplies did not fit in with theirs so easily.  They felt that the cost of production here was greater than that in other countries from which they got goods.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this war, we knew there were things we wanted to get from Great Britain and there were things which we thought they would want from us, and we knew that the distance from here to Britain was much shorter than the distance over which they had to bring these goods.  Very naturally, we said: &ldquo;We are quite prepared to give you certain things.  There are some things you will want and some things you will not want.  Will you tell us in advance what you think you will want, because there will be the necessity for planning in order to meet your requirements?  Tell us what you want. We can tell you very quickly what we want and we are quite prepared to give you these things in return,&rdquo; but we did not get very much of a response in that direction.  We were not met from the point of view of a general planning.</P>
      <P>It is asked here why we cannot force a proper appreciation, why we cannot say we will give goods for goods.  That is natural enough, but there is no use in putting up propositions like that unless you are prepared to stand behind them and to see them through. I ask anybody who suggests we should adopt that policy: Are you prepared to say: &ldquo;Very well; we will have a fight. You will keep these things and we will keep the things we have?&rdquo;  There may be some who think that would be in the general interest, but I do not think that is so, at the moment, anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are only suffering now from what we have suffered from for a long period and which was the basis for putting our policy before the people instead of the policy that was in operation before <Col N="758" /> ours, that is, that a country which is a primary producer, except in conditions of real famine where these primary products are absolutely essential, and which is trading its primary products for manufactures, is generally having the worst of the bargain, and the sooner you can get out of that position of dependence the better. That was the position in the past.  We have had, in the main, to sell our agricultural produce in the past at the lowest level that would keep us in production.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy up on that.  I say that there was no nation in Europe in the 80 years from the middle 'forties or so to which the same thing happened as happened to us, in that, from being a nation of 8,000,000, we were cut down to 4,000,000.  That did not happen to Poland or any other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a by-product and it could continue still, but that was not our purpose.  Our people did not decide on that as national policy.  The thing happened, and maybe it is one of those things which, in the ways of Providence, come about, although we do not set out to achieve it, but of which we are very glad; but we would be still better pleased if we had kept our population. If we had kept our 8,000,000 people, or even 6,000,000, and the rest were sent out as missionaries and developed that empire of which Deputy Dillon speaks, it would have been still better. We cannot take credit in any way from the point of view of national policy for that.  It is something which was never aimed at and never accepted as good national policy.  There is obviously a limit to the numbers which <Col N="759" /> could be maintained on this island, and if we had the natural increase maintained on this island, I believe the time would come, and even in advance of the time when, so to speak, we would have reached saturation point, when we could afford to send out some, but certainly not at the rate at which they went out at that time, or at the rate at which people say they are going to-day.</P>
      <P>There are two big things which face every Government.  One of these is unemployment.  Side by side with that in our case, we have had to bemoan the fact that, despite efforts made even in our time, we have not had the increase in population which we expected, but I should like people to remember that we passed at that time through one of the worst depressions the world has ever passed through. Every nation in turn was struck by it, and all we have to say is, that if we did not increase during that period we have at least the feeling that if steps which would normally have brought about an increase had not been taken, the decrease would have been very much greater.  Nobody can answer that definitely.  That can be questioned, but I do believe it will be admitted by people who fairly examine the question that we did pass at that time through an extremely bad period for the world as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we hope that that will enable us to get through the crisis.  I hope it will not be necessary to do what was suggested by some Deputies, to compel each farmer to grow a certain percentage of wheat or other crops.  The next important commodity is fuel.  As I have said, here in the city we are faced with a very difficult problem in regard to fuel.  That problem has been dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Whatever may be said about our success in that regard, there is no doubt whatever that an organisation was set up to deal with that situation.  It cannot be said that there was not a definite attempt made to try to deal with the situation, but one may plan and may not succeed. We have the problem of transport, and our difficulty is that the localities in which man-power and bogs are available are largely the most remote from the point where we want the supply. An attempt was made to solve that problem by trying to bring men to the bogs situated near Dublin.  Unfortunately, the people we expected to help us in getting that done saw fit to do the opposite.  I think that was unwise and wrong.  I think it was even bad politics, that it was a thing that should not have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the wages were miserable but there has to be some relation between wages generally and the ultimate price of the product. <Col N="761" /> Obviously, if wages paid to men working on the roads are higher than the farmer can afford to pay, the farmer has to compete with them and in consequence he has to look for a higher price for his wheat and other products, so that you have an upward tendency right along the line.  We had hoped to pass through this period without causing any undue increase in prices.  I have figures here, but I do not want to weary the House with them.  I can only say that if you are forced to increase wages on the bogs and the wages of those who handle the turf, inevitably the price to the consumer will have to be increased.  As in the case of bread, you cannot pay higher wages all along the line without having the ultimate cost greatly increased. There is no use in complaining that the cost of turf in Dublin is high if at the same time you force up prices all along the line up to the time it reaches Dublin.</P>
    <P>Naturally the person down on the bog looks at what he gets for producing turf and compares it with the price ultimately charged to the consumer in Dublin, but he forgets that all along the line people who are engaged in the various processes by which that turf is brought from the bog to the city have also to be paid.  There is no way of cutting out these intermediate costs. By all means, if you can reduce the cost by better organisation, do it, but there is a limit to the extent to which that can be done.  I do believe that everything reasonably possible in that direction has been done.  I am not saying that the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied with what has been done.  He is not, but he has done this: he has made sure that two-thirds of the people have really no fuel problem.  The problem for the remaining third is a very acute and serious one and if we are not able to solve it, I do not think that complaints will enable us to do so. No amount of complaining is going to bring this earth any nearer to the other members of the solar system. There are things that complaining cannot achieve.</P>

We could not induce people ahead of the war to lay in stocks.  We know that there was a certain cessation of tension at Munich. There was a certain stoppage there and people were doubtful as to what was going to be the result.  Many people had hopes that the war threat would pass and there were others who were doing everything in their power to grab all the raw materials that were available.  From the time that war became inevitable, you could not get these materials in any quantity because all countries were looking after their own needs.  Not merely had prices gone up, but the availability of goods at any price was very slight.  Somebody asked during the debate whether the Minister had done anything about financial arrangements.  I know there was an arrangement made with the banks and the banks did co-operate with those who wanted to lay in stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact about the quotas is that we were not operating them.  We took them off.  I should like to state here, lest there be any misunderstanding about it, that the fact that we have taken off tariffs at present is no indication of any change of policy on our part in regard to protection.  In my belief, if we want properly to develop our industries, there must be protection. I am aware, as well as other members of the House, of the dangers that follow protection, but I say that those again are dangers which have to be faced if we want to get our results. We have got some results at present in the building up of industries which would not have been possible if those infant industries had not been protected in the period during which they were being built up.  Without a protecting shield for a time we could not pass from our comparatively undeveloped industrial state to a state in which we will have industries to supply ourselves with our main needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the rest of the period then, there are two or three main problems that we have to face.  There is first of all the fundamental problem of national defence.  That comes first and foremost. The trouble is that our people, who realised the dangers very fully a couple of years ago, do not realise those dangers to the same extent to-day.  I think even the Leader of the Opposition was unwise enough to suggest that the danger had passed some months ago.  He was quite wrong.  I want to say as authoritatively as I can from here that that is wrong; the danger has not passed.  The danger remains, and, no matter what course this war may take, the danger is likely to become greater even than the danger which threatens us to-day, and there can be no let-up whatever in our watchfulness in regard to matters of national defence.  That is the primary thing.  Next to that is the question of food, and next to that, I should say, is the question of fuel, particularly for the city here.  We have, of course, the big problem which comes from the fact <Col N="765" /> that, because we have not certain raw materials, some of our industries are closing down.  That is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say that we are trying to induce our people to emigrate, or anything of that sort.  We are not, but we cannot put up a barrier.  In the case of a man who has £7 a week or £5 a week in the particular industry he is in at present, if, through lack of raw materials, that industry closes down and that man loses his employment, we cannot say to him: &ldquo;You must stay here.  We can give you only 30/- or £2&rdquo;, or whatever may be the sum which the community as a whole may be able to afford to give him to maintain himself and his family.  You cannot say to that man: &ldquo;You must stay here, and live on that maintenance allowance.&rdquo;  I should like to deal&mdash; although this is perhaps not the time, and I have already kept the House rather long&mdash;with the statement which was made here by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think he saw only half of that problem.  He looked at it from the point of view of the particular work on which he is engaged.  That problem has to be looked at from a much wider angle than that from which he looked at it.  You cannot say to a man here in this country: &ldquo;You must stay here, and you must subsist on this particular sum&rdquo;, unless you put that obligation on everybody.</P>
    <P>In the case of a man who, from his earnings in Britain, sends over £4 or £5, or whatever it is, to maintain his family here, you cannot say that that man's family is not going to get their share of the goods of the community which can be purchased by that money. If you do, then you must say to the farmer: &ldquo;You must not sell those cattle, because the money you are getting for them is giving you a claim upon the limited goods of the community at the moment.&rdquo;  You have to go right through, and you have not merely to conscript the manpower of the country, but you have to conscript the wealth right down to the individual's pocket.  There is no half-way measure in those things.</P>
    <P>It is a natural matter of regret to <Col N="766" /> us, whose policy has been to try to keep our people at home, that at the present time there is not employment for them at home, and they have to seek employment abroad.  It must be our duty to try to provide, to the extent to which our resources will permit, alternative employment.  When a man is employed perhaps in some business to which he has not ordinarily been accustomed, and in which he is not skilled, we cannot give him for his unskilled work the same as he has been able to earn in his skilled employment. I am afraid I do not see how the community can do that.  It is a problem which I should like to see worked out, and, so far as I could look for a solution, I looked for it.  I do not think at the moment we could do it, and until we can do it we cannot put up a barrier and say to those people: &ldquo;You must stay at home.&rdquo;  I should like to see them staying here; I do not want them to go.  I believe it is our duty to do everything in our power to make it possible for them to live at home.  I do not believe that the majority of them would go were it not for the fact that their ordinary means of livelihood at home have been taken from them.  I believe they will come back, those of them who will be still there.  I hope they will come back.  I do not want anybody to think that it is a matter of satisfaction to us to see any of our people, for any reason whatever, leaving the country.  We would rather see them here.</P>
    <P>Those are problems for which, no matter what your will or your effort, you cannot get an immediate solution. I shall certainly never object to any pressure that can be put on from any side of the House to try to get a solution to the best of our ability.  It is the duty of every Deputy to try to press for that.  If he thinks that the right and proper measures are not being taken, it is his duty to press the Government to try to find a solution. At the moment, I do not see any complete solution of that problem.  I do not see any solution for it except a solution based on a complete change of our whole social system.  You may do it if you conscript labour, and mind you if you do that you will cause a <Col N="767" /> lot of those hardships which I for one am anxious to avoid.  If you have conscription of labour, you will have to consider the question of the class of work people can do.  You will have a lot of the difficulties which they have to encounter in Britain at the present moment.  Consequently I say that is an outstanding problem for which, at the moment, I do not see any satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>I hope, at any rate, that I have shown the House that we have a general plan which will have to be worked up.  There is an organisation actually being set up at the moment for continuing that post-war planning.  I should like to discuss that, but time will not allow me to do it.  I hope I have shown that we have general principles in mind, and that we are as alive to the difficulties as any Deputy in the House, but again I must say finally that there are problems and difficulties which no amount of thinking and no amount of planning will solve.  We have to try to make those difficulties as light as we can by co-operation, and by general appreciation of the problems.</P>
