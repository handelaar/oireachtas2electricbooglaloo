As far as I can see, however, the superannuation scheme, in the main, remains very much as it was when this measure was introduced, and on that all I wish to say is that it was the original intention when the legislation was brought in, in 1927, that the board should have power to make a superannuation scheme for the employees and members of the Electricity Supply Board, and that is an intention which we shall see implemented sooner or later.</P>
      <P>I characterise the provisions made here as being very meagre and inadequate for a type of board such as this is, and I think that some of the things that have been suggested are particularly ungenerous and approach very near to the point where they could be described as mean.  As far as the impact of disputes with employees of the board is concerned, that is a matter which, if dealt with at all, should be dealt with by general legislation affecting disputes, and there should be no relationship&mdash;there is no necessity for such relationship&mdash;between superannuation schemes and any dispute that might arise.  That is a matter which, I should also say, as far as I can manage it, we hope to have changed to a better position sooner or later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill passes, I should like to say that I think the Minister has adopted a particularly niggardly attitude in connection with the pensions scheme to be provided under this Bill.  The supply of electricity is a national undertaking in this State, the Electricity Supply Board is virtually a State organisation, and there is a general desire that a pensions scheme ought to be of such a character that it would not be onerous on the potential recipients of pensions. In the case of this Bill, the Minister, while requiring contributions from the manual workers, is also requiring an increased contribution in respect of the years during which the pension scheme <Col N="747" /> was not operative, and is thus imposing a heavy burden on the manual workers in the Electricity Supply Board.  I think the Minister will find that the conditions under which pensions will be granted to these people are too onerous and the pensions themselves too small to make the pensions scheme attractive to them.  It really means, therefore, that so far as large numbers of the manual workers are concerned, very few of them, I believe, will elect to come under the provisions of the scheme because of the substantial weekly contributions that they will have to pay, particularly in view of the fact that their ordinary wages are not sufficient to enable them to meet their ordinary financial burdens.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Electricity Supply Board undertaking has been an outstanding technical and financial success, and that the board has operated in such circumstances as to entitle the whole State to acclaim it as a very prosperous national undertaking, I think the Minister might have introduced a scheme of non-contributory pensions to provide much better benefits for the staff than will be available under this Bill.  The odious portion of the Bill, of course, is that in which, in order to obtain a pension, a worker is obliged to renounce his natural rights under the Constitution, one of these natural rights, under the Constitution, being the right to organise to withhold his labour, if it is necessary to do that in order to remedy injustices.  Under this Bill, a worker may be suffering under acute injustice, and even though he has a natural right to withhold his labour in order that that injustice may be remedied, if he does so, this Bill provides that in such circumstances he cannot obtain a pension, even though he has previously contributed towards a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the success of the Shannon scheme, I think the Minister might have introduced a much more generous pensions scheme than that which has been submitted to the House, and I think he was very unwise to impose, as a condition of the receipt <Col N="748" /> of a pension, conditions which, he must know, are odious to the workers, and conditions which, so far as preserving the continuity of the generation and distribution of current by electricity are concerned, will be found to be quite valueless if ever a crisis in respect of wages and conditions of employment should arise.  I think the Minister might very well have endeavoured to devise some type of conciliation machinery free from the atmosphere of threat and free from the atmosphere of duress.  I think conciliation machinery of that kind would prove much more durable than the types of conditions which are imposed in this Bill in regard to the receipt of pensions by workers as a means of preserving concord and amity in the industry generally.</P>

      <P>I want to say, in connection with the remarks made by the two Deputies who have spoken, that the points to which they have referred were debated at some length on the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill.  The Deputies might have expressed those opinions then with a better opportunity of having them discussed. I merely want to repeat, for their information, what I said then.  It is very easy to be generous with other people's money.  It is a simple matter for Deputies, in a position of no responsibility, to urge that we should give unlimited pensions without contributions to workers when they know that the responsibility of finding the funds for the purpose will not be theirs. I think that, in devising a pension scheme for the workers of the Electricity Supply Board we must have due regard to the consequences of providing the funds for that purpose.  While it is true that the amount required to pay pensions to the Electricity Supply Board staff is small in relation to the total revenue of the Electricity Supply Board, nevertheless it can be secured only from the charges for electricity throughout the country.  Somebody will have to provide the funds, and I think it is not unreasonable to require that the pensions for such workers should be provided from a fund made up by contributions partly subscribed by the workers themselves. <Col N="749" /> There is nothing ungenerous in giving 1/- for 6d., and that is what the scheme contemplated by this Bill proposes: that for every 6d. paid into the fund on behalf of a worker 1/- will be given back to him.  That is a far better provision for the old age of those workers than the great majority of our citizens enjoy.  The suggestion that the obligation to make a contribution to the fund is a burden on those workers is just nonsense.  If the workers consider that it is a burden, then they have not to join the fund.  But the provision in the Bill is, that for every 6d. a worker pays into the fund, he gets 1/- back.</P>

      <P>The position is, as I have stated, that other workers of the same grades employed by commercial concerns have no hope of getting a pension on retirement.  They have not got the same security of employment either.  In fact, they have a lesser prospect of continuous employment, so that from every aspect, the position of the Electricity Supply Board employees, of the same grades, is better than that of other workers employed by commercial firms.  It is open to the Electricity Supply Board workers, if <Col N="750" /> they so choose, to remain outside the pension scheme.  If they do come into it, they know that the effect of their doing so will be to secure for them economic security in their old age for the payment of a comparatively small weekly contribution now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, of course, has misrepresented the purpose of the Bill in relation to disputes.  There is nothing in this Bill which prevents an Electricity Supply Board worker going on strike.  This Bill is not removing from him his right to go on strike, but if he exercises that right, then we do provide that certain consequences will follow from that course of conduct.  To say that it is depriving the worker of a natural right is nonsense.  Everybody, of course, has the right to justice, and I want to say most emphatically that the machinery established by this Bill to secure justice for the employees of the Electricity Supply Board in any matter in dispute between them and their employers will be far more effective than the right to strike to which Deputy Norton attaches so much importance.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; in such a dispute than the precarious weapon to which the Deputies opposite attach so much importance.  Deputy Norton spoke about the establishment of conciliation machinery.  We are doing much more in this Bill.  We are putting behind the conciliation machinery which normally operates in the country, as between the Electricity Supply Board and its employees, an independent <Col N="751" /> tribunal which will secure for the employees of the board an independent judgment on any matter that may arise in dispute between themselves and the board.  In that way we are protecting them against the possibility of their position being used to their disadvantage by their employers. I think that the employees of the Electricity Supply Board will gain substantially through the enactment of this Bill, and the consequent introduction of a pension scheme.  The only hope that I would like to express, now that the Bill is about to pass, is that eventually we may be able to get a scheme equally good to operate in respect of a larger number of employees than those in the service of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the House bears in mind that the object of this policy of Irish in the schools is to make Irish the living language of the people of this country it will be recognised that sufficient progress will never be made along the lines of treating Irish merely as a school subject.  Even, however, if we were to treat it as a school subject, most teachers and educationists would agree that, like every other subject, its acquisition entails a certain amount of toil and mental effort on the part of pupils.  The great fault that I find with the report of the Teachers' Inquiry is that, instead of examining how best the purpose we have in mind can be achieved, the speediest and most efficient way in which Irish can be made the living language of this country through the agency of the schools, it gives a rather <Col N="752" /> false picture&mdash;I think I can term it an unbalanced one&mdash;of the actual conditions in our schools.  Had we, in this report, more information as to the linguistic equipment of individual teachers, more illustrations of actual cases, and some account of the circumstances of individual teachers and the conditions under which they work, the report would have been more valuable than it is.  I referred last night to the references, which were many, to the boredom, repression and strain which children are alleged to suffer, particularly in the infant schools.  An effort is actually made to connect that condition, which we do not, in fact, know exists, because no evidence is given, with teaching through Irish.  The casual reader of the report might, on the mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of the teachers, take it that all the defects which, for example, children in the infant schools in the City of Dublin suffer from and which are dealt with in the medical officers' reports are attribut able in some way to the teaching of Irish.  Of course obviously that is a matter, as I have said, that would require to be examined very carefully indeed.</P>
      <P>When the Irish programme in the infant classes was instituted, I think I am correct in saying that what the originators of the programme had in mind was that, so far as possible, the conditions of a nursery in a good home would be approximated to.  We know that that may be, perhaps, only an ideal.  But, if we visit an infant class, no matter how inexperienced we may be in educational matters, if we bear in mind that a fairly good criterion of whether the work is being done properly or not is whether the teacher is teaching the class as a family, as a mother would teach her children, we shall, I think, not be far wrong if we take that as an indication of whether the work is likely to have value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously a great deal depends on the teacher.  The teacher <Col N="753" /> has to be a specialist.  She has to be able to teach kindergarten, to teach language, to teach handwork, to teach drill, to teach singing, and she has to participate with the children in their games.  She has to be their companion and friend, so to speak, as well as their teacher and mother.  So that it is not incorrect to say that a skilled teacher of infants must be a specialist. In addition to that, tremendous inroads are made on her physical and vital energy.  It is not easy to get a teacher of infants who will fulfil the ideal qualifications.  Nevertheless, we have to strive for the necessary conditions in this matter of Irish. I referred to some of the conditions last night: the teacher's ability to instruct children in Irish or to train them, in the case of infants, and the children's capacity to benefit by the training.  The whole question of the teacher's qualifications and the methods she adopts is obviously of the greatest importance.</P>
      <P>It is stated in the report, for example, that the atmosphere of the school is unreal, artificial, and even unnatural.  If that is so in particular cases that the teachers have in mind, I can only say, as I said last night, that the teaching is being carried on under a false conception of what is required by the Department's programme.  It might even be that in these cases the teaching itself is not competent or efficient because, as is pointed out in one part of the report, for a short time after an infant goes to school, as those who have children themselves will easily recognise, no matter how family-like the atmosphere may be, the child, having for the first time to circumscribe himself or herself, to subject himself or herself to some form of loose discipline, some form of social activity, is bound to feel the change. The atmosphere is bound to be rather novel.  It is well described by a particular teacher who is referred to here as being perhaps an atmosphere of &ldquo;puzzledom&rdquo;.  I think that happens to infants first going to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a correct picture is given of the actual situation in our schools when it is suggested that, in <Col N="754" /> fact, the children are living in conditions of &ldquo;repression&rdquo; that they are not allowed to speak, that they are &ldquo;harangued&rdquo; by the teachers, that the &ldquo;eagle eye&rdquo; of the teacher is constantly upon them, and that &ldquo;sustained and conscious&rdquo; effort has to be made by the child to participate in the activities of the class.  When we consider that the only object in fact of the infants' class is language training, that there are no formal subjects as such, that whatever elementary idea of number is taught is entirely subordinate to the teaching of language, and that the whole aim is to build up a vocabulary based on the child's actual interests and experiences, we shall see that, if the teaching is carried on according to the programme, and if the teacher is skilful and competent, these conditions of strain and repression could not possibly exist.</P>
    <P>We have to assume that the teacher is an understanding person, that she treats the child as he wishes to be treated, as a separate personality, that in her teaching of the language she has regard to the amount of Irish that the child has on first coming to school, or, if he comes without any, that it will take a certain amount of time for the child to familiarise himself, even in the best circumstances, with the atmosphere and the conditions of the school, and that the teacher can only proceed very gradually. Where the child is in the senior infant class and has already been in the school for some time, he will have acquired some vocabulary, and if the teaching is to be as efficient as we would wish, the whole aim and object of the teacher&mdash;I should like to stress this point&mdash;should be to base the language teaching, so far as possible, on the actual experiences and interests of the child, the actual things which the child understands and with which he is familiar.</P>
    <P>That is the reason that play is so important in the infant school.  I think play is only mentioned once or twice very casually in this report, and it is mentioned as a physical activity. But play can be creative, for example, in the development of handwork, artistic work and drawing, or it can be <Col N="755" /> used as a medium of instruction.  For example, if the children do shopping, if they do bus man, if they do going to the seaside, or any of these things which are familiar to them, they can be taught language in that way.  If teachers bear these things in mind, I have no doubt they will get results, particularly if they view the training of the infants from the point of view of building up a vocabulary, gradually replacing the English words which the child uses by the corresponding Irish words, and systematically using the vocabulary which is being built up, all the time having regard to the fact that this vocabulary must have the closest possible connection with the actual things with which the child is familiar.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary, as I have said, that we have had so little reference to this matter of play which modern educationists regard as being a most important part of the curriculum in infant schools.  Although the programme in our schools at present makes ample provision for play, and not alone for play, but, as I have said, for kindergarten, handwork, drill, singing, playing games, story telling and so on, these things find no reference whatever in this report, of which such a large part is given up to the question of work in the infant schools.</P>
    <P>The Notes for Teachers, dealing with the question of Irish in the schools, deal with Irish generally and further notes are being issued dealing with the teaching of infants.  If Deputies will look at page 5 of the Notes for Teachers they will see that what I have just mentioned has been stressed by the Department as being necessary for the successful teaching of infants:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the aim of his instruction is to make Irish speakers of his pupils, it follows that he must supply them with the vocabulary most practical and immediate to their needs.  If they are to use Irish freely in school, in the playground, on their way to and from school, at home, they must have a body of speech-moulds and a vocabulary adequate to express the ideas they at present <Col N="756" /> possess.  Therefore, their own lives as they live them, their interests and occupations, their work and their play, the normal and abnormal occurrences of their home and school-life, dictate the choice and range of these subjects.  Later on, topics remote from their experiences must be taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is denied in this report.  It is denied that the experiences of the child can be utilised in this way and it is argued that in the teaching of Irish one is confined to the actual school experiences. Why on earth, if one is teaching English and one can use the out of school experiences to extend the child's vocabulary and grasp of the language, can it be contended by persons who presume to have knowledge of the matter that in the case of Irish you are confined absolutely to school experiences?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Later on, topics remote from their experiences may be taken because it is the aim of education to broaden as well as to develop the mind and its interests; but the language in which these remoter topics will be discussed is based on that learnt in connection with the more urgent personal range of thought. The teacher should, therefore, consciously set himself to study the children's world of ideas and interests and supply them, first, with a language in which to express themselves freely on these subjects.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, the aim in the infant school should be to give the child a foundation, if nothing more is possible, of Irish, to enable him later on to get actual instruction through Irish.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan says I am giving a false idea of what this report says. At the bottom of page 20 it is pointed out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All language development is closely related to experiences and, as school experiences are limited, <Col N="757" /> opportunities for any development in school are limited.  There must be close language relationship between home and school.  The home and school must supplement each other in this regard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The meaning I take from that is that it is denied, or at any rate one may deduce from it a denial, that the out of school experiences can be used.  I do not say that if the children are not sufficiently advanced it may be possible to use them.  All depends on the individual teacher and the circumstances. I say that, in the circumstances, where infants' training is carried on successfully in Irish, there is no reason why out of school experiences should not be brought in, and it has been found that the out of school experiences, such as the experiences in shopping&mdash;poor children frequently have a good deal of knowledge of shopping&mdash;are useful and pennies and half-pennies can be used to a very great extent to give them those elementary ideas of numbers that are considered necessary to build up a vocabulary.</P>
    <P>If the teacher is a person of understanding, in addition to being competent to teach the infants in Irish, then I have no doubt that she will accommodate herself as far as is possible.  We cannot have the ideal conditions, perhaps, of the nursery or of the family, but we have to keep in mind constantly that our aim ought to be to approximate to them as far as we can.  I have no doubt whatever that a competent teacher, fluent in Irish, who understands what the programme asks her to do, who examines the notes and tries to find out what the Department has in view, ought, with her qualifications as teacher, to be able to carry out the ideas of the programme and to ensure that, at the end of the infant class period, the children leave her with a vocabulary which has been built up and which enables them to carry on conversation on simple topics and show a certain familiarity and fluency with the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I refer to the actual programme.  It will be seen on page 22:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Conversation.  Junior Infants. <Col N="758" /> Language.  Conversation, object and picture lessons, story-telling and recitation, all used for the purpose of training the children to understand Irish and to speak it distinctly and correctly as their natural language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senior infants are dealt with on page 23:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Language.  Pupils to be taught to understand Irish, and to speak it correctly and distinctly as their natural language; this to be done by means of conversation-lessons about persons, objects, pictures and actions, alternated with rhymes, dialogues, and short stories such as can be wholly or very largely illustrated by actions or pictures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is stated also on page 14:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We may mention here that when drawing up our list of obligatory subjects we placed first and foremost before our minds the schools in which two teachers have to deal with children ranging from infants to those of 14 years of age.  We have, therefore, formed our programmes primarily for schools of this type, some 71 per cent. of the total number.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to stress again what I have already emphasised in this House, when this matter has been under discussion, that the conference strongly emphasised the importance of teaching infant classes through the medium of Irish and the use of the direct method in that connection. As I have said, a certain effort is required to acquire the ordinary school subjects, but we are not treating Irish as a school subject and if we do treat it merely as a school subject, we will be getting an entirely wrong perspective in this matter.  I do not know whether, through the amount of propaganda that has been going on about this matter, whether well-founded or ill-founded, even the best-intentioned of us have not done a certain amount of harm to the policy of teaching through Irish.  I maintain that in order that Irish should be made a living speech in this country, Irish will have to be used as a medium for other subjects.  I cannot understand <Col N="759" /> how, having regard to our situation, anybody can believe that merely teaching Irish for an hour a day&mdash;which is the position in schools where no subjects are taught through Irish&mdash;can ever get us anywhere in making Irish the spoken language in this country. We have a unique task in this country. Perhaps no other country has undertaken such a task.  We have thrown a heavy burden on our teachers but let us not try to run away with the idea that we are doing something simple. We are doing, or attempting to do, something very great indeed, something which few nations have undertaken, and it is not for me to say how many of those who may have undertaken such a task have succeeded.  In this matter we are depending largely on the moral support of our people and on the fact that they believe that our aim is right, that the goal is a worthy one and that we ought to do everything possible to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that the child spends only four or five hours a day receiving secular instruction in the national school.  Out of the 14 or 15 waking hours of his day, only a comparatively small number is spent in school.  For the rest of the period he is quite free; he is released from the discipline and burden of the school work and he is living entirely, as a rule, in an English atmosphere where everything possible is being done to anglicise him.  If, out of the four or five hours at school only one hour is going to be devoted to Irish, what chance will Irish have?  I think that, whatever difference of opinion we may have about individual cases or as to methods, we must admit that the fundamental policy of using the school as a medium through which Irish will be gradually extended, through the subjects and through the standards, until eventually all the subjects in all the standards will be taught through Irish, was the only way in which to tackle this problem.  It was recognised that the elementary schools were the key to the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I gave some figures last night showing that we have not advanced very far <Col N="760" /> on the road.  I have shown that in 1934 we had only a small percentage of schools doing the work through Irish.  In 1942 it is doubtful whether it could not be argued that we have been only marking time, if we have not retrogressed, in the interval because the number of schools has declined and it is a moot question&mdash;I would be very satisfied in my mind if I were certain of it&mdash;whether in this particular matter, where we have lost in quantity we have made up in quality.  I am very, very doubtful whether, in view of the war situation, with the lower <i>tempo</i> generally, with the fact that people are worried and anxious about the situation, we have not in fact gone back somewhat in our general policy for the revival of the language. I doubt very much whether we have made the same progress as we would have made if times were normal and if people were not worried by matters arising out of this unfortunate war situation.  But, even before the war, the progress that was made was not such, I think, that anyone could say undue pressure was being put upon the teachers.</P>
    <P>I read last night some extracts from evidence given to the Vocational Organisation Commission and I would like to say that it is quite clear from the figures that from the fourth standard up, very little instruction through Irish is being done.  An important point that has to be borne in mind in that connection is that, apart from the three R's, only a little singing is taught up to the fourth standard. English is taught through English. Irish is taught through Irish, and the question then is to what extent you are teaching arithmetic, or trying to teach arithmetic through Irish.  The arithmetic, even in the third standard, is rather elementary, but I would like the House to bear in mind that it boils down to a question of the amount of arithmetic, apart from singing, that is being taught or that is sought to be taught through Irish.</P>
    <P>I explained to the House that in 1934 we thought we had gone to the absolute limit in reducing the content of the programme in order to enable Irish to be dealt with adequately and <Col N="761" /> instruction through the medium of Irish to be carried on somewhat more vigorously.  At no time did we try to impose the teaching of Irish upon teachers who had not the necessary qualifications.  So, I have yet to learn what exactly is meant by the official pressure that it is suggested was put upon the teachers, when they themselves admit that they knew they were doing something, or trying to do something, that was in fact opposed to the official instructions of the Department.</P>
    <P>Unless we can envisage the situation where each school in the country will be a little Gaeltacht, in which practically all the children and the teachers will be constantly speaking Irish, there is very little hope that we will in any reasonable time achieve the position that these children will be able to conduct their ordinary business of life through Irish.  If Irish is simply to be taught for an hour a day as a school subject&mdash;I would like to see it tried; I would like to see experiments to prove otherwise, if it is possible&mdash;it is my belief that you cannot in the nature of things, by treating it as a school subject, enable the pupils to regard it as a language in which their ordinary business can be done, whereas, if it is treated as the language of the school and a language through which subjects are taught to them, it will be quite easy for the children to understand that Irish is not merely a school subject but a language that they are intended to use in their play, in their work and in their lives after school.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the way in which we in this country are threatened to be engulfed by the seas of English speech, washing our shores, so to speak, not alone from one side, but from the other, not alone through the newspapers, but through films and through the radio, I do not know how anybody can maintain that that unequal struggle can be maintained by the protagonists of Irish, unless we try to regard this as a matter in which we must have wholehearted effort, a matter which must be taken completely out of the realm in which it is sought to place it, as being merely a school subject.  It has been described by prominent men <Col N="762" /> of the present and past generations as a matter of life and death for the country that the language should survive, and, for more than 20 years, we have been trying, under an Irish Government, to bring back Irish as a living speech.  Let us look around us and see, outside the schools, what has been the extent of our success, and if we are satisfied that success has been achieved to a great extent outside the schools&mdash; in the courts, in the Dáil and elsewhere &mdash;then we may say that we are not completely dependent on the schools; but I am afraid that if we be realistic in this matter, we shall have to agree that up to the present and for some time to come the revival of Irish has depended and will depend almost entirely on the efforts of the teachers.</P>
    <P>As I see it, we are in the position that we have this flood of English beating around us and threatening to overwhelm us.  We are trying to set up these embankments of Irish, these dykes, in order to keep out the tide of anglicisation, and it is a very urgent matter indeed that we should get these embankments up.  They may not be perfect from the engineering point of view, but the urgent thing and the immediately necessary thing, in my view, is to get as many of them as possible built, and built as strongly as possible. The test of our effectiveness in the matter is, I think, the will and resolution we show in building these embankments to keep out this opposing speech, because let it be remembered that this is not a matter like the building of industries or such things.  It is a living, vital, spiritual matter and if we do not succeed with Irish, then the opposing speech succeeds.  To the extent that we do not succeed in making Irish the speech of this country, English must continue to be the speech of this country.  Are those of us who think English is necessary not satisfied with the strong position that English holds in the life of the country that we should try to force back the clock to the position of 20 years ago, and adopt the retrograde step of sacrificing all that work, all that toil and all that labour, and, on the case made in this report, of going back to the teaching of Irish as a mere school subject? <Col N="763" /> If we do that, well and good, but let us give up the pretence that we are trying to make this country Irish-speaking.</P>
    <P>It is admitted in this report that the older teachers do not in fact teach through Irish to any great extent and it is scarcely necessary for me to emphasise the matter.  I should like to say that we have still in the service large numbers of teachers who were over the age of 30 in 1922 and who were excused from securing any qualifications in Irish.  These are still there and they have not been dismissed for incompetence in Irish or failure to teach Irish.  They have been given every allowance by the inspectors. Every fair play has been given to them, although we all know that if the schools had been manned since 1922 with the type of teacher we are now getting out of the preparatory colleges, teachers who are themselves not alone competent Irish speakers, able to discuss every subject through Irish, but who have a higher standard of education, and who are able to teach the subjects in the primary school programme through Irish, the situation would be far advanced indeed compared with what it is to-day.</P>
    <P>Even at the present time, according to the latest figures, only 64 per cent. of the teachers have the bilingual or higher qualifications and could be described, even on a modest estimate of their ability, as being capable of teaching subjects through Irish, but, in fact, as the figures I have given show, very little indeed is being done in the higher standards.  I should like to have an inquiry as to how we would achieve this goal of making Irish the living speech of the schools, and, not alone that, but the medium of instruction in the schools, in the speediest and most efficient manner.  I should like to have examples given to us of what has been done in the schools which we know have been successful in this matter, and, if anybody doubts my word, let him look at the list of secondary schools where he will see the gradual growth of Irish and extension of Irish as the medium of instruction and compare <Col N="764" /> it with the growth, or lack of growth, in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>Does anybody contend that the secondary schools, though they may have some advantages, have not had a great burden placed upon them also? But they have taken up the patriotic attitude that this is a national duty, a national task, which has to be carried through, no matter what the obstacles or the difficulties may be. The beginnings have been weak, perhaps. There have been transitions gradually from English to Irish, but, after a period of years, by constant effort, the teachers in those schools have equipped themselves to teach the entire secondary programme through Irish.  I say that those who have undertaken that task have been successful and it is a proof that the same thing can be done in the primary schools.  I am not saying that the teaching of infants, as I said at the beginning, is not a very highly specialised and arduous type of work which calls for great exertions, even from the most highly-skilled teacher.</P>
    <P>The approach to the whole problem in this report is not constructive and not made in a manner which, I think, our experience and our successes so far would have led us to expect would have influenced the teachers in their judgments and their views on this matter.  On page 27, they practically deny that teaching through Irish can be carried on successfully, or that children from English-speaking homes can acquire the power necessary to do their work through Irish.  The actual words are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sum of these phrases is being constantly increased by their out-of-school environment, and it is a fairly correct assertion that children drawn from an English-speaking home and living in an all-English-speaking environment will never acquire the power to think otherwise than in the language of their home and of their natural environment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that is a very pessimistic view, and if we were all of that view, if our teaching and our policy were animated by that view, we might as well throw up our hands and <Col N="765" /> give up the idea of restoring Irish.  I maintain, however, that it has been proved successfully, not alone in secondary schools but in primary schools, which are here to be seen in the City of Dublin, if Deputies wish to see them, that children from English-speaking homes, and poor homes, too, can be given a good knowledge of Irish, can become familiar with the language, and, even at the end of the infants' course, can be said to have got such a grasp of Irish as to be able to speak it fairly fluently and naturally.  From the report itself there is a certain confirmation of what I have been arguing, I think.  Pages 15 to 25&mdash;almost ten pages&mdash;are given up to the question of the medium of instruction in infant schools.  I contend that there is no instruction in infant schools: that there is merely language training of infants, or at any rate training with the idea of enabling a vocabulary to be built up to be of further use, but pages 15 to 25 of this document are filled with long statements of the suggested ill-effects of Irish, as shown by the medical officers of health, and references to instruction which, I maintain, is not being given, or should not be given, if the programme was being followed and the teaching efficient.  On page 25, however, I find that the important matter of the whole national attitude towards this problem and its fundamental nature, apart altogether from its importance as a school subject, is brought into the report, and I only regret that the contents of the two small paragraphs, which give the views of a minority of infant teachers, have not got the same amount of consideration, argument and discussion, and have not been presented with the same care as the attitude of the 60 per cent. has been stated in the preceding nine pages.  Even the &ldquo;60 per cent., however, believe that Irish should be used as the school language and that instructions, orders, and, as far as possible, incidental conversations with the children, should be in the Irish language. It is held by the 60.5 per cent. that if this were done, and short English lessons introduced at intervals, progress in the Irish language itself would be more advanced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I am informed by the inspectors that in a great many schools&mdash;and the matter is referred to in the Notes for Teachers&mdash;no effort is made, in fact, to use Irish as the school language, as the medium for giving orders and instructions to the pupils, and that, in fact, one would imagine that to use Irish in that way as the medium of intercourse between teachers and pupils was rather more difficult than actually teaching subjects through Irish.  We have here long lists of numbers of teachers who have tried, apparently, often against official instructions, according to themselves, to teach subjects through Irish, but we have no account given of those who have tried the other line, the line that, it is suggested here, would be beneficial, of using Irish as far as possible as the school language.  If teachers believe that that can be done, it is extraordinary that we have no evidence or no cases brought before us to show what the good results were, because if there are other methods by which Irish can be made the language of the schools, if it can be shown that through these the pupils will eventually be able to speak Irish, to do their business in Irish later on, and to benefit by instruction through Irish in the secondary schools, let us by all means have all the evidence that we can get about these alternative methods.  Unfortunately, we have merely the bare statement that the 60.5 per cent. think that, by giving the instructions and orders in Irish, progress would be more advanced.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that we have been at this work for 20 years, and why is it that there are schools in the country where this has not been done during that generation?  Why is it, when we have laid it down in the 1926 programme, in the Notes for Teachers and the other instructions that we have given, that Irish has not now, at least, reached the stage when it is used as the school language?  It is simply because Irish is not regarded as it ought to be&mdash;as something vital to the life and the soul of this nation. It is regarded merely as a school subject, and even in that light, it is very <Col N="767" /> often not viewed with any great understanding. It is not considered as a medium, it is not built up gradually as a medium of speech, first as a training in language and, eventually, as a medium of instruction.  It is regarded merely as an end in itself, but I fear that not enough attention is given to it as the method and the means by which the best results can be got for the extension of Irish in the school.</P>
    <P>I was going to say that the 39.5 per cent. held that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if proficiency in the Irish language is the aim, the instruction during the infant years should be in Irish, and English should be rigidly excluded. The vast majority of children in the Galltacht have no outside opportunity of hearing Irish spoken, and the very most should be made of the comparatively short school-day period.  The children will learn the language only by speaking it, and the natural impulse to speak will result in the child's striving to acquire forms of expression in the new language when those of his home language are denied him.  In this way the continuous use of Irish gives a tremendous impetus to the language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that if the whole of that section, dealing with infant training, and indeed the whole of the inquiry, had been based on that approach, that the task of reviving Irish is one that we have to face with courage and determination, that we are not to allow ourselves to be set back by obstacles or difficulties but are to proceed with determination and earnestness&mdash;if the whole inquiry had been on that constructive basis, and if it had been taken as axiomatic that the programme of the Department, and the circulars and instructions that were issued, were to be the basis of the examination, and that the real question on which the country as well as the Department of Education would like to have information would be how we could secure the best results from this programme or what better methods the teachers ought to adopt, what procedure they should <Col N="768" /> follow in dealing with the different classes, how they should undertake the teaching of subjects through Irish and give us practical examples of what it has been possible to achieve, we might look on this in a different way.  Unfortunately, however, as I said last night, we have no indication of that in the report, apart from the two paragraphs I have read, which would seem to suggest that a large minority, at any rate, of infant teachers believe in the programme of teaching through Irish in their case, and they believe it because they see no other way of accomplishing the purpose of making Irish the living speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the Minister to this report.  I think it is a matter of importance that ought to be discussed with the general part of his Estimate. When I remember some of the phrases he used when perorating ten or 15 minutes ago, and then I heard him about two minutes ago, I feel a certain amount of disturbance.  He talked about the embankments and barriers we must erect against the inflow of English in the schools: that we must go ahead in a more determined way against those barriers and obstacles. He referred to the propaganda in the report.  Is that to be his attitude towards buttressing the weakness and the difficulties that have been evidenced if not entirely proved by the report? With a view to drawing up this report a questionnaire was sent out for examples and suggestions.  No doubt the group appointed got these together. Supposing these were produced to the Minister and showed any evidence that, while it was possible to get Irish made the living speech in the country through the continuance of present methods but that that would be accompanied by two or three other things: that there would be a lack of further training, that certain things would be defective in the make-up of the children coming from the primary schools, and that making Irish the living speech could be better brought about in other ways, would the Minister still stick to his phrases and impediments and barriers and say it was <Col N="769" /> all propaganda?  There is quite an amount of historical matter in the early part of the report indicating why it was necessary to have an investigation at all.  Certain school teachers came to certain conclusions after having had examples before their eyes. They found that they were not alone in those views.  The result was that certain resolutions were passed and a committee was set up which has got together quite a valuable body of evidence.  This report brings out something which, I think, ought to merit the attention of the Minister and not merely a sort of bad-tempered reaction.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to page 25 of the report, in which it is pointed out that incidental conversations with the children, instructions and orders should, as far as possible, be in Irish. It is said that &ldquo;the view held by 60.5 per cent. was that if this were done, and short English lessons introduced at intervals, progress in the Irish language would advance.&rdquo;  With this view, it is stated, 39.5 per cent. disagreed. So that of the 40 per cent. who advocated the sole use of Irish, approximately half held that, while the language itself would benefit, other things would suffer.  If we neglect the 60 per cent., and take merely the 40 per cent., we find that on the question of Irish as a medium of instruction in infant schools the 40 per cent. is divided, one-half holding that Irish will benefit, and the other half holding that other things will suffer.  Supposing that was the conclusion of the whole report, that the teachers were evenly divided, I wonder what view the Minister would take of one-half of the teachers saying, &ldquo;Carry on as you are&rdquo;, and the other half saying, &ldquo;If you do that, certain other things are going to suffer&rdquo;?  How would the Minister's propaganda phrases meet that situation?  Would he still hold that it was going to disrupt the work done over the last 20 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fair number of pages in the report are given to the historical part, and to the situation which existed prior to the setting up of the committee and the production of the report.  We are told what happened in 1922 when <Col N="770" /> orders were issued that the work in the infant standards was to be entirely in Irish.  It is suggested that a beginning should be made in the teaching of history and geography.  Within a couple of years it was recognised that that went too far.  The second programme conference, established in 1924 at the request of the National Teachers' Organisation, in its report, says: &ldquo;It cannot but be convinced by the unanimous expression of opinion which it had received on that point.&rdquo;  Since then there has been a fair amount of trial and error on this matter, and undoubtedly definite progress on certain lines.  On page 12 one finds towards the end of this historical part this view:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Concurrent with this growing faith of the official mind that the use of Irish as a teaching medium for children from non-Irish speaking homes was not alone feasible but educationally desirable, was a growing doubt in the minds of teachers of the educational progress likely to follow from it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Eventually the Irish National Teachers' Organisation in 1930 passed a resolution stating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this congress considers that the time is now ripe for an educational assessment of the use of Irish as a teaching medium in schools in English-speaking districts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was followed by a request by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation for a stock-taking.  A conference was held with leading officials of the Department in the early spring of 1934.  It is stated here that in the memorandum presented to that conference the Irish National Teachers' Organisation representatives stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The continuous teaching of a new language throughout the school-day imposes an undue strain on children of tender years.  They tend to become weary and listless during the latter portion of the day and the teacher's energy is largely wasted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress that because it has been questioned whether the teachers are <Col N="771" /> good judges of the strain brought about by giving instruction in certain ways to infants.</P>
    <P>That was the time I suggest for the Department to give their viewpoint, if they had a viewpoint, on the question as to whether the teachers were capable of giving a judgment on this matter of strain. Apparently, that view was not put forward by the officials but it is the viewpoint held by the teachers.  Eventually, the congress held in Killarney in 1936 passed the resolution which formed the terms of reference of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The committee was asked to report on</P>
    <P>&ldquo;whether a certain teaching practice which had come into being as a result of Departmental instruction and pressure was educationally sound or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there was a request that there should be a full examination and report.  In any event we have this situation: that in 1922 it was decided to go full blast on this matter, in 1924 there was a sort of withdrawal, in 1926 the second programme conference issued a report in which the original instruction was somewhat modified. There was the point of view held by the official mind and the opposite viewpoint held by the teachers who saw the machine working.  In between the conference with officials of the Department, the teachers expressed their view with regard to the physical strain.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a great deal of another point and that is how it comes about that certain of these teachers have taught subjects through the medium of Irish when the conditions set out by the Department were not fulfilled, namely, teacher qualified and pupil competent to benefit by the instruction. They say this twice, they put it in the end of the report and they put it in the forefront of page 12 in order to put it in a certain context; that 525 out of 857 state that they did this contrary to their own opinion and that they did it as a result of official suggestion.  If the Minister reads that paragraph in its context he will see that it refers to two circulars <Col N="772" /> issued by the Department.  In 1931 a circular was issued, as given on the top of page 12:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The circular having drawn attention to the fact that although some 5,000 of the teachers had the bilingual or higher qualifications in Irish, commented as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The number of schools in which considerable and progressive work through Irish is being done is comparatively small.  The Department, therefore, desires teachers to address themselves earnestly and courageously to the accomplishment of this important duty of extending instruction through the medium of Irish.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was followed by a further circular in February, 1934, which repeated the instructions of the November, 1922, circular and said further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These instructions indicate the desirability of the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible according to the capacity of the teacher in speaking the language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Immediately after that follows this paragraph in the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be noted in this connection that out of 857 teachers replying to query 24 of the questionnaire, 525 stated that as a result of official suggestion and contrary to their own opinion, they taught subjects through the medium of Irish when the conditions set out by the Department were not fulfilled&mdash;namely, teacher qualified and pupil competent to benefit by instruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take that to mean in that context that there was a bit of a push made by the Department and that that is why the teachers use this phrase that official suggestion moved them to do this contrary to their own view.</P>
    <P>However, that is the background to this report, a viewpoint that I think can be held by good patriotic people and by people who are concerned with this matter of making Irish a living language; but that the method which is being attempted now is not a proper method, that if it does achieve the aim <Col N="773" /> of getting Irish a little bit further on rapidly, it will do it at a certain cost. These people have sacrificed their own leisure and in a very intelligent way set about finding out what is the situation and report in a matter-of-fact type of way, attempting to find out whether what is now being attempted will have the desired aim, and if the aim could not be accomplished with less suffering in other respects.  It is embarrassing on an important Vote like this to have the Minister treating this in a wholly inadequate way and showing, not merely an amount of antagonism, but also a certain amount of bad temper in regard to the suggestion that any comment could be made on this matter; apparently taking the view that simply because the Department has had a particular point of view for many years and there has been some progress made on the lines of that point of view, it is impolitic and imprudent, if not unnational, for people to say that the same objective can be achieved with less sacrifice.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the inquiry itself I might say that in any inquiry of this sort there are three things in which there is a possibility of error. The people to whom the result of the inquiry is given may be incapable of reporting.  They may not be the sort of people who can collate information of a particular type or set a test sufficiently wide to get the information on which a judgment can be based. The second type of error might be that they did not get a big enough sample from the schools or, if the inquiry was a biased one, it may be that the inquiries were directed only to one section of the schools and their opinion would be definitely misleading.  The third way would be that, supposing the proper people were addressed by those competent to collate the results, those at the end of the line, who are giving evidence of their own and the special things they observe, might not be competent observers or might report in a biased way.</P>
    <P>I am going to rule out bias from this matter.  If the questionnaire was directed in a widespread way to the schools set out in the forefront of the paragraph, I think the names that <Col N="774" /> appear in the report indicate clearly that the people who were given the task of directing the inquiry were not biased against the use of Irish.  With regard to competence, I can only say this.  I have no personal experience of the work of primary schools, but I think anyone reading the report, particularly that section which deals with the teaching of infants, must be struck with one thing, and that is that the people who put this report together knew a good deal about child psychology, know all that is required about the approach to a child's mind, and the way in which a child's interest ought to be excited if proper results are to be obtained.  I think there is internal evidence in that report from the way in which it is put together to indicate that the gentlemen who did compose it were fully qualified, provided they got the correct information, to draw up a report which would be of use to the Department, to this House and to the country generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has questioned the weight of the evidence and possibly he has questioned whether the people who brought the evidence forward were competent observers. I did not know when the Minister was speaking whether he had read the report itself or whether he had contented himself with reading a report on the report.  At certain times I thought that he did not seem to be picking even the best passages from the report to fortify the arguments adduced.  There were times even when he seemed to distort the report.  He said that one might take it from the report that the bad physique of the children and the malnutrition could be ascribed to the teaching of Irish. There is nothing so clearly distinguished in the report.  Those who make the report say clearly that there are quite a number of things which add difficulty to the educational process in the infant schools, and on page 14 they talk about children who are undernourished and insufficiently clad, and quote figures from the reports of the Department itself which they describe as illuminating.  They talk of the number medically examined and of the defects they were suffering from.  They talk about malnutrition, under-nourishment, <Col N="775" /> and bad housing conditions, and they say that that is the material that has to be worked on.  But they carefully distinguished that which is the product of outside influences from the effects that they find in trying to give these children some part of their instruction through the medium of Irish, when Irish is not the home language. I do not think it can be said by anybody who has read this report that there is the slightest possibility of confusion between those two things.  The report carefully segregates them.  When physical conditions are referred to, they are very careful to say that they do recognise that the children coming to a number of schools are not in a high state of physical development. Having said that, they talk of what they find as to the extra burden that follows from the teaching of Irish in a particular way.</P>
    <P>As to the question of instruction in infant schools, on page 18 it is stated in this particular connection that 422 teachers replied.  They say that of the 422 who replied, nine were discarded for reasons of lack of experience.  Of the rest of them they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The teachers who comprised the balance were all giving satisfactory service, 115 of them being rated highly efficient and 298 efficient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to conduct an inquiry on his own into this matter on whom would he rely for his information, if not on the teachers who are actively engaged day by day in the schools?  If he is going to rely upon the teachers, will he get any better selection than these 422, 115 of whom are rated as highly efficient and 298 as efficient?</P>
    <P>The first thing they mention is the question of the physical results.  They say it is bad.  The way they come to that conclusion is, they talk about the lack of energy and the listlessness which is observed in the school at the end of a period of instruction in this way.  They say that it means that the child is stiffened with boredom, listless and inert, and the teacher's efforts are wasted.  The Minister <Col N="776" /> seemed to indicate that that was a matter for a doctor to examine into. I should imagine a doctor might possibly give instructions to the teachers as to what they were to observe and that they might take observations over particular periods of the day, something amounting to a measurement of fatigue.  Fatigue as an outcome of school work has been measured over and over again and the results have been related in many text books.  The evidence has appeared for what it is worth.  These people who reached their conclusions in a particular way say that they found the children dull and listless and, at the end of the day, the teacher's efforts were merely a waste of time.</P>
    <P>They had previously said that to the Department in 1934.  They referred to the undue strain on the children, and said that the children tended to become wearied and listless towards the end of the day, and the teacher's energy was wasted.  They were not reproved on that occasion.  They were not told that they were not competent to come to a conclusion on that matter.  I suggest that they are entirely competent, and the Minister, if he is going to exclude them, is going to abandon any proper research into this question of fatigue.</P>
    <P>The Minister also commented upon this, that the teachers, either the body who drew up the report or the teachers who recorded their observations in that questionnaire, seemed to think that the experience was confined to school experience.  There is an entirely different statement made in the report.</P>
    <P>On page 20 of the report this appears:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first subject on the programme for infant schools and infant departments is language, thereby emphasising the pride of place which language occupies in the education of infants.  All language development is closely related to experiences, and as school experiences are limited, opportunities for language development in school are limited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> There is a very definite statement there.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There must be close language relationship between home and school&mdash;the home and school must supplement each other in this regard&mdash;if the child is to acquire the power to express adequately his experiences in clearly articulated speech.  It must be remembered that the educative process, particularly in so far as language and power of speech expression are concerned, begins in the home.  That process has been going on for almost six years before the child enters the school.  While the power to form the sounds that make up speech is inherent in all children, the speech itself is learned from the parents or in the family circle.  The vast majority of children are able before coming to school to give expression to their feelings, their desires, and their imaginations, through the speech education they have got prior to coming to school.  That faculty which has been acquired is completely lost as an educative force if and when the child is placed in an environment where there is used, what is to him, a foreign language. In such circumstances the spontaneous chatter for which the child longs is denied to him, and he cannot, therefore, give a living description of his experiences&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is clearly his outside experiences&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because his newly-acquired and very limited vocabulary does not admit of his doing so in the free and easy manner of the home language. His attempts at expression are feeble, if he does not take refuge in silence altogether.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that this curbing of the child retards his progress, as it destroys his natural spontaneity, stifles his attempts at expression, and makes him timid and undecided.  What the Minister said is completely the reverse of the facts as set out in the report. These people say that you must build on experience if there is to be any progress at all, even in language, and they say when the child has had his experiences <Col N="778" /> outside the home and comes there with a certain amount of experience, and language in which to clothe his experience at six years, and an attempt is made to extend this experience through the medium of another language, he is thrown back and becomes inarticulate and so his spontaneity is gone.</P>
    <P>On the general matter of the medium of instruction on the mental side, I cannot understand the Minister's attitude, which apparently is that it is the wrong thing to entitle this chapter &ldquo;The Medium of Instruction in Infant Schools.&rdquo;  I observe that on page 15, where that heading is put, there is reference to the note of the Department, and the note says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The work of the infant classes is to be entirely in Irish....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the teachers are wrong in speaking of &ldquo;instruction,&rdquo; the Department must still be in error to a greater or lesser degree when they put in the harsher term &ldquo;work.&rdquo; On the general attitude, these people report on page 18:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the question of the comparative benefits to be derived by the pupils from instruction through the medium of Irish, and through the medium of English, 345 stated that their pupils did not derive benefit from instruction through the medium of Irish equal to that which they would derive were English the medium used.  The contrary view was held by 45.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is analysed at length in the succeeding pages.  Then, on page 19, there is a broken paragraph which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first obvious fact that emerges from this inquiry is that the majority of infant teachers are opposed to using Irish as the sole medium of instruction when English is the home language, but this must not be taken to mean that they are against teaching Irish as a subject to their young charges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are three pages which follow before one comes to the application of Irish to number-teaching, and I cannot understand how the Minister says that the people who wrote this report <Col N="779" /> forgot that the greater part of the educative process in the earlier years is through play.  That is spoken of at least a dozen times in the pages that follow here, and it is one of the points on which I lean.  I say that the people who wrote the report are very definitely good child psychologists, and are very proficient in the proper approach to the mind of the infant.  The Minister apparently did not see that that was the foundation of their remarks. So far as the rest of the matter with regard to the infant school is concerned, it is dealt with under separate headings.</P>
    <P>I come finally to the use of Irish and the language revival.  The report is, of course, one-sided in the sense that the majority of the replies to the questionnaire make the people who produce this report right, that the benefit is not being got through the attempt to teach through Irish that might be got otherwise.  Even such benefit as is got is being got at a certain cost to the people who are made undergo this method of learning.  If the Minister wants a final look at the attitude of the committee on this question of teaching through play, he might look at page 24, where it is stated: &ldquo;Children must be entertained to be enthused.&rdquo; In other words, it is by enthusiasm through entertainment that children in the earlier stages will be brought to the acquisition of any information.</P>
    <P>The report is so detailed, so well put together and so full of information, that it is hard to get the appropriate quotations from it, on the points that really occur to one as important, but it may be said in general that the report then travels through the teaching of various subjects, through the medium of Irish.  Not having ever had any experience in connection with primary schools, reading it as a complete outsider as far as that branch of education is concerned, I must say that the point of view that developed in me through this was that it is only in what are called the subjects in which &ldquo;doing&rdquo; plays the more important part that there is any proficiency <Col N="780" /> at all or that there is equal proficiency when the subject is taught through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>I think that in these matters the report says that a majority of the people who were addressed expressed the view that instruction can be done with greater benefit through the medium of Irish than in any other way.  That applies to such things as singing and sewing.  They also say that the school instruction, that is to say, the formal instruction given to the children about the enforcement of discipline in the school, can be done through the medium of Irish because it is a mere matter of phrases used which implant themselves and get themselves into the children's memory and arrest attention immediately.  As far as the other things are concerned, this report says that the majority of the people addressed have come to certain conclusions.</P>
    <P>A very amazing matter is referred to on page 60 of the report, where they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a constant theme running through all the replies, which points to the fact that parents generally are opposed to a method for the Irish revival which would tend to lower the educational standard of the children, according to their values.  Infant teachers have stated that it is a common practice for parents to ask that infant children be provided with English primers so that they may be given in the home the instruction in English reading denied to them in the school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is thrown in in a chapter headed &ldquo;Conclusions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There emerges from this report, in any event, this, that a competent body of people were asked by two congresses to get certain material together and to advise, through the medium of a report, the I.N.T.O. on this matter of teaching through Irish where Irish was not the home language.  The report indicates that there has been a growing feeling amongst teachers involved in this educational process in the schools that the matter was not <Col N="781" /> being correctly handled.  This competent body of people got together what must be regarded as a good sample of replies in answer to their questionnaire.  There emerges from their report that it is the considered opinion of the people collating these replies that this particular matter, handled in the way in which it is, is not giving the maximum benefit to the children.  I think the people who brought up this report would say it is not even giving the maximum benefit to this matter of making Irish a living language, and they certainly do raise this question as to whether better progress towards both objectives, that is to say, good all-round education and the making of Irish more a living language, could not be obtained by another means.  They give reasons; they give facts.  I am quite certain that the replies which this committee has would probably give more facts and allow a better pamphlet to be produced if the evidence was not regarded as confidential.  I suggest there is something there to be inquired into.</P>
    <P>Last night I heard a Deputy from this Party ask the Minister could he give, even from the angle of his Department, a summary of the views that are expressed there, so that we could see on net points what are the issues as between, say, his Department, which has taken up a certain line, and the people who wrote this report.  He was asked to state if there was any conflict over policy or was there a conflict merely over the means to achieve certain ends.  I think it would not have taken any great trouble to give that information.  One does not know just to what points attention should be directed.  One does not know what conflict there is between the Department and its present practice and what is written here.  I think it is a matter that could easily be attempted by the officials of his Department, to set out here, in a very brief way, with reference to the report, what are the points to which attention has been called by this report.  It is worth inquiring into, even for the purpose of disproving them.  The Minister knows the value of the old adage that it is the exception that proves the rule.  Perhaps this whole report could be classified in that <Col N="782" /> way, but it does at first sight present a body of opinion which is apparently contrary to, one might say, even the policy, certainly contrary to the method of achieving the end that the Department has before it.  If the Minister wants to do it, let him put beside the experience referred to in this report the experience of those other good schools he refers to, so that the public can get a proper view of what is the policy of the Department and what it is striving towards and what are the difficulties in their way.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should have been grateful, and his Department should have been grateful, to the people who went to this amount of work to get out this report.  They should be particularly grateful to the group that have collated the replies and have given us the views, which they do not express as their views on policy, but simply as something that they have skimmed off from the replies that came in to the questionnaire.  I think the Minister would certainly very definitely relieve the feelings of quite a number of people who are disturbed if he were to do what I suggest.  I would say the people that are disturbed are in two classes.  There are people who have for a long time thought that this attempt to force Irish was wrong and who feel that in this report they have got some backing for that view, and there are the completely opposing group who are very anxious to have Irish advanced, but who believe that this report indicates that the wrong methods are being chosen.  The Minister would do a service to both these classes of people and would relieve a certain amount of anxiety if he would adopt the particular line of approach to this pamphlet that I have spoken of.  I think it is one of the most valuable pamphlets produced by an independent body of people.  If there is something wrong in the nature of the information they asked for, or in the collection of the information, or the way in which it is presented, the Minister has a right and a duty here to tell us where they have gone wrong.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not recognise, even though he thoroughly disagrees with the report, that these are the people on whom the success of the whole experiment depends?  I agree with him that if Irish is to be successful the schools will have to be the main medium.  We have to depend on the teachers.  Does he not recognise then that if the teachers on whom he depends present a report of this kind, there is at least a case for investigation?  I think there is.  Does he not recognise that he is doing great damage to the whole cause by not adopting that attitude to the report?  It is not what one or two ideal teachers or ideal schools can do. There are such.  I know them through personal experience.  It is what the average body of teachers can do, being ordinary human beings.  I wonder whether I might relate an experience of my own in a different country.  I was in Germany in 1928 and met a number of competent heads of the various departments in industrial education, primary and secondary education.  At that time they had there an experiment called the Arbeit Schule, which meant really that the children conducted the school and, more or less, the teacher remained in the background.  I met a few men who were quite enthusiasts of that experiment but I put them a very simple question&mdash; Does that not require an extraordinarily able teacher?&mdash;and they said that it did.  I asked: &ldquo;Do you think that out of the 200,000 teachers you have here in Germany, you will get all these teaching geniuses?&rdquo;  They simply shrugged and said: &ldquo;That is the trouble.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is not what one or two teachers, or one or two good schools, can do; it is what the average teacher can do.  It is on that we have to depend, and it is a rather serious matter when these men make a report of this kind, with which the Minister is quite entitled thoroughly to disagree.  I do not think he is justified in saying that a case has not been made out for thorough investigation <Col N="784" /> and, by saying so, I think he is damaging the cause both of the language and of education.  So far as I could gather from his speech, there seems to be an extraordinary muddle. We have the inspectors, the Department and the teachers all apparently acting at sixes and sevens as to what can be done by children, and the sole defence of the Minister seems to be that, after all these years, the teachers apparently do not know what the Department wants from them so far as infants are concerned.  They are apparently under the complete delusion that they should give instruction. That is the value of Departmental instructions and of the very elaborate system of inspection we have.  It is not a very convincing explanation.</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday, on only two cases in 20 years have Deputies intervened after the Minister's reply to the discussion of an Estimate.  On the present occasion, Deputy Mulcahy intimated that he might desire to say something further on a particular matter, the matter with which Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Sullivan have now dealt&mdash;namely, a report printed by the national teachers.  However, I would like Deputies to consider calmly in connection with the general procedure, what would be the results on ordered debate if, on any Estimate on which the Minister had concluded, the debate should be reopened on the plea that some Deputy expressed dissatisfaction with the Minister's reply.  It would be very difficult to imagine unanimous satisfaction with the Ministerial reply on any Estimate.  Therefore the convention which has obtained&mdash;and to which technical objection has been expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;that when a Minister, no other Deputy offering, has been called on to conclude, he does conclude, subject to Deputies' rights to ask questions at the discretion of the Chair, should continue to operate.  On this occasion, the two Deputies who have just spoken have confined themselves to the matters specifically indicated by Deputy Mulcahy.  The continuance of what I may style established procedure is conducive to, if not essential for, orderly debate.</P>

      <P>I am not taking the blame off their shoulders, but I am sorry that there is no indication that the managerial system is going to be restored.  Secondly, I asked the Minister what progress had been made in regard to county histories and what use had been made of the histories that have appeared.  I also raised a question as to whether he would not seriously tackle again the question of raising the school-leaving age and consult other Departments closely concerned. I put to him, further, the matter of teachers in secondary schools teaching subjects which they met practically for the first time when they were called on to teach them.  As I understand the situation, that is possible.  I should like to know whether he considers the inspection system in secondary schools sufficient <Col N="786" /> to overcome difficulties of that kind. I gave him an instance in that connection which came under my own notice.  Finally, I asked about school buildings.  Does he think that £200,000 a year does more than make good the wastage?  I can tell him that some 14 years ago it was the view that it did no more than that, and will he give further consideration to that matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will go further than he has gone in his statement in relation to this report.  There are two things involved in it.  Firstly, the whole morale of the country, I think, is involved.  So many people have pinned their faith to the idea that you cannot have an Irish nation without an Irish language, that if we do not get the language restored and if we do not get away from the hypocrisy in relation to the Irish language which takes the place of love and work for the Irish language in the case of many people who call themselves very strong nationalists, we shall reach a point some day when our national prestige and national morale will get a terrible shock, because we shall wake up to the fact that we have allowed the opportunity of saving the language to pass.  Secondly, unless we clear out of our educational arena generally all this talk, all the doubts and all that fog over the educational situation which is caused by people who object to, criticise, misunderstand or fail properly to evaluate what is being done for the language, we shall utterly and completely neglect the whole of our education&mdash;that which people have to get through their schools whether their language is French, German, English or Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as one who wants to see the language restored and as one who has watched very closely and with a particular advantage, because of a close connection with the formation of some of the schools, the work that has been done for the last 20 years.  I saw a whole series of families passing from the infant school, through the primary school, the secondary school and into the universities, through schools which <Col N="787" /> were all Irish, and I have seen the results of it.  I cannot see any grounds for complaining that the work was not properly done and that people who have gone through all-Irish schools were not able to take full advantage of a university education afterwards. There are those who would like to ask what is the position with regard to the language as the spoken language in the home and in the street, but that is another matter and it has nothing to do with the position in regard to the primary schools.  What I want to know is this&mdash;and I think that a lot of people like myself, as well as a lot of ordinary intelligent people who are concerned with the life of the country generally, and with no particular interest in education, would like to be assured on these points also&mdash;who are the people who are dictating the technical processes operating in our primary schools for the use of the Irish language and its spread; who are the people that are dictating these processes; what do they represent; from what professions or from what rank of Departmental work or school work, or any other kind of work, do they come?</P>
    <P>We want to get a picture of who these people are.  We want to know what they want done.  We want to have a picture of what has been their experience in the past, in education or any other branch of work associated with education.  We want to know what experience in the past has enabled them to come to their decisions as to what they want done now: for what objects, for what immediate objects in the schools, they are seeking, and then, what are they doing, what will they do or what is their plan, from month to month and from year to year, to review what is being done and what the results of that work are both in relation to the immediate object of what they require in the schools and the final results of that in the capacity of the children leaving the primary schools, to talk and to use Irish.  Now, could we get a picture of that?  If we could get a picture of that, then we will restore confidence in ourselves, we will have a general idea of what is being done, <Col N="788" /> who is directing it, and what is expected from it, and we will feel that these are the best people to approach that work.  We will feel that it is being systematically dealt with, and we will be able to stand with confidence and, at any rate, patience, outside and add our own view and our own appreciation of the situation, and if a public opinion should be formed around it, no doubt supporting what is being done, then, in that way, our minds will be at peace so far as concerns that aspect of the matter, and we will be able to concentrate our minds on the more general side of our educational policy and our educational problems.</P>
    <P>My object in raising the treatment of this report, up to the present, by the Minister for Education, has been to plead with him that he cannot stand, with the responsibilities and with the power for action, opportunity, and good that he possesses, in the middle of that machinery and act in the way in which he is acting towards the people who in the past have been bearing, and who are going to bear in the future, the real burden of the work of restoring the language to this country through the medium of the school.  When the Minister speaks of the way in which the language movement is depending on the primary schools by reason of the fact that nobody else outside seems to be doing very much, he will have much more reason for feeling that much more depends upon the schools if, as a result of his treatment of this report, there is supposed to be a conflict between himself, the Department, and the teachers.  If the result of that treatment should be the suggestion of a conflict of that particular kind, people are going to have doubts raised in their minds that this is a report against the use of Irish in the schools.  If the issuing of that report brings the Minister to the point of systematically reviewing the situation, a tremendous lot will have been done, and the national school teachers will have added to the debt which the country owes to them already.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked for an inquiry into the situation.  I am not <Col N="789" /> quite clear as to the type of inquiry he wants, but as a preliminary to any inquiry such as Deputy O'Sullivan seems to want, I want an answer to the questions I am putting here.  If any inquiry were to be set up, I think it ought to be a preliminary inquiry that would tell us, for our information here and for the information of people generally, who are the people who are dictating the technical processes in our schools for using and restoring the Irish language; what do they represent; what do they want; what is the past experience upon which they base their claim to assert that certain things should be done; what is the immediate object and what is the ultimate object of what they want done; and what are they doing now and proposing to do in the future to see that the work is kept systematically under review and that we will not wake up in another 20 years with the same kind of unsatisfactory position in which we are to-day, when we have the most important teaching body, as far as the restoration of Irish is concerned, making a report, and the Minister appearing to be completely at variance with it and yet taking no steps to grapple with the situation or to indicate any way in which people can clearly understand whether there is a particular line of policy suggested in the report and in what way it conflicts with his policy.  I think that we cannot allow the present situation to pass without some very definite action on the part of the Ministry, and without bringing the Minister, the inspectors and the primary teachers closer together, getting a better understanding of the situation from these in the beginning and then, somewhat on the lines I suggested, a better understanding here and a better understanding by the people generally of what is being done.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  On the 20th May, I addressed a question to the Minister, in respect of a certain number of schools in the City of Dublin, as to the attendance at each class and the number on the roll at the last normal date on which the information was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked yesterday about certain information which I got this morning. I mentioned the intention for which I wanted it.  I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the following facts: In the Central Model infants' national school we find that the junior infants are divided into two classes, with 80 pupils on roll in the first class and 61 in the next.  In that school you have nine classes.  In every one of them there are more than 50 children on the roll.  In the Model School (girls) you have 13 classes, and in four of these there are more than 50 on the roll. In Gardiner Street convent school there are 27 classes.  In 14 of the classes there are more than 50 children on the roll.  In seven of these classes there are more than 60 on the roll, and in three more than 80.  In one class there are 86 on the roll, in another 82, and in another 88.  In St. Vincent's (senior) girls' school, North William Street, there are more than 50 children on the roll in eight out of the 15 classes.  In the junior infants there are 111 children on the roll.  89 children were in attendance on the date on which the information was given to me.  A note on the return states that the number on roll in April was from 65 to 67 on the average, and that since May the <Col N="791" /> number had increased to 111.  In the North William Street convent boys' school, there are more than 50 children on the roll in ten out of the 14 classes.  Two of these are junior infant classes.  In the first junior infant class there are 94 on the roll, and 75 were in attendance on the date on which the information was given.  In the second class, 76 are on the roll. 57 were in attendance on the date on which the information was given.  In the Girls' Lower Rutland Street school there are more than 50 on the roll in four out of nine classes.  In the infant girls' school, Lower Rutland Street, there are more than 50 on roll in six out of the seven classes.  In the senior infant classes you have 67, 62 and 63 in classes.  In the Pro-Cathedral boys' national school, you have more than 50 on the roll in five out of ten classes. In the Pro-Cathedral infant boys' school you have more than 50 on the roll in five out of eight classes.  In three of these classes you have more than 60 on roll.  There are two classes in which there are more than 80.  In St. Patrick's No. 1 boys' school, there are more than 50 on roll in six out of 14 classes, and in three of these you have more than 60 on roll.  In one class there are 75 on roll.  The attendance on the date for which the information was given was 66.</P>
    <P>Quite apart altogether from anything which has been said by the Minister with regard to his policy for the use of Irish in infant schools, and quite apart from the ideal that he held up before us this evening, if the children in these classes were being looked after by their mothers, will the Minister seriously tell us, when we consider what primary education means for such a large number of the people in the City of Dublin, that we can afford to have the basis of our primary education laid on classes of over 50, of 60 and of 82 in the case of infants?  Will he tell us what is happening in this city when we find in a school in this city that you can have 111 infants on the roll in one class?</P>

We have not enough inspectors to test the work as thoroughly as we would wish. His ideal appeared to be to have specialists in particular subjects.

      <P>The position is that we have intimated to the schools and to the association that we propose to take action on this matter, but no official decision has been reached.  At the same time we have asked the schools to give us certain information, particularly as regards the qualifications of <Col N="793" /> new teachers coming in.  When we get that information, during the next school year, we will be in a better position to judge what progress will be necessary.  As the Deputy knows, it will take some time, even with the best will in the world, to get this matter settled, and no matter what proposals we put up the schools will have to be given reasonable time to make arrangements. I hope the Chair will grant me indulgence to deal with a matter that really does not arise on this Vote.  It is the matter of county histories.  Four have been published, and four more are in course of preparation.  It was never intended that they should be used as school texts.  The object is to give information of a fairly specialised character to readers interested in local history.  I feel also that these books might be used as handbooks by teachers and that they will have a certain appeal to teachers.  Such books have been published in Great Britain, for example, and have been used there and elsewhere by teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that some inspectors have written textbooks, but it is not a practice that I favour. I do not know that recently inspectors have been doing that.  There have been a few cases in the past where inspectors have edited textbooks for private publishers.  We discouraged the publication of textbooks by primary school inspectors.  I think a definite instruction has been given in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is not due to any interest we may have in the inspectors.  It may be due to the fact that there is a scarcity of alternatives <Col N="796" /> to the particular book, for example, or it may be due to the fact that publishers have entered into commitments and we enabled them to try to work off the stocks which they held.  But, if there are books by inspectors on the list, I am sure the officers of my Department who deal with that matter are only too anxious to get them off, if we can do so without creating harm or hurt elsewhere.  Certainly we will not keep them on to advantage the inspectors. That is not the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister realises that it is to the advantage of the inspectors at the moment.  With regard to the question of commitments of publishers, the Minister is surely aware that most of these books, certainly the most important ones, have been published and republished. They have been issued and reissued from time to time.  There is no question of doing any hurt to any inspector who has indulged in this extra form of emolument.  They have benefited to a great extent in years past. I take it that there is a policy of removing such texts from the list of approved books and I am glad to be assured that this is to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the precedent that it is based on?  I wonder will the Minister suggest that he will bring in a change in the pensions for national teachers and not consult them beforehand?  Is the Minister serious?  What precedent has he?  I presume he has a precedent if he says it is not usual.  Has he given full consideration to the idea that there should be a gratuity given to the teachers on condition that they make a certain contribution?  Has he considered that and turned it down?  It does not appear on the scheme.  It is a matter on which, I imagine, if the teachers had been consulted, they could have put forward their views.  Perhaps the Minister might answer these questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would have to go into the question of the scheme in some detail to answer that.  As regards consultation.  I find that although personally I have had no consultation with the secondary teachers' association, there has been correspondence from time to time and various suggestions have been made, but it has not been found possible to incorporate <Col N="799" /> many of these suggestions for financial reasons.  The present is not a suitable time to extend this scheme to give increased benefits or place additional costs on the State.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware that, from the actuarial point of view, it would take a very large sum of money to make the fund sound.  Alternatively, a large annual subsidy, amounting to £10,000 a year, would have to be paid, even as matters stand, to ensure its solvency.</P>
      <P>The present scheme is concerned only with administrative matters as between the Department of Finance and Department of Education.  There is only one matter which really affects the teachers; that is, the question of the re-entry of a teacher into the scheme.  The period has been increased and the teachers know of that proposal and they have agreed.  I think we shall have to leave the question as to how far we can go in regard to the general matter until the scheme comes up for consideration.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Brennan's point, we have frequently heard it said that we are not giving a sufficient bias to agriculture in our schools.  As I have often said, there is nothing to stop teachers in the primary schools from using examples and illustrations from the life about them.  They are strongly recommended, in the Notes to Teachers and in the programme, to utilise as far as possible examples and illustrations from local life, work and needs and, therefore, I see no reason why, if the suggestions are carried out, there should not be a definite agricultural bias in the instruction, even in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we have to have regard to the fact that we are trying to give the pupils the fundamentals of the three R's, and also a knowledge of the <Col N="802" /> Irish language, great or small.  Irish is an additional burden on the teachers, if you will, and, from our discussion in the House to-day, we know what a serious matter it is. Therefore, I do not think that Deputy Brennan, on reconsideration, will consider that even if there were a strong case educationally for putting agricultural instruction on the programme, it could be done in existing circumstances in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>We are encouraging vocational schools in rural areas to give instruction in rural science.  A fairly large number of young agricultural graduates are teaching in the rural vocational schools.  The tendency undoubtedly is to follow courses leading to commercial work.  There is a reason for that.  A good many of these people find openings in commercial and distributive work.  A great number of people are employed in these callings and it is almost impossible, under a non-compulsory scheme, to compel students to follow the type of courses that we would like them to follow.  Their idea is to look for something that has a job at the end of it, a job in the Civil Service, if possible; if not, some commercial employment. We have that difficulty and allowance must be made for it.</P>
    <P>In addition, as the Deputy knows, only one son can be kept at home on the farm.  The others have to find employment elsewhere.  I think there are too many preparing for commercial life, but if there are openings, it is very difficult to stop them following the course they like without a system of compulsory education and enforcement of compulsory courses upon them.</P>
    <P>I would not be in a position to say what the general results of vocational education are just now.  According to the reports I receive, the schools are progressing satisfactorily.  The day courses are doing well, and the numbers attending them are increasing. The evening classes for adults or persons already in employment seem to be doing well, but I think there is a certain impatience with the work of vocational schools, because, as I have mentioned, <Col N="803" /> people are too apt to look for a job at the end.  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that there will be a job at the end, no matter what course is followed.  I would suggest that members of committees&mdash;I presume the Deputy is one&mdash;should emphasise to parents on every possible occasion that the object of the vocational schools is to give a vocational training for the ordinary avocation of the district.  If there is an industry in the district, then special regard should be had to it.  If not, the bias should be towards agriculture and domestic science.  Parents should be made to realise that there is no guarantee of employment, commercial or otherwise, at the end of the course; that, in fact, vocational education courses ought to be looked upon as training ground for home work afterwards in the case of girls, and for farm work or other local employment in the case of boys.  There is no guarantee, unfortunately, that they will get that employment.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is not at the moment in a position to answer for the results achieved, would it not be a wise thing if we had some kind of survey of the whole position?  A restatement by the Minister of the aims and objects of vocational education is no good to us at the moment.  It is our opinion that that is the aim, and that these are the objects.  But are they being carried out?  That is quite another matter. Are they being fulfilled and what results are we achieving?  I think the Minister ought to have some kind of survey made, by the inspectors or by other people, to find out if there are worth-while results achieved.  I think it is time that was done because we may be travelling in a wrong direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see on this Estimate there is a salary of £600 put down for a person described as director in the National College of Art.  I would like to inquire what was the position in respect of this whole institution.  As far as I have been able to follow it, what used to be called the School of Art was transformed into the National College of Art somewhere about the year 1936.  In 1938 certain appointments had to be made to it.  The first approach to it was the usual one of advertising the posts with a statement as to qualifications.  The first advertisement called for qualifications in Irish.  I do not know what happened in response to that.  The second time the advertisement was issued the qualification of Irish was abandoned, certainly abandoned in respect of one of the posts for which it had been previously insisted on in the advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time after these advertisements had been issued, a statement was made that, first of all, in response to the whole advertisement, nobody with a knowledge of Irish could be found to apply, and secondly, nobody in Ireland could be found to fill certain posts.  The result of that was that about the year 1938, three appointments were made&mdash;an appointment as assistant director of a gentleman who, I think, came from Holland; as professor of sculpture, of a gentleman who came from Czechoslovakia, and as assistant professor of sculpture, of a gentleman who came from England. <Col N="805" /> These three continued in their respective posts until the start of the war, when the Czechoslovak and the Englishman resigned.  I think both of them went back to their respective countries.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the director of the school had died, and the assistant-director, a native of Holland, held on. The post of director was advertised, and there was quite a number of candidates who applied, including the headmasters of certain schools of art in the country.  They were told after a bit that they were not regarded as suitable.  I think there was the usual demand for a knowledge of Irish in connection with this appointment. However, these people, some 12 or 14 of them, all natives of the country, all holding down administrative posts&mdash; posts requiring certain craftsmanship, &mdash;in schools in the country, were all told that they were unsuitable.</P>
    <P>Eventually, the matter was raised by question in the House here, and the Minister said it had not been found possible to select a candidate possessing the necessary qualifications.  We have again the position that was found in 1938 with regard to the professor of sculpture and assistant-professor of sculpture and assistant-director of the school, that there is nobody in the country qualified for the post.  However, the matter lay there for a bit, and the people who had applied, against whose work in their respective schools there never had been the slightest complaint, had been told in a most comprehensive way that they were unsuitable. They were all kept on the qui vive with regard to the appointment.  Recently, it has been announced that a certain gentleman has been appointed acting director.  What that means I do not know.  I understand that the assistant-director resigned his post as assistant-director, but that may have been only for the purpose of the selection of director.  It may be that he is reappointed and has gone back.</P>
    <P>The position was that at a particular period there was neither a director nor assistant director, and there were two professorships vacant.  The person appointed, according to the statement <Col N="806" /> in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of mid-May, is an art inspector in the Technical Instruction Branch of the Department of Education. I am quite sure that he is a very distinguished person.  There are a number of statements made about him here: he is prominent amongst the younger Irish artists, with special distinction in water-colour painting; a constant exhibitor at the Royal Hibernian Academy; a fluent Irish speaker, who received his training in the Old Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, and who became an inspector of the Department in 1939; he has close contact with the working of the schools of art in Cork, Limerick and Waterford; and is closely associated with the National College of Art, of which he is an associate examiner. Every one of these qualifications could be bettered by some of the people who applied amongst the original 13 and who were told that they were unsuitable. It is invidious to mention names, but I can refer to the Professor of Painting in the National College of Art and the assistant professor.</P>
    <P>Let us take the professor of painting and go through the list of qualifications of the gentleman who has been appointed acting director.  He is a fluent Irish speaker; he has longer and better training both in the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and elsewhere; and in comparison with this gentleman, of whom it is said that he has close contact with the work in the schools of art in Cork, Limerick and Waterford, he has been in association with the Dublin school for many years, and at the moment is chief professor of painting therein.  The gentleman appointed is said to be closely associated with the work of the National College of Art.  I could imagine nobody more closely associated with that work than the professor of painting in the particular college.  This gentleman who has been appointed is an associate examiner, while the professor, of course, is an examiner.</P>
    <P>The situation is that, in 1938, we had to scour the world to get a Czechoslovak, a Dutchman and an Englishman to fill three important posts, <Col N="807" /> and then, when the director of this college died, and when we had applications made by the 13 best qualified people Ireland had, they were simply told peremptorily that they were unsuitable, with no statement given as to the points of qualification they lacked.  There are two or three who are pre-eminent in all the matters referred to here as the qualifications this young gentleman has, and they are all passed over.  They are invited to apply for examination, and the usual farce is gone through of taking entrance fees and subscriptions from them, and imposing travelling expenses on them, and then they are told they are not suitable.  No statement is made with regard to the deficiency of any one of them, and, when it has all lain there for about a year and a half, a young man who, as late as 1939, became an inspector in the art section of the Department, is put in.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that this is another example of the growing tendency to have people who are either civil servants, or very shortly removed from that position, put into these important positions, which certainly ought to be held for people who are more definitely professional in their outlook and their work than the civil servant can be.  I know nothing more than what is printed in this newspaper with regard to the person who has been given the appointment.  I take it from the phrase used&mdash;&ldquo;acting director&rdquo;&mdash;that it is something in the nature of a temporary appointment, but I should like to hear from the Minister what is the position and what is the situation now with regard to the assistant director.  Did he resign, and was it for the purpose of having himself considered amongst those applying for the directorship?  Has he since been reinstated in his post as assistant and what happened with regard to the two people who were in the section dealing with sculpture and who resigned at the start of the war?  What was the matter which led to the mass condemnation of the 12 or 13 people who had very definite technical qualifications, as well as Irish language and administrative <Col N="808" /> qualifications, and who were simply told that they were unsuitable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McGilligan knows that the only method of entry to the Civil Service, apart from promotion or secondment of an existing civil servant, is that a recommendation should be made by the Civil Service Commission.  No recommendation was made by the commission in this case and the only courses open to me were either to leave the post unfilled or to second a civil servant to fill it either temporarily or permanently.  There is no question of a permanent appointment at present. The appointment is temporary, and the gentleman in question is only seconded from the inspectorate of the Department of Education.  If, as a result of the working of the present arrangement, it is considered desirable at a later period to make the appointment a permanent one, the Department of Education will have to approach the Civil Service Commission for their endorsement of such a permanent transfer since it is not what is officially called a normal transfer on promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gentleman who has been appointed temporarily is, I think, the most suitable person available to me at the moment.  He is an inspector, and, although young, he has had a good deal of experience as a teacher and also in visiting the schools through the country.  I think that from the point of view of administration as well as actual qualifications in art, he is satisfactory, at any rate, for the temporary appointment which has been made.  I cannot say what the position is as regards the Civil Service Commission.  I am not responsible for them.  Had the Civil Service Commission recommended a person, I presume that I would have had no option &mdash;I understand that is the legal position&mdash;but to appoint that person.  As they recommended no person, I have no authority to appoint any of these other persons to the post.  It is entirely the statutory duty of the Civil Service Commission.  I do not know officially what the position may have been as regards the qualifications <Col N="809" /> of the individual candidates.  The fact is that no recommendation was made. The board, I think, was a very representative one and it cannot be argued that they did not know their work.  I think they were thoroughly familiar with it and probably took all aspects of the matter into consideration.  In any case, that is outside my province. I have considered it necessary, in the interests of the institution, to appoint a temporary director and an art inspector seems to be the most suitable and best qualified.  Although a young man, he is, I think, a man of promise.</P>

It would be of interest to the House to know them, when one realises that 13 candidates fell, at whatever hurdles were put up, as being unqualified, and that they included the headmasters of the Cork and Waterford Schools and people from the College of Art itself.  I understood that the qualifications insisted <Col N="810" /> upon were a knowledge of Irish, some proficiency in some craft and some administrative experience.

The Minister realises just who that gentleman is, and he knows his reputation in this country, the number of years he has served in the School or College of Art, and the qualifications he possesses.  I suggest that the fact that even that one person was considered unsuitable will lead, probably, to a great deal of bewilderment in the minds of people generally.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give continuing effect to the taxes and duties embodied in the Financial Resolutions which have been passed by Dáil Eireann following the Budget.  As Deputies are aware, the Resolutions have statutory effect for only a limited period under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  In fact, all or nearly all the important provisions of this Bill have either been the subject of Financial Resolutions or have been referred to in my Budget speech.  They have, therefore, been debated already at considerable length.  In the circumstances, it is hardly necessary for me to give a very detailed analysis of the Bill at this stage.  Should Deputies require elucidation of particular points they will have an opportunity of raising them on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I might, however, be permitted to refer again to one or two of the major issues that were discussed in the debates following the Budget.  As on previous similar occasions, amongst the matters within the province of the Minister for Finance to which prominence was given were the growing volume of Government expenditure and the question of borrowing to meet deficits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking first at the recent trend of Government expenditure.  I find that this subject is one of the war-horses mounted on every possible occasion by Deputies in certain parts of the House. Just as often as that matter was raised I have been at considerable pains to demonstrate the reasons for the expansion which for 1942-43 has reached a figure of £44,270,000.  I have even had <Col N="814" /> on occasion to remind Deputies that there is a war on and that, even though we are neutral, this country has been involved in financial outlay which may be directly traced to necessities arising out of the war-time conditions obtaining elsewhere.  I refer in particular to the large block of expenditure under the headings of military and civilian defensive measures, special employment schemes, supplies, damage to property and personal injuries, which run up to a total of something between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000.  Apart from these specific war-time additions to the tax burden there is also the general rise in prices and cost of living, which have, naturally, brought in their train an unavoidable increase in the cost of government.  Added to all that, expanding social services and the fact that the State services are mainly staffed by young people on rising incremental scales of pay have also helped to swell costs.</P>
    <P>Taxed on the one hand with squandermania, the Government has yet been reproached on the other with the alleged niggardliness of its provision for the relief of distress and for social services generally.  While it is true that only one new large-scale benefit has been introduced under this year's Budget, I would point out that the existing social services, many of them of most generous proportions, are being fully maintained and, in cases, expanded,</P>
    <P>Despite whatever may have been said to the contrary in this House, I am satisfied that the recent Budget, which refrained from imposing any additional taxation, evoked generally a lively sense of relief.  I do not presume to claim more for it than that, since the times are not such as would enable any Minister for Finance to introduce a Budget which could aspire to more positive signs of popular acclaim.  Criticism has, of course, been voiced in some quarters on the decision to resort to further borrowing, whereas in others the procedure has been welcomed. While I deprecate the circumstances in which borrowing seems to be the better part, I feel that if borrow we must the conditions of the present day are reasonably favourable <Col N="815" /> for the purpose.  We must admit that these are exceptional times in which it is necessary to follow exceptional courses if we are to keep the ship of State afloat.  Even economic purists would agree that conditions in which there is a general slowing down of the economic machine&mdash;conditions just such as we, for reasons outside our control, are experiencing at the moment&mdash;are those which justify an unbalanced Budget.  Furthermore, our credit is sound and money is cheap. Our position being thus I submit that borrowing will prove a lesser evil than that of adding further to the existing load of taxation.  It must be remembered, when all is said and done, that the deficit for which I have budgeted is roughly only 12 per cent. of the revenue I hope to receive, namely, £38,365,000, and that side by side with the new debt created from time to time the process of extinguishing old debt still goes on, though, of course, the pace of extinction is not so rapid.</P>
    <P>At all events, there is no gainsaying the fact that the deficit is there and since it cannot be liquidated by any magic known to me, the most that we can do is hope that, in the event, it will not prove to be of the dimensions now predicted.  Always assuming that revenue will come in on the basis estimated it is not beyond the realm of possibility that last year's experience of a diminished deficit will be repeated. Deputies will recall that last year after the various post-Budget adjustments which had to be made following tax concessions, we anticipated a deficit of approximately £4,542,000.  At the end of the year we found that the actual deficit had shrunk to the much more comfortable figure of £2,697,000.</P>
    <P>The financial reckoning which we have to meet is, as I have mentioned, of the order of £44,000,000, and I trust it will not be necessary to increase this sum appreciably by Supplementary Estimates in the course of the year. There has been criticism of the volume of Supplementaries introduced last year, and I may say that I yield to no one in my dislike of such additions, not least because of their upsetting effect upon my budgetary calculations. <Col N="816" /> It should be appreciated, however, that especially at present the requirements of government often change from day to day and the Minister for Finance, being a realist, cannot allow services to be starved merely in order to keep within the bounds of Estimates framed many months, perhaps, before the expenditure is incurred. Deputies may, however, rest assured that when preparing their Estimates the Departments concerned endeavour to include therein all the charges that can reasonably be foreseen at the time and for which provision may properly be made in accordance with the canons of Government finance.  Such Supplementaries as may prove unavoidable in a financial year receive in my Department the most careful scrutiny as to their necessity and amount before they are presented to Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>After these introductory general remarks, I now propose to deal briefly with the individual sections of the Bill: Section 1 (which corresponds to No. 1 of the Financial Resolutions passed on Budget day) is the customary &ldquo;charging&rdquo; provision for income-tax and surtax imposing those taxes for the current year and securing the continuance of relevant enactments. It will be observed, however, that as compared with other years, there is an amplification in the form of the section.  The necessity for this amplification arises from the reimposition of excess surtax which is to be charged for the year 1942-43 at the same rate as that for 1941-42.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (corresponding to Financial Resolution No. 2) is designed to combat a device whereby in certain trades which afford an opportunity for holding stocks for appreciation the trade is discontinued and the trading stock which has appreciated in value is disposed of in such a manner that the profits on appreciation escape the income-tax net.  Section 3 deals with the special case of a trader erecting buildings or installing new machinery to produce, by means of a process which in normal conditions would not be economic and, therefore, not feasible, a commodity at present&mdash; having regard to a shortage of supplies <Col N="817" /> arising out of the emergency&mdash; urgently needed in the country.  The effect of the section is to secure that, by special allowances year by year, the ultimate loss to the company when the particular use of the machinery or buildings ceases to be commercially profitable shall be set off against the tax liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a number. Section 4 introduces an allowance for deficiencies for excess surtax purposes based on the same broad principle as the proposed allowance for deficiencies, which will be referred to later, in the case of excess corporation profits tax. The effect of the &ldquo;deficiencies&rdquo; allowance will be that, when in due course the whole period of the charge to excess surtax can be surveyed, it will be found that, taking into account all variations of profits upwards and downwards as compared with the standard, an individual will not have paid &ldquo;excess&rdquo; tax on more than the net total excess of his profits for the whole period over the standard profits.</P>
      <P>Section 5 relates to a matter raised on the Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill when it was represented that, on the existing basis of assessment to income-tax, hardship may be involved in the treatment for tax purposes of a person in the early years after he has commenced to carry on a trade or profession.  The section affords relief by providing that, on the taxpayer's application, an adjustment may be made so that the aggregate of the assessments for the first three years shall not exceed the aggregate of the actual profits for those years.</P>
      <P>Section 6 introduces a similar relief in relation to the case of an individual first entering on an office or employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 extends the provisions of Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1941. The 1941 section provided that a net loss sustained in the standard period for excess surtax should, to a certain extent, be carried forward and set off against the profits in respect of which <Col N="818" /> the individual was chargeable with excess surtax.  The new section provides that any unexhausted balance of loss may be deducted from the profits of subsequent excess surtax years.</P>
    <P>As to Part II&mdash;Customs and Excise&mdash; Section 8 is intended to provide additional powers so as to prevent the improper use (<i>i.e.</i>, the use in motor vehicles) of oils such as paraffin in respect of which a rebate of duty has been granted.  The section also confers a concession on the owners of agricultural tractors by allowing them to use rebated hydrocarbon (heavy) oils in such tractors even though the tractors may be diverted to purposes other than agricultural.</P>
    <P>Part III&mdash;Death Duties&mdash;is concerned with certain reliefs from death duties which I mentioned in my Budget statement.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for a measure of relief in respect of the death duties chargeable on the property of persons who die from injuries caused here during the emergency by the armed forces of other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a natural continuation of the provision contained in the Finance Act, 1940, which, in effect, secured that the dependents of domiciled Irish people, who had been killed, should not be deprived of certain death duty reliefs granted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 11 puts right a trivial drafting error which crept into Section 26 of the 1940 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>As to Part IV&mdash;Corporation Profits Tax&mdash;Section 12 is the first of the provisions on the subject of corporation profits tax.  It deals with the particular case of a company which commenced to carry on its business more than one year, but less than two years, before the 31st August, 1939, and has not had a trade year ending in the year ended on that date&mdash;or, in other words, has not made up accounts covering a period of 12 months ending on a date in that year.  The section empowers the Revenue Commissioners, on the application of the company, to make an estimate of the company's pre-war profits for adoption as the standard profits.  Without such a provision <Col N="819" /> the company would have been thrown upon the minimum standard of £2,500 or the substituted standard.</P>
    <P>Section 13, broadly speaking, provides that where a company is formed to take over the business of a predecessor company the standard profits of the new company may be computed as if the succession had not occurred and the predecessor company had continued to carry on the business.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the allowance of a &ldquo;deficiency of profits&rdquo; for purposes of excess corporation profits tax and follows the Budget announcement. The effect of the allowance now proposed will be that, when the entire period of the charge to excess corporation profits tax can in due course be surveyed, the position will be found that, considering all variations of profits in the period (whether up or down) as compared with the standard, a company will not have paid excess corporation profits tax on more than the net total excess of its profits for the entire period over the standard profits.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is inserted to correct a small drafting flaw which occurred in connection with a Committee Stage amendment to Section 35 (1) (c) of last year's Act.</P>
    <P>Section 16 relates to the substituted standard.  Under Section 39 of last year's Finance Act the substituted standard was arrived at by adding up the amounts necessary to provide 6 per cent. on the company's paid-up ordinary capital and the fixed rate on the debentures and paid-up preference capital.  As announced in the Budget speech, an alternative basis of computing the substituted standard is now to be provided.  The alternative, as will be seen from sub-section (1) of the new Section 16, is based on the amount necessary to provide 7½ per cent. on all the company's paid-up issued capital (including debentures).  A special rate of 9 per cent., however, is provided for new companies, that is, companies formed on or after the 1st January, 1934.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious to Deputies that the alternative basis now provided will <Col N="820" /> be operative and will be of substantial benefit in the great majority of substituted standard cases.  There may, however, be odd cases in which the old basis would be better for the company than the new; for example, where a comparatively large proportion of a company's capital consists of 10 per cent. preference shares; and this is the reason why companies are being given a right of election between the former basis and the proposed new one.  This right of election gives rise to a difficulty since a private company, for instance, might issue in the future preference shares at an abnormally high rate of dividend and then, by opting for the &ldquo;old&rdquo; substituted standard, evade some or all of its due burden of &ldquo;excess&rdquo; tax.  Sub-section (2) of Section 16, which was foreshadowed by Financial Resolution No. 3, is directed against the possibility of such a device, and under it a company cannot be allowed a higher percentage in respect of capital issued after Budget day than 7½ per cent. in the case of an old company or 9 per cent. in the case of a new company.  Sub-section (2) is in addition framed to meet another device whereby in certain cases a company might after Budget day write up assets fictitiously and issue shares to the extent of such fictitious writing up.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is, in a sense, complementary to Section 16.  It amends Section 41 of last year's Act which, in the case of a company whose standard is computed by reference to actual profits, allows a deduction from the profits of the chargeable period in respect of fresh capital issued since the end of the standard period.  The amount of the deduction under Section 41 is 6 per cent. on the paid-up ordinary shares and the fixed rate on the paid-up preference shares (including debentures). An alternative basis of computing the deduction is now afforded for all the fresh capital issued and paid up at 7½ per cent. for old companies and 9 per cent. for new companies.  In view of the right of election a difficulty precisely similar to that already mentioned in connection with Section 16 arises.  Sub-section (2) of Section 17 (which was foreshadowed in the second paragraph of Financial Resolution <Col N="821" /> No. 3) is included to meet this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 18 corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 4 and is designed to ensure that, in the case of a director-controlled company, in computing the company's profits for a chargeable period a sum shall not be allowed in respect of the controlling director's remuneration greater than the sum which was allowed in respect of his remuneration in computing the profits of the standard period.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that, notwithstanding that assessments for accounting periods ended before the date of the passing of the Act may technically have become final and conclusive, such adjustments may be made as may be necessary to give effect to the retrospective relieving provisions in this part of this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Coming to Part V&mdash;Miscellaneous and General&mdash;Section 21, which was the subject of Financial Resolution No. 5, imposes a stamp duty of one pound on every banker's licence.</P>
    <P>Section 22 relates to trustee savings banks.  Its primary purpose is to clear up certain doubts which have arisen since Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1940, was enacted, e.g., as to the sale of depositors' existing investments in Government securities and the continued application of the former code of law governing these banks.  It extends to income from investments of the banks with the Minister for Finance the income-tax exemption which has applied, under the Income Tax Act, 1918, to their investments with the National Debt Commissioners.  The other provisions in the section are to facilitate administration.</P>
    <P>Section 23 makes the necessary provision for the transfer to the Exchequer from the Road Fund of the sum of £100,000 already taken into account in the Budget statement.</P>
    <P>Section 24 implements a Budget announcement by providing for the discontinuance of the making of assessments to the old excess profits duty.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is the customary &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Section 26 is the usual section relating to the short title, construction and commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I think I should refer now and that is to a discussion which took place with Deputy Mulcahy, in which Deputy Cosgrave also had an interest because he raised the matter first, as to the amount of yield of corporation profits tax for 1941-42.  Some confusion seems to have arisen with regard to the yield and I will endeavour to put the matter right.</P>
    <P>Reference to my Budget statement last year will show that I hoped to get from all the proposed changes in corporation profits tax an additional yield of £1,400,000.  On the other hand I explained that the extra shilling in the pound of income-tax, which I also imposed, would probably not yield me more than £300,000 (Official Reports, Vol. 83, col. 37).  As Deputies are aware, corporation profits tax is allowable as a deduction in computing profits for income-tax purposes.  If there had been no increases in corporation profits tax I could have expected that the extra shilling on the income-tax would have yielded about £780,000 in the year 1941-42.</P>
    <P>Thus it will be seen that under the original proposals, for the purpose of the Budget balance, there was a loss in income-tax amounting to £480,000 to be set off against the expected gain of £1,400,000 from the changes in corporation profits tax as originally proposed, leaving the net gain at £920,000.</P>
    <P>On the 10th June, 1941 (Official Reports, col. 1743, Vol. 83), when speaking of the financial effect of the concessions which were granted by me after the introduction of the Budget, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not possible at this moment to state with any degree of confidence what the financial effect will be of the proposed changes in corporation profits tax but it is clear that we cannot this year count on a considerable portion of the revenue of £1,400,000 which we had hoped to get. The yield next year from my new proposals should be substantial.  As <Col N="823" /> it is, I will probably have to add something in the neighbourhood of £500,000 to my borrowing figure in the current year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputies will observe, the £500,000 was given as a very rough indication of the extra amount which might have to be borrowed as a result of the concessions I made after the discussion.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussions which have taken place this year, Deputies Cosgrave and Mulcahy overlooked the fact that the concessions granted in respect of corporation profits tax meant an increase in the yield of income-tax.  After granting the concessions, certain increases in corporation profits tax remained and on the same day, 10th June, I said (column 1821, Vol 83, Official Reports): &ldquo;With the revised proposals the income-tax yield will be about £760,000.&rdquo;  In fact, it was rather more, but taking it at £760,000, if I now compare the estimates with the ascertained results by bringing the figures together, we get the following: original White Paper estimate corporation profits tax, £648,000; estimated gain from increase in corporation profits tax charges (as originally proposed), £1,400,000; original estimated gain from extra 1/- in the £ income-tax, £300,000, making a total of £2,348,000. The actual receipt from corporation profits tax including increase from higher flat rates and reduced margin for ordinary corporation profits tax and including receipt from excess corporation profits tax, £910,000; gain from extra 1/- in the £ income-tax, £760,000, making a total of £1,670,000. Net loss from corporation profits tax concessions, £678,000.</P>
    <P>I said last year that I estimated, roughly, that the concessions I gave would cost me at least £500,000.  That was a rough figure; I had not calculated it and I had not time to get my officials to calculate it.  I thought that was what it would cost, but the actual cost was £678,000.  I hope the figures I have given now will clear up the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is better to deal first with the matters that have <Col N="824" /> been raised by the Minister in the concluding portion of his speech.  On a previous occasion, when dealing with the Budget statement, the Minister was at a loss to know where I got certain figures.  I said that the Minister had got £600,000 less from tobacco than he had budgeted for.  I gave him the benefit of £50,000 in that connection.  I was speaking in multiples of £100,000. He asked where I got those figures.  I looked up the finance accounts published somewhere about the autumn and they gave a figure of £6,590,000, representing customs duties on tobacco. I added to that figure £1,870,000 which he imposed.  I overlooked the fact that the Minister had stated in his Budget speech that he had reduced the withdrawals from bond since February, 1941, to 1/65th of the annual clearances, as against the 1/52nd that had been the rule.  In other words, each week he allowed out four-fifths of the amount of tobacco which had been released in the previous year.  He went on to say that he got £670,000 more than he estimated.  As we are clearing up matters, the Minister will find that in column 2293 of the Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 86, No. 7, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Actually, the receipts were not my estimated £6,735,000 but £7,410,000.  The result was £670,000, approximately, better than I estimated&mdash;not £600,000 less.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His estimate of £6,735,000 was a lean estimate, having regard to the amount that he stated he was allowing to be withdrawn from bond.  If he allowed four-fifths of the previous year he would not have estimated on getting a quarter less than the previous year. He said it would be even more than a quarter.  However, I will take his own figure of £6,735,000.  He actually received £7,141,000.</P>

      <P>There is no necessity. I need never read figures.  I need only hear or see them and they satisfy me and I do not boast about the way I got my information or education in these matters.  It happens to be a facility.  The Minister would have it if <Col N="827" /> he took the same pains to understand them when they arise.  If we have settled that up, there is only one outstanding matter, one might say, in dispute between us.  The Minister was apparently in a very uncomfortable frame of mind on the last occasion and he said no companies got a concession in the payment of income-tax.  We know that.  It does not matter whether the companies get it or not if the individuals get it.  The shareholders in a company are the company.  You may call them by another name, but the company would not be there if it were not for the shareholders and the benefits flow to the shareholders of whatever legislation is passed here benefiting them.  No more than that was intended in my statement.  If the Minister thinks that I should have been so specific as to indicate individuals rather than companies, he is welcome to his mentality with regard to that matter. These are really minor details which, in the normal course, would call for more broad-minded treatment on the part of the Minister.  We leave him there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to spend £44,000,000 odd and apparently the Government is proud of it.  The question which concerns the country and this House is, is there value for it and what are the outstanding circumstances of our time? The most remarkable thing in the present circumstances of this country is, first of all, that we are reducing the numbers in employment; the cost of food has risen from 158, index of August, 1939, to 209, February, 1942. If you take in all items, it has risen from 173 to 237&mdash;a very steep rise, a rise that is very largely influenced by the policy of the Government.  In a neighbouring country, where taxation has risen almost to peak point, the increase in the cost of food items&mdash;I am speaking now from recollection&mdash;is 25 as against our 51.  If we boast about expansion in social services, must we not admit that there is necessity for them and that the necessity for them is, to some extent, traceable to whatever lack of planned economy we have in this country?  Surely, if there was one thing more than another which people were led to believe prior to the <Col N="828" /> Government taking office, it was that they had a plan and that they were going to deal with the situation, that there should be more people in employment, that there should be less taxation and that there should be great expansion in industrial and agricultural activity throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his Budget speech&mdash;and again to-day he seems to take some credit for it&mdash;that this is a time for borrowing; it is a suitable period for borrowing; money is cheap.  This is not the first year that we have had an unbalanced Budget. That is my principal cause of complaint &mdash;that this is not merely an epidemic; the disease has become endemic with the Government.  We are paying off some old debts.  If we are, we are paying them off with borrowed money and there is no indication as far as one can see, in any quarter, of any plan either for the present or for the future.  There are some indications of an early general election.  This Budget was described, when it was introduced, as one of them.  There is another evidence of that to be seen now on the roads around County Dublin.  People are employed on the roads whom one only sees employed at election times. That is my principal cause of complaint against this Government: it is always playing politics.  It is not concerned so much with the real vital needs of the day, of the moment or the future as it is with maintaining and keeping political control.  They have been very fairly treated by the people of this country and in this Parliament since the emergency arose.  Every co-operation that could be extended to them in a difficult time was extended and both the people and the Parliament are entitled to expect better service than they have got up to this.</P>
    <P>It is idle to tell us there is no means of saving out of that expenditure of £40,000,000&mdash;idle.  The Minister seems to be very annoyed when I suggest to him one particular item, that is, the Army.  Two years ago, the Government appeared to be suffering from a fit of nerves and every possible opportunity was availed of to instruct the people as to the dangers that were immediately besetting us.  Unless I am <Col N="829" /> mistaken, that was the most dangerous period since the emergency started.  I have got no evidence to the contrary.  If they were then doing their work, and I expect they were, the measures that they took to defend this country at that time were the maximum measures, involving the maximum expenditure, in respect of defence.  Now, expenditure on the Army has gone up 50 per cent.  Does not the Minister know, and does not every member of the Government know&mdash;or ought they not to know&mdash; that if these matters are left to soldiers, there is no limit&mdash;the sky is not even the limit now&mdash;to the expenditure that will be asked for in connection with defence?</P>
    <P>If we are to take the long view, without venturing into the realm of prophecy at all, examining only past experiences, we know there are always difficult times after wars.  It is said that this war is going to be an exception. We were told the same thing about the last war.  The last war was said to be a war that would result in the exaltation and security of small nations.  Was not that forgotten the moment the war was over?  Assuming that this is going to be different and that an extra effort will be made when this war is over to deal with pressing problems, we in this country at present have no plan for dealing with that matter.  We have to admit that the competition of our competitors&mdash; and they are at the ends of the earth&mdash; in respect of the goods we are going to export is exceedingly keen, and if we are to meet that competition in future and are to derive any benefit from our export trade, we should like to hear what other principal means there are of improving that trade, except by increasing the value and the volume of our exports and decreasing the costs entailed in securing that purpose.  If we approach the matter from that angle, obviously a £44,000,000 Budget, with a declining income, or, at best, a stationary or static income, is no inducement to our people to remain on the land.  The Ministry know quite well that, even in the pre-war period, the remuneration <Col N="830" /> available to persons on the land was not a sufficient attraction to keep them there, and if we are to maintain that population on the land and make any effort towards a development of our trade, an increase of our output and so on, there must be a better livelihood for those engaged in agriculture than they have had for the past ten years.  These are the matters which I think the Minister would be very well advised to take into account.</P>
    <P>On the larger question, the history of this country has been very much upset by the controversies and differences of the past 20 years.  We have at least this much in common&mdash;and it is not much&mdash;that we made a revolution, but have not brought about a commensurate improvement in conditions in the country when a magnificent dispensation of Providence gave it its freedom. That much at least can be said of the two Parties.  They were able to make a revolution, but so far as building up the country and making it a place for Irish men and women to live in is concerned, examining these two decades, we would venture to express the hope that the next two decades will be far better.  In conclusion, I say to the Minister that, so long as he has the frame of mind which he has, he is almost inviting expenditure.  It is his duty to see that there is economy in the State, and when considering the very heavy taxation at present in force, he must bear in mind that while he might have put on more taxes in his Budget this year, he would not get more money, that we have reached saturation point, and, in consequence, the House is entitled to expect from him a real contribution towards economy in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been your good fortune, Sir, during the last few weeks, occasionally to have been in the House for a few moments when we were discussing finance and money.  I think we did devote a few moments to that topic, and I gathered &mdash;and I am afraid that I sometimes backed up the Government in the line they were taking&mdash;that there was no useful work for which there was any lack of capital in this country.  I did not mean by that mainly Government <Col N="831" /> expenditure in the sense of expenditure on Government offices.  If we look through the Book of Estimates, we will find that that is one of the main directions in which money has been spent, but I had not that in mind.  There are a number of Departments the usefulness of which at the moment may be doubted.  Nobody can pretend that they are working to the satisfaction of the people.  The Minister for Supplies seems to have distinguished himself particularly in not foreseeing practically any of the problems he would have to face until the problems hit him in the face.  Then we had hurried, unconsidered action.  The only matter in which he acted promptly was in enforcing the principle that if anybody made a suggestion to his Department, it was the equivalent of high treason.  I understand that to suggest anything to the chief officials of the Department of Supplies as to what they should do called for condign and exemplary punishment and we had an example of that.  I refer now not to the six people on whose behalf and without whose authority representations were made, but to the man who made the representations. Merely because he approached a Government official and made a suggestion to him, he was punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the proper attitude for the Department to take up towards the public and it is the proper attitude for the public to understand that they are there to carry out the behests of the all-wise Departments.  It reminds me of the celebrated story told about another great nation in the east of Europe.  A short time after the Bolshevik revolution, a workman was hanging on at the risk of his life to the bar of an overcrowded tram, and when some people passed him in motor cars, he said: &ldquo;They are my servants; I am their master.&rdquo;  Much as we differ from that great Republic in other matters, that is an aspect of their outlook which we have absorbed to the fullest.  I am not criticising the great bulk of the officials of that Department, who are bound down by the instructions they get from on top, but we have a Ministry of Supplies which satisfies nobody, a Department of <Col N="832" /> Local Government which seems bent on making local government impossible and certainly non-existent, which suppresses councils which do their duty properly and leaves in existence some of the greatest scandals in the way of county councils.  I could well believe, when the present Minister for Finance was Minister for Local Government and Public Health, that there was one glaring instance where, as Minister for Local Government, he would yearn to suppress a certain county council in the south-west of Ireland, but as Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party, it was a thing that he would have to think gravely over before he would contemplate doing anything of that kind.  That is where the money goes&mdash;in Departments like these.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to a matter to which I have referred frequently here, especially in the last couple of years.  I have not protested so loudly against the amount of expenditure, but addressed my remarks rather more to whether we are getting value for the money.  Deputy Cosgrave also referred to the problems that are likely to face us after the war.  In view of the experience that we have had of the foresight of the Ministry&mdash; of the Government as a whole&mdash;in reference to war problems, I hesitate about asking the Minister to exercise foresight in regard to post-war problems. If the wisdom and foresight of the Government is exemplified, for instance, in the activities of the Minister for Supplies, then it might be rash to urge the Government to try to do a little forethinking in connection with problems after the war.  Yet they may be very serious.</P>
    <P>Take a matter that may become very pressing for this country.  Its economic position during the war, in some respects, may be not so threatening, but to what are we to look forward after the war?  What about agriculture? What is the prospect for agriculture? Have the Government as a whole given any serious consideration to the statement of two prominent members of the Government&mdash;if there is such a thing as prominent members of the Government&mdash;one, that the dairying industry was dead, and the other, <Col N="833" /> that the cattle industry was dead?  Are the Government satisfied merely with the enunciation of that extremely black and pessimistic doctrine by two of their Ministers, or are they taking any steps to deal with the situation that that is likely to produce?  Is there any evidence that they are doing anything of the kind?  I can see none.  Supposing, however, we are still in the position after the war of having largely to rely on agriculture, and surely that is inevitable&mdash;I am not now going into the particular form of agriculture; that certainly requires a great deal of consideration, and more, I am afraid, than it is likely to get, if we are to avoid being led away by shibboleths&mdash;what form is agriculture going to have in the future, or is it going to have any form?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that the land is not getting its proper re-conditioning material.  He will have the excuse, of course, that it is impossible to get that material in the proper time.  Very good; suppose, for argument's sake, we grant that excuse, the problem is still there.  Furthermore, I find one particular instance where it seems to me that some work could be done, because it depends on ourselves alone and not on the importation of any material, but it is a direction on which the Government have&mdash;I do not like to say deliberately&mdash;banged the door, and that is arterial drainage.  I find no evidence of any signs of life on the part of the Government as a body, or of any department of government, in that particular direction.  I am very familiar with the answer that I generally get from the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, that there are no economic schemes. Well, now, let us look upon this matter as a whole.  Let us take, not merely the schemes separately.  I should like the Government to examine the question in connection with the national economy as a whole.  A large number of people are leaving this country.</P>
    <P>Again, I am not going to use that now for the purpose of criticising the Government.  To my mind, the problem has become too grave for that sort of thing.  I am looking at the matter mainly from the point of view of the interest taken in the people that leave <Col N="834" /> the country.  I am afraid that very little interest is taken in the people who leave the country, especially in a certain direction.  Now, emigration is not a thing that can be remedied from morning till night.  But if young men are leaving the country because of the lack of work here, surely here is the place where work could be done.  Even supposing that by the mere balance sheet a particular piece of work could be described as uneconomic, would it not be better to go on with such work if it would keep a number of people in this country, and if it would help to save the contributions that we pay to a number of people for doing nothing at the present moment?</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to consider work of that kind in isolation from the general unemployment problem of the country. It will require a very big and a very heroic effort on the part of the Government to deal with that problem properly, but I have no evidence that they are even considering it.  We were told, and there may be one or two Deputies on the Minister's own benches who might say that we were told <i>ad nauseam,</i> that there was no useful project for which money could not be found.  Now, that is true, I believe, so far as a number of private industries are concerned, industries promoted and taken up by companies.  I think that if they have a reasonable prospect of success finance will be forthcoming. But here, in what could be real work, adding to the land of the country and making up, therefore, in some respect for the impoverishment of the land that must take place owing to the lack of sufficient manure&mdash;here is an opportunity for work on which money could be spent.  I believe that if you take all the circumstances into account, not merely the actual estimate of the increased value of the land as against the upkeep of the schemes afterwards, but other considerations as well, such as those I have mentioned, it is work which the Government should have been preparing years ago to carry out, and that they should not merely have reached the stage of &ldquo;considering the report.&rdquo;  That simply means that useful work has been postponed and land left unreclaimed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> If agriculture, in two at least of its main arms, is going to be paralysed&mdash; the dairying industry and the cattle industry&mdash;what are the Government doing?  Supposing that dismal prophecy is true, and supposing we accept it, what are the Government doing to compensate agriculture for that catastrophe&mdash;a real catastrophe.  I cannot find that there is any evidence that they are doing anything, and the main fault that I have had to find for the last couple of years has been that we are not getting value for the money we are spending.  To my mind, the actual amount of the money we are spending is secondary to that.  If I could feel, and feel honestly, that we are getting value, that the problems that are likely to face us will be faced, and faced with intelligence, foresight and the preparation of hard work on the part of those in authority, I confess that I should be easier in my mind than I am at the present moment, but often, it seems to me, money is spent in ways that are wasteful.  Money is refused where it could be really productive. Other countries, not as dependent as we are on agriculture, still find it a paying proposition to reclaim land, and yet here I am met continually with the reply and the excuse that the scheme is not economic, that there are hardly any economic drainage schemes left in the country.  I think that, actually, is the view of the Department that is responsible for arterial drainage.  I mean the genuine view.  I would ask the Government to look at the thing in a bigger way than that, and to consider the other economic effects that it may have in the way of absorbing the unemployed.  It does seem to the ordinary person a scandal to see thousands of acres of land flooded.  That causes a feeling that the Government are not doing their part in this particular matter.  I merely put that forward as one of the inducements that might be borne in mind by the Government.  Considering the condition of the country as a whole, it would, I think, pay to do work of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two minor matters that I want to deal with first. The intention of Section 8, I presume, <Col N="836" /> is to prevent the use of kerosene in motor vehicles.  It appears to me that the section is worded to exclude tractors which are constructed for use for agricultural purposes.  We talk a good deal about the development of agriculture, and I presume the Minister is sympathetic in giving facilities to agriculture with that end in view.  Under the law, these tractors can be used for the delivery of beet to the factories, because it comes under the term of agricultural produce. A problem, however, arises if a farmer uses a tractor for taking back pulp, which is a manufactured article, from the factory.  Because the pulp does not come under the term agricultural produce, the farmer is prohibited by law from using the tractor for taking the pulp to be used for the feeding of cattle to his farm since the farmer cannot use the duty free kerosene for that purpose.  I think it is unreasonable to adopt an attitude of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of doubt about it, and I would be glad if the Minister would clear it up.  The Minister is giving some concessions to recently established industries in this Bill.  There is another matter that affects agriculture, but no provision is being made in the Bill to meet it. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to it.  It is the necessity of preserving the fertility of the soil which, to my mind, is the greatest asset this country possesses. No matter what Government is in office <Col N="837" /> there should, I think, be a conservative policy as regards the preservation of that asset.  Everything possible should be done to increase the fertility of the soil, to hand it down to posterity in good condition.  It is unavoidable, during the present emergency, that we have to draw on the fertility that is in the soil, but it should be our policy to restore it as early as possible in the post-war period.  I understand that if a farmer is assessed for income-tax at the present time, and makes an application for concessions in the matter of providing capital to restore the fertility of the soil, it is not entertained by the Revenue authorities.  I would ask the Minister to look into that aspect of the case.  Surely it is only fair, if the State requires a man to draw excessively on his capital resources which in the farmer's case consist in the fertility of his soil, that his claim to put aside some capital to meet the cost of the restoration of that fertility ought to be allowed.  I understand that such claims have not, so far, been entertained with favour.  The Revenue authorities were not sympathetic towards such claims.  I hope the Minister will look into both these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers that an expenditure of over £44,000,000 for a little country with our resources is a huge one to ask the people to face at the present time.  The Minister, in his Budget statement, when speaking of the provision that he has to make for borrowing to a substantial extent, suggested that a good deal of that capital would have to be repaid by agriculture&mdash;our main industry.  It appears to me to be an extraordinary situation that while the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, appreciate that, no real effort is being made towards a reorganisation of the agricultural industry. It is true that over a very long period the output of our agriculture has remained static.  As compared with some other countries it has, in fact, receded to some extent.  Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that in the last two decades neither Administration had done very much to make the lot of this country any better or any happier.  Possibly they were faced with a great many difficulties.  But, at this <Col N="838" /> time, when the world is passing through the greatest crisis that it has ever experienced and when economists are warning the world of the problems that lie ahead for every country and the great difficulties that must be surmounted in a post-war period, I think there is all the more reason why we should get down to the problem of doing something by way of reorganising our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Probably at the end of this war we will find ourself in the position that many of the commodities that we exported pre-war are no longer there to be exported, because the raw materials necessary for the production of these articles were not available, and that several sources of production, from which we had a surplus to export, will no longer be in the position of having a surplus; that these commodities will not be there and that our income from these sources will be dried up.  If that is so, the cost of administration in a set of circumstances like that cannot possibly be met.  We will probably find ourselves in the position that many of the people who left this country to go across the water, attracted there by the high rates of wages, will be sent back to us.  We will also inevitably have to demobilise the Army to a great extent at that period.  The possibility is that our sources of income from our sterling assets, which we talked so much about during the last week, may be considerably reduced, because the rate of interest on these capital sterling investments may undergo a very considerable reduction.  With the probable reduction in our income, we cannot possibly hope to face a cost of administration of the magnitude or volume of the present figures.  The fact that the Minister got over his difficulty by borrowing, and that he found himself unable to balance his Budget because we had reached saturation point and it was impossible to tap any new source of income, is simply postponing the liability that must be faced in future. As the Minister said, most of that liability will have to be borne by the agricultural community.  As I say, no real attempt has been made to reorganise that industry.  It seems inconceivable when you see what other <Col N="839" /> countries, particularly our neighbour-country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy O'Sullivan drew attention to the fact that in a recent statement the Minister for Agriculture referred to the decline of the dairying industry.  As a matter of fact, we know that in the coming year it is quite possible we may find ourselves without sufficient butter.  We know what the position of the pig industry is.  Ten years ago we had an export trade of about 500,000 cwts. of bacon and 500,000 live pigs.  To-day the situation is that we have not sufficient bacon for our own requirements. So far as exports are concerned, the egg industry has diminished to a very substantial extent.  I am simply referring to these three matters to indicate the trend of agriculture at present and the necessity for giving immediate attention to its development and reorganisation.  If the burden that the Minister told us in his Budget statement would have to be thrown back on that important industry is to be borne, I think it is necessary that it should be reorganised and put in a position to bear some of the charges that the Minister suggests must be borne in future.</P>
      <P>Yesterday and to-day we were discussing education here.  We dealt with the provision of a very substantial sum for education.  While the discussion mainly centred around the teaching of Irish and the restoration of Irish as a living language, I do not think anything was said about agricultural education.  One of the handicaps we suffer from here is lack of education in that respect.  There is no doubt that our failure to expand agricultural production as compared with our competitors in the same market, such as the Scandinavian countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was merely pointing out that we were handicapped in so far as our competitors were undoubtedly educated.  They had a better technical knowledge of their work. That in itself was a great handicap so far as we were concerned.  The result was that we were unable to compete and they eventually captured our market to a very great extent.  I understand that at present there are discussions taking place with regard to the price of cattle and the type of beast that the British are prepared to take from us.  I suggest that this is the time when something should be done about getting a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  I am sure we are all most anxious to maintain our exports, but we can only maintain them if we get essential raw materials in return.  The most important thing that we require is artificial manure, particularly sulphate of ammonia.  This is the time when we should say that we can only maintain our exports, even in live stock, if some effort is made on the other side of the channel to release essential artificial manures, particularly sulphate of ammonia.  That is the one article which is not controlled on the other side, and that indicates that they have ample supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity afforded by this Finance Bill to draw attention to the very high cost of living in Dublin City.  The immediate result is a very low living standard for certain of our people. Large numbers of people have crossed the water because they can get there better wages than would be given them at home.  If it was not for the fact that they have crossed the water and got employment, I dread to think what would have happened had these people been left at home to depend upon the present Government to provide them with the means of living.  If it was not for the wages sent by these people to their relatives in this city and in other parts of Ireland, the standard of living, low as it is to-day, would be much lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Dublin, especially the working classes, have nothing to thank the present Government for, even though the Minister introduced a Budget, which, according to him, meant no increase in taxation.  Strange to say, while he brought in a Budget that meant no increased taxation, within a few days of its introduction a very essential commodity, butter, went up by 2d. in the pound.  Wages did not go up at the same time.  This week, although there is no increased tax on tea, the price to the working class people in Dublin has gone up from 3/4 to 4/- a pound and there has been no <Col N="843" /> increase in wages to meet the increased cost.  I think the time has arrived when the Government should pay a little more attention to the requirements of the people and to the hardships which they are tolerating.</P>
    <P>Deputies from various parts of the House have referred to the bread queues in Dublin, caused by what I believe is an unfair distribution of flour to the bakeries.  It is not due to any scarcity, because in some parts of the country they can get 100 per cent. of the bread supplies.  The position in Dublin is quite different, because the working class people there have to line up by the hundred in queues outside every bread shop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat reluctant to say anything on the Bill.  For the last eight or nine years I felt it was rather useless to say anything in this House on financial or economic matters.  I arrived at the conclusion, after this Government was in office for two years, that the members of it had apparently made up their minds that, having failed to break down the State with arms, having got control of administration they would endeavour to break it down economically.  The question arises now, have they succeeded in their attempt to break it economically where they had failed to do it with arms?</P>
      <P>This Budget has been described in this House as a bad Budget, as a good Budget, and as no Budget.  To be quite candid, I would agree with Deputy Dillon that it is not a Budget at all.  When a Minister has exhausted the entire taxable capacity of the country, he looks around and says, &ldquo;I wonder can I get money anywhere else to pay all these bills that I owe?&rdquo; Being in power, and being in control of the State, he can exercise authority to get the money from somewhere and he proceeds to borrow it.  If money was borrowed for a useful State purpose I would be the very first to approve. The policy of the Government has led up to the position that it has got to borrow, and it borrows, of course, on the pretext that abnormal circumstances obtain.  If that were true, I would approve of borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it has been stated here, and it has not been disproved, that it is useless in this emergency to increase the incidence of taxation because such an increase would not yield any greater revenue.  If it is true that we have reached that position&mdash;and I agree that we have&mdash;that again is subject to argument&mdash;the fact that the Minister, having a gap so wide as approximately £4,250,000, did not make any attempt to close that gap by taxation convinces those that argue that this country has reached saturation point with regard to taxation&mdash;what is the prospect for the future?  We are glibly told that we are borrowing now because there is an emergency.  The emergency that <Col N="846" /> exists to-day is nothing, in my view, compared with the emergency that will obtain in this country when the war is over.  If we have reached saturation point to-day&mdash;as it is clear we have&mdash; for causes that we need not proceed to analyse here, which lie in the Government of this country for the last ten years&mdash;what is going to happen in this country?  That is a question that perplexes me.  After ten years of reckless spending, a considerable part of which was directed to the contraction of production, we have reached saturation point.  What is going to happen in the post-war period?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, speaking on the Budget, asked what had posterity done to bring the liability that this Budget imposed upon them?  It should be clear to Deputy Cogan that posterity had not done anything; it is what we have done to posterity.  This evening Deputy Hughes said that a duty devolved upon us of handing to posterity in a better condition than we found it, our inheritance, that is, the land of this country.  What is the use of talking about posterity?  What do we owe to posterity?  Posterity will judge us in this matter.  By our reckless conduct we will leave to them a position that will be utterly intolerable.  The spectacle of the next 20 or 25 years in this country appals me.  After all the claptrap that one has heard for the last ten years about a new order and the necessity for a new order in the world, the new order that will obtain in this world when the gentlemen who are going to create it are finished with it, is a new order of misery, suffering and poverty.  What resources will we be able to leave to posterity to meet that condition of affairs?</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Cosgrave have been emphasising the necessity for doing something to increase the fertility of the land.  Under the conditions that we have&mdash;and they are, of course, very bad&mdash;the Government say they cannot do anything to improve the fertility of the land because they cannot get the means.  That does not affect the issue at all.  Should this war last for another three or four years, what is going to <Col N="847" /> happen to the population of this State, with regard to even the bare necessities of food?  What amount of wheat will be produced from the land of this country, say, three years hence, if no fertilisers are provided in the meantime? After that period&mdash;if peace is proclaimed in the world&mdash;what is going to be the position in this country? Then it will be a case of going back and starting to rebuild.  The land, which is the only resource of this country, will be completely exhausted.  That will be the state of affairs post-war, when this country will have to face the demobilisation of what is for us a huge army and the return from England of 100,000 to 150,000 men.  Has the Minister introduced this Budget quite indifferently to all these issues and their implications? I would be glad to get from him&mdash;of course I will not get it&mdash;a general survey of our present position and our capacity to meet the issues that will confront us.  We deserve to suffer for the sins we have committed, which have brought about the present conditions. It would be regrettable that the people that brought about such a condition of affairs did not reap the harvest. It generally happens that people who have sown in the wind reap the whirlwind.  Difficult as it may be, I hope that I will live to see the reaping of the whirlwind.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said here about agriculture, wheat, butter and bacon. The tragedy I see about these things is that year after year we are proceeding into a worse position with regard to them.  In the past few months there was a good deal of discussion here about black markets in oatmeal, tea and flour.  When people were talking about these things, did they know what they were talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister frankly to tell the House and the country&mdash;I believe in being perfectly frank, blunt and honest, because <Col N="848" /> I think it is a good thing&mdash;what is the revenue position.  Has it reached saturation point and was it out of sheer necessity that he decided to borrow this year?  I do not want any glib claptrap about the Government borrowing because it was cheap to borrow.  Every Finance Minister who will come after this Minister will have that same excuse to make.  No matter what the price is, it will still be cheap to borrow. I should also like to hear from him whether there is any organisation within the Government making provision for the position, when peace comes again, with regard to assimilating the men in the Army who will be demobilised and with regard to the return of all the young men who have gone to England, I take it, temporarily. There is no use in putting this matter on the long finger, because if the Minister remains for four or five years in his present office, and if he has to deal with this problem, it would be wiser for him to take stock of it now, to tell the country what it is and what its implications are and what plans he and the Government have for dealing with it when the occasion arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the excessive burden imposed on the tax payers in this year's Budget&mdash;the excessive burden of expenditure under which the country groans and which taxation is unable to meet&mdash;I should like to ask if the Minister has any plans for reducing that burden of expenditure. Has the Minister any plans for inquiring into the various headings under which expenditure is incurred in the various Government Departments, with a view to securing some reduction in the burden?  The citizens are becoming alarmed by the fact that every day new services are being added, new expenditure incurred and the number of officials in the employment of the State increased, while at the same time it is very difficult to observe any improvement in the administrative machinery, or any sign of increased efficiency.  In the debate on Education, it was pointed out that there has <Col N="849" /> been no improvement in the general educational standard.</P>
      <P>So far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned, there is nobody who would dare to suggest that there has been any improvement, even during the past 20 years, in the condition of the agricultural industry. What return are the taxpayers getting for their money which is being put into the alleged development of agriculture? The dairying industry has declined and pig production has declined.  Almost every branch of the industry has declined, and it is only the present emergency which has brought about a temporary increase in the area under tillage.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to know whether the Government have any plan, even now, after so many years experience and with their experience of the present emergency, for the future of agriculture. So far as we can ascertain, they have no plan.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his famous speech in Cork University, which was the only occasion on which he attempted to outline the future of agriculture, seemed to express the conviction that agriculture has no future, that it must continue to decline, that production must continue to decline and that the number of people permanently engaged in the industry must be reduced, if there is to be any improvement in the standard of living of those people.  I think that is the most alarming feature of governmental policy at present.  If the community are to bear the excessive and ever-increasing cost of administration, there must be some plan to improve the productive capacity of the people.  There must be some plan to add to the volume of production, so that the nation will be able to continue to exist and to support its present population. So far, there is no indication of any such plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out that the number of people permanently employed in agriculture is altogether below the number required in order to get the last ounce of productivity from the land and in order to ensure that the land will be worked to the best possible advantage.  Yet, we have the <Col N="850" /> fact that the Minister responsible for agriculture can hold out no hope of the provision of increased employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>What has the Government to show after ten years of extravagant and expensive administration?  So far as I can see, the only visible improvement in our social and economic conditions is to be found in the cities and large towns, where a number of people have been provided with better housing accommodation.  For that, the Government deserve some credit which I am prepared freely to give them, but has the economic condition of even the people in these large towns been improved?  Have they been put in a position to pay the rents of the new houses with which they have been provided? So far as I can ascertain, they have not, and they are to-day facing even a more serious condition of poverty than they had to face in the past.  While a large percentage of them have better housing accommodation, they are faced with the fact that they are unable to pay for that housing accommodation and with the prospect that they may have to go back to the conditions from which they were rescued.  This is mainly due to the fact that the cost of living has been allowed to increase enormously through failure of another Department of the Government, the Department of Supplies, to ensure equitable distribution of existing supplies and cheaper distribution of such supplies.  Inequitable distribution has led, as it always does lead, to profiteering, black marketing, and all the other types of racketeering which inflict excessive burdens upon the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Some people, in the past ten years, have got rich; some people, in the past two years, have got very rich as a result of the failure of the Government to plan the provision and distribution of supplies to the poorer sections of the community.  That is the position in our cities and large towns. In the country, the position is even worse.  There, we have at least the foundation of prosperity in the fact that we have a very considerable area of undeveloped land, land that would be suitable for improvement, reclamation <Col N="851" /> and drainage, but nothing whatever has been done, in spite of all the money which is being spent by our Government, to improve the condition of the soil in rural Ireland.  In the past, we were inclined to denounce, and freely denounce, the old landlord class who ruled our rural areas.  We got rid of them.  Some of them were bad, but some of them were not so bad and, in clearing out that class, we destroyed a section of it who contributed far more to the development of the land than we have been able to contribute under our own democratic administration.  In every part of the country we see drainage schemes, which were carried out by landlords, being allowed to deteriorate.</P>

I have touched on the question that our rural areas are entirely underpopulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say that, I am referring, not to the congested districts in the West, <Col N="852" /> but to the main portion of the area of our State.  I believe that until there is a proper economic plan, which will provide for such a development in agriculture as will enable us to increase enormously the number of people permanently employed in production in agriculture, apart altogether from development schemes, there is no future whatever for this country.  Such a scheme cannot be planned in a day.  It cannot be planned by one Minister.  It must be planned by the Government as a whole, and it must be planned, mainly, by the Minister for Finance who, in the last analysis, is the man who will have to provide the money.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to say to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Supplies: &ldquo;I am not satisfied with the volume of agricultural production in this country; I believe that the present volume of production is inadequate to provide for the maintenance of the present population of the country; I believe that something must be done to develop agriculture&rdquo;&mdash;if the Minister for Finance were prepared to say that, and prepared to say that any worth-while plan for the development of agriculture would receive his moral and financial support, we would be making some progress.  The Minister, as I pointed out, has been responsible, both in his present capacity as Minister for Finance and in his former capacity as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, for a very considerable improvement in the housing of our people in our towns and cities and, to a limited extent, in rural Ireland.  I say, to a limited extent, because, as far as housing has been provided in rural Ireland, it has only been for the working classes.  I believe that there is a much bigger housing problem, awaiting solution in rural Ireland, in the housing of our farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention to discuss any particular Department of the Government in detail.  I am simply suggesting, first of all, that the entire sum which the people of this country are called upon to contribute to the Exchequer, must be reduced, and very drastically reduced, and that there is scope for such reduction.  I am not, however, one of those who hold that while the number of people in the employment of the State should be reduced, no provision should be made for the employment of such people.  I believe that it is necessary to reduce the number of people employed in various Departments of the State where the numbers have been allowed to increase to too great an extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was trying to point out that, in reducing the number of officials in the <Col N="854" /> State, some means should be found of providing them with alternative employment. The only way it could be provided would be by the State taking steps to reorganise, develop and promote other industries, as well as undertaking such public works of development as are urgently called for at present.  Such a plan would enable the Government to cut down drastically the personnel of many Departments without at the same time throwing the people concerned out of employment. I know, of course, the Minister will say that all Departments of State are understaffed.  That is the usual answer we get.  The extraordinary thing is that year after year the number of people entering State employment continues to grow, while the services rendered to the community do not show any sign of a visible increase.  In view of that, something very drastic will require to be done to keep expenditure at a level which the people can bear. In addition, something very far-reaching will require to be done to raise the volume of production, because it is out of the goods that our people produce&mdash;the people who work &mdash;that all services, national and local, must be financed.  For that reason, the future of agriculture must be so planned as to provide the necessary increase in production.  I hold definitely that it is in the home market we will find the widest scope for the permanent increase in agricultural production which is so urgently needed.  When the emergency passes, all the foodstuffs of every kind which we have been accustomed to import should be so restricted as to guarantee the entire home market for produce of our own agriculturists. We should guarantee that, not for one year, or for two years, but should make the market an unchangeable one, at reasonably secure prices, for everything which the farmer produces, particularly tillage produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of attempting to answer a number of the questions that were put to me on details of administration or on the detailed working of different Departments of State.  As Minister for Finance, I have a certain <Col N="855" /> knowledge of the administration of agriculture as I have of the administration of a number of other Departments. I do not know what amount Deputy Cogan knows about agriculture. If one were to judge by the number of speeches we hear from him on the subject he must be the greatest agricultural expert in the House.  I have listened to his speeches with interest, but what I have remarked about them is that it is always the same old tune.  I wish he would vary it a bit.  It would add a little to the interest of the people who listen to him and might get him a bigger audience.  But it is always the same tune&mdash;the tune that &ldquo;the ould cow died of.&rdquo;  That is what we hear from him day after day, in season and out of season.  I do not say that there is not something in what he says.  Perhaps he knows a little more about agriculture than I do, but what I do say is that he cannot possibly be right in all his propositions.  In practice, what he says is that there should be only one market here&mdash;the home market&mdash;and that it should be capable of consuming all our agricultural products. Take cattle production, for one thing, I do not see how that could happen.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have more opportunities for talking on agriculture.  He can talk on it every day the House meets, this week and next week, if we meet next week.  I am sure we will be all very glad to hear what he has to say.  I do suggest to him that he should speak a little more carefully.  Perhaps on occasions we all make statements we would not make if we thought a little more carefully.  If we did that, we might be a little more precise in our language.  I think, in regard to some of the statements the Deputy made to-night, that he would like to change them when he comes to read them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that very few of those who took part in the debate on <Col N="856" /> the Finance Bill to-day, or on the Budget on the 6th May, devoted themselves completely to the subject of the Budget.  Instead, they devoted themselves to a greater extent to what was not in it.  They did that when they could not find anything in the Budget or in the Finance Bill to condemn or criticise.  They talked about a plan for the next generation, and asked &ldquo;what are we going to do for posterity?&rdquo; Deputy Cogan varied that a little by asking &ldquo;what did posterity do for us?&rdquo;  That, to a large extent, was the attitude of a number of speakers in this debate.  Even Deputy O'Sullivan fell into it in, shall I call it, his criticism of the Finance Bill.  He and several other speakers asked what was our plan, and all because they could find so little to condemn in the Finance Bill of this year or in the Budget statement of the 6th May. Individual members of all Parties&mdash; they were not speaking for their Parties, of course&mdash;have said to me, every one of them, that they were delighted with the Budget.</P>
    <P>It was a pleasant surprise for them. I have heard that from innumerable people everywhere I have been in the last few weeks.  &ldquo;A damn good Budget,&rdquo;&ldquo;An excellent Budget,&rdquo;&ldquo;Never expected it to be half as good,&rdquo; were the comments I heard.  Deputies know as well as I do that that is a true comment, including Deputy McMenamin.  If I had added considerably to taxation, they would not have been a bit surprised. They all expected it; there is not a Deputy who did not expect it.</P>

The unusual thing was that I succeeded in doing my duty and in pleasing the vast bulk of the people and the majority of Deputies, whatever they may have said for debating purposes here.  These are the facts as I know them.  I am glad that the matter raised by Deputy Mulcahy, and which was originated by Deputy Cosgrave in criticising my figures, seems to <Col N="857" /> have been cleared up to the satisfaction of Deputy Cosgrave.  The figures I gave are official figures, accurate figures, and they cannot be gainsaid. Deputy Cosgrave said the Government are spending £44,000,000 of money and are proud of it.  I do not know that I can truthfully say we are proud of it. I do not hesitate to say, and I have said it since I became Minister for Finance, that we are bearing a very heavy burden of taxation in this country.  I do not want anybody in this House or the country to be without knowing the extent of the burden we are bearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope everybody knows it.  I know it better than anybody, because I have the job of &ldquo;raising the wind.&rdquo;  I should like that to be borne in mind by every Deputy, particularly Deputies on the Opposition Benches, who charge us with squandermania and extravagant expenditure.  Deputy O'Sullivan, after re-echoing the criticism of Deputy Cosgrave about extravagant expenditure, went on to ask why we are not implementing the recommendations of the Drainage Commission.  If we do put these into operation, as I think they should be put into operation as soon as we can do it, that job will be entirely uneconomic.  The estimate of the commission is £7,000,000, but it will probably be £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 before it is finished.  The Deputy spends a lot of his time criticising us for extravagant expenditure and then he wanted to know why we do not spend £7,000,000 or £10,000,000 more.  That is inconsistent.  Deputy O'Sullivan is not the only one, because Deputy Cogan was on the same racket. &ldquo;Look at the conditions in the rural areas,&rdquo; he said.  I know that in County Wicklow many of the small farmers' houses are in a bad condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have spent a huge amount of money in providing good houses for the urban and rural population. The County Wicklow has done particularly well in providing houses with the active assistance of the board <Col N="858" /> of health.  There is no other county, with the possible exception of County Wexford, which has done as well in regard to housing in the rural areas as County Wicklow.  Magnificent work has been done there in regard to housing. The provision of houses has cost a considerable sum and will cost a lot of money for the next 25 or 30 years. But the Deputy, while talking about our extravagance and the big bill we have to meet, wants us to do twice as much, and even then he would not be satisfied as long as there was an insanitary house in Wicklow or anywhere else.  You cannot have it both ways.  I should like to see every insanitary house wiped out in town and country, and every insanitary school for that matter, and there are plenty of these to be wiped out yet.  But Rome was not built in a day and, with all the goodwill in the world and even if we had all the finance, we cannot get the materials to do these things now. Therefore, house building is almost stopped and the rate of building schools has very much reduced much to my regret and the regret of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says that we are proud of spending £44,000,000.  If there is anything we are proud of, it is that kind of constructive work we have done for the benefit of this generation and the generation to come.  We do not apologise for that. Housing has cost a lot of money both to the taxpayers and the ratepayers, and I should like every taxpayer and every ratepayer to know how much it cost in his own county.  I should like that to be brought home to them and that they should look around and see if they are not getting good value for that money.  If this Government are proud of anything which they have achieved, they are proud of the revolution they are responsible for in regard to the housing of the community up and down the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave talked about employment going down and the steep rise in the cost of living for which the Government are responsible.  I cannot object to that criticism because it is true.  Employment has gone down <Col N="859" /> considerably and there would be greater numbers on the unemployed list, as several Deputies reminded us, were it not for the number of people who emigrated.  But Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Cogan and others at any rate should be fair and say that employment has gone down, numbers of people have emigrated, and the cost of living has gone up, but there is a war on.  I think it was Deputy Cogan said that the country had little to thank the Government for and Deputy Byrne echoed these sentiments.  If there is one thing that the people know they have to thank the Government for it is keeping the country at peace.  I wonder if there is anybody who would like to see that condition changed even at the cost of greater employment.  If conditions were otherwise, we might have every man, woman and child employed at very high wages, as they are elsewhere.  I do not know whether Deputy Byrne or Deputy Cogan or Deputy Cosgrave would be better pleased with a change of that kind.  I say that they should be fair in their criticism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also complained about the scarcity of tea.  Thanks be to God, there is still some tea in the country, and, even though they have to pay for it&mdash;and some of them pay pretty highly for it&mdash;there is tea for most of the people&mdash;almost all.  If conditions were otherwise, if we had not the active, intelligent and far-seeing Minister for Supplies that we have, even the quantity of tea that is available might not be available.  The same thing applies to butter.  The quantity of flour and bread on sale is certainly not what everybody would like to see, but bread and flour are available.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to get me off the track.  He wants me to indicate what we have not got, what we are to do for the next generation, what we are to do for posterity.  The Government are responsible to the people of to-day, to the people of the past ten or 11 years who elected them, to the people who will elect us whenever the next general election takes place.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned a general election, and said it was suggested that this Budget was a general election Budget.  So far as I am concerned, there was no such intention on my part, nor on the Government's part &mdash;and that is the whole truth.</P>
      <P>I do not know anything more about this general election than anybody else here.  I take it a general election will be due next year, and it looks to me, speaking as an individual member of the Dáil, that this is not a desirable time for a general election. I am not giving out Government policy now, because I have not discussed it with anybody.  I merely want to answer Deputy Cosgrave's remark about this being a general election Budget.  It is no such thing.  I did not think of a general election when I was framing that Budget.  I had in mind that we would probably have another Budget to produce before a general election.  That is the whole truth.  So far as I am concerned, the question of an election did not arise in my mind in the preparation of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said, and I hope I am not misrepresenting him, that perhaps there was something in the idea of a general election when one saw around County Dublin working on the roads men who are employed only at election times.  I have not had time to inquire about that, but I asked <Col N="861" /> Deputy Seán Brady, a member of the Dublin County Council and of other boards, to find out for me from the responsible officials whether there was any truth in the statement that there were unusual numbers of men working on the roads in North County Dublin and I am told, from the horse's mouth, so to speak, from the best authority I can get, that there is no truth in that statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says that the Government are responsible for the steep rise in the cost of living.  Even if he were on these benches, with the Government of which he was the Head, at a time of war like the present, the mighty financial magician could not have kept the cost of living from rising. He talks of the increasing cost of social services being due to the lack of planned economy.  Indeed it is not.  It is due, again, to events and things over which we have no control, things that are outside the purview of this or any other Government in this country.  If the emergency continues, and if the unfortunate condition of affairs which induces a spread of unemployment continues, the cost of social services will go up and up and the cost of living may go up and up, too.  The Government will have to try to meet it and we will see then whether there is any truth in the statement, that I believe there is no foundation for at all, that we have reached saturation point in taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave wanted to see a decrease in the cost of the Army. God knows, so would I.  I would be very happy if I could see the cost of the Army reduced by 50 per cent., or down to what it was before the emergency started.  It was then less than £2,000,000 and now it is £9,000,000. Suppose we could take £7,000,000 off the Army Vote, what could we not do with that £7,000,000, or with even £3,000,000 or £4,000,000?  We could do a lot in the way of housing, in which Deputy Cogan and others are interested, and a lot in the way of the social services that so many people are interested in.  Nothing would please me better than to be satisfied that the period of danger was over and that we could reduce the size of the Army and, therefore, its cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> When Deputy Cosgrave first made reference to the period of danger having passed, I could find nowhere any foundation for that statement.  I have made inquiries since that statement was made some weeks ago by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;he repeated it in a milder form this evening&mdash;and I wondered on what information he bases his opinion. Perhaps he is in more intimate touch than I am with big affairs and big Governments and people who might have an influence or an interest in these matters.  At any rate, any information that is available to me as a citizen or as a member of the Government does not bear out Deputy Cosgrave's statement that the period of danger for us has passed.  There is no truth in it, I believe, and no foundation for it.  I would be very happy to think that Deputy Cosgrave was right and not I, and that we could save some millions of pounds on military expenditure.</P>
    <P>From certain points of view there is no more wasteful way of spending money than on an army.  From some points of view at present it is a good thing, when unemployment is so rife, that a man can be taken into the Army or into the Construction Corps, where he will be well fed, well housed and looked after properly.  That is all to the good, but it is not productive employment, and that is what I would like to see our millions spent upon.  If we had not that Army well equipped and manned by men who knew their job and were determined to carry out their duties, the history of the past two or three years in this country might have been different, and we have to bear that in mind.  We have to bear the cost of the Army, and it is a heavy cost, a big burden, and, even at the expense of repeating myself, I will say that I wish to God we could stop it or stop a lot of it and so be able to use the money for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>Aside from the Army cost, there is at least £2,000,000, or maybe £3,000,000, put upon us as additional expenditure by reason of the emergency.  I am sure if we went into all the Estimates we could, at a modest figure, take £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 as representing emergency expenditure.  If we could take that off £44,000,000, it would <Col N="863" /> bring our total figure nearer what I thought we ought to be spending here for the services we are getting, and nearer what the taxpayers ought to be asked to bear.  But, whatever is necessary in order to keep war away from our shores, in order to keep this country at peace, to keep it as well defended as we can have it defended, is, I think, well worth the money.  I think, if the case were put to the people of the country, whatever the cost, they would be prepared to bear it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the Estimate for expenditure on the Army ought to be examined and scrutinised meticulously and criticised from every point of view, because soldiers are usually young men and not the most careful people in the world about money.  Anything a soldier wants he usually thinks he must get and somebody else has to count the cost.  I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that every item that goes into the make-up of that £9,000,000 that is spent on the Army is fought over, argued over, wrangled over and discussed with the Army people and the Department of Finance to an extent that, perhaps, he ought to know something about.  It was as bad and worse at one period when Deputy Cosgrave was in office.  We have the same wrangles, that he must have some knowledge of in days gone by, going on all the time to try to keep Army expenditure within what we regard as reasonable limits.  The Army people say that we are the damnedest lot of screws and hard-hearted people that they could come across.  I know there are many things that should be done for the soldiers.  Deputies on all sides of the House must have heard complaints about the allowances to married soldiers, the allowances for men going on leave, the allowances to officers. Some of these allowances are very modest.  If we were to do anything in the nature of increasing allowances for these soldiers, their wives and children and for the officers, their wives and their children, comparable with what is done in other Armies elsewhere, it is not £9,000,000 we would be asking for, but it might be very considerably more. <Col N="864" /> I often wonder if some of those who criticise the Minister for Finance for his extravagant expenditure were in my place and listened to the tales of hardship that I have to listen to, not only from the Army, but from the Civil Service and other places, where people are struggling hard to live on small pittances, what they would do.  I am not by nature a hard-hearted person.  I am not, but, as Minister for Finance, I have to try to be hard-hearted and hard-faced when I think of what I may be up against when I come to the Dáil. If some of those men who criticise most volubly and most severely were in my place, we might have a very much bigger bill and Deputy Hickey would probably say: &ldquo;And quite right too.&rdquo; But maybe Deputy Hickey, if he were in my place&mdash;I know he is not hard-hearted by nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We did set up a commission years ago, and it will probably give Deputy O'Sullivan some little satisfaction to know that not only did the Government adopt in principle the recommendations of the Arterial Drainage Commission, but they had a Bill drafted some months ago.  That Bill is going the rounds of the Departments for Departmental examination and criticism.  There are snags in it, and it is very difficult to reconcile the views of the different interests.</P>

      <P>I need not say any more.  Deputy O'Sullivan says that it seems to be the view of the Government that there is no economic drainage scheme left in the country. Economic drainage schemes of a very small kind and land reclamation schemes have been carried out every week of the year in the last few years as a result of large sums of money being provided by this Government. They are provided in this Finance Bill as well as in others of recent years for farm improvements.  We spent some hundreds of thousands of pounds &mdash;not a small sum of money&mdash;and it is improving the land, improving the position of the individual farmers who get the grants.  The Department of Agriculture or the Department of Finance are not niggardly in sanctioning these grants.  A great number of schemes has already been completed. Good work is being done.  We are providing in this Finance Bill for more money for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any more I need say.  I know, as I have said, that taxation is heavy.  I would like to repeat <Col N="866" /> that I have nothing to hide in that direction and I do not want anybody to suggest that we are doing anything to cover up what we are spending. I do not agree with the suggestion by Deputy Cosgrave that we are proud of it.  We are proud, certainly, and we have reason to be proud, of certain items in that expenditure for which we were responsible.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing.  Deputy Hughes mentioned the question of the fertility of the soil.  He was very interested in that.  So were other Deputies.  He wanted to know what allowance was being made for the fact that the soil fertility was now being used up and how the farmers who pay income-tax were going to be recompensed for that.  First of all, there are very few farmers who pay income-tax. I do not know what the percentage of farmers who pay income-tax is, but it is very small.  However they manage to escape the net, they do escape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know some who I think ought to be paying, who are not paying.  I know some who, if they were shopkeepers in the town or manufacturers, would be paying. There are only two or three I have in mind.  They are not paying, because they are farmers.  We are making certain allowances in industries for machinery that is bought specially for emergency purposes for the manufacture of things that cannot be provided except by allowing special expenditure during the war.  The income-tax people have authority to take that capital expenditure on machinery for special emergency purposes into account, and expenses incurred by the agricultural community to restore the fertility of their soil, when the date comes to expend money on fertilisers and so on, will come into the calculation, provided they pay income-tax.</P>
