      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the basis on which preferences or extra credits for knowledge of Irish are awarded in competitions for appointments to be made on the recommendations of the Local Appointments Commissioners to situations under local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis on which these preferences or extra credits are awarded is the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are certain posts&mdash;e.g., county librarian, chief executive officer of a vocational education committee, school attendance officer&mdash;for which a very good knowledge of Irish is regarded as an essential qualification.  Persons selected for appointment to these posts must therefore be competent to discharge all their duties efficiently through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>In competitions for all other posts a preference or extra credit is given to suitable qualified candidates who have a good knowledge of Irish, the extent of the preference varying according to the category of the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for example, the post is one the duties of which are to be performed in a Gaeltacht area, or one the holder of which may have to deal with persons from a Gaeltacht area, then the regulations governing the competition as an invariable practice are so worded as to ensure that a candidate who has not a good knowledge of Irish will not be <Col N="426" /> selected for appointment unless it is found that no suitable qualified candidate with such a knowledge is available. If it is necessary to appoint a candidate who is not competent to discharge the duties of the post efficiently through the medium of Irish the person appointed is required to obtain the requisite knowledge of Irish within a specified period.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the post, though not in the Gaeltacht, is one (e.g., school medical officer) the duties of which are to be performed in relation to school children, the commissioners' regulations are so worded as to ensure that a candidate who is not competent to perform all these duties efficiently through the medium of Irish will not be selected for appointment unless it is found that no suitable qualified candidate who is so competent is available.  The regulations provide further in such cases that substantial extra credit is given to any candidates whose knowledge of Irish is sufficiently good to enable them to reach a competent standard in a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>For the filling of other offices which do not affect the Gaeltacht, the regulations are so worded as to provide for the grant of extra credit, but not in the nature of an absolute preference, to candidates who possess a good knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that before a candidate is granted any preference or special credit in respect of his knowledge of Irish, he must first satisfy the commissioners that he is fully qualified and suitable in all other respects for appointment to the post which he is seeking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, is not the plain fact this: that when a Fianna Fáil candidate for a public appointment has made an exhaustive study of the Irish language, then the advantage accruing from a knowledge of that language is substantial; but if a non-Fianna Fáil candidate has an adequate knowledge of Irish and a Fianna Fáil candidate has not, then the advantage is not so substantial?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that in the Irish-speaking districts there are a large number of people: nurses, doctors, rate collectors and others who were appointed to their positions subject to the understanding that they would get a competent knowledge of Irish; that they have been in their posts for eight, nine and ten years and are still not certified to have a competent knowledge of Irish, and that no steps appear to have been taken to see that these posts are filled by people who do know Irish?</P>

      <P>That is a matter that has frequently engaged the attention of the Government.  There are difficulties in connection with it, and, if the Deputy would like to have a full answer, I suggest that he should address a question to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>The sum of £26,620 mentioned by the Deputy is the estimated net cost of management of the Local Loans Fund in 1941-42 after deducting receipts by way of penal interest, etc., as provided for in Section 18 of the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935.  As indicated in a note on page 13 of the current year's Estimates volume, the amount is made up as follows, namely, Exchequer and Audit Office, £100; Department of Finance, £750; Office of Public Works, £22,000; Law Charges (Finance solicitor), £1,770, and Land Commission, £2,000.  The money will be paid out of the fund into the Exchequer in 1942-43, via the appropriate Votes.</P>
      <P>The services covered by this expenditure comprise the financing and general administration of the fund, the examination of loan proposals, including the legal work involved; the making of advances, the collection of repayments and the preparation and-audit of the annual accounts.</P>

      <P>Complaints have been made that persons in different districts of Dublin have been unable to get their normal supplies of bread and such complaints have been investigated.  I am satisfied that there is no shortage of bread supplies in the poorer areas of Dublin, especially in the bakers' shops.  In fact, the amount of bread which is at present being distributed in Dublin is giving me serious cause for concern as it is far in excess of the proportion of the stocks available to meet the country's requirements until the next harvest.</P>

      <P>It can happen, of course, that the supply in an individual shop will run out, and the Deputy will understand that in present circumstances there must be a curtailment of bread consumption by everybody.  Nobody can get the full quantity of bread they may desire to obtain.  In the bakers' shops, however, there is a full supply of bread to meet the demands of the customers registered at those shops, but frequently people who are not registered at those shops endeavour to obtain bread there, and these people are on occasions refused supplies and told to go to the trader who normally supplies them.  But, in the bakers' shops of Dublin, as a whole, the quantity of bread is quite considerable.  In fact, it is so considerable as to indicate that the persons supplied by those shops are getting more than their due supply.</P>

Officers of my Department have carried out a number of investigations with a view to ascertaining the reason for such queues and I am satisfied from their reports that it is not a shortage of bread.  Ample supplies of bread are made available to meet the reasonable requirements of the customers registered for supplies at these bakers' shops.  In some cases people forming queues appear to have apprehensions that they may be unable to obtain, supplies if they delay making purchases but, generally speaking, the main cause of the queues is the desire of customers to obtain freshly baked bread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the limited quantity of wheat available, it has been found necessary to reduce the quantity of flour to be produced by millers to 80 per cent. of their deliveries in 1940. Traders in a number of areas will not, as a rule, receive this proportion for distribution to consumers, as provision has to be made to meet requirements in cases of emergency, and to meet special claims in certain areas.  I am aware that in certain areas in North Mayo numbers of consumers who formerly purchased their requirements of flour from travelling shops are now unable to obtain their supplies from these sources, inasmuch as these shops have either ceased visiting these areas or have curtailed their visits.  Arrangements have, however, been made to allow the local shopkeepers extra supplies to meet the increased demands made on them.  An investigation is being made into the question of the distribution of flour in West Galway. and, pending its completion, arrangements have been made to provide extra supplies of flour for this area.</P>

      <P>But how is that done?  It cannot be done in the manner we know so well here in Dublin where a man goes round with a placard on his back and another in front.  What steps have been taken to acquaint the people of these arrangements?  There has been a considerable amount of correspondence in connection with this matter from the West.  I do not know whether the Minister has seen a letter from the Belmullet area written by the chairman of the parish council. There has been a whole series of complaints that the people are not getting anything like sufficient supplies and that the 80 per cent. basis of distribution is not fair in their case because they had other sources of supply which have now been stopped and in consequence they are at a great disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply in Belmullet.  In the case of Belmullet, there has been difficulty of distribution due mainly to the curtailment of the activities of travelling shops. That has been rectified.  There is another problem in Belmullet due to the scarcity of potatoes.  There is no scarcity of potatoes in the country as a whole, but there appears to be in that area.  There will be a permanent problem in the Belmullet area owing to difficulty of transport.  As the Deputy is aware, it was necessary for the Government in former years to subsidise a shipping service to that area because there was practically no other means of transport.  That service was stopped some years ago because the development of road transport made it unnecessary.  The problem of transport in the area is again having active attention.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is yet in a position to indicate when it is proposed to pay the reconstruction grant to Mrs. E. Kelly, Claregate Street, Kildare, in respect of the reconstruction of her house which was authorised by an inspector from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is not an isolated one.  There are several others and it has been necessary to investigate them fully so that the legislation required will be comprehensive.  These investigations have taken somewhat longer than was thought, but I hope to make a definite announcement in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This case was brought to the notice of the Minister on 29th October last, when, after an authorisation to carry out reconstruction work, the Department refused to pay the reconstruction grant to this woman.  The  matter  was  again brought to the notice of the Parliamentary <Col N="455" /> Secretary on 4th February when he intimated that he hoped to be in a position to make a definite statement on the matter at the end of March.  This is the middle of April and this poor woman has got herself into difficulties, arising out of the authorisation she got from the Department to proceed with the reconstruction work.  Would he now say that this woman may assume that this grant will be paid to her so that she can meet the liabilities in which she has been involved as a result of the Department's authorisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give such an assurance, because, in order to deal with this case, it will be necessary to introduce legislation, and in order to ensure that cases of a like nature may be covered by the legislation, it is necessary to make a fairly full investigation. If the Dáil passes the legislation, when introduced, the woman, if she proves her case, will, I hope, be able to secure the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by saying &ldquo;if she proves her case&rdquo;?  Does the Minister not realise that it is a most outrageous thing for his Department to authorise this woman to commit herself to an expenditure of £40 and for the Department then to repudiate the inspector's recommendation?  Surely the Minister will do something to meet such a situation which involves the honesty and the administration of his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter, I am doing everything possible to rectify this situation.  The difficulty arises out of the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts reported that the grant in a case was made <i>ultra vires</i> the Act.  There is no idea of repudiating any commitment into which the Department entered, but the Minister and the Department are bound by the law as it stands at the moment, and in order that this commitment may be fulfilled and honoured, it is necessary to amend the law.  The drafting of the legislation in this regard has to take its turn and we have to <Col N="456" /> be sure that the legislation will be effective for its purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that the portion of the report relating to sugar was not suppressed by the Censor.  It was passed for publication and was suppressed by the newspaper concerned.  The portion relating to bread queues was forbidden publication in accordance with the powers of the censorship conferred by Section 2, sub-section 2 (i) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and the Emergency Powers No. 151 Order (1942) made thereunder.  The reason for prohibiting publication of this part of the report was that it is considered necessary at the present time to do everything possible to prevent the development of a panic mentality in relation to the supply of bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the last part of the Deputy's question, the full report as submitted to the censorship was sent to the Department of Supplies, and <Col N="462" /> as the object of the report was to urge the Minister for Supplies to inquire into the causes of bread queues with their attendant hardships for the people, that purpose was fully met by passing it directly to the Department of Supplies, while at the same time ensuring, as far as possible, that there would be no added cause of public panic which would render more difficult the most equitable distribution of bread which it is possible to achieve in the present difficult supply position.</P>

      <P>I think that what the Deputy intends to suggest is the <i>amendment</i>, rather than the <i>repeal</i>, of the Acts in question. The effect of a repeal would simply be to remove all restrictions, on the activities of moneylenders and to leave borrowers without any special protection in their dealings with moneylenders.  The most recent Act, the Moneylenders Act, 1933, may, I think, be taken as representing the opinion of the Oireachtas as to the extent to which statutory restrictions are likely to be effective or useful in the matter, but if the Deputy has any definite suggestions to make I shall be glad to consider them.</P>

He was not transferred to the Reserve; (4) Sergeant Fegan's total service in the Army, therefore, amounts to 19 years 72 days to date; (5) His character, as <Col N="470" /> last assessed, was very good; (6) He is at present in receipt of pay at the rate of 5/- per diem.  Marriage allowance at the same rate is also paid; (7) No financial provision can be made for him until his discharge; (8) and (9); In view of (7) they do not arise.</P>

      <P>I am aware that difficulties are being experienced by holders of wireless sets operated by batteries. Payment of the licence fee is, however, a statutory obligation in all cases in which wireless apparatus is held, whether workable or not.  I would urge all holders of wireless sets which are not workable to arrange to store them for the present.  I am considering whether the circumstances are such as to justify an amendment of the relative legislation, although this would, I fear, lead to serious loss of broadcasting revenue as well as to administrative difficulties.  The problem is not an easy one to solve, but I can assure the Deputy that it is under very careful consideration and I am open to consider suggestions as to how the difficulties can be overcome.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that when it was made a statutory obligation on a person who had a wireless apparatus to hold a licence fee, batteries were available for the possessors of such apparatus, but they are not now available?  I suggest it is nothing short of a racket to continue to demand a fee from persons who cannot get batteries for their wireless sets.  Will the Minister not consider remitting the licence fee in any case in which it is certified by a member of the Gárda Síochána that the wireless set cannot be operated by reason of the absence of the battery?

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="An Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, since the Dáil last met we have lost Mr. T.P. Dowdall, the senior representative from Cork City.  During the decade of his membership of this House he endeared himself to all of us. With his buoyant, generous personality, it was indeed impossible that it should be otherwise.  He spoke rarely, and intervened in debate only when he was moved to do so by the desire to urge policies which he was convinced were for the general well-being, but which seemed to him to be neglected or not to have their importance fully appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was, as members know, an enthusiast on afforestation and on monetary reform.  In the Central Bank Bill he was particularly interested and, despite his doctor's orders, he came here to speak on the Second Reading. It was only with the greatest difficulty that I dissuaded him from doing so, urging him to wait for the Committee Stage, when by way of amendment he could deal with more specifically, and argue more concretely, the points with which he was concerned.  I had hoped that when that stage was reached his health would have improved and that <Col N="476" /> he would be better fitted for the effort involved.</P>
    <P>By the death of Deputy Dowdall we have lost a great-hearted and noble Irishman who loved his fellowman with true Christian charity and, in the spirit of that charity, was unfailing in his assistance to every needy one who sought his aid.  His death is felt as a personal loss by each one of us, as it is by the thousands of the citizens of his native city of Cork with whom he was brought into contact by his manifold good works.

      <P>In connection with No. 9, the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Bill, I understand that a deputation from the Irish Trade Union Congress interviewed the Minister on the subject of an amendment to this Bill, and I have before me a letter from the secretary of the congress in which he states that in order to give the deputation an opportunity of considering an amendment to the Bill the Minister said that he was willing to postpone the Committee Stage of the Bill for about a fortnight, if requested to do so by any Party in the Dáil.  I 'phoned the Minister's office yesterday to ascertain if he was prepared to concede the request that was then made, but was informed that he was not prepared to concede it.  In view of the reported promise of the Minister to the deputation, will he now consider the question of postponing the Committee Staged?</P>

      <P>The members of the Labour Party have had three weeks in which to prepare amendments to the Bill.  It is quite true that if I had received the request in good time I would have been prepared, to consider it, but I did not receive it, and I think it is unreasonable to ask for a postponement of the Committee Stage on the eve of its being taken. The position is that if it is not taken to-day it may not be taken for a considerable period, because of the business already arranged for the Dáil. I think it should be taken to-day and, in all the circumstances, I do not think there is anything unreasonable in taking it to-day.</P>

      <P>My interest was in connection with amendments by the people concerned.  They made no request to me or to the Labour Party, but took the course, of having an interview with the Minister, and I understand that the Minister then undertook to consider amendments to the Bill and intimated that he was prepared to agree to a postponement of the Committee Stage.  It was only yesterday that the congress intimated to me their desire for a postponement of the Committee Stage, and within ten minutes of that intimation I got in touch with the Minister's office and was then informed that the Minister would not agree to a postponement.</P>

      <P>It is at least a fortnight since I met representatives of the Trade Union Congress.  It is quite true that I told them that I would consider any amendments submitted, but I did not receive the impression that the amendments could not be prepared in time.  If there had been any intimation to me that a postponement was desired on the ground that an amendment could not be prepared in time, I would have agreed to a postponement, but having received no such intimation up to yesterday I decided to take the Committee Stage to-day.  There are two main Estimates on the Order Paper for which I am responsible and, apart from that, the other Dáil business would prevent this Bill being taken, perhaps, even in this session, if it is not taken to-day. Next week, there will be the Central Bank Bill and, following that, there will be the Budget and other financial business.  I think Deputies should facilitate the taking of the Committee Stage to-day, and amendments can be submitted for the Report Stage or in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill was prepared in happier circumstances and to meet the situation existing in other times; but as it was ready for circulation and as I did not think it would take much <Col N="482" /> time, I thought it desirable to bring it before the House.  Some time ago, in order to consider the means by which building societies could be helped to make a bigger contribution towards the financing of house purchase, the Department of Local Government held discussions with the representatives of the banks and of the building societies, and as a result of those discussions provision was made in the Housing Act of 1941 to enable the banks to give financial accommodation to the building societies in approved cases, where the local authority is prepared to guarantee repayment.  One of the purposes of the present Bill is to put those societies in a position to avail, as far as possible, of the guarantee facilities open to them under Section 3 of the Housing Act of 1941.</P>
      <P>The Bill also widens the limits within which societies may borrow money.  It is provided in the existing law that the total amount received on deposit or loan by a society and not repaid may not at any time exceed two-thirds of the amount for the time being secured to the society by mortgages from its members.  It is proposed in this Bill to raise the ratio from two-thirds to three-fourths and to exclude from the operation of the limits so imposed any loans that may be received by the societies under guarantees provided for in the Housing Act of 1941.</P>
      <P>The only other point with which the Bill deals is that of collateral security. In determining the amount of any advance which a society might make to a borrower, the society in some cases takes into account any satisfactory additional security as well as freehold or leasehold security offered.  There can be no objection to this practice, and to remove any doubt which may exist as to its legality it is desirable to put it into legislative form, and it is proposed to do this in Section 3 of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, it is inconceivable that the Minister should take the line that there has been no delay, considering that the general assumption was that there would be a superannuation scheme.  It was a public service and it was inevitable that there would be a pensions scheme.  It is introduced now, 15 years afterwards, and there is some responsibility between the Department and the board for the delay in introducing it, particularly if it is expected that the employees would make a contribution towards it.  In that case, it does appear to me that this question of the contributory part of it&mdash;so far as the Department is concerned&mdash;up to this period, is a responsibility that cannot be evaded by the Department or the board, and they should reconsider that aspect of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, statements were made in answer to amendments put down by Deputy T. J. O'Connell on the Committee Stage of the 1927 Bill.  In answer to the Deputy, who pressed me on the point, I said we could reinsert in sub-section (2) of Section 7 the words previously there and which had been taken out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid by the board to its officers and servants out of the funds at its disposal under this Act such remuneration and allowances as the board shall determine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the words which are now in. I said we could then make it an instruction to the first board that they shall not establish a pensions scheme to come into operation earlier than five years after the date of their appointment.  There was no promise of the introduction of a scheme, as there was no belief that the scheme had to be introduced by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> It was acknowledged and was then thought to be a fact that the board had power to introduce a scheme without any further legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also thought at that time that the estimates of the financial results of the board's working were much better than were justified, and it was only after years of working of the board that a position of stability was reached in the board's financial accounts.  It was only when it appeared to me that not only was the board's organisation stabilised but that its financial prospects had definitely improved to the point that would justify the incurring of additional expense of this nonproductive character, that I agreed to the introduction of legislation to permit of the payment of pensions to the staffs.</P>
      <P>It may be that this Bill was not unduly pressed.  It was decided upon before the outbreak of the European war, but the pressure of events following the outbreak of war naturally meant that action on this Bill was less speedy than otherwise would have been the case.  Certainly, no circumstances have arisen from which it could be argued that there was any moral obligation imposed on the taxpayer to contribute.</P>

      <P>From beginning to end, the taxpayer will not pay one shilling for pensions under this scheme brought in by the board The electricity consumers may pay, but I do not know what the Minister means by talking about optimism as regards the board's working.  There never was a board which had to start under such conditions&mdash;which did not allow for optimism at all.  The Minister aided the pessimists; the whole thing was <Col N="487" /> going to collapse.  As far as he could, he tried to make it collapse.  There was no question of payments out.  In five or ten years after the board was established would there be any great draw on the fund for pensions?  Certain moneys piled up for the later payment of pensions but, at present, there would not be any great drain on that fund in the way of paying out money.</P>

    <P>(1)  Where a member of the board required by the Principal Act or the terms of his appointment to devote the whole of his time to his duties as such member ceases, after not less than ten years continuous whole-time membership of the board, to be a member of the board by expiration of his term of office without reappointment or by resignation during his term of office either after he has attained the age of sixty years or on account of ill-health before attaining that age, it shall be lawful for the board to grant to such member a pension for life of an amount per annum calculated at the rate of one forty-eighth of the yearly salary of such member for every completed year of the period of his continuous whole-time <Col N="488" /> membership of the board ending on the date of such cesser, but subject to a maximum of twenty forty-eights of such yearly salary.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person to whom a pension is granted under sub-section (1) of this section dies at such time after the casser of his membership of the board that the amount of such pension for the period from the date of such cesser to the date of his death is less than his yearly salary as a member of the board, it shall be lawful for the board to grant and pay to the personal representative of such person a gratuity of an amount equal to the sum by which the said amount of such pension for the said period falls short of the said yearly salary.</P>

    <P>(b)  the expiration of the term of office of a member of the board followed by his reappointment (whether actually made before, on, or after such expiration) to membership of the board for a term beginning on the date, or the day after the date, of such expiration shall not constitute a break in the continuity of his membership of the board.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 raises a different point.  I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 2, line 40, to delete the word &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 relates to the conditions under which pensions will be paid and amendment No. 4 relates to <Col N="489" /> the period which will be counted for pensions.  As far as the section itself goes, it means that a person would not qualify as a whole-time member of the board for anything in the nature of a pension until he had given ten years' continuous whole-time membership.  The other point is, what years of service will be taken into account?  I am moving to take out ten years' &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; service, and to take it that a man qualifies for a pension when he has put in ten years' service.  I mentioned on the Second Reading that there is a special point in this in regard to one whole-time member who is at present serving, but whose term of office was interrupted for one or one-and-a-half years.  That person has to start now from the date of the second appointment. I suggest that that is not proper.  When the break was made, it was abnormal, and the fact of his reappointment shows that it was considered that his services were useful to the board.  Apart from that, I think the Bill should not be drafted round an individual.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is no equity in having in the Bill ten years' continuous membership.  The situation is that there was no fixed scheme for the personnel of the Electricity Supply Board.  A board might be set up that might appeal to a certain Minister, who might want to have on it a man with a certain business outlook or with certain experience, but another Minister might require to have someone on the technical side appointed to whole-time membership.  A man who was appointed to whole-time membership might not be reappointed because another Minister had a different viewpoint as to how the board should be constituted.  If that Minister or a colleague made a change, a man who had served five years could be relegated to the technical staff or relegated to part-time membership.</P>
    <P>I suggest that where changes are brought about, not by lack of ability or lack of attention to duties, it is rather hard on a man to be subject to varying whims, seeing that it is only after passing the qualifying test he could put in a term of office amounting <Col N="490" /> to ten years' continuous membership. It is better to get away from that.  The particular situation is well known to Deputies.  As a matter of principle, I suggest that if a man has ten years' service as a member, whether it is continuous or whether there is a break, that that should be taken as a period qualifying for a pension.  If that is not the situation there might be difficulty in getting people to serve on the board.  Again, we should not think of present people. Some Minister hereafter will have to look for a managing director and whole-time personnel.  It will not be always the case that men put on the board will be found suitable.  If a Minister hereafter has to approach an elderly person to serve on the board, and if that person sees that he must have two terms of office, one running after the other, before he can qualify for pension, that may affect a Minister in his choice of personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the member of the present board who is personally affected by the form of the section, I do not think there is any case at all.  I refer to the member of the board whose appointment to the board was terminated but who was appointed again after a lapse of 18 months or some such period.  When his first appointment was terminated he received a lump sum of £2,000 as compensation, by way of gratuity, for the termination of his appointment. If we are now going to provide pensions for retired members, of the Electricity Supply Board we must take into account any such payments made previously in respect of a break in service in the past.  This matter is complicated by the fact that there is an individual affected by the wording of the section as it stands.  If we try to consider the question, not in relation to a particular individual, but in relation to the general position, I think it will be agreed that the provision made in the section is reasonable in all the circumstances.  Members of the Electricity Supply Board are not badly paid; they are well paid.  To make provision for pensions on retiring after a certain period of service is, in effect, to provide an increase in <Col N="491" /> their salaries.  It is, perhaps, questionable whether certain members of the present board or those who may come up for appointment to membership of the board in future could, or could not, earn in any other capacity higher salaries than they are now receiving. If we keep these salaries on the present scale I have not the slightest doubt we will be able to attract to the board personnel suitable to the requirements of the office.  If we consider it justifiable to make provision for pensions in certain circumstances it is because those who may become members of the board and who remain members for a long period will lose commercial contacts which, otherwise, would, on retirement, procure fresh employment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have acted upon the assumption that nobody is likely to be appointed a member of the board except a person fairly advanced in years.  That is, a person who has already made good in some technical or administrative post in some commercial organisation or in the public service, a person who, after a period of ten years' continuous service, would be of such an age and in such a position that suitable employment would not be likely to be available for him if he should then cease to be a member of the board.  I think that it is reasonable to require that there should be a period of ten years' continuous service.  I admit that there is a slight possibility that some individual may serve a nine-year term, may then have a break of a few years, be reappointed and serve another period of nine years, then ceasing to be a member of the board without being eligible for a pension.  If I were to agree to modification of this section in any way, it would be only to the extent of allowing aggregation of service where each period of service was protracted. That would not meet the case to which reference has been made, nor do I think that we should attempt to deal with any past case.  Any modification of the section so as to permit of aggregation of service should apply only to future members of the board or, at least, should exclude from consideration past service, prior to a break, in respect of the termination of <Col N="492" /> which compensation by way of a gratuity has been already given.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that it is not unreasonable to require ten years' continuous service to qualify for a pension.  Having regard to the provision made in respect of other public offices, what the justice of the case requires and taking into consideration the rate of remuneration paid to members of the board, I should be very slow to amend this section at all.  I intimated on Second Reading that some consideration might be given to the question of modifying the section.  I do not say that I have come to any conclusion on this matter or that I have secured the assent of my colleagues.  But, if there is to be any amendment, the farthest I should be prepared to go, assuming the Government would be prepared to amend the section, would be to recommend that aggregation of service would be permitted only if each period of service before and after the break was not less than five years and the total period of service was in excess of ten years.  In such cases, I should think it fair to take into account whether, in respect of the termination of any previous service, compensation in the way of gratuity had been paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any change in this section will be welcome.  There are a couple of points which I should like to put to the Minister.  He spoke as if the salary of the members were fixed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The salary is changeable at the end of the term of office.  He spoke as if a five-year period were assured to every member of the board, whereas the Act provides for a period &ldquo;not exceeding five years&rdquo;.  Some other Government may take the view, on appointments falling due, that they will appoint I members for three years at £1,000 a year.  If this provision stands, the Minister will then have the situation that a person who has served three times will have to serve one further period before he will get ten years' continuity.  I thought the Minister's view with regard to salaries had changed from what it was when he was speaking from these benches.  I thought he had learned that money has not the value he set upon it when <Col N="493" /> he was in opposition, and that he would have brought that viewpoint to bear on this matter.  The salary of the ordinary member of the board is about £1,700; the chairman gets more.  A person who qualifies by having ten years' service will get about £35 in respect of each year.  He will, therefore, have a pension of about £350. That man, who has given ten years' service, will have been appointed fairly late in life.  He will have lost his business contacts and does the Minister think that a person with commercial contacts will give ten years at £1,700 a year to this service and, at the end of that period, receive a pension of £350?  That is a lesser view of the commercial possibilities and prospects in this country than I thought the Minister would have.</P>
      <P>The Minister weakens his argument by insisting so much on the position of the member of the board of whom we have spoken.  He says that he got a gratuity of £2,000.  How many more persons, on leaving office, are going to get £2,000?  If they do not get £2,000, the whole strength of the Minister's case in respect of this man is gone. They will go out at the end of five years with nothing.  Take the case of a man who is appointed for five years at £1,500 a year and who is dropped at the end of five years.  The Minister finds, for instance, that he requires a technical man on the board and he gets a technical man.  Another Minister, when the appointment falls due, may think that there are too many technical men on the board.  He may want a commercial man.  He puts on a commercial man and he &ldquo;drops&rdquo; the technical man, who has given good service for five years and in respect of whom there has been no complaint. He has not qualified for a pension and he gets nothing.  Some time later, he is invited back to the board.  He serves for five years and he is &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; once more.  Still he is not eligible for a pension.  I think that that is a hardship.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 2, to delete all words from the words &ldquo;either after&rdquo; in line 43 to the words &ldquo;that age&rdquo; in line 44, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualification for pension depends, so far as this section is concerned, not merely on a ten-year period of service but on two alternatives&mdash;that the man must be &ldquo;dropped&rdquo;, so to speak, or, alternatively, that he has resigned after he has attained 60 years of age or on account of ill-health before attaining that age.  Suppose a person is tempted into some other service, does the Minister want to penalise that type of person?  Suppose a member is a very eminent man, that he has given good service to the board and that some other organisation&mdash;for instance, a public utility organisation under Government control&mdash;comes along and asks him to take a position under that organisation.  If he leaves the service of the board simply <Col N="495" /> because he wants to better himself, the Minister will not allow him to qualify for a pension at all.</P>

      <P>If there is any purpose at all in having a pensions scheme for the members of the board, it is to retain, for the service of the board, persons who are worth retaining: to give them that additional advantage from remaining in the service of the board for a period of not less than ten years, or until they are 60 years of age, in order to qualify for a pension.  If we were to allow a person who had reached the position where he could obtain the maximum pension under this provision to retire without consulting the convenience of the Government, or the welfare of the organisation at all, I think we would be acting in an unduly liberal way.  We do say that if he reaches the age of 60, then he may retire, or if he is in bad health he may retire, but if he is in good health, and under 60 years of age, we certainly think he should retire only in circumstances in which he knows that his retirement will involve the loss of his pension rights.</P>

      <P>The pivotal words in this are: &ldquo;it shall be lawful for the board&rdquo;.  It is not being made obligatory on the board.  If the phrases proposed to be deleted are removed, it does not mean that the board must grant a pension.  We only remove an obstacle in their path.  There are two smaller points&mdash;ill-health and the 60 years.  I do not think ill-health is wide enough to cover the case of a man who, say, meets with a disable <Col N="496" /> ment.  Suppose he is knocked down. That person may be described by a doctor as being in good health, but yet he is disabled.  I do not think &ldquo;ill-health&rdquo; would cover a case of that kind.</P>
      <P>As regards the other point, take the case of a man whose office is abolished. Suppose the Minister in charge indicates tliat he is going to drop a man who has a seat on the board.  He has to go elsewhere while his term of office is still running.  He may want to retire voluntarily.  Why should not an obligation be put on the board to consider his case and pay him if the circumstances seem to warrant it?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 2, line 48, to delete the word &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This applies after getting over the qualifying period for continuous service, and it deals with the years that are reckonable for pension purposes. Again, it is only continuous service that counts.  A man will get over the first part of the clause because he will have done ten years' service.  In that time he will, in fact, have done thirteen odd years in the service of the board. Nevertheless, when he comes to reckon his years for pensionable purposes he has to knock off the three earlier years which were, perhaps, the three most difficult in the whole period of his service.  Take the case of a person who had gone on to the board, dropped off and came back again.  He served, say, ten years in the second period.  He had ten years of continuity.  He previously served for five, dropped another five, and then had ten years' service.  Only the ten, however, will be reckoned for pension purposes.  I think there is a great hardship there because, in fact, that person had in all 15 years' service with the board.  I think, once a man has got over the regulation fence of ten years' continuous service, that all his years of service under the board should reckon for pension purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of pension in the scheme was arrived at by way of a compromise between the different conflicting views held by the board, by myself and by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance must necessarily enter into the picture because he is concerned with the provision made for public servants, and any precedent established in organisations such as this will naturally react upon the public service.  The basis, however, proposed here of 1/48th salary for each year of service is, in fact, 25 per cent. higher than the normal Civil Service scales.  It was agreed that the basis of calculation should be 25 per cent. higher than in the case of the Civil Service because of the fact that the age of entry into the board's service is likely to be late as compared with the age for entry into the public service, as well as by the imposition of this maximum of 20/48ths which is less than half salary.  I do not think that, in all the circumstances, it is an unfair provision <Col N="499" /> to make, having regard to the standards that we must preserve, standards already in practice in respect of senior civil servants and of officers in commercial organisations of a somewhat similar character.  It may be that, in some cases, very heavy pensions are being paid.  I do not think that the organisations paying them have escaped criticism.  In a matter of this kind where the Government is responsible for the legislation, where, the organisation is so intimately associated with the Government, and where there has been a deliberate attempt to associate scales of salaries, methods of recruitment and of remuneration to the practice of the Civil Service, I do not think that we should leave out of account at all, what is the position of civil servants in respect to pension.</P>
      <P>We have agreed to operate upon a 25 per cent. higher basis, that is, 1/48th of salary for each year of pension, because of the fact that the maximum will be 20/48ths, and also because of the fact, to which I have already referred, that the age of entry into membership of the board is likely to be late as compared with the age of entry into the Civil Service.  I am afraid I could not at all agree to this amendment suggested by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>Take sub-section (2) Section 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A local body shall, with the consent of the Minister, grant to a pensionable officer in their employment who has at least ten years' service, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> (a)  who is removed from his office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity, or</P>

    <P>(c)  whose position has, in the opinion of the Minister, been materially altered....</P>
    <P>an annual allowance for his life not greater than two-thirds of his yearly salary and emoluments.</P>
    <P>There is the ten years.  Two-thirds is what is required there.  Of course, it is quite clear no question of finance arises on this at all because the number of people who will at any time be getting pensions as whole-time members of the board, paid out of the earnings of the board, will be relatively small. The difference between, allowing a man to rise to a maximum of two-thirds or getting this five-twelfths maximum is infinitesimal and would not cause the electricity consumers of the country to lose a night's sleep.</P>

      <P>In preparing this pension scheme for members of the board, the pensions of the Civil Service have to be taken into account.  I think it would be open to serious question if we were to make for retired members of the board more generous provision than is being made for senior officers of the public service and, clearly, the Minister for Finance would feel, if that is done, that his position in maintaining the existing provision for the Civil Service would be considerably weakened.  The provision is in one respect already more generous than that provided for the public service. As I have said, the basis of the whole scheme was arrived at by way of compromise, and I am afraid I cannot <Col N="501" /> agree to amend it here.  It would reopen the whole question of the pensions of these members if I tried to secure an agreement upon a new basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister equates this to the Civil Service.  Why should it be so?  The Minister recognises that to get the proper type of person to be a whole-time member, he must be a specialist.  If you do not get a specialist, you will get some man with all-round abilities of a very marked type.  I certainly think they would be people who would be marked under the phrase that is used in the Civil Service in respect of some persons&mdash;&ldquo;possessing qualities not ordinarily found in the service&rdquo;.  I do not see why there should be any comparison&mdash;certainly there is no identification&mdash;as between these and the members of the Civil Service.  There is the other point.  Civil Service pensions are not openly on a contributory basis.</P>

Those who have gone into the Civil Service went in&mdash;of course they have been disappointed in this&mdash;on the basis that their salary was to fluctuate according to cost of living.  There is no such provision made with regard to these people.  Quite a number of things mark out the Civil Service as being completely different, especially from the four or five people we are speaking of here.  I cannot see any reason whatever for equating the maximum.  I think it will be found on examination of the statutes as a whole that the two-thirds maximum is far more common as a maximum than anything else.  Anything other than two-thirds is the exception.</P>

    <P>This is a small point.  It means that if a person who has qualified for pension dies soon after he has qualified, then if the amount of the pension for the period from the date of the cesser to the date of his death is less than his yearly salary, the pension will be made up to the yearly salary.  I suggest that you should simply pay him his yearly salary.  If he has got a little bit in the way of pension, leave it so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy enough for Deputies to urge more generous provisions and it is not always easy to resist that plea, but we have to try to be reasonable.  The Bill provides that if a man dies in harness the personal representative gets a year's salary.  If he is retired on pension and dies within the first year of his retirement then the amount of the pension already paid will be supplemented so as to secure for the personal representative the balance to bring it to a year's salary. Deputy McGilligan's amendment would involve that if a person dies towards the end of the year, if in fact three-fourths or seven-eighths of the full year's pension has been paid, nevertheless, on death, a full year's salary would be paid.  I think that is unduly generous in all the circumstances, having regard to the existing practice of other commercial organisations and to the public service which I think we must take into account as our standard in this regard.  We do provide for this year's salary to the personal representative if the individual dies in harness. If he dies immediately after retirement then the personal representative will be paid a year's salary less the amount of pension already paid.  I think that is generous enough in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Supposing a girl left to get married, or supposing a man left because he was in bad health, he or she will have to come inside the requirements of the scheme in regard to the number of years' service before any pension is payable, and so on.  The board is almost 15 years in existence. There are a number of people who put in at least ten years' service and have gone.  Why should not they be brought in retrospectively?  It will not mean very much to them.  It will mean that they would have to qualify by making payments, if that section is adhered to, or in some way or another they would have to be brought inside the scheme by the terms of the scheme itself.  I should imagine that in the scheme there will probably be some minimum period of years' service before qualification and there will be contributions payable by the persons concerned. What I ask is that you ante-date this scheme as if it had been brought in during the first or second year of the board.</P>

Most persons who left the service, apart from women clerical workers who left to get married, would have left because they were dismissed <Col N="505" /> for some good reason or because of bad health; that is, apart from those transferred from public authorities, who had probably pension rights attaching to them in any event.  In the case of those retired in bad health, so far as I can recollect, it has been the practice of the board to make fairly generous provision for them on retirement. I should like to inquire into it and see what is involved.  Personally I cannot see how we can devise an arrangement under which we can bring into the fund&mdash;I want the Deputy to think of a fund in connection with this &mdash;persons who cannot in any circumstances make a contribution to the fund.</P>

      <P>This is to cut out a number of words in sub-section (2).  As the section runs, the board prepares a scheme.  That scheme is then submitted to the Minister. As the section stands, the Minister then can refer such scheme back to the board for reconsideration or, by order made after consultation with the Minister for Finance, he may confirm the scheme either without modification or with such modifications as the Minister shall, after such consultation, think proper.  In other words, the board is given the task of preparing a scheme.

      <P>Having spent a number of years trying to evolve a pensions scheme for the Great Southern Railways Company, I am sure it is not a bogey.  One of the reasons I was not at all anxious to have this Electricity Supply Board pensions scheme introduced before the Great Southern Railways pensions scheme came into operation was because I knew that the financial circumstances of the board would permit of more generous treatment than is possible in the other case and that the precedent established here would be quoted in the other case and will, I am certain, be quoted if that pensions scheme contemplated by the Railways Act, 1933, ever comes to the point of being brought into existence.  In any event, we feel that there are good grounds of public policy for ensuring that the pensions provision made for employees of the Electricity Supply Board should be related to the general circumstances of, say, industrial concerns and should not be unduly generous.  We must not set too high a standard in this case merely because of the exceptional circumstances of the board, as the board can charge more for electricity, and there is no possibility of people declining to pay or transferring custom to another concern.  It is the exceptionally strong position occupied by the board which requires that we should examine whatever pensions scheme they propose to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might take an analogy from more recent circumstances, there are other industrial firms in this country which, in present circumstances, are in an equally strong position in the sale of goods and they have come to the Prices Branch of the Department with proposals to increase the salaries of their staffs and workers.  They proposed to compensate themselves for that increase by an increase in the price of their goods.  In such cases, the attitude taken was that any increase given must be at the expense of the proprietors and that it must not be <Col N="509" /> reflected in any increased charge to the public.  In the case of the Electricity Supply Board, we cannot have the same provision, but we can ensure that the person whose duty it is to protect the public interest and to examine the pension scheme the board proposes, authorises and approves of it before it is actually brought into operation.  I think we must have these safeguards where an organisation like the Electricity Supply Board is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of a public standard is brought in to cloud the issue.  There is no question of safeguarding the public purse in this matter.  I do not think there is even a question of safeguarding the public purse indirectly.  I think the analogy given is, therefore, altogether false, and I say the public issue can be left out altogether.  There is no question of the Minister for Finance acting as guardian of the public purse, as there is no public purse to guard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is charged with the supervision and control of the public services of the State, and he wants to ensure that, in this particular organisation, which is fairly closely related to the public service, there is not established a standard of remuneration or pension which will be an embarrassment to the Minister for Finance in dealing with the public service.  I do not think the employees of the Electricity Supply Board render better service than the employees, say, of the Department of Finance or any other Government Department to an extent which would justify them getting better pensions than public officials of equal standing in any Government Department would get.  It is the job of the Minister for Finance to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He compares their position with the case of men in the service of the board who can be dismissed at a moment's notice.  The Minister for Finance is, forsooth, brought into this to protect the public interest, but there is no public interest to guard except in the long tedious way the Minister has tried to bring it in.  As to the comparison that is likely to be made, the Minister fears a comparison between the conditions of the Great Southern Railways employees and the conditions enjoyed by these men, but I cannot at all credit that these comparisons of a better type are going to be pressed on the Minister when anything is brought in dealing with other types of employees.

      <P>The Minister is endeavouring to get the impact of the Civil Service brought to bear on this question of pensions, but with regard to salaries, the board can create the most awful complications for the Minister by giving high salary rates and the Minister apparently is not perturbed over that.  The Minister for Finance was not brought in to regulate that question although these people are paying £750,000 a year in salaries.  I have never heard any representations that the salaries they are paying are creating an upward tendency amongst general wage-earners. but when it comes to pensions, this all important matter of pensions, we have to get this whole business moulded in <Col N="511" /> the way in which it is in this Bill, simply because there may be, at some indefinite date, some tremendous comparison, whether just or not we cannot say, with some unnamed public utility that may hereafter arise and which may claim the same rate of pensions as the board wants to give to these people.  I think it would be plainer to say that the Minister may prepare a scheme than to pretend that the board can prepare a scheme when the Minister can upset that scheme as he wishes afterwards.</P>

      <P>Surely that suggestion of the Minister is not quite justified? Does he not know from experience that, irrespective of the merits of any particular case, the object of the Department of Finance always is to prevent the creation of any precedent that might be inimical to some future action of theirs?  The one bogey of the Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance is the creation of a precedent, entirely irrespective of the merits of the case.  I think the Minister will agree with me that the Establishment Branch of the Department never consider the merits of any case.  The first thing they consider is: &ldquo;Will this create a precedent?&rdquo; The black hand of the Department of Finance is sticking out in this section.  I think Deputy Davin has put his finger on the difference between the employees of the board and other civil servants, even professional employees, of the State. The employees of the board are doing a far different job, a job of a highly specialised type demanding a high degree of skill.  Very often human life depends on the proper performance of their duties, not to talk of the very existence of the industries of the State, and of the maintenance of lighting, cooking, etc.  There are employees of the Electricity Supply Board who have no counterpart in the Civil Service. They are highly specialised men who require to be highly skilled if life itself is not to be jeopardised and if <Col N="512" /> proper security and proper provision for the maintenance of public services is not to be imperilled.  I think the Minister will agree with me that there is no justification for this section except that ineradicable hatred of the Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance for the creation of a precedent and the question of precedent has no relation to the question of merits.</P>

      <P>There are specialised people in the Civil Service who were attracted into the public service by reason of the security offered in that service but who, if they took a chance in professional life, might command very much higher remuneration than the public service gives them.  They took less plus the security which the service offered them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the classes of professional men employed in the board's service, the rate of remuneration plus security which they are offering has been considered quite attractive by the persons concerned. It can even be said that they are too attractive and are tending to bring into the specialised branch of work, for which the board is responsible, persons who might be more usefully left free.  As to the other point made by Deputy Costello, if his experience of the Department of Finance is as he says, he will appreciate the difficulty I had in arriving at the financial provisions in the Bill, which do in fact represent a compromise arrived at in discussions between the representatives of the Department of Finance, the Electricity Supply Board and the <Col N="513" /> Department of Industry and Commerce. There was not unanimity as to what should be in the Bill, and what in fact emerged represents a compromise between conflicting views, but there is nothing in the Bill which I am not going to defend as reasonable, and I do not think it is entirely unreasonable in all the circumstances that the board should be required to submit its schemes to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and through it, to the Department of Finance, so that we can give it &ldquo; the once over &rdquo; before confirming it and bringing it into operation.</P>

      <P>There might be something to be said for it&mdash;not a whole lot, but something&mdash;if the Minister for Industry and Commerce alone were in this sub-section, but the bringing in of the Minister for Finance is entirely unjustifiable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a dual responsibility. There is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to electricity consumers, on the one hand, and the possible demands that may be made upon other organisations with which he is connected, or may be responsible for, to introduce a similar scheme, and there is the necessity for ensuring that there will not be too great a disparity between the pension provisions for Electricity Supply Board employees and those made for the public service.</P>

      <P>The whole underlying principle of the Act setting up the Electricity Supply Board was to keep the board and its activities entirely <Col N="514" /> free from governmental control.  They are, in a sense, a business concern. The whole policy of the Act under which the board was set up was to keep them apart from governmental control.  They can, as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, give any salaries they like.  Why should the Minister at this point&mdash;I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his officials do not wish to grasp those powers at all; I believe it is the Department of Finance that is at the back of it&mdash;seek to justify those proposals by saying that he has a duty to the electricity consumers to see that their charges are not increased?   Their charges can be increased by the board at the present moment in numerous ways which cannot be touched by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in one single instance that the Minister is forced&mdash; probably reluctantly forced&mdash;to justify those proposals on unjustifiable grounds, namely, his concern for electricity consumers, but, even if there were such a duty on the Minister towards the consumers, surely it is no justification for bringing in the Department of Finance.  I think the Department of Industry and Commerce would probably have a much broader outlook on this question, and would probably be in a better position to deal in a business-like way with a business board such as the Electricity Supply Board if they are untrammelled by the horror of precedent that there is in the Establishments Branch of the Department of Finance.  Even if there is any justification for the introduction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; I do not think there is any, having regard to the fundamental principle on which the board was set up&mdash;there is no possible justification for bringing in the Department of Finance.  It is going to bring trouble to the board; it is going to add trouble to the Minister, and will introduce extraneous circumstances in connection with what should-be purely a business proposition.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister know that this is another of those camouflage suggestions?  Would anybody send the Minister a resolution protesting against a pension scheme and its impact on charges who had not already sent the Minister a protest against salaries and their impact upon charges?  Is it likely that electricity charges will be increased to the consumer because of movements in wages or because of the smaller matter of pensions?  The Minister knows very well that the wages matter will be the important consideration in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And yet the wages matter is entirely outside his control. Of course, we have to run this a little bit into the future.  I said before that it seemed to me to be a question of the Government trying to get its hooks on the whole board.  If that is not so, if the grappling irons are not out to get this organisation pulled back to the old moorings at Government Buildings, it means that we are going to have this lop-sided concern; that in a public undertaking started by the Government the salaries will be left free; that you will have a group of independent people left to run a business concern in a business-like way; that they will be able to attract their personnel; that they will be able to give them the lines of advance from one grade of employment to another; that they will allow for promotions, for annual increments, for payments for sickness; that they will be able to establish a cost-of-living bonus on their wages; that they will be able to do all that freely, but when it comes to the question of a pension scheme, then some unnamed undertaking in the future might object to the beneficence of a particular board and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance must get into consultation over the whole matter.  It does not bear <Col N="516" /> looking at.  Nobody with any grain of logic or common sense in his being can justify that.  I suggest that there is something in the point of view of Deputy Costello that it is the Establishments Branch of the Department of Finance that is trying to get in on this.  I go further and say that there is a certain amount of repentance on the part of the people in Government Buildings for having allowed the board to veer away from governmental control. I think the next public undertaking will not get the same freedom that this board got.  I think that is what the future holds.  I do not think anybody can go on a public platform and justify that sub-section in connection with a board of this type, which is allowed to pay its 2,000 employees, to distribute £750,000 a year in wages, and to give emoluments as they please.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>(1)  Every superannuation scheme shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  provide that a fund shall be set up out of which the superannuation benefits payable under the scheme shall be paid and that such fund shall be administered in accordance with this Act and the regulations made thereunder by the Minister, and</P>
      <P>(b)  provide (save as otherwise provided by this section) that every person entitled to superannuation benefits under the scheme shall pay contributions to the said fund and that the board shall make to the said fund payments equal in the aggregate to the aggregate amount of the said contributions thereto, and</P>
      <P>(c)  provide that the board shall defray the expenses of administering the scheme and managing the said fund, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  indicate clearly the classes of persons in the employment of the board who are to be entitled to pay <Col N="517" /> contributions under the scheme and, in particular, define the classes of persons who are to be deemed in relation to the scheme to be manual workers, and</P>
    <P>(e)  prescribe the contributions payable and the superannuation benefits receivable under the scheme and (subject to the provisions of this Act) the service which will qualify or be reckonable for such benefit, and</P>
    <P>(f)  provide (subject to the provisions of this section) the circumstances in which persons leaving the employment of the board before they have become entitled to superannuation benefits under the scheme will be entitled to have contributions paid by them under the scheme repaid, whether with or without interest, and</P>
    <P>(g)  provide for matters incidental or ancillary to all or any of the matters mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section.</P>
    <P>(2)  In addition to the matters mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, every superannuation scheme shall provide that only continuous service in the employment of the board ending on the date of retirement from that employment on account of age or ill-health shall qualify or be reckonable for superannuation benefits under the scheme, and the manual workers superannuation scheme shall further provide&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c)  that where, in the reckoning of such continuous service as aforesaid of any manual worker, any period of service of such worker is excluded in pursuance of paragraph (a) of this sub-section, all contributions paid to the said fund by such person or by the board on his behalf in respect of the period of service so excluded shall remain in the said fund and shall not be repayable, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that every dispute as to whether a break after the passing of this Act in the service of any manual worker in the employment <Col N="518" /> of the board was or was not due to such wilful action as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section on the part of such worker shall be referable to the tribunal to be established under this Act, and that the decision of the said tribunal thereon shall be final and binding on all persons concerned.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every superannuation scheme shall also contain provisions enabling persons to whom the scheme applies who are in the employment of the board at the date of the confirmation of the scheme to include in their service reckonable for superannuation benefits under the scheme continuous service (in this sub-section referred to as prior service) in the employment of the board prior to and ending on the said date, but subject to the following provisions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if any such person pays to the fund set up for the purposes of the scheme appropriate contributions (with compound interest) in respect of his prior service, the board shall also pay to the said fund appropriate contributions (with compound interest) in respect of such prior service, and such person shall (save as is otherwise provided in pursuance of the next preceding sub-section of this section) be entitled to reckon his prior service in full for benefits under the scheme, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if any such person does not pay to the said fund contributions in respect of his prior service, the board shall pay to the said fund appropriate contributions (with compound interest) in respect of such prior service, and such person shall (save as is otherwise provided in pursuance of the next preceding sub-section of this section) be entitled to reckon one-half and no more of his prior service for benefits under the scheme.</P>

    <P>The superannuation scheme as now <Col N="519" /> left in Section 5 is one that has in all its details passed the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Then we lay down certain provisions.  It has to provide that a fund is to be set up out of which superannuation benefits shall be paid; that such fund is to be administered in accordance with the Act; that it has to be further administered in accordance with regulations, and those regulations must be made by the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Would not the whole scheme already have been under the Minister's censorship?  This is a question of the regulations for the administration of the scheme.  It is not even a question of regulations made by the board and sanctioned by the Minister.  It is regulations to be made by the Minister for the ordinary administration of this fund.  What justification is there for that?  The scheme has to be administered in accordance with the Act and regulations made thereunder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>&ldquo;...providing for the investment of such fund in accordance with this Act; providing for the keeping and audit of the accounts of such fund; and providing for such other matters relating to the establishment, maintenance, and administration of such fund as the Minister considers proper to be provided for.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Minister makes regulations ensuring that the fund will be established that the solvency of the fund will be regularly tested, that various provisions will operate to ensure that there is no speculation with the resources in the fund, and that in every way the interests of the participants in the fund will be safeguarded. <Col N="520" /> Once he comes into the picture at all, it seems to me that it follows automatically that the Minister is under an obligation to ensure that the scheme will be a workable one and that the fund established under the scheme will be properly protected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> In sub-section (1) (b), page 5, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;fund&rdquo; in line 24 to the end of the paragraph and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;of an amount not greater than 5 per centum of the salary or wages payable to such person and that the board shall pay to the said fund by equal annual payments over a period not exceeding 40 years such amount as may be actuarially required to keep the said fund solvent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This I regard as an important amendment. I do not know that we have sufficient material to enable us to decide on a particular percentage such as that I have set out in the amendment, but I should like to have some maximum fixed in relation to the contributions that may be required from members of the staff.  As it stands, the scheme is to provide for pensions, on a contributory basis and further that the scheme is to be on a fifty-fifty basis, the State paying in the aggregate as much as the contributions exacted from the staff.  It is very hard to get details of pension schemes, but there arc quite a number which can be looked to and in most of them&mdash; certainly in most of the English schemes&mdash;the 5 per cent. contribution from the staff is the highest demanded, and that is the modern statute.  The old statute which demanded a contribution from a staff and laid down a percentage put it at 2½ per cent. of salaries.  That has been found actuarially to be unsound.  It was unsound in connection with the railways, the scheme there being started on a 2½ per cent basis.  Other contributory schemes in operation in England are based on 5 per cent. and on a 5 per cent. maximum.</P>
    <P>Certain literature has been written and certain comments made about the 5 per cent. figure on the basis that 5 per cent. never seemed to be necessary as a contribution for pensions of substantial types, but that it was better to have a maximum of 5 per cent. in order to allow for such things as extreme length of years of a staff or&mdash;and this is something which had to be provided for in some of the schemes which went actuarially unsound to provide <Col N="523" /> against bad investment of the trust fund out of which the superannuation was later to be paid.  If one takes a line from English schemes, however, not universally but in very much the majority of cases, they demand a maximum contribution of 5 per cent. of salaries or emoluments.  The Other side of that has to be met in some other way.  I do not know what contribution will be required in order to make the fund solvent, but there would have to be a great deal of calculation made in respect of a payment, of only 5 per cent. maximum and one would have to get first&mdash;this is not an absolutely new undertaking but one which has been in existence for 15 years&mdash;a determination as to what percentage of the staff are even approaching the obvious retiring age.  One would have to find a variety of other things, such as the amount of pension that is to be given, but I can give examples and details of reasonable pensions which have been secured to employees on the small ranges of salary earning on a payment of 5 per cent. of their actuarial earnings. There are quite a number of concerns which have built up funds starting at 2½, 3 and 3½ per cent.  Five per cent. seems to be the ordinary maximum chosen for either the good type of commercial undertaking or institutions like banks and public undertakings of the type we are considering here.</P>
    <P>I put down this 5 per cent. because it is the one that occurred to me on looking through the English legislation. The other side has to be left much more vague, and I say that the board shall pay by equal annual payments over a period not exceeding 40 years such amount as may be actuarially required to keep the fund solvent. I put it in that vague form for the reason that I do not know how many of the staff of the Electricity Supply Board are over 50 or 55 years of age, and I do not know what would be the amount that would have to be put in in order to keep the fund solvent.  If one were starting afresh and recruiting people of 20 or 25 years of age, with, of course, special provision for experienced staff of the technical type, <Col N="524" /> one would have a better picture of what was likely to happen, but here there is an element of calculation which will depend upon the details of the staff of the board.  A calculation could be made quite easily at once if there was no question of back payments, no question of bringing people in and allowing them to qualify with their past service, but, that being the consideration, it does tend towards confusion.  That is why I put this phrase in the rather loose way in which it is worded&mdash;that the board would then pay whatever was the amount an actuarial calculation showed was required to keep the fund solvent.</P>
    <P>I set out a period of 40 years for this reason: that all this matter of the people who have come into the board's service and have served 15 years and for whom some allowance, I hope, will be made in connection with arrears, will have disappeared by that time, and that complication will not then arise. At the end of 40 years, the majority of those who have given 15 years' service with the board will have gone and that matter will not arise again.  After that period, it would be quite easy, actuarially, to find out what is the board's contribution if the staff have to pay 3½, 4 or 5 per cent.  I ask the Minister to put in some maximum.  It is always subject to enlargement after, if it is not found suitable, but I believe that 5 per cent., on the examples I have seen in other countries, would be quite sufficient to meet the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is sufficient, well and good.  If the Dáil feels strongly that the legislation providing for this pension fund should set out as one of the conditions under which the fund would be established that nobody will pay more than 5 per cent of his salary, that can be considered, provided the principle of equal contribution is maintained and provided it is understood that the pension which a man will receive on retirement will be related to the amount he has paid.  What the Deputy is doing is something different. He says that nobody should pay more than 5 per cent. and that, if there is a deficiency in the fund, the board will make good that deficiency <Col N="525" /> An arrangement of that kind would lead to the removal of any inducement to the governing body of the fund to restrict the pension benefits payable to the participants in it.  They will know that if any deficiency arises because they increase the pension, because they pay out a larger pension than the state of the fund would justify, the board is required by law to make good the deficiency and the board will have to pay an ever-increasing amount in order to allow the inflated benefits to be paid. That would be the inevitable result of the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
      <P>What is contemplated in the Bill is that the pension will be related to the contribution.  It will be a matter entirely for the board when they are preparing the scheme, subject to whatever opinions will be expressed to them by those who will benefit by the scheme, whether they will have a large contribution and a large pension or a small contribution and a small pension.  We are providing that the board's contribution will be equivalent to the employees' contribution, that the whole scheme must be kept financially sound, and that the fund will have an income from contributions sufficient to enable it to meet the pensions. I could not agree to any arrangement in which the board would be required to make good any deficiency that might arise.  If it should happen that a deficiency arises, there will be two ways in which it will be made good &mdash; by decreasing the pensions, or by increasing the contributions.  The solvency of the fund will have to be assured at the expense of those contributing to it.  The suggestion that has been put forward would, in my opinion, lead to a situation in which the pensions will have no relation to the contributions and the entire cost will fall on the board.</P>

      <P>The analogy of 40 years that I took was derived from a Local Government Act in England. They made the calculation that a maximum of 5 per cent., with an equivalent payment from the local authorities, would give the pensions scheme that was required.  They had <Col N="526" /> to take account of people already in the employment of the local authority; they had to take into account middle-aged men who had made no contribution and in respect of whom no contribution had been made by the authority.  They put in a phrase to the effect that the amalgamated group would pay all the contributions for those for whom no contributions had been paid in their earlier years.  They allowed them to spread that payment over 40 years and that is where the 40 comes from.  The board had certain negotiations with a body of their own, a pensions committee of some sort. They discussed the matter with them and arranged what pensions would be suitable.  Various things were spoken about and they discussed in detail what contributions would be required from a man entering at 25 years, 35 years or 40 years.  I understood that all those things were actuarially calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are proposing that there shall be equal contributions. Take the case of a person who has spent 15 years in the employment of the board and is now earning £4 a week, a man who entered at 25 and is now 40 and who intends to leave the service at 60 or 65.  The proportion of pay that he would have to sacrifice now on the equal contribution basis would be pretty considerable.  These people have not made any provision for themselves.  Many of them relied on a statement made in 1927 that there would be a pensions scheme.  If the back payments were different, or if some more liberal attitude were taken with regard to people who have 15 years' service&mdash;not insisting on their paying fully with compound interest&mdash; then there might be something to be said for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody has raised any great complaint about the magnificence of the salaries that the board are giving their employees.  Even from the viewpoint of the Department of Finance, the members of the board have shown themselves to be people who can be trusted in regard to the giving of salaries&mdash;but, perhaps, that <Col N="527" /> is no great compliment.  Why not leave this a little more open in connection with the payment of pensions? Why insist on the equal payments?  I could understand an equal payment if you are going to deal with the arrears in some other way.  Take something, not more than 5 per cent., from the employees, and let the board put in the amount necessary to make the fund actuarially solvent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are committed to the principle of equal payments.  I do not think it is unfair to say that a man who starts to contribute to his pension at 40 will contribute more or get less than the man who starts at 25.  We do provide for the man who starts at 40 that, in respect of his past service, half of the contribution will, in fact, still be paid.  It is a matter for himself whether he will contribute the other half.  He will get a half pension in respect of that period without any contribution from him.  The principle here is that the fund should be based on equal contributions from the board and its employees.  We allow the board to work out the scheme and, if they want to limit the amount of the contribution and, consequently, the amount of the pension, that is a matter for themselves.  If they want to give more liberal pensions on the basis of a higher contribution, it is also a matter for themselves.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the amendment in relation to the section, and I am taking up the viewpoint that has been expressed by Deputy McGilligan.  I think it has been shown in the course of these discussions that in order to obtain even very low pensions some members of the staff, who have given considerable service to the board in the past, will be required to pay more than 5 per cent. of their wages, and that even then the pension they receive will be decidedly small. Deputy McGilligan seeks in his amendment, to ensure that the maximum contribution that such persons would be required to pay would be 5 per cent., and a 5 per cent. contribution from each side, normally, would make a solvent pension fund.  I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance to fix an overriding maximum of 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's amendment seeks to fix a maximum contribution of 5 per cent. from the staff and 5 per cent. from the board, but his amendment takes cognisance <Col N="529" /> of the fact that there are persons who have given considerable service to the board and who are quite incapable of paying a sufficient contribution to bring their services into economic value for pension purposes, and if they were required to do that they would be asked to make a contribution beyond their capacity to pay.  The Electricity Supply Board is a very wealthy organisation; it is a substantial revenue-earning organisation, and the consumption of electrical energy produced by the Electricity Supply Board has been beyond all conception of what it was thought it would come to when the first Bill was passed in 1927.  Accordingly, it is not unreasonable to ask the board to start off with 5 per cent. contribution as a maximum, but that the board should put into the pool a sum of money which will cover the case of persons who have been in the board's employment and who, during that period of service, were not required to pay contributions and in respect of whom it would be a decided hardship now to ask them to pay arrears of contributions over 15 years. As Deputy McGilligan rightly points out, this is a transitory problem.  It will disappear in the course of time, according as the people concerned retire, and then you can have a normal pension scheme with a contribution of 5 per cent., or perhaps less, from each side.  But I think it is not unreasonable to ask the board to put into the pool a sufficient sum of money to cover the services of persons who were in the board's employment prior to the introduction of this Bill.  It will not put any great strain on the board's resources.  It will not affect the board to any great extent, and a contribution of that type from the board would probably overcome many of the objections that have been levelled against this scheme, because of the fact that it makes a person pay a substantial additional contribution in order to make his past services available for pension purposes.  I think we should require the board to put something into the pool in respect of that past service so as to make it available for superannuation purposes in the future.</P>

Let us think of this now and bring it back to reality.  The board's revenue is about £2,000,000 in the year.  It has been asserted, and I assert it again, that what we are talking about would not amount to £10,000 in a year.  What the board would pay, let us say, to their permanent pensions committee would not cost an extra £10,000.  That is, on the basis of paying up for the back years, <Col N="532" /> with arrears of compound interest and so on, it would not cost £10,000, and that is very little in relation to £2,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small difference here.  One of the lettered paragraphs seems to make provision for service which is continuous.  It says that you count only such continuous service&mdash;that is paragraph (b) of sub-section 2.  I am arguing this point again.  Supposing a person comes into the service of the board and goes out before he becomes entitled under the scheme&mdash;I do not know the scope of the scheme, but I presume there will be a minimum number of years service in order to become entitled to a pension at all&mdash;he would not be qualified for a pension.  He goes away because he may be offered some better work, or his work may be uncongenial, or he may ask for a change which he does not get and there is some pique. He gets cool later on and comes back again.  By breaking his service for a month, he will lose the benefit of the years he has served previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in a later section a provision <Col N="538" /> which, if it does not apply comprehensively, might be made to apply comprehensively, to employees, so that a person would not be allowed to do a certain number of years, then cash in on something in the way of a gratuity and come back and seek to have the early service counted in.  All sorts of things may break the service of employees of the board.  If they can get better employment, leave what they have behind them in the fund, and come back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the case of a manual worker we provide two alternatives. If he leaves under circumstances in which he imperilled the electricity supply, he is not entitled to draw from the fund the amount he has paid into it.  It is only when he leaves voluntarily for the purposes indicated by the Deputy, or similar purposes, that he can exercise the right of withdrawal.</P>

Then, there is the old point as to whether ill-health covers disability.  On a wide interpretation, it could be made to cover it. Suppose that the technical post which some person held was abolished.  That is not retirement on account of age or ill-health.  These things appear to be blocked.

    <P>This sub-section deads with the question of people going on strike.  They will forfeit their contributions.  I have a secondary amendment to this amendment.  The things which may lead to forfeiture include service broken through wilful action on the part of the worker which &ldquo;caused, or might have caused&rdquo; interruption in the generation, etc., of electricity.   I draw attention to the words &ldquo;might have caused&rdquo;.  The grounds also include action which &ldquo;might have&rdquo; impeded the due performance of any of the functions or duties of the board.  By the 1927 Act, we have brought in the Conspiracy Act of 1854.  That dealt with the supply of essential services, such as gas and water supplies.  We are dealing here with a board which has bigger functions than the management of any gas or water undertaking ever had.  The functions of the board are very generally described. They may do anything that will lead to greater distribution of electricity in the State.  Amongst their specific functions, there are such things as running business places for the sale of electric bulbs.  As I read this provision, if any worker was guilty of conduct which a tribunal declared might have impeded the board in selling electric bulbs, he would forfeit his pension rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has got to be a break in his service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a messenger delivering bulbs goes on strike to get better terms, that might be regarded as impeding the board in discharge of its functions.  Any worker commits a criminal offence under the old Act if he prevents the distribution of essential things, such as gas, electricity and water.  Now, we are putting the messenger or the man who drives a van with electrical goods on the same footing as the man who tries to destroy one of the main transmission wires.  I should rather have the old provision.  It is a criminal offence for people to behave in certain ways in regard to essential services such as the supply of electricity.  Then, the things which &ldquo;might have caused&rdquo; what is <Col N="543" /> set out in the Bill, or which might have impeded the board, need not necessarily result in any of these things.  It is not only a break-down that might have resulted in an interruption in the transmission of electricity that is covered, but a break-down in the service which the Electricity Supply Board renders to the public in their showrooms and by the sending out of their vans.  The penalty is too rigorous.  This Bill does not repeal the existing law, and it always remains a criminal offence for people to behave in certain ways in regard to the supply of electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the idea that I want to conceal in any way the intention of this provision.  It is provided that an employee of the Electricity Supply Board who elects to participate in the pension fund will not be entitled to go on strike except he is prepared to suffer the penalty of loss of pension rights.  This was one of the principal matters of discussion on Second Reading.  There is a very good case to be made for requiring that workers employed in an essential service, like that of the Electricity Supply Board, should not go on strike. Not merely does the welfare of the whole country, but the livelihood of thousands of other workers, depend upon the continuity of their operations. We are not preventing them from going on strike.  We are not compelling them to enter a pension scheme.  These workers are getting standard trade union rates of wages, as set out in agreements between employers of similar classes of workers and the unions catering for these workers.  So far as the trade unions recognise these rates as reasonable, these employees get reasonable rates of wages.  If we propose to give them something over and above the wages they are receiving, we think we are entitled to ask, in return, that they will not jeopardise the livelihood of other workers and the prosperity of the whole country by withdrawing their services.  There are other public services in respect of which we will, at some stage, get to the point where there will be a common recognition by everybody, <Col N="544" /> including representatives of the workers, that it is not desirable in the interests of the workers that these services should stop.  We hear a great deal about the right to strike.  That phrase has been used frequently in connection with this Bill and other Bills. The worker's fundamental right is to justice and, if we restrict his right to secure justice by withdrawing his labour, we must give him an alternative means of getting justice.  Therefore, we propose to provide in this Bill that a worker who elects to limit his right to strike will be protected from injustiee by setting up between him and the board, or as an appeal tribunal from the decisions of the board, a tribunal which will be impartial.</P>
      <P>I know that the constitution of this tribunal has been criticised, but, as I told the Dáil before and told the Trade Union Congress, my sole desire is to get an impartial tribunal.  Any proposals which appear to be more acceptable to the representatives of the workers concerned, or to the Trade Union Congress, and which I am satisfied will give us an impartial tribunal, will be acceptable to me.  But I want to make it clear beyond doubt, and particularly I want to remove doubts in the minds of the workers concerned, that the tribunal will be impartial.  It will be a tribunal which will be a protection for the workers, and will be designed to ensure that in any dispute between them and the board justice will be done.  That is all that we are doing here.  We are not compelling any worker to elect to enter this pension scheme at all.  The worker who prefers to maintain the position of alleged independence which he now has, or his right to withdraw his labour to rectify his grievances in that way, can continue to do so, but he will not get the benefit of the pension scheme if he does that.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  He can at any time elect to exercise the right to withdraw his labour subject to the provisions of the old Act that Deputy McGilligan referred to, provided he realises what is involved in that.  The Dublin Corporation workers did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> They went on strike knowing that by doing so they were sacrificing their right to pensions.  That right was only restored to them by the Government when it decided to reintroduce legislation specially drafted for that purpose. Those employed by the Electricity Supply Board can do the same thing, but I want to tell them that if they do it in unlikely that any legislative provisions will be introduced here to protect them, because I am convinced that public opinion in all parts of this country, and among all classes in this country, will eventually develop to a realisation of the desirability of preventing stoppages of work resulting from disputes in essential undertakings on which the livelihood and employment of everybody else depends.  We have had these disputes in essential services, often called at short notice and causing widespread hardship and inconvenience amongst other working-class families often irresponsible disputes caused not by any real grievance or promoted by any responsible organisation, but merely by the whim of a few individuals responsible to no one. I think we should get into the position in which that will not happen.  If we do, then I think there is an obligation on us to ensure that the workers concerned will have reasonable protection gainst injustice.</P>
    <P>Objection has been taken to the principle of establishing a tribunal here. The tribunal provisions of this Bill are inserted as a protection for the workers only, but if there, is objection to them they can go, but if they go the position of the worker will be that if he goes into the pension scheme a break in the continuity of his service will deprive him of his pension, and there will be no appeal.  The purpose of the tribunal is to give the right of appeal, and I think that is in the interests of the workers.  I know that the Trade Union Congress take objection to the section which requires a worker to sign a document in which he accepts this position.  I am not prepared to insist upon that.  Again, I think it is a protection for the worker.  At any rate, I think it is desirable that the very special obligation he undertakes when he decides to become a participant in <Col N="546" /> the pension scheme should be brought to his notice.  It is not a fundamental matter as to whether that obligation is brought to his notice in one way or another.  If there is objection to bringing it to his notice by asking him to sign a document in which that is set out, then we can do it in some other way.  But, in my view, it is desirable, first of all, that the tribunal should be there, and, secondly, that the worker should be fully aware of what his position will be if and when he elects to become a participant in the pension fund.</P>
    <P>On the question of a break in the continuity of service, terminating the right to pension and involving a sacrifice on the part of the worker, I am not prepared to accept any modification of what is in the Bill.  That must stand.  I think it is essential that it should stand.  The alternative to it is to take manual workers outside the scope of the Bill altogether.  If there is a case for doing that, it can be argued. If we give to the manual workers employed by the board the same rates of pay that manual workers employed by other employers are getting, then their position is reasonably good so long as it can be held that the rates of pay of other manual workers are reasonably good.</P>
    <P>It certainly cannot be held to be an obligation on the part of the Electricity Supply Board to pay more than the standard rates of wages which are recognised by the trade unions for appropriate employment.  If, in fact, we make provision for pensions for them, then I think we should require from those manual workers, in return for that, an undertaking to ensure that, except in circumstances of a very exceptional character, their services will be carried on, and that minor disputes concerning rates of wages and conditions of employment will be settled by negotiation or arbitration rather than by strikes.</P>
    <P>I welcome this discussion.  I told the representatives of the Trade Union Congress that I was prepared to accept any amendment that they might suggest to the section relating to the establishment of a tribunal, and the constitution of it, provided that it gave what I was satisfied was a fair tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> I also told them that I was prepared to consider any amendment they might offer to Section 12, if they had an objection in principle to that section, although I think it might be necessary to substitute for it something to ensure that the worker who elected to become a member of the pension fund realised what precisely he was involving himself in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as being a particularly vicious portion, not merely of the section but of the whole Bill.  I think the Minister is hugging an illusion if he imagines that an amendment of this kind inserted in this legislation is likely to have the effect of guaranteeing him immunity from an interruption in the generation and transmission of electricity if factors exist which so severely irritate the workers as to bring about such an interruption. I do not suppose that any reasonable person in this State desires to see any interruption in the generation and transmission of electricity in this country, because it only needs a few moments' thought to conceive the dislocation that would be caused thereby.  But, having said that on the one hand, I think it is necessary, on the other hand, to look at what the Minister is doing in this section. The right of the worker to withdraw his labour is older than electricity itself.  It is older than gas itself, and is older than any of the utility undertakings that have given rise to the legislation which makes it a penal offence for a worker to withdraw his labour in respect of these vital services. The right of the worker to withdraw his labour is a natural right. It is a right which is inherent in the right to live.  In this particular section we set out to deprive the worker of that very natural right.  He is the only class of industrial worker that we set out to deprive of his natural right to strike.  I think the Minister is foolish to imagine that this section does, in fact, deprive the worker of his right to strike.  This green Bill and other green Bills will be of no use in trying to establish that position by imposing penalties because workers decide to withdraw their labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> A far better approach to the whole problem of avoiding disputes in essential undertakings would be the creation by co-operative effort&mdash;and I underline co-operative effort&mdash;of wage-negotiating and condition-fixing machinery which would produce both on the part of the employer and of the worker a recognition of the essentiality of the service, and a recognition that there is a certain overriding obligation to the community at large.  A recognition of that type on the part of workers ought to beget on the part of employers a similar type of recognition.  With a reasonable balance of mind on the part of both sides, I think you would then get a type of machinery the very essence of which would be the avoidance of disputes which lead to interruptions in the public services or in essential services.  I think that, in respect of the Electricity Supply Board, the Minister might very well have got that type of machinery by the expenditure of very little time.  He might very well have gone to the unions concerned and have discussed the matter with them, and I refuse to believe it would have been impossible to get agreement on the matter.  Instead of that, the Minister gets into the jackboot and puts this particular sub-section in Section 7 and declares to all and sundry: &ldquo;If we make provision for a pension for you to save you from destitution in old age, then we are going to make sure that we will withdraw your natural right to withdraw your labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect of what the Minister is doing.  The Minister may not desire to do that, but that is the effect of what he is doing, because he is saying in this particular section that if a worker withdraws his labour and causes an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity, or if he impeded or might have impeded the due performance of any of the functions or duties of the board, he loses his past service for pension purposes and he loses his contribution.  So that, in order to get a pension when he reaches 60 or 65 years of age, he has got to <Col N="549" /> undertake never to withdraw his labour, no matter how indignant he may feel at any treatment which he receives from the board or from the peculiar type of tribunal which is established under this Bill.  I think the Minister might very well have sought a remedy if, in fact, any remedy is needed in respect of the Electricity Supply Board for the avoidance of trade disputes, in another direction.</P>
      <P>Happily there has been no dispute in the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister might have had a better public case, appealing to a certain type of employer's mind, if he had quoted other cases.  The Employers' Federation have taken credit to themselves for having been responsible for the introduction of the Trade Union Bill and have taken some of the credit for the introduction of the restrictive clauses of this Bill, but there is no reason whatever for singling out the Electricity Supply Board employees for the type of treatment that is indicated in this section.  There has been no dispute in the Electricity Supply Board.  I think the relations between the staff and the board have, on the whole, apart from certain Ministerial meddlesomeness, been quite good. There has been no dispute.  There has been no friction.  The board has produced electricity on an enormous scale, a scale never previously contemplated, never contemplated when the parent Bill was introduced.  Things have run smoothly.  Yet, in the middle of all that domestic peace, so far as the Electricity Supply Board staff and the board are concerned, we get a jackboot section of this kind which, I think, is calculated to annoy and irritate people and which will not get the result which the Minister desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has waited for 15 years. The Minister is on the wrong line today in connection with the avoidance of disputes in the Electricity Supply Board, and I would suggest to the Minister that even now he might withdraw this particular section or subjection of the section and endeavour by discussion with the board, with the unions catering for the board's staff or with the Trade Union Congress, to get a type of negotiating machinery <Col N="550" /> the essential purpose of which will be the avoidance of dispute and which will recognise the necessity for maintaining the service.  As the sub-section stands, it is most objectionable, most reprehensible.  In a time of crisis and time of dispute between the board and its staff this section is not worth the paper it is written on, any more than it was ever proved to be worth the paper it is written on in respect of disputes in other industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three things that ought to be considered, in connection with this new step&mdash; whether forward or backward depends on the point of view&mdash;first of all the offence that may be committed by a member of the staff of the board; secondly, the tribunal that is to adjudicate on the offence; and thirdly, the penalty.  As we stand at the moment, under Section 110 of the 1927 legislation, we have applied Section 4 of the 1875 Act.  The result of that is that breaches of contract by persons employed in the supply of electricity become criminal offences and that is the situation at the moment.  If there is a criminal offence or if a criminal offence shall hereinafter be committed it shall be determined by a judge under that section.  I could have imagined the Minister saying: &ldquo;Here is an opportunity and I will avail myself of it and I will say in regard to pensions that anybody who is en route to qualifying for a pension will not get the full length if he is convicted under the 1854 Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would then be going to put on an extra penalty to a court determination of a crime.  What does he propose to do?  He proposes now to add to the offence if a person breaks service in such a way that it causes or might cause an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity.  Let me take it that these three words go no further than what the 1854 Act thought to be a break in the supply of electricity.  The Minister adds that penalty if a person breaks service in a way that impedes or might impede the due performance of any of the functions or duties of the board.  What are they?  The generation, supply and distribution of electricity, <Col N="551" /> to start off with.  But there is a variety of other functions&mdash;research work in connection with electricity, appliances, and their sale.  Eventually, the board may manufacture appliances and, by a later Act, not the 1927 Act, we gave the board certain powers with regard to the salmon fisheries around Limerick.  That is part of the functions of the board.  So that anybody who breaks service now in a way that might impede the board in selling electric bulbs or in looking after the fish on the Shannon, is going to be on the same footing as far as this is concerned as those who interrupt the supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>And, as to whether a person has impeded the board in the discharge of any of its functions, there is no longer going to be a judge and a jury. They are the people who would decide under the old Act.  It is no longer a judicial determination but a determination, in the end, by a nominee of the Minister.  There are going to be three people on the tribunal to decide.  One is to be a representative of workers, so to speak, one representative of the others.  Let us say they would be biased and, in the end, you are going to have a determination by a person, not necessarily a judge, appointed by the Minister, and that person is going to determine whether on a particular occasion some manual worker in the board's service has brought about a situation which might be regarded as one that might have impeded the discharge by the board of some of its functions.  I think that is a very wide enlargement.  What is the penalty? Whether the Minister cares to run them before a court or not as committing the criminal offence, he can run them before his tribunal and get them deprived, not merely of pension, but of their own contributions paid into that pension fund.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were here going to set up general legislation with regard to strikes, I would go some part of the way with him with regard to, say, lightning strikes.  There is a considerable volume of opinion, and I think there are certain people in the labour movement not unsynipathetically disposed <Col N="552" /> towards the growth of public opinion in that matter against the immediate interruption, not of things of essential service but of things some way removed from that.  The Minister is not setting up a general code in regard to strikes.  He is trying to penalise one group that come under his control, and I think he might have been satisfied to do the ordinary thing and say: &ldquo;It is already a criminal offence to do certain things, but you have the rights of the ordinary citizen to a judge and jury to determine whether that has been done or not, but once they find you guilty we will stop your pension rights.  Once judicial proceedings have ended in the determination that you have been guilty of something against that old Act, we will not allow you to take part in the pension rights and we will make you forfeit the payments you have already had deducted from your salary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister might have done that and there could be no great comment on it.  But he is going very far, I suggest, in enlarging it in the way in which he is doing it.  He is certainly going very far with the tribunal as at present constituted.  The person may be a layman or a civil servant attached to the Minister's Department. The person to be appointed by the Minister may not have any of the ordinary qualifications of people who determine between citizen and citizen.  The Minister will have his nominee.  It is a very wide clause and refers to something that may have impeded the board in the discharge of its functions. I suggest that this is not the time for that.  If the Minister wants this matter dealt with, let him deal with it by a definite frontal approach to that particular matter.  I ask him to consider the question of industrial courts established by agreement between the parties likely to be concerned.  I do not think the Minister will bring forward, with any great hope of getting agreement on the matter, an industrial court to decide a dispute where the board is balanced as between the people likely to be concerned and is to be presided over by a nominee of the Minister.  I do not <Col N="553" /> think he would get a reasonable acceptance of that view at the present time.  That may be the situation under the old industrial courts law, but there have been very few sittings of that court.  The Minister would not get an easy acceptance of the idea now.  I ask the Minister will he get an easy acceptance of the idea of a lay tribunal to determine what really amounts to a criminal offence and with the penalty of forfeiture of payments made.  He could not possibly get acceptance of that.</P>
    <P>If you segregate out one matter, is the Minister likely to make his appearance before the public, as an introduction to his new idea with regard to strikes, and say that in connection with the sales rooms of the Electricity Supply Board he is going to prohibit people in these rooms from striking, by saying: &ldquo;We will not allow you to indulge in the benefits of a pension fund unless you guarantee not to strike,&rdquo; and add further as another acceptable point that &ldquo;the determination of whether you have done something affecting the service or impeding the board in the discharge of its duties through your activities in the sales rooms will be not by a court and jury, but by a lay board&rdquo;?  I do not think the Minister will come forward with that.  I think he is rather wrong to avail himself of the opportunity presented to get this in in a side way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, I have no special view as to its desirability or otherwise.  I would simply like to ask whether, in connection with this general arrangement for pensions for the employees of the Electricity Supply Board and the desire of the Minister to prevent strikes in the service, he will consider as an alternative the amending of the Industrial Courts Act to provide for the Electricity Supply Board in particular. The Industrial Courts Act provides that the employer and the employees must agree before the matter is brought before the industrial court.  So far as I can understand the general principle of the Act, it will be always in the power of the Minister to amend the Act in respect of certain types of industry covering a large, or narrow <Col N="554" /> field.  It will be possible for the court to come into operation for a specific purpose, so that if the Minister or the workers or the employers make a request to the court to examine any particular question, automatically the court will sit.  As at present established, the request must be made by both parties.  So far as I can see, there is nothing to prevent the Minister amending the Act so that only one party will be sufficient to invoke the powers of the court.  I ask the question in order to find out whether the Minister has power to do that.  This is a matter which interests people who have made a study of industrial disputes in this country and in other democratic countries.  The Minister is aware that in more than one of the small democracies in Western Europe the industrial court is of the type I have described, where either party to the dispute can invoke the court, and the court in these countries is used to a greater extent.</P>

      <P>The courts established under the Industrial Disputes Act have no power to make binding awards.  If we are to take the step contemplated, that is, to make it an unprofitable matter for the Electricity Supply Board workers to go on strike, we must do something more than merely give the right to get an award from an industrial court which has no binding effect on anybody, unless we propose to give them the right to strike.

I do not see any great objection to an enlargement of that to make it specific with regard to electricity that it definitely includes the interruption of the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity to be judged by a judicial tribunal.

We do it because we want them to be impartial in their duties, but we have none of that here.  It is not a question of a legal body.

Would the Minister even now undertake to initiate further discussions with the workers' representatives or the Trades Union Congress with a view to getting accepted a type of wage-fixing machinery which will create between the staff and the board that sort of atmosphere which <Col N="557" /> will not make it necessary lo insert such an objectionable sub-section?</P>

We can stop before we come to them if you like, but we have got to do more than that.</P>

    <P>We must give them this right which is a protection against arbitrary action by the board in matters relating to their employment.  The constitution of the tribunal is a matter on which I am prepared to consider any reasonable proposition.  I take it that the first thing that will happen if there is a dispute as to rates of wages or conditions of employment is that there will be negotiations between the board and the employees.  It is only in the event of the failure of these negotiations that there will be an appeal to the tribunal.  The tribunal can have any constitution the Deputies wish.  The one thing I am concerned with is that it shall be of such a character that its impartiality will be beyond question.  I do not mind what procedure is adopted, who appoints the chairman of the tribunal or the other members for that matter, provided that there will be a feeling in the minds of the people concerned that the tribunal will be impartial as between the board and the employees, and provided also that if it becomes clear to the public, to the board or to the workers, that over a period of time there is evidence of partiality, of unfair dealings or of unfair handling of relations between the board and the workers, there will be power to change the members of the tribunal.  I am prepared to leave Section 9 over, and I invite Deputies to produce whatever proposals they think are reasonable for the constitution of the tribunal.  I am prepared to stand over the one in the Bill if there is opposition to it.  I do not want a very <Col N="558" /> elaborate provision, but if wo do put into the Bill, as the Government decided must go into the Bill, a provision which will involve the loss of pension rights in the case of a break in the continuity of service, then I think we should have this tribunal as well.</P>

      <P>It is a bit more. What I want to ensure is that superannuation schemes shall contain provisions <Col N="562" /> enabling persons already in the svrvice of the board to include in the service reckonable for superannuation benefits service in the employment of the board prior to the date of tho confirmation of the scheme.  I simply want to get out those two paragraphs, which entail on the people already in the service of the board the payment of the appropriate contributions of compound interest, or else that they would be entitled to reckon only one half of their service.  I want to leave that out so that the board can make its own scheme freely on this point.  I want to leave this thing loosely worded, so that the board will not be tied to those equal contributions for the back service, with the alternative that they simply add half a year for each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed that before.  I cannot agree to modification of that.  We must keep this principle intact, I think, having regard to the general considerations I have described already which have governed our attitude on this Bill.  I think it is not ungenerous to provide that a person with previous service with the board need not, if he likes, pay any contribution in respect of that service, and still get a pension for it, a pension which will be secured to him by reason of an obligation placed on the board to pay into the fund its contribution in respect of that previous service.  I am not prepared to ensure that the whole of that contribution or any more than 50 per cent. of the appropriate contribution, will be paid by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comparison I can make then is with the old Act of 1922 in England to which I have already referred.  I understand that the board had a scheme which they presented to their pensions committee. This is not a matter on which I can speak with certainty, because I have not the calculations.  The scheme aimed at giving, after a certain minimum period of service, ending at about 60 or 65, 50 per cent. of the salary, plus a year's gratuity.  It aimed at giving lesser rates for a person retiring before the 65 period on grounds of ill-health <Col N="563" /> or voluntary retirement.  It aimed at giving people who retired on marriage their full contributions paid into the fund, or a year's salary, whichever was the greater.  It aimed at giving people who left the board not exactly through misconduct but under, say, a bit of a cloud, repayment of the contributions to the fund with interest, and it was possible to do all that on a 5 per cent. contribution from the employee and an equivalent contribution from the board, leaving out the payment for the years of service already in; the board would bear to the full extent the back years' service.  I gave examples the other day showing that certain persons would have to pay as much as 20 per cent. of their salaries.  I believe a calculation has been made that no employee of the board will get off with anything less than 6 per cent., even the lower-paid people, if they want to qualify under this arrears of service section.  I think that is an amazing change from the scheme to which I have referred.  I am speaking now entirely from hearsay, and have not seen the figures, but I am told that that is the pensions scheme which the board had thought of, and which had been found to be actuarially sound.  People who in 1927 certainly thought they had superannuation coming to them now find that they are being asked to pay back with compound interest whatever is found to be their proper contribution. It comes to this, that the majority of them will not do it.  Then another consideration occurs.  People who went into the service of the board at 25 or 30 years of age, and are now 40 or 45 years, will wonder whether, if they pay only from now on for the 20 odd years of remaining service, they will get those benefits, or whether they wih find that what they are likely to get is so whittled down that it would scarcely be worth their while going into the scheme at all.  The whole matter can easily be adjusted by what would not be more than a possible obligation on the fund of £10,000 a year over a certain number of years, and this obligation will never arise again.  I think the Minister might meet me on this point.</P>

      <P>I know that we can undoubtedly say: &ldquo;Here is an undertaking which has a monopoly.  It can charge anything it likes for electricity and pay any pensions it likes.  We know that it will not go burst because, if necessary, we can, increase the charge for electricity and there is no competitor&rdquo;; but if we take that line, that will be the end of this development. We can have regard to the general circumstances of the public services and the pensions payable to public servants and of other public utility companies not in this happy position&mdash;other industrial concerns might want to adopt an analogous scheme for their staffs&mdash; and say: &ldquo;We will have regard to all these and ensure that the Electricity Supply Board scheme is a reasonable scheme which will not involve any undue <Col N="566" /> strain on the Electricity Supply Board revenue which some other undertaking could not undertake.&rdquo;  I say that we are doing well enough for them when we take the general run of pension fund schemes established by other big enterprises just as large as this and with a revenue equal to that which the Electricity Supply Board has when we say that we will be as generous as they are.  In some respects, we are more generous.</P>
      <P>I think it is a mistake to try to do too much.  In any event, all we are doing is putting these limitations on the board.  If they find that their fund is accumulating assets, they can increase the benefits or decrease the contributions, as they like.  It is a matter of experiment for some years, because clearly any calculation as to the contribution that will enable a particular pension to be paid must be subject to the test of time.  It might prove to be right or wrong.  If the fund produces a surplus, there could be an improvement in the position; on the other hand, if the fund produces a deficit, as other funds have done, there will have to be a modification of this position.</P>

      <P>Everybody who wants to start contributory pension schemes must deal with this problem of the person who has been in for a number of years and who is now 45 or 50 years of age.  That is the whole problem of all these schemes.  If we were satisfied merely with having pension schemes applicable to new entrants and not covering old employees, we could draw up very attractive schemes involving low contributions and high pensions. In the case of the Great Southern Railway the problem was made impossible of solution by reason of the fact that the average age of the existing employees was so high that none could afford lo pay the contribution that <Col N="567" /> would bring a pension worth while, and the whole fund could not be made to work at all without a heavy subsidy, which was not possible in the circumstances. Clearly, if you start at the beginning of an organisation, with all the members new in the service and young in years, you will produce a much more attractive scheme than you will when dealing with an old organisation with a high proportion of elderly employees.</P>

      <P>Only one example has been quoted to the House of a body which faced this difficulty.  It is the local officers' superannuation scheme in England in 1922.  They set out a 5 per cent. contribution as a maximum from the employees and an equal contribution from the local authorities, but the local authorities are to bear the burden of the arrears.  That is an example of something which corresponds to a public utility.  The Minister said that this was a concern which has a monopoly, which might raise its prices and which could not &ldquo;go burst&rdquo;. That is very extravagant language to use about these people.  They have done nothing like that.  Think of what they have done.  They have put on them, according to the Banking Commission Report, a burden such as no public company can have, by law, in England. These people have put on them, according to Professor Duncan in the Banking Commission Report, an obligation which no company in England, by law, could carry, and which no public utility known in England or here is carrying.  They both remunerate the capital and renew the plant.  That obligation is put on them and they are facing up to it and are in process of carrying it out.  They further employ a couple of thousand people and distribute £750,000 in salaries free from any inter-position from this Minister or the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now approaching a pension scheme for these people.  They have given good service to the people and their charges are not, in the main, complained of.  I think it is only those people who have no appreciation of what electricity charges used to be in this country who at all venture to complain. <Col N="568" /> That is the reality of the situation and not the hypothetical talk about the people who might say: &ldquo;We are a monopoly and we can increase our charges.&rdquo; The reverse situation is what they have achieved, but nobody has complained that they have set too high a standard in the wages they have paid.  When it comes to this pension matter, the crux of it is that there might be an addition of £10,000 a year for a limited number of years.  The board's revenue at the moment is £2,000,000 and the £10,000 represents .5 per cent. of that revenue.  There is no question of their being unable to bear it, and it would make the pension scheme a reasonably decent matter, instead of something which will cause disquiet and annoyance through the years.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> (1)  When a superannuation scheme has been confirmed by the Minister, the Minister may, by the order confirming such scheme or by a subsequent order made after consultation with the Minister for Finance, make regulations for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  providing for the setting up of the fund required by such scheme to be set up for the purposes thereof, and providing for the vesting of such fund in trustees and for the appointment of such trustees from time to time as occasion requires;</P>
    <P>(b)  providing for the investment of such fund in accordance with this act;</P>
    <P>(c)  providing for the keeping and audit of the accounts of such fund;</P>
    <P>(d)  providing for such other matters relating to the establishment, maintenance, and administration of such fund as the Minister considers proper to be provided for.</P>
    <P>(3)  It shall be lawful for the trustees of a fund set up for the purposes of a superannuation scheme to lend to the board, and for the board to borrow from such trustees, out of such fund such moneys as such trustees and the board shall think proper, and whenever any such moneys are so lent by such trustees to the board the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the board shall pay to such trustees interest on such moneys at such rate as shall from time to time be agreed upon by such trustees and the board, with the consent of the Minister for Finance;</P>
    <P>(b)  such moneys shall be repayable on three months' notice given in writing by such trustees to the board or by the board to such trustees;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> (c)  such moneys shall be expended by the board solely for the purpose of the exercise and performance of the powers and functions conferred by law on the board;</P>
    <P>(d)  such moneys and the interest thereon shall, by virtue of this section, be charged on and recoverable out of all property on which advances by the Minister for Finance to the board and the interest and sinking fund payments in respect thereof are for the time being charged and shall, as against such property, rank next after the charges mentioned in Section 16 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  A fund set up for the purposes of a superannuation scheme shall be deemed to be set up under an irrevocable trust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; in line 17 down to and including the word &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; in line 19, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the board may (subject to the provisions of this section)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I, previously, on an earlier section, dealt with this matter of the regulations being made by the Minister instead of by the board.  This is the other side of it.  Seeing that the scheme will have to be criticised and passed by two Ministers, I suggest that once it has been passed, the making of regulations concerning these matters might be left to the board instead of to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Once we have decided upon the principle of a statutory fund at all, these regulations must be made by the Minister concerned, and not by the board, and I do not think it is unreasonable, in the circumstances, that these powers should be left with the Minister.  The State has invested a large sum of money in the electricity supply undertaking, and the Minister for Finance, in particular.  I think, has a right to be consulted in any matters which may affect the revenue of the <Col N="573" /> board.  If we had decided merely to empower the board to pay any pensions they liked, and left it at that, without any statutory obligations as to the form of the pensions scheme at all, this would not arise, but now that we have a statutory fund I think this power should be exercised by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have it decided that any scheme they set up has to be approved of by two Ministers, and let us agree further that there are statutory obligations on them in regard to the scheme, such as that it must be on the basis of equal contributions, the number of years' service, and so on&mdash; let us take it that all that is decided upon and that we are now on the question of the fund.  There is a scheme which has to be passed and approved by two Ministers, and that goes back to the board.  Are the board not to be trusted to make their own regulations, providing for the setting-up of the fund, for the investment of the fund, for the appointment of trustees, and so on?  Is that something that the board is incompetent to do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have decided on the principle of a statutory fund&mdash;that is, the superannuation fund to be set <Col N="574" /> up under this statute&mdash;and, that being so, there devolves upon the State the obligation of ensuring that the management of the fund is sound and that proper regulations are made for the appointment of trustees, the investment of the fund, and so on.  I do not think the Ministers should divest themselves of control over these matters.</P>

I know very well that the Departmental mind is horrified at the thought of the board being set loose at all, but what on earth is the reason for having the Minister make these regulations?</P>

It is in funds and the trustees of the fund may lend to the board and the board may borrow from the trustees out of the fund.  You have the two parties there at arms' length&mdash;the board and the trustees&mdash;to come to agreement on the rate of interest.

Having regard to the obligation on the Minister for Finance to supervise the general capital finances of the board, he should be consulted.

      <Col N="577" /> At the moment, the Minister borrows from the public at a certain rate of interest and lends to the public at a higher rate and makes a bit.  What is contemplated here is that the superannuation fund may come to such a point that the board would like to borrow from the fund instead of from the Minister.  Then the Minister for Finance is going to step in and see that they pay his exorbitant rate.  The alternative before the board may be to subsidise the fund instead of paying a higher rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Those circumstances are least likely to occur.  It must not be supposed that the governing body of the fund and the board are two entirely separate and antagonistic bodies. The governing body of the fund will be the board in another form.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be borrowing from the public at a lower rate than at which he lends to the board and may be making a bit on the transaction.  If the board were allowed to go to the public to look for a loan they may get it at a lower rate of interest.  The Minister is charging them more than administration expenses.</P>

      <P>The fund may become so big that they may be able to supply the money out of it.  The board's capital has been developing at the rate of £1,000,000 per year.  The present capital, after 16 years, is about £14,000,000.  The Minister is afraid that the fund may lend at a lower rate of interest than the Minister can get from them.</P>

I am all the time thinking that the Minister is not intending to put in a lot of juveniles as trustees, but adults of intelligence and financial probity, to look after this.

      <P>This seems rather strange, in view of the Minister's declared object to keep control of the rate of interest.  The paragraph, as drafted, will enable the board, by not consenting to the Minister for Finance, to get a loan without interest.  The section says: &ldquo;At such rate as shall from time to time be agreed upon... with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the scheme it may be found, but it is not right one way or the other.  In that situation I do not see the use of the Minister for Finance.  All this dragging in of Ministers to sanction this and that is the greatest nonsense, and is bringing administration into disrepute.  I have never known a case in which a proposition has been put up to the Minister in the last ten years in which it has not taken days, weeks or months to get the necessary sanction.  I know one case of a dispensary doctor, where it took the Minister 12 months to make up his mind as to what pension he was to get.  A boy leaving school could have made it up.  That is what the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service are bringing this country to. As far as this is concerned, the case made for the Minister for Finance coming in here is just humbug.  He can serve no useful purpose.  If the trustees are sensible people and the board a sensible board there is no necessity in the world for bringing in an outsider, and it simply means a waste of time.</P>

      <P>It is done in numerous pensions schemes, even in the case of the Great Southern Railways, where it was contemplated that the fund might lend to the board.  It is not obligatory on the trustees to lend to the board at all.  They can invest in any particular class of securities which are prescribed, but they must not lend to the board at a lower rate or at a higher rate than the board could obtain outside. The alternative to such control is for the Minister to put in the Bill the rate&mdash;4 per cent. or 4½ per cent., say&mdash;at which the fund may lend to the board, but I think that it is better to have it flexible.</P>

If the board can borrow at such a rate, the Minister wants to provide that this fund will get a higher rate of interest than that obtainable outside.</P>

Surely, these two bodies&mdash;the trustees and the board&mdash;themselves can decide on that question.  It is a liability of the concern, if it is based on 4 per cent. Bringing in the Minister for Finance will probably mean that the question must be raised and there will have to be the Minister's sanction and you have all this political turmoil over nothing.

The main reason for the section as it stands is that I think it desirable to bring to the notice of manual workers in a personal way that besides participating in the scheme there is an obligation attached.  I would be prepared to produce an amendment which would require the board to notify each of the manual workers that this set of circumstances was associated with their membership of the fund.  It is not of importance what way it is done, but I think it is desirable that the individual worker who is about to become a member should understand what the consequences of membership are, and that there is an obligation on the board or someone to ensure that he is so notified.</P>

      <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;excluded person&rdquo; means a person employed by the board who was transferred to the service of the board under sub-section (9) of Section 39 of the Principal Act and has, by virtue of such transfer, a right to superannuation benefits payable by the board and in respect of whom it is provided by this Act that no superannuation scheme shall apply to or enable superannuation benefits thereunder to be received by him;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;appropriate superannuation scheme&rdquo; means, in relation to an excluded person, the superannuation scheme which would apply to him if he were not an excluded person.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any excluded person may, by application in writing made to the board not later than one month after the confirmation by the Minister of the appropriate superannuation scheme, elect to be deemed to have surrendered the superannuation benefits to which he is entitled by virtue of his transfer to the service of the board and to be entitled in lieu thereof to receive from the board the like superannuation benefits as those which he would be entitled to receive under the appropriate superannuation scheme if that scheme applied to him.</P>
      <P>(3)  The following provisions shall apply and have effect in relation to every excluded person who makes to the board, within the time limited by the next preceding sub-section of this section, such application as is mentioned in that sub-section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  such excluded person shall not be entitled to receive any of <Col N="584" /> the superannuation benefits to which he was entitled by virtue of his transfer to the service of the board;</P>

    <P>(c)  such person shall be entitled to reckon for the purposes of the superannuation benefits to which he is entitled under the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section the same number of years of continuous service as he would have been entitled to reckon for the purposes of the superannuation benefits to which he would have been entitled if he had not made the said application to the board but subject to the provisions of the appropriate superannuation scheme in relation to the calculation of continuous service;</P>
    <P>(d)  notwithstanding anything contained in the next preceding paragraph of this section, such person shall not be entitled to receive, in respect of any particular benefit, any greater amount than the maximum amount fixed by the appropriate superannuation scheme in respect of that benefit;</P>
    <P>(e)  for the purpose of calculating the superannuation benefits to which such person would have been entitled under the appropriate superannuation scheme if that scheme had applied to him, there shall be deemed to have been duly paid by or in respect of him the contributions appropriate under the said scheme to the number of years of service which he is entitled under this sub-section to reckon;</P>
    <P>(f)  subject to the foregoing provisions of this sub-section, the provisions of the appropriate superannuation scheme and of this Act shall apply and have effect in relation to such person in like manner in all respects as if such scheme applied to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> (4)  Where the appropriate superannuation scheme in respect of an excluded person is the manual workers superannuation scheme, an application under this section by such person to the board shall be void and of no effect unless it is accompanied by a declaration, signed by such person, to the same effect as the declaration the deposit of which with the board is made by this Act a condition precedent to the payment of contributions and the receipt of superannuation benefits under the manual workers superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>(5)  All superannuation benefits which an excluded person becomes entitled under this section to receive from the board shall be paid by the board as part of its general expenses.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every dispute which shall arise between the board and an excluded person (including a person claiming to be an excluded person) in relation to this section or any of the provisions thereof shall, at the request of the board or of such person be referred to and determined by the tribunal, and the decision of the tribunal thereon shall be final and binding on the board and on such person.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In computing for the purpose of this Act the service of a person who is in the service of the board at the date of the passing of this Act and who is a person entitled to superannuation benefits under this Act the board may add to the period of service reckonable for such benefits, such period, not exceeding ten years as the board shall think proper having regard to the age, length of service and other special and relevant circumstances of such person but subject always to the proviso that the pension payable to such person shall not by reason of such added period of service exceed the maximum pension payable under the appropriate part of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that a note here states that acceptance of this amendment means the destruction of Section 14, although I think the two should run together. Section 14 is tied to this, in that it only applies to anybody precluded on the ground of ill-health from paying contributions and receiving a pension under the superannuation scheme That brings up another consideration. Take the position of some people in the service of the board who find that they cannot pay contributions because of bad health.  They may say that the bad health was brought about by over work or something associated with service in the board, I do not know if there is any provision like that in the superannuation scheme which precludes <Col N="587" /> people paying contributions on the ground of ill-health.  In other words, you refuse them admission because there is a bad medical certificate. This is to apply not only to new entrants but to people already in the service.  As the Bill stands if these people want to get the full value for the years they have served, they must make a heavy contribution.  The section does say that they get one year counted for every two years of service. I suggest as an alternative, that the board should take into consideration special circumstances and qualifications and that there might be certain added years.  The period is limited in this way: &ldquo;the board may add to the period of service reckonable for such benefits, such period, not exceeding ten years, as the board shall think proper having regard to the age, length of service and other special and relevant circumstances.&rdquo; There is super-added a proviso that, even adding the years, nobody can get more than the pension that would have been payable to him if he had subscribed right along the line.  It is another way of meeting a certain section, but nothing like a majority, of the people in the service of the board.  It is to meet the case of higher-paid employees who are going to get full benefit but who will have to pay up to 20 per cent. of their salaries.  I think that would be intolerable on present salaries.</P>

      <P>I was not too sure that it would not have in some way cut across what was meant in Section 14.  I can see some people who are in, and who would fall under heavy penalties in the earlier section, who might creep out under this, but only if they are broken down in health by reason of their activities in the service. I frankly admit that this is another way of easing the situation of people already in the service of the board at high rates of pay and who, if the Bill stands in its present form, will have to pay a very high proportion of their salaries to get the full years of service reckoned for pension.  It is going to be permissible for the board to give added years in respect of certain people.  I put down the phrase as it occurred to me.  There are two other limitations, that it only applies to people in the employment of the board and will not apply to new entrants. These are the two overriding conditions. Ten is the highest number of added years, and no case can be made to bring pensions higher than the appropriate pensions if persons paid all along the line.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £444,768 chun slánuithe na suime is gáchun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1943, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Talmhaidheachta agus seirbhísí áirithe atá, fé riaradh na hOifige sin, ar a-n éirmhítear Ildeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £444,768 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1943, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the current year shows a net decrease of £451,677 compared with 1941-42.  This decrease is accounted for principally by three items, namely, sub-heads B, G (3) and N (1).  Sub-heads B and N (1) are concerned with the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The foot-and-mouth outbreak last year cost something like £480,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> There is only a token estimate in for that purpose this year, in the hope that we may not again be up against the same situation.  The third item that accounts for the decrease is that there is no subsidy this year for artificial manures, and there is, therefore, a saving under sub-head G (3) of £52,875.  I think these are the only remarks I have to make at the moment about the sub-heads as far as any decreases or increases are concerned.</P>
    <P>The big task that is before us in the Department of Agriculture this year is to see that, on account of the scarcity of imports, we shall have more and more home-grown food of a certain variety, principally in the form of grain.  We must, if at all possible, become self-sufficient in this coming harvest in wheat production.  That has been our aim over the last two or three years.  Deputies know that last year the Statistics Department reported that we had 463,000 acres of wheat.  That was an increase from 305,000 acres in the previous year.  We must, if at all possible, go further than that in this coming year.  In order to encourage the production of wheat, a price of 50/- a barrel has been guaranteed. According to all the reports, the position looked, I must say, very promising up to about a fortnight ago, when the bad weather set in.  Even so, if we get fine weather, I think a considerable area may still be put under wheat this year.  We had a good supply of seed wheat of winter varieties, in fact more than we required.  Many farmers made provision for their own seed requirements or obtained them by exchanging seed with other farmers. In addition, our own seed merchants assembled large stocks of winter wheat for sale.  They also imported a substantial quantity of winter seed wheat. At the end of the winter season we had a good lot of wheat, which was meant for seed, left over.</P>
    <P>The position as regards supplies of seed wheat of the spring varieties is also satisfactory.  In August last the Irish Seed and Nursery Trades Association agreed to a scheme for assembling 100,000 barrels of seed wheat of spring varieties so as to ensure that there would be an ample supply.  There <Col N="591" /> was an agreement made with that association that if a portion of this wheat was left over they would be paid 50/- a barrel for it, but the agreement would hold only if less than a quarter of the amount assembled by them was left over.  That condition may involve a commitment of about £5,000.  That is true of every barrel of wheat for which we are liable between the 50/- which is payable to them, and the amount which we would get from the millers of 41/- per barrel.  There was only a very limited quantity of imported spring seed.  The demand for it was not very great, I think.  At any rate, very little came in.  Orders were made fixing the price of seed wheat.  It is not necessary to go into them now because the season is practically over except perhaps to mention that the price of spring seed is 62/6 per barrel.</P>
    <P>With regard to barley and oats, under sub-head O. 11., there is a sum of £2,000 provided to cover the expenses of the Cereals Distribution Committee from the period 1st April to the 31st August, 1942.  This committee was established last August for the purpose of advising me on matters relating to the assembly and distribution of oats of the 1941 harvest, and to act as my agent in giving directions for the disposal of barley and oats purchased by licensed dealers.  Although the acreage under barley and oats was higher in 1941 than in 1940, in the case of barley up to 28 per cent. and of oats up to 14 per cent., still the proportion of the crop marketed was very low. This may be accounted for by the fact that no maize was coming in, and that farmers had to keep a good deal more of their crop for feeding.  They also, possibly in many cases, kept more for seed.</P>
    <P>The quantity of oats marketed is creating a difficulty in providing a sufficient supply of oatmeal.  There is a good demand for oatmeal because of the restricted flour supply.  The supply of barley seed in the hands of maltsters will be sufficient to meet the demand. It was found necessary, early in January, to suspend the malting of barley for brewing and distilling in <Col N="592" /> order to provide a reserve of barley for use in bread.</P>
    <P>Malting for beer has now been resumed on account of the improvement in the position as regards imported wheat, but the supplies of barley and oats on hands do not warrant any hope that it will be possible in the near future to release either cereal for use in the feeding of animals.  The position as to these cereals has been injuriously affected by transactions in the black market. Efforts have been made to restrict black market operations by prosecutions and the impounding of stocks of grain which were acquired in contravention of the law.</P>
    <P>The position, at any rate, as regards seed wheat, seed potatoes and seed barley is, on the whole, satisfactory, but as regards root crops it is not so good.  The great bulk of our mangels, turnip and swede seeds were imported ordinarily from Great Britain.  It is feared the British authorities will not be able to export any quantity of these seeds this present year.  About this time last year or a little earlier it was anticipated that the seed would be very scarce just now and farmers wers advised as far as possible to grow a certain small quantity of barley and turnip seed for their own use.  Certain instructions were issued as to how this could be done.  A good number of farmers availed of that advice and have their own mangel and turnip seeds. Certain of our seeds merchants also arranged with farmers to grow some mangel seed and turnip seed for them. Even so, I am afraid that there will not be sufficient for our full requirements. Farmers have been advised to be as economical as possible in the amount of seed they use.  The prospect, I think, for turnip and swede seeds is better than that for mangel seeds.  We may, I think, succeed in having a fair supply of seeds for turnips and swedes but I think it is fairly certain that we will not have enough mangel seed and, in view of this, arrangements have been made with the Irish Sugar Company to release large quantities of beet seed which, if sown where mangel seed cannot be got, will yield a suitable crop for stock-feeding.  The price of these <Col N="593" /> beet seeds haa also been fixed at a very reasonable level.</P>
    <P>There is no change since the subject was discussed here before in the artificial manure position.  There will be one grade of compound fertiliser issued this year.  It will be put on the market in the form of a single compound known as emergency compound fertiliser and supplies will be very limited.  The guaranteed analysis of this fertiliser is as follows:&mdash;20 per cent. soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. citric soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. insoluble phosphate, with 1 per cent. nitrogen and 1 per cent. potash.  In order to provide as far as possible for an equitable distribution of even this small quantity, an Order was made regulating how this manure would be distributed.  Under the Order a retail distributor is authorised to supply to an established customer, that is, a customer who bought artificial manures from him last year, a quantity of this fertiliser not in excess of 25 per cent. of what he purchased last year and he cannot take on a new customer without a permit from me.  The reason, of course, for this limitation is obvious because there is not available more than about one-fourth of what was available last year.  An Order has been made at the same time by the Department of Supplies with effect as from the 22nd February, fixing the minimum retail price of this compound at £10 per ton plus cost of transport from manufacturer's premises to the railway or canal station nearest the premises of the vendor.  Farmers have been advised to increase by all possible means the supplies of farmyard manure by a more liberal use of surplus straw, etc., and also, as far as they can, to make use of the liquid manure.  Along the seaboard greater use will be made of seaweed.</P>
    <P>A lime scheme subsidised by the State and the county committees of agriculture is to be put in operation throughout the country and farmers are urged to take full advantage of this scheme as, in the present circumstances, whilst we cannot claim that lime is a substitute for artificial manures, we do know that it may make certain feeding matter in the soil <Col N="594" /> available for plant feeding where it otherwise would not be available.  The amount it is expected will be spent on this scheme is £71,000.</P>
    <P>The Compulsory Tillage Order, known as No. 124, requires occupiers of agricultural laud to cultivate 25 per cent. of their arable land and gives me the necessary powers to enter on land that is not tilled under the Order. Up to the ]3th April, 98 holdings were entered on and arrangements have been made for the cultivation of this land either by means of conacre lettings or by the Department's officers directly.</P>
    <P>We have had many difficulties to face owing to the shortage of supplies.  One of them is the question of timber.  As many Deputies have been agitating about this matter I would like to say a few words on it.  A permit is required from the Minister for Supplies for timber of any quantity exceeding in value £5 per month and discussions have been taking place between the Department of Supplies and my Department.  Any applications for timber for agricultural purposes usually come to my Department for advice.  We have been trying so far to provide the timber necessary.  The varieties that are available are principally spruce and beech, beech being more plentiful, as it happens, than spruce because beech is not used for many of the purposes for which spruce could be used.  We have consequently been trying to use beech for butter boxes and where the beech is very well seasoned it has been good on the whole but, if not thoroughly seasoned, has given rise to moulds.  We have used less valuable timber for the making of egg cases and also boxes for the export of such things as meat, fish, rabbits, poultry and so on.  We have tried to get these cases and boxes returned.  We have not succeeded in getting returned the butter boxes that were sent out under butter last year. We did succeed, however, in getting a good number of the egg cases returned &mdash;not all&mdash;but they have been coming back.  We have not tried to get the boxes which go out under fish, meat <Col N="595" /> and so on because we feel they could not be used again.  They would be badly stained and, being made of rather poor material, could hardly be used a second time.</P>
    <P>Another supply question is binder twine.  We hope, when the harvest time arrives, to have a fair supply, probably enough if used carefully by the farmers concerned and not asked for except by those who want to use it.  We have hopes of getting in a certain amount of raw material for the making of binder twine between this and the next harvest and in that way to make up a certain deficiency.  Arrangements are being made to try native raw material so far as possible next year and experiments have been carried on with green flax and other materials.  I think it will be possible at least to provide some of the binder twine necessary from home-grown materials of that kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to machinery, threshing mills, agricultural tractors, and tractor ploughs, which were all imported freely and in increasing numbers up to 1940, are becoming somewhat short.  They are almost impossible to secure now. But, luckily, there are reasonable supplies of spare parts either in stock or on order, and the latter, I think, will arrive.  It is most important for owners of threshing mills, binders, and such machines, to look after the machines as soon as possible so as to order the necessary spare parts, and not leave the repairs or the putting into order of those machines until the last moment. The output of horse-drawn farm machinery, as well as the supply of spare parts by home manufacturers, is, considering the difficulties encountered, being maintained at a reasonable level. The curtailment of imports of essential raw material is, however, affecting production, and this, it is feared, will become worse as time goes on.  In view of the kerosene and petrol position, farmers should, so far as possible, keep their horse-drawn machinery in order, and have it available if the fuel position should become worse.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fuel position, the Department keeps in constant contact <Col N="596" /> with the Department of Supplies, and I must say that, so far as paraffin for tractors is concerned, we have not nearly as many complaints this year as we had last year.  If we are to judge this matter by the number of complaints that come in, the scheme of issuing permits for paraffin would appear to be running very much more smoothly this year than last year. Owners of agricultural tractors are granted allowances on the basis of the work to be done, and are required to furnish in their application forms particulars of the work.  In the case of poultry breeders, who require kerosene for incubating equipment, a rather satisfactory arrangement was made with the Department of Supplies; I mean satisfactory considering the amount of paraffin available.  Monthly permits have been issued since November, 1941, to poultry station-holders under the poultry stations scheme, and similar permits have been issued to poultry farmers and institutions since January.  In December, 1941, allocations were made to holders of Putnam lamps in connection with the poultry stations scheme, and permits to ordinary owners of incubators were issued in January, as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>A fairly large number of complaints has been received during the last few months from poultry breeders who were not granted any allowances of kerosene, or who stated that the allowances granted to them were inadequate. These complaints were taken up with the Department of Supplies as they occurred.  The difficulty in many cases appeared to arise from the fact that the poultry breeders concerned failed to apply under the Emergency Powers (Kerosene Rationing) Order, 1941, for registration as industrial users of kerosene before the closing date&mdash;31st May, 1941.  However, as the cases came under our notice, we got them rectified in most cases by sending them on to the Department of Supplies. It would be as well for such people to register in time for the coming year.  Kerosene was also supplied to egg dealers for egg testing.</P>
    <P>Representations were also made by my Department to the Departinent of <Col N="597" /> Supplies with a view to granting a special allowance of kerosene to farmers for lighting purposes during the winter months, but the Department of Supplies intimated that it was not practicable to grant such allowances except in the case of registered dairy farmers.  Allowances of petrol and kerosene for stationary engines used on farms are being granted to registered users and we have not received very many complaints from such users. Some complaints have been received from lorry owners that the allowances of petrol granted to them for the haulage of lime and culm for lime burning are inadequate.  From inquiries made to the Department of Supplies we find that most of these lorry owners are receiving a supplementary allowance of petrol equivalent to the basic allowance&mdash;that is usually 40 gallons basic and 40 gallons supplementary&mdash;and we understand from the Department of Supplies that that is the maximum amount that is given to any lorry owner.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to the Department of Supplies also on behalf of limekiln owners who require culm for burning lime for agricultural purposes. That Department intimated that, in the case of kiln-owners situate outside the scheduled turf area, that is in the coal areas, permits for the purchase of culm were granted, and in the case of limekiln owners in the turf areas, where it was proved to the satisfaction of the Minister for Supplies that turf could not be used, permits were also issued.  In some cases the owners used a certain amount of turf and a certain amount of culm as a mixture.</P>
    <P>The next matter about which I want to say a few words is butter.  The production of creamery butter for the year ending 31st March was 658,000 cwts., which is practically the same as for the year ended 31st March, 1911.  It was practically the same last year as the year before; I think there was only a difference of about 3,000 cwts.  This was disappointing because in the summer and autumn of 1940 there waa a long period of drought and a decline in milk production was <Col N="598" /> only to be expected on account of that.  Last year we had no such period of drought and one would expect the production of milk to be higher, but it did not prove to be higher as a matter of fact.  There was practically no reduction&mdash;there was some slight reduction, of course&mdash; owing to foot-and-mouth disease, because the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease did not affect the main creamery districts.</P>
    <P>The quantity of butter stored last winter was 160,000 cwts. which is almost twice as high as ever was stored before, and indeed was as much as we had cold-storage capacity for.  As from August lust, imported fats ceased to be available and this naturally resulted in a substantial increase in the home consumption of creamery butter, which for the year amounted to the very high figure of £544,000 cwts.  Home consumption could have absorbed another 20,000 cwts. if we had it.  But, as I said already, we could not store more, because we had not the capacity.  We are, however, making provision for a greater cold storage capacity next winter and we hope to store more butter than we did this year.  The value of butter was maintained throughout the 12 months at the figure of 158/- per cwt.  This was effected by a retail price of 1/7 per lb. which meant to the creameries 152/- per cwt.  They were paid in addition to that a production allowance of 6/- per cwt. and this enabled the creameries in turn to pay about 6d. per gallon for milk.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider that an adequate price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not expressing any view on that at the moment.  Having regard to the fact that probably no imported fats will be available this year, home consumption will probably show a substantial increase, with probably a corresponding diminution in the export of butter.  In fact it may happen that we shall have no butter at all for export.  We do hope, however, at least to provide enough for home consumption <Col N="599" /> during the summer and autumn period and also a sufficient quantity to store for our winter requirements.</P>
      <P>As regards pigs, the number of pigs bought for curing in bacon factories in 1941 was 827,000.  That compares with 1,100,000 in 1940.  Towards the end of the summer of 1941, when the decline in pig stocks had become evident, steps were taken to conserve supplies and to build up reserve stocks of bacon and pig products for home consumption. There was another difficulty in finding sufficient storage for that bacon, but luckily the stocks were being built up as butter stocks were being taken out. No bacon has been exported since the 30th September, 1941.  At the same time, the export of live pigs was stopped and every pig produced since then has been kept within the country. For the last four or five weeks, we have reached a stage where we are beginning to draw on these stocks.  In other words, the number of pigs coming into the bacon factories now are not sufficient to meet home consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not because of the drop in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The drop in price may have induced people to eat more bacon but that is not the only reason.  At that time also, the Government made an Emergency Powers Order reintroducing a system of production periods and quotas on a carcase basis so as to ensure an equitable distribution of supplies of pigs amongst the various bacon factories.  The old provisions relating to bacon production periods and quotas had been suspended from the 1st March, 1940.  The decline in pig stocks has continued, due mainly to the shortage of feeding stuffs.  At the end of 1941, there was a marked increase in the dead weights of pigs sold to bacon factories, the weights being much in excess of those suited to the requirements of the trade. Furthermore, the absorption of the limited supplies of feeding stuffs available for feeding pigs to such weights was considered most undesirable.  In <Col N="600" /> determining a proper price to be paid for pigs, consideration was given to theae matters and lower prices were fixed at the beginning of 1912.  Subsequently it was found that a proportion of excessively heavy pigs continued to be marketed and that, in addition, wheat was being fed to pigs.  The situation called for further measures to correct the conditions reffered to and, accordingly, pig prices were further reduced in the middle of February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was fairly extensively used in one place.  In one week, wheat was found in the stomachs of certain pigs in 16 factories out of 33.  That was a fairly big proportion.  I should close my remarks on this matter by saying that there is no indication of any increase in pig production up to the moment.  All I can say is that it would appear, on the figures we are getting now, that production is not going to become any worse.  That would mean that there may not be any improvement as regards the numbers produced for the next 12 months, except for a <Col N="601" /> very slight seasonal increase in the harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to eggs, despite the difficulties arising from the emergency situation, the egg industry had on the whole a good year.  The improvement in the quality and cleanliness of our eggs resulting from the operation of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act was maintained during the year. The code-marking of eggs, to indicate the period during which they were tested and found to be fresh, enabled consumers on the home market to purchase supplies with confidence.  I think that in that way the Act passed in 1939 had a very good effect.  The arrangement by which the export of eggs was entrusted to a central selling organisation&mdash;Messrs.  Eggsports, Ltd.&mdash;worked well during the year, not only from the point of view of our shippers, but also from that of the distributing association in Great Britain.  Adverse reports from cross-Channel centres were relatively few, and the majority of these related to the use of defective packing materials with resulting injury to the eggs.  We have had scarcely any complaints with regard to stale eggs or bad eggs. There was some increase in exports at the beginning of this year, during January and February, but that increase was converted into a decrease in March, so that taking 1942 to date, there has not been much change in the situation.  The egg industry has to contend with various difficulties. The scarcity of feeding stuffs, as in the case of pigs, is the first difficulty.  Then there is also difficulty experienced in securing packing materials, including egg boxes.  There is a further difficulty in collecting eggs in remote districts, where lorries were largely used, owing to the petrol shortage.  Every effort is being made to overcome these difficulties, and arrangements have been made with the British Ministry of Food for the return of the maximum number of packages despatched from this country.  In this way, we hope to conserve supplies of timber available for such purposes in the country. The prices which our eggs are fetching on the home and export markets are such as to enable a reasonably <Col N="602" /> remunerative price to be paid to producers and every effort is being made to ensure that producers receive a fair price having regard to all the circumstances.  On the whole, I think the outlook for the egg trade is not unsatisfactory although the difficulties which I have mentioned may be at least as bad, if not worse, in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    <P>The year was a good one for the poultry trade.  Exports rose in quantity and in value.  Exports of live poultry were stopped towards the end of the year under an Order which came into operation on the 17th November, 1941.  On the same date the Emergency Powers (Export of Dead Poultry and Rabbits) Order, 1941, came into operation. The effect of this Order was to restrict the export of dead poultry and rabbits to traders who were granted licences for the purpose.   These licences were granted to traders who had the necessary premises and other facilities for carrying on the exports under proper conditions.  All exporters had to export through the central agency&mdash;Messrs.  Eggsports Ltd.  Eggs, poultry and rabbits are all going through that agency now.  The quality of our poultry and rabbits has, I think shown very considerable improvement. Owing to the difficulty of ensuring that our rabbits may be exported in good condition during the summer, it is contemplated making an Order to prohibit export of rabbits during certain months of the summer.  Rabbits very quickly deteriorate, and do not travel well in warm weather.  In fact there were very considerable losses on them last year, so I intend to make the Order to which I have referred.  My present intention is that the period covered by the Order should be from 1st May to the end of August.  Normally, the exports of rabbits during that period are very low.  As a matter of fact, during those four months the Order will not hurt anybody very much.  I think I am right in saying that the total exports during those four months last year were not as high as those for one month in the high exporting period.</P>

      <P>There is no harm in saying that the Deputy sent me notice about that, but I have not had an opportunity of inquiring into it yet.  I do mean to inquire into it.  They have certainly not been stopped through any order or advice ot the Department. There is only one other thing to which I have to refer, and that is the matter of allotments.   It is estimated that there will be about 26,400 allotments this year, as compared with 21,595 in 1941.  Plot-holders, like everybody else, will have their difficulties this year through the shortage of artificial manures, but in spite of that we hope they will get good returns, and their combined efforts will add a very valuable contribution to the drive for more food.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I do so on the grounds that neither in the statement we have heard from the Minister nor in that portion of the Book of Estimates dealing with this particular Estimate is there any evidence of a clear and comprehensive policy for agriculture such as the situation in this country to-day demands. I could not help feeling, during the time I listened to the portion of the Minister's speech which I heard, that it is a pity that the Minister shares with his colleagues in the Cabinet that universal pessimism which seems to predominate in Ministerial speeches at the present time, and, indeed, for a considerable time past.  The gloom of the world situation is sufficiently bad without having added to it continuously the kind of dreary speeches that we have been hearing.  I think the people would be just as grateful, perhaps more grateful, if the tone of Ministerial utterances were not so universally gloomy as it has been for a considerable time, and I say that without desiring in any way to ignore the seriousness of the position which faces this country at the present time.  What the people regret most is that there is no evidence of a policy to deal with that situation, and I think that is particularly true of the Estimate now under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum required is £666,768, and this has shown a decrease of a considerable amount which is made up of a saving as a result of the elimination of the cattle diseases that were rampant last year.  I am neither competent nor anxious to discuss the cattle plague that occurred here last year, except to the extent of saying that I gathered both in this House and outside of it that there was a great deal of dissatisfaction with Ministerial policy in regard to the matter.  That is a subject which will be dealt with by other people more competent to <Col N="605" /> speak on the question than I am, so there I leave it.  I do want to emphasise what I think has been obvious in this country in the last five or six mouths, and that is how regrettable it is that there should be a policy of hesitancy and indecision with regard to Ministerial actions on many important public matters.  I think the hesitancy and indecision of which we had evidence in regard to fixing the price of wheat is a very serious matter indeed for this country.  I believe that if the steps which were belatedly taken in regard to fixing a price for wheat had been taken courageously and definitely at a much earlier time, many of the questions which will probably appear on the Order Paper from time to time, questions such as we heard to-day, would not have to be asked or to be answered, and there would not be any need for the panicky last-minute appeals with regard to the sowing of wheat that had to be made recently.  If the price had been fixed at the proper time, a much better situation would exist now, and I think the Minister is blameworthy in that particular matter to a very considerable extent.  I must say that I did not notice in the Minister's statement here this evening any evidence of that kind of policy one would expect to hear enunciated on a serious occasion of this kind with regard to the future organisation of agriculture here.  The country is crying out for some announcement of a policy of that kind at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be unaware of the fact that rural depopulation is proceeding at a very alarming rate.  It is probably no exaggeration to say that the people left the rural districts last year and are leaving them at the present time at a rate that has had no parallel since the famine days.  That circumstance should certainly compel the Minister and his colleagues in the Government, and this House generally, to think seriously on the whole question of the causes of that mass emigration, and its relation to the present position of our main industry.  Amongst the very large number of people who have left this country in recent months has been a very large number of <Col N="606" /> farmers' sons, and particularly smaller farmers' sons, from the southern counties who are a very serious loss to the country.  With them have gone some of the best young men, the agricultural worker type of person, whose services will so very much be needed in the near future.  I do not want to envisage what the situation will be when all the thousands who have left will have no alternative at the end of the war employment which will engage their attention for some time yet but to return to this country, and surely if we have not yet got any policy for dealing with such a situation, or for dealing with the situation that will exist before that time, we ought at least to have some evidence now that preparations are being made for the consideration of that question in the very near future, and almost immediately.</P>
    <P>This exodus from the countryside is a very serious matter and I do not think it can be brushed aside by merely saying that people are leaving for the sake of change, for variety of employment, or for securing more congenial employment, or even better wages, elsewhere.  I believe it is true of the very large number of people who have left, and particularly true of people who have left all they had, in the world in the way of families and family associations behind them, that they would not have taken that step without very serious reasons for doing so, and there is no use in disguising the fact that, for the majority, leaving the country was the only alternative to the poverty and the difficulties of life that they had to endure up to the time they left.  Yet they were the best people in the country. If the school rolls show fewer children to-day and if the whole evidence of that decay which rural depopulation causes is growing, it is because people of that type have left the country.  I see no hope of an increase in the number of school-going children, or an increase in the population of the countryside in the future, unless, through the operations of the Minister's Department particularly, with some assistance from his colleagues, a policy is devised for keeping such people at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> Agricultural labourers have gone out of the country in order to get a better wage in England.  I am not one of those who believe that you can make the agricultural worker completely prosperous without having regard for the person who is his employer, the farmer.  I have very often seen the difficulties of many of our farmers in the constituency I speak for.  These people have not been free from one end of the year to the other from difficulties of their own, and I have not to be convinced, because I was convinced very many years ago, that in order to make the condition of our agricultural labourers safe, the industry generally must be helped and the men who employ agricultural workers must be put in a position in which they can afford to do it.  I believe there would be very little difficulty about wages if the agricultural industry were put in a much better position than that in which it is now and nobody who knows conditions in the country at present can say there is not a great deal to be done in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some inquiries about the immediate future in relation to fertilisers.  There is only a very small amount, a token amount, set out in the Estimate and I should like to emphasise what has already been very well emphasised by one of my colleagues from West Cork, Deputy O'Donovan, that is, the need for doing something to find alternatives in view of the present shortage of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I live in a constituency where much better use might be made of the resources which nature has placed at the disposal of the people in the way of sea sand and seaweed, and there should also be a more extensive use of that fertiliser, lime, which can be found in generous quantities in certain parts of County Cork.  I should like to see the Government giving evidence of a wider appreciation of the urgent need for taking steps to put at the disposal of the people facilities for the use of fertilisers of that type to a very much greater extent than is the case at present.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I used the word in the more general sense, but I associated it with improvement of the land, and I stand corrected by Deputy Hughes who is in a better position than I am to know the facts.  I still have some recollections of my own early days when I saw farmers using lime very extensively, and it seems to me to be regrettable that that is not the case to-day.  I feel that much more could and should be done in that direction, and I believe that failure to use lime has not been caused by any reluctance on the part of the farmer to use it, but because of certain other difficulties which may have cropped up in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether the Minister seriously believes that the agricultural industry can be substantially improved, or whether he has completely recanted views which were freely expressed in this House by himself and his colleagues in the days when they were much more optimistic about everything than they are to-day, because the Minister made a series of rather astonishing statements in the course of a lecture in Cork some time ago.  The Minister on that occasion made a statement which seemed to imply that he had completely lost his faith in what was called the &ldquo;back to the land&rdquo; movement.  He seemed to regard that as being in the nature of a mirage and to suggest that there was no further room for the settlement of people on the land.  That is entirely in conflict with the views formerly expressed. I do not want to make any capital out of it, except to say that it seems to be an entirely wrong conception of things and that if the Minister has reached the point at which that is his considered view, there is not much hope for agriculture at his hands in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's references <Col N="609" /> to the pig industry and it seems to me that that industry is ruined.  I do not think it is enough to say that the shortage of feeding stuffs and supplies has brought that about.  Farmers and labourers in West Cork depended to a great extent on this industry, because even people in labourers' cottages were actively interested in the keeping of pigs&mdash;a limited number, perhaps, but still enough to be useful in assisting them.</P>

      <P>I am particularly concerned to get a little more information on the subject-matter of the question which I put to the Minister to-day, because it would seem to me, from the Minister's attitude, that we are apparently at the beginning of a new phase in the suppression of responsible, constructive and urgently necessary political suggestions.  It is necessary that we should have some indication if that is so and, to the extent that there is any element of that kind in the present tendency, it is essential that we should understand its meaning and its intent.</P>
      <P>My constituency executive, at its monthly meeting at the beginning of the month, considered some of the difficulties under which the people in the City of Dublin are labouring and, naturally, prominent among the matters under their consideration was the question of the bread supply&mdash;the inadequacy of it and the fact that very many people were quite unable to get the 80 per cent. of their normal supplies that the Minister for Supplies declared was available&mdash;that he reiterated to-day was available when he stated that in the shops more than 8O per cent. of the normal supplies of bread was available.  The executive issued this report to the Press:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The monthly meeting of the Fine Gael North-East Dublin Constituency Executive was held in the North Star Hotel, Amiens Street, on <Col N="610" /> Tuesday evening, Mr. M. Corcoran presiding.  In view of the fact that the difficulties experienced by the poorer classes in the city, in connection with bread distribution, were increasing rather than disappearing, it was decided to protest to the Minister that, as bread rationing had not been proceeded with, an immediate inquiry into the causes bringing about bread queues and into the excessive shortage in bread supplies reaching the poorer parts of the city should be held at once, and the proper supply made available under such conditions as will obviate the queue hardships.  In connection with the new cut announced in the sugar ration, it was complained that very many people were quite unable to obtain the previous ration of 1 lb. per person.  It was decided to direct the attention of the Minister to this fact and ascertain what steps were going to be taken to secure that the new ration now fixed would be made available to everybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which my executive had to consider the question, the circumstances in which they prepared that report, drawing the attention of the Minister for Supplies to the matter, and then in the normal way issued to the Press a statement of that part of their proceedings which they considered of public importance, are fairly well known.</P>
    <P>The House remembers that on the 26th February the Minister for Supplies broadcast that, from the following day, only 80 per cent. of the normal bread supplies would be available. They are aware of the great confusion that took place in the City of Dublin as a result of that; that many people were quite unable to get bread supplies over the following week-end, and that that state of affairs continued on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  On Wednesday, 4th March, I was given permission by the Chair, as a matter of urgent public importance, to refer to the conditions that existed in the City of Dublin.  That matter was discussed at considerable length here.  The Minister's attitude then, and in questions a day or two afterwards, was to the <Col N="611" /> effect that the position had improved. He complained that some difficulties were created by Deputies not co-operating, and he stated (Parliamentary Debates, 4th March, column 2184):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am asking Deputies, when the Government considers that a course of action by the public is desirable in the public interest, to endeavour for a time, at least, to ensure that the public will act in that way and not to be around seeking evidence of non-co-operation or difficulties in order to promote public discontent, but to endeavour, for the time at any rate, to give the Government plan an opportunity of working.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I raised that matter on the 4th March because it was a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Anybody connected with the City of Dublin knows what the conditions have been during the last month.  The Minister for Supplies told us to-day that in the bakers' shops more than 80 per cent. of the normal supplies is available.  I asked if the poor people could expect at least 80 per cent. of their normal requirements and the Minister said &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;They are not getting it&rdquo; and the Minister replied: &ldquo;They are.&rdquo;  Following a statement in the Press based on reports stated to have been given to the Minister for Supplies by some of his inspectors, I received a letter from the secretary of my constituency executive, dated 14th April in which she says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My own family were allowed only two loaves for Saturday and Sunday&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is a family of six or seven&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A family of seven, whom I know, are allowed only two loaves per day....  But the inspectors did not know (or perhaps they did not want to know) that the maximum amount given to any of the people in the queues was two loaves.  Some of those people had large families and afterwards had to tramp around the city visiting all the small shops looking for more bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> After allowing a month to elapse from the time of the debate here on the 4th March, my executive found it necessary to discuss this matter again and to make suggestions and it is very puzzling to us that the Minister is able to say, in the light of what we know, what he said to-day, that 80 per cent. of the normal supplies is available in all the shops.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for the censorship refused to allow the Press to publish any part of the report of my executive that dealt with bread and completely cut out all reference to bread, the reference being, as I quoted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we ask the Minister, as a result of the continuing difficulties, that he should hold an immediate inquiry into the causes bringing about bread queues and into the excessive shortage in bread supplies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he decided that that would not be published because he did not want to have any added cause for public panic in the situation.  I asked him under what section he stopped this publication and he replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The portion relating to bread queues was forbidden publication in accordance with the powers of censorship conferred by Section 2 (1) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and Emergency Powers (No. 151) Order, 1942.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government may, whenever and so often as they think fit, make by order (in this Act referred to as an emergency Order) such provisions as are, in the opinion of the Government, necessary or expedient for securing the public safety or the preservation of the State, or for the maintenance of public order, or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister whether, in deleting the portion stating that a responsible political executive in the City of Dublin called <Col N="613" /> upon the Minister for Supplies to institute an immediate inquiry into the position with regard to the queues and the shortage of bread reaching the poorer parts of the city, he did so because of public safety or because of the preservation of the State or because of the maintenance of public order or the provision and control of supplies and services.  I think it is important that we should know for which of these reasons he refused to allow the suggestions in the report to be published.  The only paragraph that I can find in Emergency Powers (No. 151) Order, which might have reference to it, is paragraph 6 (1) (a), which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;give directions to the proprietor of a newspaper prohibiting such proprietor from publishing, either permanently or during a specified period, in such newspaper or in any poster or placard in connection with such newspaper any specified matter or any particular class or classes of matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether he had given to the Press any general instruction to say that bread and the difficulties in connection with it in the city were not to be referred to at all. The Censor cut out the reference to bread in the heading of the Press report. He cut out all references to bread in the report that was being inserted in the Press, and I want to know whether that was done because of a general instruction issued to the Press in the city that bread was not to be referred to, and I also want to know, was his Order directed to this particular report alone?</P>
    <P>I say that a new phase appears to be developing in the repression of responsible, constructive and urgently necessary political action.  The Minister has indicated that if he published the report of the executive it would add to public panic.  I think that most Deputies in the City of Dublin take a responsible interest in the situation. My experience in the city, at any rate, has made it easy for me to be in touch with various classes in the city.  There are 21 people on that executive: they <Col N="614" /> are closely representative of various phases of Dublin life, and nearly all of them are closely connected with the workers and know the workers themselves as a result of being closely connected with them.  I do not think that the Minister can say, either with regard to the people who are members of my executive or myself, acting outside this House or inside this House, that we have shown ourselves in any way irresponsible in dealing with matters.  We realise the difficulties that this country is in, and we realise particularly the difficulties that people in the city are in&mdash;we are a part of it&mdash;and we have no desire except to know the facts and to try to see how these facts had best be approached so that the difficulties of our people may be ameliorated and lessened.  We have no interest in what the Government are doing beyond seeing that the Government do their part to make things easy, and we have no interest, in present circumstances, except to make it easy for the Government to know how these things can best be approached.  I am quite aware, of course, that Ministers have not given us credit for that.</P>
    <P>When, about this time last year, I had occasion to draw attention to the exorbitant prices that were being charged for coal in the city, and when I pointed out that between January and February, when the import price of coal had gone up by 1/5 or 1/8, there was an increase in the price of coal to those who were serving the poorest parts of the city of 11/- a ton, with a consequent greater increase in price to the poorer classes of people who were buying coal, and when I systematically brought the facts before the House here in such a way that the Minister for Supplies could not deny them, what was his answer?  According to column 575 of the Dáil Debates of 12th March, 1941, the Minister for Supplies, Mr. Lemass, said that I could do my damnedest to try to cause discontent amongst the poor of Dublin.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He can go out with his red flag to cause revolution if he likes, but he will not succeed, because the <Col N="615" /> Government will expose his tactics on every occasion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, when, on the 4th March of this year, we were discussing the bread situation, the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A very large part of the difficulty in relation to bread supplies in Dublin was due to the fact that we did not get that atmosphere of acceptance and co-operation created through the co-operation of public representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pointed out at the time&mdash;although the Minister for Supplies denied it&mdash; that the Minister was charging public representatives with interfering with his plan, but that was what he said: that it was due to lack of co-operation by public representatives in the City of Dublin.  Accordingly, I say that the attitude of the Ministry has been to react against the presentation of facts here and the discussion of facts here. But we go a very big step further along the road of misrepresentation and suppression when the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures excises from the report I mentioned all reference to bread.  He told me, in reply to the question this morning, that he did not suppress that part of the report which dealt with sugar.  He said that that was suppressed by the newspaper concerned.  Well, I am grateful to a newspaper that declined to report that the constituency executive for north-east Dublin met and had nothing to say about anything except sugar.  That would have been a misrepresentation of the situation.</P>
    <P>Now, that report was issued to the Press, not to make political capital out of it, but to inspire public confidence, and if we are to have suppression of public statements or documents issued by responsible political bodies on questions that concern vital and urgent interests of the people, then the Minister may expect that you may run into panic all the sooner. In view of the present difficulties under which the people are suffering, nothing could be more calculated to inspire calm, to inspire confidence, and to inspire hope than seeing that <Col N="616" /> their public representatives and those who maintain political organisations in the country&mdash;organisations upon which this Parliament rests and is built up&mdash;are taking a lively interest in the conditions in the country and showing that they know what these conditions are and that they are making a practical approach to seeing that they are properly attended to.  So far from creating panic in the City of Dublin with regard to queues, so far from increasing the queues, so far from increasing the irritation of those who were not able to get the normal supplies of bread that the Minister for Supplies says were there, the publication of that statement from a responsible Dublin executive would have assisted to calm the people and inspire confidence.</P>
    <P>As well as getting some more detailed information as to the powers and the lines on which he is working, I want to know who is responsible for the actual suppression.  Order No. 151 gives a whole list of people who can be the competent authority for suppression purposes.  The Minister has indicated that he sent part of my executive's report to the Minister for Supplies, and that he thought that good enough.  We had made suitable representations direct to the Minister for Supplies.  I want to know if it was that Minister who asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to suppress this.  If not, was it the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures himself?  If not, who in the censorship machinery did it, and under what direct instruction, whether of a general or particular nature, was he acting?</P>

      <P>This Parliament is approaching the last year of its legal life.  Are we beginning that last year by a new plan, on the part of the members of the Government, either through this Minister or through the officials acting under him, for attempting to blot out opposition, or for doctoring, changing and making futile <Col N="617" /> the reports of Opposition Parties and their organisations in the country, in an endeavour to make them appear silly?

We need assistance to help our people to face their trials and difficulties with composure, knowing that as much as can be done will be done, and realising that, by co-operation and by the criticism and watchfulness of the Opposition Parties, the Government will do its work a little better than they might otherwise.  I ask the Minister to realise that this should be treated in a serious way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mulcahy in the last part of his remarks&mdash;that we are in a difficult situation, and that it will require the co-operation of all Parties in order to bring us through it.  There is no use in blinking the facts about the bread situation; it is a difficult one for the country.  It is particularly difficult for the poor people whose food largely consisted of bread in the past. Anyone who has any suggestion as to how we can eke out supplies or provide substitutes for bread or anything like that should bring forward such suggestions. No effort has been made at any time to stop any suggestions of that kind or of criticisms of the Government for failing to do this, that or the other in order to eke out bread.  We have enough experience of life to know that, when there is a certain panic mentality regarding shortages, everybody starts to grab at once and that makes the situation more difficult still. Publicity about bread queues will not put more bread on the counters, but will just have the effect of adding to the bread queues and making the situation more difficult.  We have stopped publicity regarding bread queues in order, as far as possible, to stop people from queueing up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the situation referred to by the Minister for Supplies to-day, where queues were absolutely unnecessary, but people queued up in shops where there were more than <Col N="618" /> adequate supplies to meet the regular customers.  I pointed out this afternoon under what power we took this action.  When the Emergency Powers Act of 1939 was going through the House, it was foreseen that there might be difficulties about supplies and that it might be necessary&mdash;in order to control and have proper distribution of available supplies&mdash;for the Government to take certain drastic action, including censorship.  As the Deputy himself read out from the Parliamentary records, in the first paragraph of the 1939 Act the Government were given power by the Dáil for the purpose of control of the distribution of commodities essential to the life of the community, to do many things, including the invoking of the powers of censorship.  It was necessary, in this particular case, to do it in relation to bread.  The Deputy himself emphasised the difference that was made between bread and sugar. If we wanted to stop political criticism, we would have stopped the criticism about the sugar as well as about the bread; but I personally do not mind, and I am sure the Minister for Supplies does not mind, political criticism.  That will not have the reaction of creating difficulties for the people at the present time.  If there are any Deputies in this House who think that we are now fighting the general election after the war, they and the whole lot of us had better realise that we are not through the war yet.  We have got to win through the war before we start thinking about the next general election.  We will be very lucky if whatever Party is in power here after the war is an Irish Party.</P>
    <P>We allowed the criticism about the sugar simply because the sugar situation was well under control and it was going to have no immediate ill-effect. The talk about the bread queues was going to have the ill-effect I pointed out, and I think the proper steps for Deputies to take and for political executives such as the North City constituency executive of Fine Gael to take was to make a direct approach to the Department of Supplies on such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they did, and the purpose therefore was served by doing that, and served in the best possible way.  I hope that such executives and that Deputies of all Parties will take an interest in the constituencies, and wherever they see something going wrong, that they will take action about it.  If something is going wrong about <Col N="620" /> which publicity would be harmful, I suggest that they should approach the Minister directly on the matter, and, if they do not get satisfaction then they should raise it in the House or elsewhere. That is the only way it can be done and in the present circumstances it is the safest way for the community.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m., Thursday, April 16th.</P>
