      <P>The number of communications to the Press for publication during each of the years was: 1939-40, 732; 1940-41, 822; 1941-42, 921. In addition a number of inquiries from the Press were dealt with by the Bureau.  These have not been specifically listed, but it is estimated that inquiries on more than 1,500 topics were answered in the year ended March, 1942.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state on what grounds he has made it an offence for farmers who have already contributed their quota of wheat to the millers to feed to live stock wheat which they themselves have grown, in view of the fact that failure to grow, wheat is not an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the Emergency Powers (Restriction on use of Wheat and Wheaten Products) Order, 1941, which is in operation since the 8th March, 1941, and which prohibits <Col N="2166" /> all persons, as well as farmers, from feeding wheat to animals.  It is common knowledge that we have not at present in this country sufficient wheat to provide bread for the community.  The reason for the Order is the belief that human needs should have priority over animal feeding, and I am astonished at the suggestion in the Deputy's question that such Order requires explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the owners of arable land grew 5 per cent. of wheat there would be enough for all, but, if some owners failed to grow that amount, why should those who grow more be penalised?  Why do not the appropriate Ministers see to it that each owner does his portion?  Otherwise, is it not an indirect inducement to people who have grown the extra amount to stop doing so?  Is there no answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will say on what grounds Mr. Thomas R. Potter, Headmaster of Potter's College and Junior School, Dun Laoghaire, who is a cripple and can move about only in a specially fitted small car driven by himself and <Col N="2167" /> which cannot be driven by another, and which carries a special chair to act as Mr. Potter's &ldquo;feet,&rdquo; has been refused a small ration of petrol, and if he will allow this car to be classified as an &ldquo;invalid chair&rdquo; or indicate what alteration would be required to have it so classified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I have not been able to make provision for the issue of permits to the very many motor vehicles required for the use of persons suffering from physical infirmity and an exception could not be made in Mr. Potter's case.  I have, however, been able to make an exception in the case of petrol driven invalid chairs, but I am unable to accept Mr. Potter's motor car as coming within this category nor can I suggest how it could be altered to a chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this is not an ordinary car? This car was specially made for Mr. Potter, who has no legs, and it could not be classified as a motor car, because it would be useless to anybody else.  Would the Minister not hold out some hope of a reconsideration seeing that Mr. Potter, who was born a cripple, has built up a good school? Without Mr. Potter there would be no Potter's College.  The Minister is aware of the history of this case, and has all the particulars.  Could he not reconsider the matter?  This would not be setting up any precedent because there are not three persons in a similar position in Éire.  Would the Minister hold out any hope of reconsidering it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no unemployment assistance due to Mr. Byrne.  His application for unemployment assistance was refused on the grounds that he did not satisfy the statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance which requires an applicant to be genuinely seeking and unable to obtain suitable employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that work is available to him and that he is not prepared to accept it.  In that respect, Mr. Byrne did not satisfy the statutory condition.  He refused to accept employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Byrne has been refused unemployment assistance because of his disinclination to join the Construction Corps.  His reason <Col N="2169" /> for so declining is the fact that, normally, he can obtain a substantial amount of work.  He does not desire to join the Construction Corps because, during the summer, work will be available for him.  He is anxious to obtain that work and is willing to accept it. Will the Parliamentary Secretary make sure that the Unemployment Assistance Act will be administered in such a way that persons genuinely anxious to obtain work, as Mr. Byrne, to my knowledge, definitely is, will not be deprived of benefit merely because they refuse to join the Construction Corps?</P>

As priority must depend on the nature of the message and not on the rank of the caller, it would not be feasible to confine priority facilities to officers above a specific rank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned on the last occasion, I was about to direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to the very serious deterioration in the economic position of persons who have got to subsist on the low level of income which is provided for them in the social services. In particular I should like to call the attention of the Minister to the basic fact that there has been a very substantial increase in the cost of living <Col N="2206" /> in the past two years, an increase which, measured by the narrowest possible criterion, is over 30 per cent.  Of course the prices of a large number of commodities have increased by very much more than 30 per cent.  I took occasion recently to examine certain price levels which were reported to the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee and to ascertain what percentage increase there was in the price of these commodities over the 1939 level.  Although the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee can buy commodities by the ton and cloth by the 1,000 yards, the percentage increase in that case, notwithstanding the favourable buying conditions available to an institution buying on such a large scale, was very substantially higher than that indicated by the level ascertainable under the Departmental cost-of-living index figure.  If we start off, therefore, with an acceptance of the fact that the cost of living has increased by over 30 per cent. in the past two years&mdash;that fact cannot be challenged because the statement is based on official information&mdash;we find that persons such as old age pensioners who enjoy a maximum pension of 10/- per week are to-day expected to exist on that 10/- per week notwithstanding the very substantial increase in the cost of living over the past two years. If we take the case of unemployment assistance recipients, we find that in the rural areas and the small towns the maximum rate of benefit provided for a man, wife and any number of children over five is 14/- per week, out of which that man is obliged to pay rent and to purchase food, clothing and all those other commodities which are essential to a civilised existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it needs very little imagination on the part of any member of the House to realise the economic degradation to which that person has been reduced by being compelled to provide for himself, his wife and family of growing children on an income of 14/- a week.  It is not possible, even adopting the communal methods of feeding, to provide food alone for a single soldier in the Army at 14/- a week.  Yet our concepts of Christianity are so warped that we expect a man to provide <Col N="2207" /> for himself, his wife and five or six children on a sum of 14/- a week at the present level of prices.  Those who have to depend on the inordinately low rates of benefit provided under the non-contributory section of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act are similarly in a desperate plight. Pensions in such cases are subjected to a means test.  The means test entails that any income which the widow has is taken into consideration in assessing her claim for a pension and pensions have been awarded under the non-contributory section of the Act as low as 1/- per week.  The maximum pension in a rural area is 5/-.  To imagine that these people can exist on pensions of such a low standard, particularly in view of the fact that the cost of living has risen so rapidly, is to expect them to do the impossible. Similarly our national health insurance benefits have not kept pace with the movement of prices.  We have devised national health insurance legislation, which does not make provision for health, and certainly is not worthy of the title of national.  There again our sick people, and these may include a man, his wife and a number of children, are compelled to exist on a maximum benefit of 15/- per week.</P>
    <P>Now, I think the Minister is not wholly removed from realities.  I think the Minister has some knowledge of the conditions of life and of living in this city and in this country, and I should like to put to him this question: How does he expect the people who are living on 10/- a week, the people who are living on 14/- a week, or the people who are living on 15/- a week, to be able to manage even the most frugal existence in present circumstances? If you take the case of a man with a wife and six children living on unemployment assistance&mdash;and that, probably, is the worst case of all&mdash; surely, the plight of that man must be desperate to-day?  This Budget has treated industrial companies in a very generous way, by permitting them to pay 9 per cent. in dividends, and, possibly, as in one case I have quoted, dividends of 14 per cent, and it seems extraordinary that a Government that can treat a wealthy section of the community <Col N="2208" /> in that way could not arrange for an increase in benefits for those who are living below the poverty line of existence to-day.  My complaint against this Budget is that it assumes that these people are in the same position as they were in, in pre-war days. We are spending close on £9,000,000 on the Army to-day, whereas we spent less than £2,000,000, pre-war.  We realise that the State needs, apparently, to spend £9,000,000 on the Army to-day, but if it is necessary to spend additional money on the Army because of the changed circumstances and the changed times, I confess to an inability to understand the complacency which enables us to treat old age pensioners, widows and orphans, unemployment assistance and national health insurance recipients in the same way as if their economic position had not been seriously disturbed by the rapid rise in prices during the past two years.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that he would have found a very considerable volume of support in this House, and even outside this House, among people with a broad, understanding mind in social problems, if he had come to the House in connection with this Budget and said that he realised that that section of the community were suffering very severe hardships because of the rise in prices, and if he made some effort to relieve the real destitution from which these people are suffering to-day.  The Minister, however, is prepared, apparently, to push their complaints on one side and to ignore their demand for the application of a remedy to their economic position.  The Minister cannot do that for ever, and he ought to realise, as I am sure some of the members of his Party realise, that there is growing indignation throughout the country at the failure of the Government to utilise the powers which reside within them to organise the resources of the country in a way that would ensure the maximum protection for the weakest and most helpless sections of the community. I happened to get a letter to-day from Donegal, the county that used to believe at one time that a passport to Paradise was to be got by voting for Fianna Fáil.  Some people there are disillusioned now, and this is one of <Col N="2209" /> them.  This man writes to me and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have taken the liberty of writing to you.  The people here are sick of Fianna Fáil and are most anxious to have a change.  We all supported Fianna Fáil, but now they are found out.  The food problem is a disgrace to any Government.  The position here is desperate.  Every day one sees children and women running to the shops for a loaf or a quarter stone of flour, only to be told that there is none.  Some families are living entirely on potatoes, and when the seed is taken from the existing supply of potatoes, what will these families do?  I can give you here the names of families who are hungry, very hungry, who have neither bread nor potatoes.  No one ever thought things could be so bad.  If complaints are made to the Department of Supplies, there is no answer.  The parish councils are ignored, and all the time tea is sold at 17/- and £1 per lb. in the little village here.  What is the use of tea if we cannot get bread?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on then to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is the grave problem here of emigration to the Six Counties, and people say that the Government in Dublin is winking at it.  We do not know, but the fact is that passports have been issued by the Guards, and practically all the boys and young men of this part of Tirconnail are going to County Fermanagh, Belfast, etc., where the British and Americans are building seaplane bases, aerodromes, etc. &lsquo;Put down more wheat&rsquo; cries the Government.  How could that be done here?  It was next to impossible to get anyone to work here this spring&mdash;all gone to the Six Counties. Just think of the irony of it&mdash;young Republicans running away from Donegal, shouting.  &lsquo;England will feed us and pay us well; Fianna Fáil starved us.&rsquo; A desperate situation truly!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a letter from one disillusioned supporter of the Fianna Fáil Government, who voted for the Government, apparently, at the last election, believing that a Fianna Fáil vote was a passport <Col N="2210" /> to some kind of economic EI Dorado.  He now finds that people cannot get bread or flour up there, and he sees the young Republicans of Donegal, as he says, fleeing to the Six Counties to make scaplane bases, and aerodromes for the British and Americans because they know that they will get good employment and wages there but will get none here.  That is the situation which, with their eyes wide open, the Government are condoning, and taking no steps whatever to remedy it. This Budget is a Stay-as-you-are Budget, but conditions are not staying as they are, nor are prices staying as they are, and economic conditions are seriously deteriorating.  Yet, in a time like that, the Minister passes over on the country a Budget which, in fact, shows no appreciation whatever of the changed times or of the changed circumstances and shows no appreciation whatever of the necessity for dealing vigorously with these problems which, to-day more than ever, require the exercise of a vigour and a revolutionary strain of thought which are not shown in the Budget which the Minister has introduced.</P>
    <P>I see only one way of dealing with that situation, and the main way of dealing with it is to put idle men and women into employment in order to create wealth.  The only way in which they can be put into employment, and given a passport to food, to clothing and to shelter, is by the issue of credits on the part of the State to finance their wealth-creating activities.  I see no answer to a demand of that kind, and I have heard no explanation from the Minister as to why it is not possible for the State to say to every idle man and woman in this country, and every adolescent as well: &ldquo;We will put you into employment and provide the wherewithal to finance you against the provision of the goods you are creating, whether these goods are immediately consumable or whether they mean the creation of new national assets of a capital kind.&rdquo;  Other countries have found it necessary to realise that the financial policies they pursued in peace times gave them such appallingly poor results that these financial policies could not be relied upon in times of <Col N="2211" /> war.  These other countries, however, have issued credits, not for peace purposes or for productive purposes, not for the creation of wealth and of new capital assets, but for the purpose of financing implements of destruction which have no productive value and which, in the course of the years, will be completely obsolescent.</P>
    <P>Is it not reasonable, if other countries can adopt a financial policy of that kind, to urge on the Government that we ought to issue some type of Governmental credits to finance a policy of putting men and women into work instead of, as we are to-day, sentencing them to the emigrant ship, or sending them from Donegal into Fermanagh and the rest of the Six Counties to make seaplane bases, and then doing the most insane financial thing of all, though it is understandable in the circumstances, permitting them to get a demand on Irish productivity and on Irish food on coupons which are produced elsewhere, and which, although they create nothing whatever, enable the holders to purchase these goods.  I do not know that it is much use appealing to this Minister or to this Government radically to alter the basis of its financial policy, but I think the Minister and the Government might very well study the advantages to be gained from a policy of expanding State credits to meet economic needs, and from a scientific adjustment of exchange rates to give our people a price level for goods produced here, so as to give them an adequate remuneration for the creation of wealth and the creation of food in their own country.</P>
    <P>My complaint against this Budget, and against the Government generally, is that it is clinging with a tenacity that is worthy of a better cause to old-fashioned methods which offer no solution whatever of the economic difficulties which a beleaguered country like ours finds itself confronted with to-day. There appears to be no definite plan. One cannot discern in this Budget, or in any of the previous Budgets, the particular direction in which the Government want to travel.  At one time there was the policy of the imposition of <Col N="2212" /> tariffs and of quotas to keep out foreign goods, as if by doing that we were building up here a huge reservoir of goods which made it unnecessary to import the commodities which were being offered to us.  Then we saw, when we came to examine the reservoir of goods, that it was almost dry.  Now we have a complete reversal of that policy. We have a reduction in tariffs and a withdrawal of quotas and import restrictions, with a plea to almost anybody in the world to give us the goods which, if we had planned and thought in time, would be available here either from our own handicrafts or by the utilisation of our foreign assets to ensure the storage of sufficient goods to see us through the war period.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a drift-on Budget.  If Mr. Wilkins Micawber actually existed he would find in this Budget something after his own heart.  It is a Budget of &ldquo;wait for something to turn up&rdquo;, but in present circumstances, when people are demanding that some vigorous steps should be taken to deal with their economic difficulties, and when there should be some plan to prevent the impending economic crash, a Budget which merely offers them a policy of drift-on and hope for something to turn up, is one which will not commend itself to the people of this country. It will commend itself less to them as the winter approaches and our difficulties are intensified enormously.  I know, of course, that there are difficulties to be surmounted here, very real and very practical difficulties, but I do not think there is an absence of either good-will or of co-operation, on the part of all Parties in the House, towards an endeavour to find an agreed solution for these problems.  We could have avoided many of these difficulties if, having set up the Department of Supplies in 1938, we accepted as a basic factor that the job of that Department of Supplies was to make sure that supplies would be available in the event of war.  Instead, the Department of Supplies at that time apparently went into an economic trance and indulged in a period of mooning.  We have never been able to discover what that Department did in the year that ended with the outbreak of war in September, <Col N="2213" /> 1939.  But, even when the war broke in 1939, and when one would have imagined that a European armageddon would have shaken the shadow Department of Supplies and induced it even then to realise that something would have to be done and done quickly, and that something would have to be done while supplies were available, we found it still in its trance, showing no disposition whatever to awaken from the slumber that enshrouded it.</P>
    <P>Even after the outbreak of war in 1939, we could have bought supplies from a large number of countries during the best part of the following 12 months.  We could have bought shipping because there was an abundance of it available.  We have £300,000,000 worth of assets in Britain which are now frozen.  We could have utilised these assets at that time for the purpose of purchasing the goods which we now need and cannot get.  The Department of Supplies did nothing whatever to direct a commercial movement to ensure the transport to this country of the commodities which it knew perfectly well could not be produced here, and could not be imported here when the area of war extended.  I think that the Department of Supplies has more to answer for to the people of this country for its complete mismanagement of the whole supply position than all the other Departments of State, even if one were to multiply all their failings by 1,000, because we then had abundant opportunities of getting the goods which we wanted.  Instead, we kept our money invested in a foreign country and saw it depreciate rapidly. The assets that we have in that country are now frozen.  As I said on a previous occasion, the £300,000,000 which we have in British investments would not to-day buy the people of this country a dozen cocoanuts, but they could have bought us timber, coal, petrol, tea, shipping, if the Government were only willing to utilise the powers they were given to exchange these assets for the goods which our people required.</P>
    <P>I suppose it looks like a wake to express regret now that these opportunities were missed with such classic incompetence, <Col N="2214" /> but missed they were.  The position of our people to-day is that they have got to try to make the best of the difficulties confronting them. Even still some effort ought to be made to steady the ship.  It ought not to be allowed to drift on without direction and without a rudder.  Some effort ought still to be made to steady it in some direction calculated to yield benefit to our people.  As I say, I believe there is an abundance of co-operation available in this country, in the economic field, for a sensible economic policy.  The Government have got it generously in respect of defence. Unanimity has been maintained on the defence front for a policy of strict neutrality. I think the Government might very well have got that also on the economic front if they had only thought and planned in time; if they had only realised that there were other Parties in the State which could make a contribution to the solution of our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Even now, faced as we are with problems of which it will be extremely difficult to find solutions, I think there is still time to devise a national plan for the provision of work for our people by an expansion of State credits.  I think it is still possible to whip up sufficient energy in the economic and agricultural fields to harness the enthusiasm and the energies of our people for warding off the worst effects of the war which is raging all around us.</P>
    <P>If the Government will only avail of the existence in the country of a measure of co-operation and understanding and not treat it as the Minister for Supplies does in some of these puerile ebullitions of his, as sabotage, then some effort might be made to save our people from the hardship and suffering which is the result of the Government's insistence on pursuing methods which in peace-time were worthless and the utilisation of which at present is nothing short of criminal.  If the Government, even at this stage, are prepared to adopt a bold and vigorous policy based on some plan in some agreed direction, I think the national enthusiasm of our people. if mobilised, can render a very substantial <Col N="2215" /> national contribution to a policy of that kind.  But, if the Government fail to evolve a policy which will arouse the enthusiasm of our people and fail to act with courage and energy in the economic field, instead of creating a pall of despair, then there seems to be no hope that we can avoid the disasters which at present are staring us in the face.</P>
    <P>I want to close by making one brief reference to our supply position.  In existing circumstances, many of the goods which we require can only be imported by us from Britain.  We send to Britain a very considerable quantity of goods, more goods than she sends to us.  Britain, presumably, wants these goods, because, apparently, she finds it advantageous to send trade representatives here to try to arrange for their export from this country. We want many of the goods which Britain has or which Britain has access to and which, if the British were willing, could be relayed to this country where they are not actually in British hands.  Is there any loss of national dignity or national prestige in sending the Minister for Supplies over to Britain and telling the British people that we cannot continue to give them £3,000,000 worth of goods in exchange for £2,000,000 worth and a credit note for £1,000,000?  Is there anything wrong with the Minister for Supplies saying to the British Government: &ldquo;Our people do not want a credit note for £1,000,000&rdquo;?  We see that these credit notes are of no use to us in present circumstances.  The £300,000,000 worth of them which we have at present are all frozen in Britain and will buy us nothing.  Is there any objection from any standpoint, either a Fianna Fáil standpoint or an Irish standpoint, in saying to the British Government that we desire to trade with them on a barter basis? In other words, if we are going to give them £3,000,000 worth of goods, we ought to get back from them no less than £3,000,000 worth of goods.</P>
    <P>Of course if you continue the present one-way trade of exporting to Britain more goods than Britain sends us, it is only a short time until a lot of our <Col N="2216" /> resources will have been exported to Britain, and instead of getting capital goods back for our exports in the form of machinery and raw materials for agricultural machinery and other capital assets, we will have denuded ourselves of capital assets and of wealth and we will have stored for us in the Bank of England credits which after the war may be quite worthless.  We sent the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to the American Continent and kept him there for a substantial time and gave him a good canter over the whole continent.  Is there any objection to putting the Minister for Supplies in an aeroplane at Collinstown, telling him that in two hours' time he will arrive in London, and to go there and negotiate with the British people and say to them that we want a trade agreement on a barter basis so as to ensure that we will not continue to export goods to Britain while getting from Britain a very inadequate return?</P>
    <P>We have not been able to get from the Government any declaration that the British are hostile in the matter of supplying goods.  If they are hostile, let us hear that.  If they are hostile, why keep giving them goods for credits?  If they are not hostile, what is the reason for not sending the Minister for Supplies or somebody else on behalf of the Government to London to negotiate with the British people and put there a case which can be put? There is no infringement there whatever of our neutrality in that respect. Sweden has a trade agreement that is implemented.  Its operation is reviewed from time to time and it is available for Deputies from Swedish official sources.  Turkey, another neutral, has a trade agreement both with Germany and Britain and it operates normally and does not infringe Turkish neutrality.  Switzerland has a trade agreement both with Germany and Italy, and Switzerland maintains her neutrality.  Why can we not make a trade agreement while maintaining our neutrality in the same way as these countries have done?  No real effort, it appears to me, has been <Col N="2217" /> made in that direction.  Any negotiations carried on with Britain have been carried on by civil servants.  I do not doubt their ability; I do not doubt their whole-hearted desire to do the best they can; but, in our circumstances to-day, it is a very unwise policy to send light weight civil servants to try to negotiate with British civil servants as the basis of a trade agreement involving this country.  The sensible course of action to adopt would be to send a delegation of Ministers to London and to tell the British people that we are giving them goods and at least that we want goods back in exchange; and in any case, over and above a barter arrangement, we have to insist that the assets which we have in Britain are not frozen by Britain as they are frozen to-day.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister say what national objection could be urged against a policy or an arrangement of that kind.  Regarding it purely as an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, I do not think that a mission of that kind would be doomed to failure.  Even if it were, we would then know what the real position is.  So far we are left in doubt as to whether the British are refusing to give us goods in exchange for our goods.  We must assume, in the absence of any declaration of that kind from the Ministerial Benches, that Britain is not so hostile and that in fact goods are available there except that we, for our part, have not been able to insist upon getting equality with Britain in the matter of exports to that country.  I hope the Minister in his reply will advert to the supply position in respect to our exports to Britain, and I hope it will be possible for the Minister to announce that whatever kind of difficulties may have existed in the past in the matter of sending a delegation to Britain for the purpose of discussing a mutual trade agreement, he realises now that that type of punctilio ought not to be allowed to stand between the goods which our people require and the intense suffering which will arise if some effort is not made to relieve the supply position.</P>

      <P>If the people of this country had only an opportunity of <Col N="2218" /> examining the situation and of discussing it, the man on one side of the street being allowed to know what the man on the other side of the street is saying and thinking, the men in one parish being allowed to know what the men in the next parish are saying and thinking, and so on from county to county and province to province, and what this country, as a whole, is thinking of other countries and what other countries are thinking of this, there might be some hope for this country, but, as things stand, I see no hope for it.  The finest exhibition of ignorance I ever heard was given here to-day by the Minister for Agriculture. Surely a man could not be so ignorant as to say that the feeding you give to animals&mdash;we were concerned with dairy cows&mdash;does not affect the standard of milk that those cows will produce.  I wonder will that be allowed out by the Censor to-morrow?  I challenge the Government to allow the country to read it to-morrow.  I will watch the papers closely, but at any rate it will be recorded, as it was spoken, in the records of this House.  It is merely a waste of time for any man with common sense to address the House when the Minister in charge, not only of our chief industry but, in present conditions, of our only industry&mdash;the production of food for the people&mdash; commits himself to such an extraordinary statement.  Of course, he was aware of the corner into which I pushed him and I expect he had to say something in order to get out of his difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have people in this country growing concentrated foods in order to produce good milk.  They are feeding that concentrated product to dairy cows after they have done their duty to the people by producing food for them.  If everybody else did his or her share, there would be no shortage.  Some people fed that concentrated product to animals and they were prosecuted for doing so.  Last week people were prosecuted in my constituency, in a townland adjoining mine, because the milk they were selling was not diluted &mdash;that case was not made against them; the charge was that the milk <Col N="2219" /> was not up to standard.  What was their answer?  Their answer was that they had no concentrated food to give their cows.  I challenge anybody to say that is not a sound excuse in present circumstances.  They had no concentrated foods.  In Youghal half-a-dozen farmers were prosecuted for feeding wheat to dairy cows.  In Sallynoggin farmers were prosecuted because they did not feed the animals in that way&mdash;that is what the prosecution really meant.  Will the Censor allow those cases to be published, so that the farmers of the country may read them?</P>
    <P>The Budget admits that we are taxed to saturation point.  Suppose any of us happened to be asleep for the last five or ten years and on waking up he was told that there are 100,000 persons idle in this country, that agriculture is not paying and that the greatest war in the world's history is proceeding, could he believe it? Will the Minister for Finance explain why prosperity follows the expansion of credit?  I remember a question I addressed to him when the war broke out.  I was anxious to know was he consulted when the banks put up the discount rate.  He said he did not know a thing about it until he read it in the paper.  Fancy the Minister for Finance not knowing that the discount rate had been increased by the banks until he read of it in the newspaper. How long have we been shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo;?  There was not much sign of a Republic there.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to ponder a little on that point&mdash;that the expansion of credit means the expansion of work.  Expansion of work demands an expansion of currency and note issue. Will the Minister look up the last balance sheet of the Currency Commission? He will find there that the note issue was £18,000,000.  In 1920 the note issue in this part of Ireland was over £40,000,000.  That represented the amount of credit that was being given to agriculture and business in this country and that is what gave us the good prices, the employment and the production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2220" /> Why have we not that to-day?  At the time I speak of we were ruled by a Black and Tan Government.  To-day we are ruled by a Fianna Fáil, bracketed Republic Party, Government. Is that what the declaration of the Republic of Easter Week meant? Did it not mean control of our credit, of our currency, of our banking?  If, when the Proclamation was issued, the British Government said to them: &ldquo;Very well, have your Republic; we have done with you&rdquo; what would we do?  Would we not establish a central bank and not a mockery of a central bank?  Would we not take control of our credit and would we not see that our people were put to productive labour?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget statement says that the cure is emigration. If we had not that outlet of emigration the Government would have no cure. All our industries are short of raw materials.  We have £300,000,000 in foreign investments.  I am told they are now frozen.  I will accept that statement.  Why were those investments not made available to the nation at the outbreak of the war so as to purchase the raw materials for our industries and secure our food position?</P>
    <P>When the war broke out in Europe all the wheat that we could afford to pay for could be purchased at 15/- a barrel, but there was very little bought.  That wheat would keep good for seven years.  A few days ago the Minister for Supplies said that they bought to the capacity of their storage.  Did anybody ever hear such a foolish statement? If we had not enough storage could we not have built additional storage?  We have a cement factory and any amount of good gravel all over the country and we could build stores in mass concrete or with concrete blocks.  There was plenty of timber at that time to loft those stores, if we wanted to put in lofts.  The men who were idle and drawing the dole could have erected buildings in which to store enough corn for ten years.  But there was no planning ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no planning ahead.  We set <Col N="2221" /> out to produce food.  What plan is there for the production of food? There is an Order to till 25 per cent. this year.  I think it was 15 per cent. in the first year, 20 per cent. in the next year, and 25 per cent this year. Does anybody in the Government realise that the land of this country will not produce crops unless it is manured?  Why was not an effort made to buy fertilisers?  Their consciences, if nothing else, should have told them that they had done everything that was humanly possible to deprive the country of its supply of natural manure by killing nearly 1,000,000 calves a few years previously. We were up against the position that we had to produce food to feed our population, and we had no fertilisers for the production of that food but the farmyard manure.  Any man with common sense and intelligence handling that problem would have approached it in this way: &ldquo;It is my duty to see that this country will produce sufficient food for man and beast. The beast is not fed for sport; the beast is fed because of its utility, in turn, as a food for man.  Any food that is given to that beast is given in order to produce food in another form for the human population of this country.&rdquo;  A feather-headed Minister, like Mr. Lemass, Minister for Supplies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to him as the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has tried to present me and others like me to the public as one who would prefer to feed animals than to feed human beings.  Let those who might be caught by that innuendo ask themselves where will they get milk, where will they get butter or cheese or eggs or beef or fats, where will they get nearly all the items that make up their food if it is not from those animals, and the animals have to be fed to produce it?  The Minister for Agriculture was surprised at the suggestion in my question that wheat should be fed to animals.  Let us take an intelligent <Col N="2222" /> director of agriculture here; would he not plan to produce enough food to support our human and animal population? Should not that be his first consideration?  But the only plan made by the Minister for agriculture was and is to till a certain area of our land, namely 25 per cent. of our arable land.  Among the urban population generally it is thought that, if 25 per cent. will not do, surely 30 per cent. will do.  To those people I most emphatically say as a tillage farmer&mdash; and I think I know my job&mdash;that by increasing the area you will not increase the food.  I put this to the Minister, or rather to his advisers, that the maximum area which can be put under the plough productively is under the plough this year.  By going beyond 25 per cent. tillage you will diminish rather than increase your food supply.  How will the productivity be kept up?  By manuring the land, and by no other means.  How will you manure the land?  By the by-product of beef production, the by-product of bacon and pork production, and the by-product of milk production, that is, you will manure the land by farmyard manure.  You will not produce those animal products unless you feed the animals, and you cannot feed them unless you grow the food, because you cannot import sufficient of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat must be grown as wheat, and milled directly into flour.  That is not to be fed to animals.  If we put 5 per cent. of our arable land under wheat, we will have enough to give bread to the people of this country.  Why did not the Government see that 5 per cent. of our arable land was put under wheat?  Why did they refuse to allow that information out to the public?  If 5 per cent. of our arable land was put under wheat, we would have enough not only to make brown or black bread, but to make white bread.  That was not done.  I wonder does the public or even this House realise that there is no obligation on any man in this country to sow one grain of wheat? Our daily bread is our first consideration, and the first consideration of any Government or any Minister for Agriculture should be to see that our daily bread is secured.  There was no effort <Col N="2223" /> at all made to secure that daily bread. If a man, considering that he has to feed cows and other live stock and give them the concentrated foods which heretofore he could import but which cannot now be imported, puts, say, 15 per cent. of his arable land under wheat, and he throws the produce of 5 per cent. of his arable land into the common pool, has he not discharged his moral obligation to the community? If he uses the other 10 per cent. or any portion of it to produce milk, to produce pork or eggs or butter, why should he be prosecuted for it, when side by side with him there is a farmer who may not have grown any wheat at all, and who is passed by as a respectable citizen? Why should we have that state of affairs?  Speaking from my own human instincts, if I am prosecuted for doing that, do you think that I would grow any wheat the next year? I do not know one single one of the farmers prosecuted at Youghal, but I do say they were enterprising farmers &mdash;when they grew wheat and saw they would have the cows running idle, they fed them in order to produce milk.  I could understand an Order and a prosecution against anybody who grew only 5 per cent. of his wheat and used it to feed animals, but any man who has done his whack in the present emergency should have freedom after that.</P>
    <P>If it is wrong to feed wheat to animals, and if a man should be prosecuted for doing it, why should he not be prosecuted if he grows none? The Minister made no stipulation that we should grow enough wheat.  He brought armies out of the Department of Agriculture to tell the people of the country the guaranteed price and that they should grow wheat.  There was a controlled price, but not a guaranteed price.  The wheat of the bread that we are eating now was fixed at £2 a barrel.  I admit that every farmer who has a little bit of land and puts it under wheat will find that £2 a barrel will pay him.  But that was not the national problem, which was to grow 600,000 or 700,000 acres at £2 a barrel. It could not be done.  There are not 600,000 or 700,000 acres&mdash;or 500,000 <Col N="2224" /> acres&mdash;of land in this country which, if put under wheat, would pay at £2 a barrel.  When Deputy Cogan and myself had a motion down last February 12 months, asking for 50/- a barrel, men got up here saying that £2 was not a bad price.  I asked some about it and said: &ldquo;Have you sown wheat?&rdquo; and they replied: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; and I then asked: &ldquo;Are you putting 5 per cent. of your arable land under wheat?&rdquo; and they said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I grow wheat and find £2 a barrel not sufficient when I grow a lot, as £2 a barrel scattered over the lot is not a good price.</P>
    <P>The problem is to get the quantity. If you want only what pays it can easily be done, but it is the quantity that is required and you should pay for it.  At the present moment, the wheat that we grew&mdash;that we were forced to grow and forced to part with at £2 a barrel&mdash;is being mixed with foreign wheat costing this country £5 a barrel. I challenge contradiction on that point. Why should our farmers be compelled to grow at £2 a barrel, when our Government is prepared to hand out to the foreigner £5 a barrel for wheat on Dublin quay?  If 100,000 tons of wheat were landed at the port of Dublin to-morrow morning and if the Minister were approached to see that finance would be available to clear that wheat would he provide the finance to purchase it, rather than let it leave the port of Dublin?  I would ask him to answer that, in winding up the debate.  Why did he not put up such a proposition to our farmers?  Why did he not say he would give a price that would beat the foreigner?</P>
    <P>If we had no Department of Agriculture and no Minister for Agriculture, if this matter were left to swing to and fro and find its own level, people would speculate on the market and there would be plenty of wheat and oats.  But the thing was mishandled, and interference killed production. The chief thing we want is production. We want the food, regardless of the price to be paid for it.  Reduced down to actual values what is price, and what is money to-day?  Pen and ink.  A bankrupt Germany has conquered Europe on pen and ink; a bank- <Col N="2225" /> rupt Japan has conquered the Pacific on pen and ink.  There is no getting away from that.  Financiers may put up what pet theories they like, but in the end that is what it is&mdash;plenty of money.  Germany made an advance, Herr Hitler wrote a cheque for thousands of millions of marks and it was honoured because he was winning. Take the proverbial £10 note, following it round when it goes to all the traders and comes back to the original drawer who burns it.  All one needs to provide against is the counterfeit coin.</P>
    <P>We are short of food and there is no use trying to deny it.  In Dublin City there is not a bread shop without queues.  My own men have come to me and said that, if the bread is cut down to seven ounces per day, they cannot work.  The output of working men has diminished, and must diminish if they are not fed.  The production of food has not been planned.  It was really a sum in arithmetic&mdash;one could not put it higher than that.  Half our foodstuffs for live stock had to be imported before the war.  Since the war we could not get that quantity in.  We had to shut off our live-stock population or provide the food.  It was only a matter for the Minister to go to the statistical Department&mdash;which, I think, is now transferred to the Department of Industry and Commerce, but he could dig out the Department somewhere in the Civil Service&mdash;and say to them: &ldquo;There are our returns; we had to import all this feeding stuff for our live stock pre-war; we now want to grow substitutes; give me the acreage we must have.&rdquo;  They would give it to him.  He had not to do any thinking about it, but would get his brief handed up to him.  He could say: &ldquo;Very well, that is all right; now, what acreage of land under average cropping will give us that?&rdquo; The same could be done with wheat.</P>
    <P>That was the whole problem.  The evidence that he did not handle the problem in that way is that he did not make a single Order requiring that any particular crop be grown to a definite minimum extent.  The problem would have resolved itself then into one of wheat, oats and barley, and enough of those would have meant that the home front was secured.  That was <Col N="2226" /> not done.  Instead of putting an intelligent drive like that into operation, we set out on an Army.  One is forced to remember Napoleon's famous dictum: &ldquo;An army marches on its stomach.&rdquo;  How far will our little Army march if we have not the food for it?  If we have women and children crying for bread&mdash;as they are in this country&mdash;what is the use of building a little Army?  Last week we were told by the Minister for Supplies&mdash; speaking as Minister for Supplies, I think&mdash;that we are threatened with a definite shortage of food because of the breakdown in transport.  I was having a bit of lunch yesterday morning when nine huge aeroplanes flew over the top of the house.  How much food would the petrol being used in those nine aeroplanes transport from place to place?  If you say a word about that outside, it will not be published, it will be censored.  Even the reports from this House are censored and will not be allowed into the Press.  I suggest a planned line of approach as regards the food position.  As regards industrial supplies, we will come to that later.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to borrow.  I congratulate him on that decision.  I can take it, that he recognises that we have reached the saturation point.  If we had, I hand it to him that he recognised it too and decided to borrow.  Why does he not borrow more?  I should think that one of the principal grounds for borrowing would be the excess expenditure on the Army which is necessitated by the present emergency.  The present emergency will affect the future as it does the present, and, if the Minister and his advisers and the Government are satisfied that we must have an Army of this size and at this cost, then its work will be as important for the future as for the present, and I think a <i>prima facie</i> case exists for borrowing. But why not borrow the entire cost of the Army, or at least what is abnormal in the cost of the Army?  Even though there is no increased taxation, taxes will be operating for a full year in the current year that did not operate for a full year in the year just gone out.  It is equivalent in a way to increased taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> There are some points on the local government side that I would like to put to the Minister.  Why does the Government permit a Government-controlled institution to charge 4¾ per cent. for money lent to local authorities throughout the country?  For example, Irish, Assurance Ltd., which was organised by the Government, brought into being by the Government by Acts of this House, which has been given a monopoly of insurance and also guaranteed a field for investment, is offering money at 4¾ per cent.  A considerable amount of money was offered to the Dublin Corporation, and there was considerable opposition to it there.  As chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, I was dead opposed to it all through.</P>

      <P>The Government in effect has created a monopoly in insurance, and is giving them a monopoly of the field for investment.  The big problem before this country to-day is food.  In respect of that all-important problem, the censor precluded any discussion in the public Press or otherwise as to how it would best be tackled.  All papers were severely censored.  Why? Why was advice not taken on it?  Now we are up against the threat of starvation. In regard to fuel, which is hardly less important than food, we are up against the same thing.  Last year, private efforts were made throughout the country to provide certain cities and urban areas with turf.  People were ready to bring it home.  An Order was made on the 1st July by the Government prohibiting the transportation of turf into Dublin City or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and perhaps other urban areas.  What reason was there for that?  That was done at a time when it was recognised that there was a threat of a fuel shortage in the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  I was with a deputation from the Dublin Corporation to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Local Government in regard to that matter.  They were afraid that all the available transport services would be inadequate to bring sufficient turf to Dublin City and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  We know that, after that transportation developed rapidly, without <Col N="2229" /> any regard to cost.  Transport services that were lying idle were brought in, and lorries were sent empty from Dublin to the Atlantic coast.  They were filled with turf and brought back to Dublin.  What would be the cost of that turf?  The value of the petrol used in transporting it was far in excess of the value of the turf that was brought up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that we read in the Press that at a meeting held in the Engineers' Hall bouquets were thrown all round about the success of the turf campaign. Go up to the Park and have a look at the results of the turf campaign, and see all the muck that was transported from the West of Ireland with petrol of which industry here was deprived. All private efforts to help to solve the fuel problem were set aside.  A syndicate that was being developed in my constituency was told that what it proposed to do had been handed over to another body.  A turf area that we considered to be suitable was condemned, but we insisted on trying it at our own expense and the turf cut there turned out to be economic.  The fuel position was spoiled by the way it was mishandled last year, and if men who are working there this year are asked about it they will say that that area is in very good production now and will give satisfactory results.  The outstanding value of the experiments of cutting turf there was that if necessary it could be carted into the city with horses. At the present time private enterprise in the production of wood fuel is being stifled.  After being promised petrol for such development it was refused and that involved twice the journey on rail and twice the expense.  The outstanding example last year was in the City of Dublin where there was a shortage of fuel.  The City Manager was directed to advertise for tenders to supply 4,000 tons, and got two replies, one offering 200 tons and another 100 tons.  The Government then intervened and said that the Forestry section had timber at Inchicore that would be made available for the city. The timber was in seven or eight foot lengths and the City Manager was informed that in that state the charge would be £3 a ton.  It would take 11/- more to take the timber to the saw <Col N="2230" /> mills and I suppose another 5/- to take it back, so that that fuel would cost £4 a ton.  That proposal collapsed.</P>
    <P>There was a shortage of fuel in Dun Laoghaire but a few of us got together and formed a company, with a capital of £20,000, to bring in supplies and got a promise of petrol, but when the scheme was working the petrol was withdrawn.  Last week the whole rail outfit broke down and about 300 tons of lumber were scattered about.  Of course, there was nothing about that in the newspapers.  It was censored. It is impossible to carry on business under such conditions.  I suppose we will have to wait until the Estimate for that Department is being discussed to deal with that matter.  I am afraid we are approaching a crisis, if it is not already on us.  I am not blaming the Government for that, but I certainly blame them for the way they mishandled the food position, and for the way they are handling the fuel position. These are the two problems that count to-day.  We drew up suggestions and we were prepared to back them with our efforts and with our money.  Was not that good faith?  Why were we not helped?</P>
    <P>There are some people at present complaining about destroying the woodlands.  As one who has used a good deal of timber in building 500 or 600 houses in the last ten years I know something about timber and I say that the sooner it is cut down the better, because it is useless for any utility purpose. Most of it is a danger.  I cut down some trees and I found that in some instances six men could stand in the butts.  They were rotten.  All the woodland to be seen around County Dublin would not provide sufficient timber to roof a house.  Why should not the present emergency be used to make some use of old timber that is really in the way?  When better times come let us plant these places with timber that will have some utility value.  What country would allow timber to continue growing years beyond the period when it had reached maturity?  No other country would allow it.  It would be cut down and used for some purpose.  Other countries look upon timber, not as an <Col N="2231" /> ornament but as a crop, and, just as oats or wheat ripens, so does timber. It is harvested when ready and is then a contribution to the national wealth. We are not destroying the countryside or its beauty by cutting down old timber.  That timber when cut down could be converted into fuel for the benefit of the citizens and without any expense to the Government if they would only allow that to be done and not put obstacles in the way.</P>
    <P>It would be a very serious matter if anything happened to our foreign investments. It will not be serious for me because whatever money I have it is not affected by foreign investments. It would, however, be serious for this country.  It is hard to foretell if we will ever have foreign investments again.  Any foreign investments we had at the outbreak of war came from two sources, from the profits of land purchase and from profits made in the last war.  I do not think the profits we can make in this war will buy much foreign securities, and I doubt if there will ever again be land purchase as a money producer similar to what we had in the past under the various Land Purchase Acts.  If these foreign investments are lost or greatly diminished in value it will, however, be a serious handicap to this country.  In carrying on the work of this country, it seems to me that the Government did not give serious thought to the future.  Consequently, we are confronted with difficulties most of which could have been avoided if some foresight had been shown by the Government.</P>
    <P>A good deal of trouble has been handed to us by the Government.  They fixed prices for certain commodities&mdash; wheat, for example.  After fixing that price on the basis of the wage then payable, they altered the wage.  Were they trying to create trouble between the farmer and his workers?  Why was not the wage fixed first and then the price, based on that wage?  After the price of wheat was fixed, a rise of 3/- or 4/- was given in wages.  Certain people in this House stated that 50/- was enough for wheat.  I do not think it was, for the reasons which I have already stated.  You will get about 150 <Col N="2232" /> acres of wheat from me, but you will not get wheat in sufficient quantities generally, because wheat-growing will not pay.  I do not want to go into that now.  If you wanted to deal with the matter in a businesslike way, why were not the costs, as measured in wages, fixed first?  The price of wheat was fixed on the basis of the then costings. A week after that, the wages were increased and, a week after that, the bog wages were fixed.  These bog wages, so far as I can gather, are higher in every district than the agricultural wages.  Surely, none of us would work on a farm if, by going down to the bog, we would get 2/- or 3/- more, while a man working for the Government would not be as much pushed as a man working for an old farmer.  We would say: &ldquo;We have our labour to sell and we are going to sell it in the highest market.&rdquo; The Government set turf cutters against farmers, fuel production against food production, employer of each type against employer of each type and worker of each type against worker of each type.  That was not the way the Government should have approached the problem if they wanted food and fuel produced.  I see that there is trouble in the bogs now, but that has nothing to do with us here.  It could not be settled here and I am not going to say anything about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies came down to this House before Christmas and asked the House to grant a subsidy of £2,000,000, so that the price of the 4-lb. loaf would still remain at 1/-. The 1941 wheat crop cost 5/- a barrel more than the 1940 crop and the Minister wanted to stabilise the price which had been fixed for the loaf on the basis of the cost of the 1940 crop.  The cost of flour to carry us through from the 1940 crop was £5,700,000.  The cost of flour on the increased price of the wheat crop for 1941 was £7,700,000&mdash;a difference of £2,000,000.  The Minister wanted to keep the price of the loaf as it was and the £2,000,000 subsidy for which he asked was to enable him to do that.  The wheat which will give us bread from next October onwards will cost 10/- per barrel additional.  If it took £2,000,000 to stabilise the price of the 4-lb. loaf at 1/-, when the increase <Col N="2233" /> was 5/- a barrel, will it not take £4,000,000 more to stabilise the price when the increase is 10/- per barrel, as it will be for the next crop to be harvested? So far as I remember, the Minister measured the £2,000,000 subsidy at 2d. per loaf.  I presume that it is intended to keep the stabilised figure to that of last year.  That would mean that the Minister for Finance would have to part with £2,000,000 to keep the 4-lb. loaf stabilised at 1/- and that, for the increase of 10/-, he would be involved in another payment of £4,000,000.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Supplies and the Government, generally, will have to consider whether they will put up another sum of £4,000,000 to stabilise the price of the loaf at 1/- or let the price of the loaf go up.  Either alternative will be terribly serious.</P>
    <P>Arising out of our debates when the Minister for Supplies asked for the subsidy, I have given a good deal of thought to this aspect of the matter. I reduced my views to the form of a considered document.  I condensed my speech to the House and sent a copy to the Taoiseach.  I shall give a copy to the Minister for Finance if he is interested.  There are people who are prepared to pay any price for bread, and who are able to pay it.  Why should the taxpayer be asked to subsidise their bread?  I suggested, in my statement, that half our flour should be standard flour&mdash;that is to say, 95 per cent. extraction&mdash;and that that half should get the whole of the £2,000,000.  The other half of our flour should be milled as white flour, and should be sold at a price based on £3 a barrel as the standard price for wheat.</P>
    <P>I could give figures, and if they were worked out it would be found that in the prices inherent in that scheme you could sell the 4-lb. loaf at 11½d., and you would want no subsidy beyond the £2,000,000.  You could pay £3 per barrel for wheat, whereas the alternative now, as I have just shown, is to increase the subsidy to £6,000,000 in the coming year, or to increase the price of the 4-lb. loaf to 1/6.  Either will cause a good deal of misgiving in the country.  Already you have gone away <Col N="2234" /> from the 95 per cent. extract and, as things stand at present, you will not be able to maintain the standard of the wholemeal bread for the remainder of the cereal year.  It is a terribly serious situation.  If, at the proper time, you offered £3 per barrel for wheat, your bread would have cost you no more.  I have not a shadow of doubt that ample supplies of wheat would have been grown in the country, because it is all a question of paying the labourer for his hire.  Men have to undergo expense in sowing indifferent land to grow wheat when the nation demands all its bread from the country, and if you had paid the price you would have got it. You refused to pay the price, and I am afraid you will not get it.  Up to the 1st March there was considerably less wheat sown than at the corresponding period of the previous year. Scarcely half the quantity of winter wheat produced the previous year was sown, and it is winter wheat that will tell in the production of bread, not spring wheat.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the folly, for it is nothing less than folly, of the Government in not permitting free discussion of these matters.  Even statements made here were censored.  I know papers against which the threat was made that they would be shut down if they dared to publish statements made in this House.  Surely, if they were foolish statements, the best thing that could be done would be to give them plenty of publicity, and then they would play themselves out.  If they were useful statements, why should they not be made known?  A couple of weeks ago I followed a discussion or a criticism in the Dublin Leader.  I put up with it for a few weeks, and when I thought it had gone far enough, I replied to it, but my reply was censored.  Why?  No excuse could be given.  Finally, it was published, but a paragraph was left out.  Surely, if the point I wanted to make was of any use it should get publication.  If it were foolish, the best way to prove its foolishness was to give it publicity. The Government is very weak and very indecisive when it is afraid of a little passage in an article or a letter like that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> The Minister for Finance was there or thereabouts at the birth of Sinn Féin.  I was there or thereabouts, too, certainly at the birth of Sinn Féin in London.  When we look back on those 40 years and remember that Sinn Féin won out, is it not a sad commentary on the policy which our young minds then grasped with enthusiasm to find that in this country which we got free of debt 20 short years ago&mdash;these 20 years have greyed our hairs and wrinkled our faces but they represent a short time in the history of a nation &mdash;we have piled up a debt of £111,000,000?  We are taxing the country still to the tune of £43,000,000 or £44,000,000, and admitting that we are taxing it to capacity by borrowing portion of our outlay this year instead of raising revenue by taxation to meet our full expenditure.  What is wrong? Have we proved, as was often flung in my face in London, that the Irish cannot govern themselves?  What have we to say in regard to that £111,000,000? We have not a single asset to show apart from a crop of pensions.  We pensioned one another.  What capital asset have we to show against the expenditure of £111,000,000?  Somebody mentioned the Shannon scheme. I do not think it is an asset.  I was born and reared on the banks of the Shannon.  I know every inch of it from County Cavan out to where it leads into the sea.  I spent my boyhood days along the Shannon and I can recall that it runs through a plain that is very little above sea level.  Instead of harnessing it to make a waterfall at Ardnacrusha, the falls at Donass were blasted out to allow the water of the Shannon run into the sea from the centre of Ireland.  We spent £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 on that.  For what?  My eyes were opened when as chairman of the Waterworks Committee in this city we negotiated the Poulaphouca scheme.  We went into details there and experts brought all the facts before us.  When they were worked out, we found that our consumption of electricity was normally 407,000,000 units and 200,000,000 of these units are produced from coal in the Pigeon House.  That is our profitable Shannon <Col N="2236" /> scheme, on one side of the account. On the other side, we have a debt of £111,000,000.</P>
    <P>Now it does not matter whether the nation dies or becomes bankrupt, whether we wrap the Green Flag or the Tricolour around us&mdash;and we who raised the Tricolour in this country have nothing to boast of, measured by the balance sheet of the nation to-day &mdash;it is time, if it has not already passed the time, that some effort should be made to cut down expenditure.  What is wrong, that any able-bodied man in this country to-day should be paid for doing nothing?  If you examine the position and riddle out the few that are producing, is it not a marvel that those few who are producing are able to carry the whole load on their backs?</P>
    <P>I know of a young man in County Dublin last year, who was busy at his hay.  He jumped out of his car up at Phibsborough and went along the canal bank, where there were two or three gangs of young men playing cards.  These men were drawing the dole, and he asked them to come out and help him with his hay.  The answer he got was: &ldquo;Bring the hay in here and we will work it for you.&rdquo; I also know of a man who came to me and who worked for me for a few days.  I paid him at a rate that was above the standard agricultural wage, but after working for a few days for me he said that he did not see why he should work when he could get paid for doing nothing, and I suppose it might be said that people are damn fools to work when they can get paid without working. Disguise it how you will, is not that driving the country to bankruptcy? What was the dope that was handed out here to those people, even in this House, for the last ten or 15 years?  Was it not &ldquo;Something for nothing&rdquo;?  &mdash;to catch votes.  Is not that what has been handed out, and not that there should be more productivity and more sweat, and that everybody must work?</P>
    <P>We are cut off now from the outside world.  Deputy Norton, who spoke before I did said that we are selling £3,000,000 worth of stuff to Britain, and that we are getting paid £2,000,000 for <Col N="2237" /> £3,000,000 worth and getting a credit note for the other £1,000,000.  With the way we are tied up, we are damned lucky to get the credit note.  If England said: &ldquo;No we will not give a credit note, but will only give £2,000,000 for the stuff you are sending over,&rdquo; what would be our answer?  You have no answer to it.  Go and examine the value of our paper £, which is based on the £ sterling.  Even in this Budget statement, the Minister says that our men are attracted by the high wages payable over there.  Now, if you had a scientific, common currency operating between the two countries, it would be impossible for a higher wage to be paid in England than is paid here, when you are in the same currency area.  Let the Minister ask his advisers as to the truth of that statement, when he has time, but the fact that the Irish workingman here, in the same currency area as Britain, gets less wages here, for the same effort, than the man who goes over to Britain, shows that the British paper £ is not as valuable as our paper £ because the same human effort is not put into it. Why is it not regulated?  Why, instead of having £18,000,000 of a current paper note issue here, on which is based our volume of credit, have we not a note issue relatively the same as we had in the last war?  The last time that I was able to see the British note issue, it was £630,000,000.  I have tried to find it recently, but I could not find it anywhere, and God knows what it is now; it might be £700,000,000 or £800,000,000. In the last war it never reached £600,000,000.  Where are our assets at all?  We are starved in credit and therefore we are starved in effort, and unemployment follows.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister again to the last published balance sheet of the Currency Commission.  When we had the Black-and-Tan regime here, when this country was ruled as a Crown Colony, there was something over £600,000,000 of a fiduciary issue.  For every paper £ that was circulating here, there had to be the equivalent in gold, because, under the Bank Act of 1845, these notes could not circulate unless there was the equivalent amount of gold in vaults in this country.  Look at your £ note now, if anybody has one, and you will see <Col N="2238" /> that it is payable on demand in London.  By the time you would be half way there, you might be bombed, and where is the security there?  In this Fianna Fáil governed&mdash;Republican-in-brackets&mdash;country, you have £15,000,000 out of £18,000,000 of a note issue backed by British securities.  Now, I hope that those securities are good, and I hope the position is such as would enable them to be good, but the most enthusiastic imperialist either in this country or outside it cannot crow or cannot be too jubilant as to the stability of these securities at the present time, and yet that is what our money is based on now.  Where is the Republicanism there?  For a couple of years after the Treaty, we shot one another over &ldquo;empty formulas.&rdquo;  Is that an empty formula?</P>
    <P>Now, a campaign has been waged against the farmers of this country for not doing their bit.  I became a farmer by accident.  I became a lot of things by accident, and I am quite satisfied that even though I am a pretty old fellow now I could take up any job in the world and make a living at it if I got my health.  I am not speaking here as a farmer, or for a class, nor am I speaking as a member of a class.  If I were in a position to take a fully detached view, it would be just the same, but the farmer has been robbed both by this Government and the last one.  The credit of this country has been ruined both by this Government and the last one.  During the Black-and-Tan period&mdash;I shall pass over it quickly&mdash;the farmer's house was used, his food was used, his horses and carts, if he had them, were used. Did he ever get compensated for these things?  Of course he did not.  The Treaty had hardly come when the people whom the farmer had housed and fed started shooting one another, and they shot any farmer who came in the line of fire&mdash;£30,000,000 went up in smoke.  Then, on the top of that, you had the rapid deflation policy, which put every enterprising farmer in this country on the wrong side, so far as the banks were concerned, and gave them millions of frozen debts.  That drove many farmers to the grave and many others to the lunatic asylum, but not <Col N="2239" /> one word was raised on their behalf. The first act of an Irish Government was the destruction of one of the charters of tenant right that I remember hearing about as a child almost, fixity of tenure.  The first act of an Irish Government was to destroy fixity of tenure.  That was destroyed by the 1923 Land Act, which was forced on the people by political adventurers.  I know how it was done &mdash; in conventions that were held here in the Mansion House and in the Rotunda.  That Government was succeeded by another, which started off with a widening of the destruction of fixity of tenure, through the economic war, which left the farmers pauperised, without money and without credit.  Then the war came upon the country, and still the farmer is blamed for not having money of which he had been robbed.  I wonder do people in responsible positions here ever consider that the individual&mdash;or the nation&mdash;who does a foolish act, who spoils his business, cannot wake up in the morning and expect that his business will be restored by magic?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has found out that he cannot extract any more. The industrial push which went on during the last few years, and which in other circumstances would be very wise, has not been able to stand the shock of this war.  We have not the raw materials.  Our electric light and gas are being reduced for want of coal, so that the position confronting the City of Dublin at the present time is terrible.  I employ a lot of workers. They asked me yesterday to try to arrange different hours for them as their meals can only be cooked during specified periods.  When I asked them, why not get Thermos flasks, the answer was that they had not got them and that they cannot be bought.  What steps did the Government take to deal with this situation?  I remember the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures advising people here, who were looking for more petrol, to fix up gas-producing tackle on their cars.  Now it is an offence to do that.  We have a black market here <Col N="2240" /> in all the moods and tenses.  I never made anything out of it.  What I bought in it cost me dearly.  I want to tell this to the Minister&mdash;and I defy contradiction of the statement&mdash;that in the case of a few enterprises in which I engaged, and in which I invested £20,000, it would have been impossible for me to cut even one tree were it not for the black market.  I could not buy an axe in the City of Dublin, a saw or a file to sharpen it.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Dockrell buys in the black market, but what I do know is that if he has not a reserve stock of files he cannot get one to sharpen a saw.  Will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, whether saws, axes and files can be bought to-day?  In pre-war days a good axe used to cost about 5/6.  It is very nice for the Minister to say that the price of a 6 lb. axe should not be more than 7/6 or 8/6, but it is only deluding the public to tell them that.  Where are they going to get them at that price?  If the Minister were to make an Order to that effect an axe would not be procurable at all. A man rang me up this forenoon to say that he had two dozen 6 lb. axes on offer at 35/- each.  He asked me if I were interested, and I replied that I was so interested that I would buy them at that price.  I had to do that because I have over 100 men working and if it were not for the black market not one of them could be employed.</P>
    <P>Why did not the Government foresee that situation so that axes, saws and files would be available?  If you want to get a horse shod to-day you have to break a piece of an old gate and send it to the smith because there is no shoeing iron to be had.  Why was there not some planning done ahead? The present state of affairs is appalling. We are told that rubber cannot be got to-day, and if ordinary cars are to be used in place of motors one cannot get iron to bind the wheels.  I wonder what are the Government thinking about?  How do they hope the country will carry on?  I have tried both in this House and in the Departments to get statistics with regard to our food position, but I cannot get them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would be quite in order in discussing the question of taxation, but most of the things that he has been referring to would arise more properly, I think, on the Estimate for the Department of Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that one can go more into detail on an Estimate. The Budget debate, however, is of a more general character, since the Budget Statement covers all Departments. In dealing with an Estimate one is often tripped up for dealing with some particular point since the Chair may hold that it concerns some other Department.  In that way a Deputy may often find himself ruled out of order.  Apart from that, I want to say that since I became a member of the House I have advocated self-sufficiency in a more detailed way than the Government have preached it. Does the Minister for Finance realise, when asking for over £44,000,000 from the people, that this year we are not only deprived of fertilisers for our land but are short of seeds to put into it? The Department of Agriculture is claiming a very big share of this £44,000,000.  That Department has been in existence for about 40 years and has cost the country, I suppose, <Col N="2242" /> about £30,000,000.  To-day it has left us without a mangold, turnip or cabbage seed, or a parsnip or carrot seed. The two latter we get from America. The farmer has been thrown back on his own resources.  Instead of the Department seeing after these things, the farmer has to find them himself now, as we know to our cost.  So much for planning ahead.  The Government have failed and all the Governments we have had have failed to appreciate their duty to the people of the country and to plan for the building up of the country.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there are big moves in this country at present.  People have got tired of looking to this House, which is mostly shut up, for guidance in the present crisis, and moves are fast maturing from which political parties will get a shock.  The time is coming when the people will refuse to allow any Government to play fast and loose with the lives and property of others, and when they will be asked to render an account.  No business concern could stand the way in which the government of this country is being mismanaged.  It is a pity that the democratic principle should be destroyed and that this country cannot be managed by half a dozen or a dozen business men. Then we might hope for some better days.  Perhaps the blame does not altogether lie with those on the Government Benches.  I have heard the Government asked in this debate why there were bread queues in the City of Dublin.  Yet the people who asked that question by way of criticism of the Government would not vote for a proper price for wheat to give bread to the citizens of Dublin.  The citizens of Dublin know that, and this sort of playing to the gallery is played out. The people are thinking that it is time some effort was made to ameliorate their condition.  They should be given a chance of living instead of the produce of their sweat being handed out in doles and pensions in this House. It is time a stop was put to that.  We have big salaries, big pensions, and every kind of big expenditure.  But what about the revenue side?  The country is taxed to saturation point until it cannot go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> The Minister, in his opening statement, referred several times to plenty of money being available.  Of course there was too much money available for certain things.  The greatest curse that can befall a man or a group of men is to give them too much money before they learn how to use it.  Money was thrown out foolishly here in the last ten or 15 years and even before that.</P>
    <P>Public money was thrown out and many of the recipients never had any notion of paying it back.  Of course, it has not been paid back, because the people who got it had not graduated in the hard school of experience with their own money and made good.  It was not a question of a man's ability or of his record or of what he had accomplished; it was a question of whom he had helped at the last election whether he got public money or whether he did not.  Now the chickens have come home to roost.  There is nothing to show now except that some wave the green flag and some say that the tricolour is the flag.  In any case, in the battle of the flags we have sunk the country in debt to the amount of £111,000,000; we have taxed the people to saturation point and now we are asked to overtax them in order to pay £44,000,000 in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The supply of commodities is drying up.  We give grants for housing, but we cannot build the houses because one of the essential materials, namely, timber, cannot be got.  All other businesses are being curtailed for want of supplies.  The country is rapidly shrivelling up.  Here and there, there are signs of irresponsibility where people want more than the present condition of things is capable of giving them.  If this goes on for another year the position will become very much worse.  Last December 12 months we had not felt the pressure of the war.  Look at the difference between that time and last December and then look at the difference between last December and now.  What will the difference be between now and the end of the year?  From all the signs, we will be lucky if the end of this war comes within the next three or four <Col N="2244" /> years.  What are we doing; what plan have the Government unfolded?  None.</P>
    <P>The Government stated that they are going to borrow.  They have a good chance of borrowing.  They hoodwinked the Dublin Corporation into taking £500,000.  It would not have happened if I were there.  They got £500,000 away at a profit of 1 per cent.  The citizens of Dublin have to pay for that. Sometimes it is useful to have local government carried out on Party lines, sometimes it is not.  It is never very good for the ratepayers, though it may be good for somebody else.  The Government got away with it, but they will probably have a more rugged road to travel in future.  They will have no trouble, however, in borrowing £4,000,000 because Dublin is full of money awaiting investment.  Everybody knows that.  I should not be surprised if the Government were able to negotiate a loan at about 2 per cent.  Of course they will then lend the money to the local councils, where there are any of them still operating, at 5½ per cent.  That will be good business.  However, I am greatly afraid that the future is very gloomy.  The future in the productive field is certainly gloomy.  If the Government do not show some better appreciation of the situation and give the producers a chance of living, then it is up to the producers to demand the right to live and the right to a return for the capital and labour that they are putting into the national effort.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wonder for what purpose the Government are using the censorship. If we claim to be a democratic State, why are one or two individuals allowed to censor the opinions of any public man or any citizen?  Why is not anything that is considered by the Press worth letting out to the public, let out to the public?  What is the danger?  We are not at war; we are a neutral country and, even if an individual here advocated a departure from neutrality, what harm would it be?  One swallow does not make a summer.  Suppose anybody advocated going on the German, the British, the American or any other side, what harm would it be?  The fact that we do not go on any side shows that the overwhelming mass of the people is anxious <Col N="2245" /> to remain neutral.  No foreign country will attack us because some individual, however exalted, whatever position he may be in, makes a statement inside or outside this House.  No foreign country will attack us because any individual has advocated a departure from neutrality.</P>
    <P>I do not see that any harm can be done by publishing all the news.  To suppress news, especially about ways and means for increasing productive effort here, seems silly, and I do not think it will help the cause it is intended to help.  There is nothing as healthy as free and open discussion, freedom of speech.  If a man has a good case or a good plan, let us have it.  If he has a bad one, give it publicity and that is the surest way of killing it.  I am afraid everything is looked at here from a narrow Party angle and we are suffering in consequence.  Our strength is being sapped, we are running out, we are not as strong economically as we were a year ago.  We will be less strong as the months go by and I suggest that some kind of national plan is absolutely necessary to save the economic strength of the country.  If we do not save that, we have nothing else left and the country will collapse and then our neutrality will be gone and everything that we cherish or hold dear will also go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for any Deputy to wish Deputy Belton a return of his strength or vigour, because he has given evidence this evening of his customary strength and vigour.  Some of us may not quite agree with certain of his statements, but, all the same, we are glad to have him back amongst us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not have spoken on this Budget were it not for the fact that Budget time is usually stocktaking time.  It is the time when Deputies in the House and the people of the country consider certain responsibilities and take into consideration what assets there are to meet the liabilities, both existing and contemplated. The only remarkable thing about this Budget is that there are no new taxes.  It is really because there are no new taxes that I feel an obligation rests on me to say what I think <Col N="2246" /> about the Budget.  I had not intended to speak, but from what I hear travelling in the train&mdash;and I spent some hours in a train recently&mdash;and at markets, fairs and other places, I am inclined to think that we have lulled ourselves into a kind of sleep because we have had no new taxation.  That is a dangerous position to get ourselves into.</P>
    <P>What is the position in the country at the present time?  We have no new taxes, it is true; but it is not that we do not want new taxes, it is not that we do not want money, it is really and truly because there is not anything that we can tax, anything that is able to bear taxation.  The Minister has practically said as much in his Budget statement&mdash;he does not feel justified in trying to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue by new taxation or by economies.  The most dangerous thing that could happen the country would be to lull itself into a feeling of complacency, a feeling of safety, a feeling that all was well when, in fact, it was otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not want to draw a lurid picture, or to subscribe to anything such as Deputy Belton indicated.  He talked of the period of lawlessness that is ahead of us, a period when this House will have so destroyed democratic institutions that the people will rise up against them.  Deputy Belton may be right, but I am not subscribing to that.  I do think that the situation confronting the country is not a happy one.  There is no use in lulling ourselves to sleep, hiding our heads in the sand and feeling that although there is not anything upon which we can collect new taxes we still can joyously borrow and joyously spend.  It is like the rake's progress&mdash; spend while you have it, spend all you can get, then borrow and spend again.</P>
    <P>There are certain headings under which you can always borrow, leaving the payment to posterity.  At the present time there are many calls upon the Government and upon other Governments, whether their countries are at war or not, and these calls are due to the existing emergency.  There are many things in respect of which borrowing would be justifiable. National defence is one of these things. <Col N="2247" /> It would not be fair to expect this generation to pay in full for the cost of defence, so that we would be able to hand down to posterity the independence which we enjoy.  Under that heading I admit that borrowing is justifiable.  That heading is not set out in the Budget as one of the things for which we are to borrow.  Nevertheless, in the ordinary way it is a thing in respect of which we must borrow.</P>
    <P>There is set out in the Budget statement one item to which I have objected consistently, and that is borrowing for the relief of unemployment, unless the money is devoted to some type of productive work.  I remember before Fianna Fáil came into power, when the members of the Party were sitting on this side of the House, they gaily informed us that the cure for unemployment was a very simple one, that curing unemployment was a very easy matter in this country.  What is the position to-day?  What have the Government done to relieve unemployment? They thought that it was a very small problem, something easy of solution, but nothing has been done by them, notwithstanding all the money borrowed last year and in preceding years, to relieve unemployment in a permanent way.</P>
    <P>If money has to be borrowed for the relief of unemployment, then let us borrow for such things as forestry and land reclamation, so that we will be able to take unemployed people off State subsidies and doles and put them on work which will eventually be remunerative to the State.  How much of that have we done?  During the past few years we have made some bog roads.  That, of course, is very useful; at the present time it is possibly a help in providing fuel for the country.  But, generally speaking, road making is not a productive work.  It may possibly ease the load upon ratepayers in some particular locality or county.  It may facilitate certain people in getting to and from their dwellings or their places of business, but, on the whole, there is no return to the State.  To ask posterity to pay back the money that we borrow now for the relief of unemployment&mdash;money paid in the way we pay <Col N="2248" /> it&mdash;is to my mind not a legitimate transaction at all.  There are very many things in this country which are shouting for attention.  There are very many things which would give a return, but I do not think any person in this country has yet made an effort to tackle unemployment in a bold way.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot at the present time about the establishment of a new order.  In central Europe there are people who boast of having a new order, which, say, the British people object to.  They say they will not have that new order, but nevertheless they themselves are talking about a new order.  Altogether, the trend of world politics at the present time is that there is a recognition by all nations and by all representative people that the order that we knew is coming to an end, and that there must be some type of reorganisation of the working classes in every country in the world, so that a man will be able to earn his living if he so desires, and that he will not be put in the degrading position&mdash; it exists in this country and in most countries&mdash;of standing at the corner drawing the dole.  I do not think there is anything so demoralising as that. By that dole we have sapped the morale and manliness of the people of this country.  Quite recently, I read in the papers that a certain prominent British politician had said that there could be no peace until the ordinary working man is in a position to earn his livelihood and support his wife and family on his earnings.</P>
    <P>Coming up here to Dublin by train some few weeks ago I saw one instance, and last week passing by a labour exchange in Dublin I saw another instance of our failure in this country to do anything whatever in that direction. We have hundreds of young men clearing out to a bomb-stricken area to earn money, and mind you they are going from a country in which the Government promised an El Dorado, in which the Government promised that not alone would there be work for all our people, but that we would have to bring our people back from America to help us.  Last week, passing by a labour exchange here in Dublin I was struck by the appearance of 300 or 400 <Col N="2249" /> girls, crushing in a queue which was regulated by police, in order to sign their names to a document so that they would either get a chance of work or get the dole.  Yet we come in here complacently and think that all is well because we have no new taxation.</P>
    <P>There is a sore in our midst, and somebody will have to deal with it.  If this Budget contained £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 or £5,000,000 to deal with that canker, I would not find fault with it, but I do find fault with borrowing unless it is set out clearly and distinctly that the work to be undertaken is work which will afford some type of return.  Let us not delude ourselves that all is well.  Here we are in 1942, after practically three years of war.  We are still carrying on.  Thank God, we are still able to carry on.  Our resources are dwindling.  There are calls for economies on all sides, and rightly so.  There have been calls upon the Government for economies, but the Minister in his Budget speech informed us that he cannot meet the deficit nor can he meet any part of it by economies in Government Departments. Now, it were better for the Government to own up to their mistakes.  It were better for the Government to admit that the policy on which they came into power, the policy of &ldquo;take from him that has and give to him that has not&rdquo;, was a bad policy.  The policy should have been: &ldquo;Produce more.  If possible, get every man into production of some kind or another.  Create assets in this country.&rdquo;  The policy of taking from him that has to give to him that has not, without any regard to production, was a false policy, and was bound to fail.</P>
    <P>The Government had a feeling&mdash;I think there was no Minister of the Government, if my memory serves me right, who was more imbued with that feeling than the present Minister for Finance&mdash;that the spending of money was not in itself an evil; that if money was taken from those that had it, and spent, it got into circulation and did everybody good.  They have carried that policy too far.  Our policy should have been that the person who has made money by production should set <Col N="2250" /> the example to other people, in order to put others into production.  The policy of taking and giving failed in bigger countries than this and gave no results.</P>
    <P>When the Government were called upon to economise, the Minister said he could not do it.  Unfortunately, when the present Government came into power, they felt, apparently, that Departments were under-staffed.  I give them every credit for being convinced of that as, if they had not that conviction, they would not have staffed every Department to the extent to which they did since they came into power.  I am sure the present Minister for Finance is as anxious as I am and as, say, the <i>Irish Independent</i> is, to economise in Civil Service salaries and staffs, but he cannot do it as, to him, it is impossible.  Why?  Because he has been caught up in the threads of the web which he himself has woven and he cannot get out.  We have set up top-heavy Departments and have increased the personnel&mdash;every civil servant is a cog in the wheel and is assured of permanency and a pension when he retires. What is to be done with them?</P>
    <P>Take the Department of Agriculture: is agriculture to-day&mdash;or has it been for the last ten years&mdash;showing a greater profit to the country than previously?  Here is what has happened. The number of officers in the Department of Agriculture, according to this year's Book of Estimates, is 588 and the cost is £196,474.  In the Book of Estimates for 1932 the figures were 319 and the cost £117,321.  I have taken that Department alone, because agriculture is our mainstay.  Has the Department, during the ten years of office of the present Government, brought more production into the country?  What has it done, in excess of what it was doing previously, to make it worth the money to the farming community and to the country, and to give a return for the extra cost? One may say there was a necessity for the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Supplies, but why has the Department of Agriculture increased like that?  According to to-day's papers, we are threatened with a bacon shortage in our own <Col N="2251" /> country and retailers will get only a quota from the factories, and according to the factories and the people in touch with the situation, our figures for pigs were never so low before.  That is bad.</P>
    <P>My eyes were opened the other day in my own locality in another respect and if the two instances shown to me are a true indication of the position, I am afraid we will enter the post-war period with very low prospects.  There are two farms in my parish with which I am well acquainted.  Both of them, after having their required tillage done, are used for grazing.  The owners of both farms are in very poor financial circumstances, and for some years past both of them have been letting for grazing.  In a farm very convenient to me, it was pointed out that, at mid-May this year, there were only 16 cattle, where there were 75 last year.  On another farm about three miles from where I live, the position was similar.  I have not very much faith in statistical figures and would be much more worried by figures of that type.  If our pigs have gone and our cattle population has fallen, we will walk empty-handed into a post-war period.  That will be very bad.  If our basket is empty, we will have nothing to bargain with.</P>
    <P>On the question of borrowing, I do not like to see the Minister come into the House and say that there is no new taxation, as he is going to borrow. If he said he was borrowing to make preparation for the post-war period and to get the country on its feet in a particular economic way, it would be quite a different matter.  As it is Budget time, every member of the House should try to get a true picture of our situation.  Let us learn from the past.  We have had ten years of Fianna Fáil Government and ten years of Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I want to make no distinctions whatever. That ought to afford us an opportunity to draw upon our imaginations and produce a good picture of what has been happening in the country.  The outstanding point&mdash;and never so outstanding as since the war started&mdash;is that our only riches are those of the <Col N="2252" /> soil.  We have nothing else.  If we want industries we must pay for them out of the return we get from the soil. With that example before us, what should be our policy?  We cannot alter the situation: our geographical position and our economic situation will remain. This is a small country.  There is no use in deluding ourselves into the belief that we are a big people.  We are not. We are a small country.  We are a weak country.  We are not looking forward to acquiring new possessions. Consequently, our position in the future will be very much the same as it has been in the past.  We will always be depending upon the products of our soil.  It is necessary and advisable that we should have industries in this country.  In so far as we can have industries based upon native raw materials we ought to go all out for that.  Any other industry in this country will have to be based upon the amount of agricultural exports we can maintain.  It cannot be on any other basis.  We ought to let that fact sink in.</P>
    <P>What are we doing then to exploit the productivity of our soil?  Rather should I ask, what are we doing to maintain the productivity of our soil? At the present moment, unfortunately, we are greatly reducing its productivity. That is inevitable.  I am not saying that it is the fault of the Government. Circumstances over which they have no control whatever are responsible for that.  But, to me and to people who live on the land, who, as far as we possibly could, have endeavoured to keep our feet on the ground, it is a matter for daily worry in regard to the future of this country and of those who will come after us. Because, if we come into a post-war period with the productivity of the soil of this country reduced, if we come into a post-war period empty-handed, with our baskets empty, with nothing with which to make a bargain, if we find ourselves in the position that we will not be capable of fulfilling the requirements of somebody who needs agricultural products and that some other country has taken our place, then indeed posterity will have cause to curse us.  That is the alarming side of the picture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2253" /> We have bread queues.  I have seen them in the city.  I have seen queues at the labour exchange.  They are depressing.  We have a shortage of commodities at the present time, a shortage of the necessaries of life.  We have a scheme of distribution that is a disgrace to the Government.  That is one thing the Government cannot back out of.  I do not think it would be tolerated or accepted by the people as a scheme of distribution in any other country.  If there is anything in the threat which Deputy Belton has thrown out as to future lawlessness in this country, it will come, in my opinion, because of something of that nature.  I do not want to go into details at the moment because details do not fit in here, but there are certain people in this country selling goods on the black market which they are supposed to sell unrationed to the poor people.  It is happening, I will not say with the Government's connivance, but it is happening with their knowledge.  It is happening because of a scheme which is so loose that it invites deception, roguery and thievery. I know it would be difficult to get a water-tight or foolproof scheme, but there is no use in pretending that we have a policy in regard to distribution unless we have one.</P>
    <P>We have got to take great care at the present time.  We have got to see that the poor people are fed.  We have got to see that the food is grown.  On the whole, it is not an easy time for a Government.  I admit all that.  But what I hate is pretence, pretence that we have a scheme, pretence that we are doing something when we are not.  It is discouraging to come into the House and to have it bluffed off that things are being done in regard to the distribution of food, tea and other things, when they are not and when everybody knows they are not.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister, when he suggests that he is going to borrow, how it is that borrowing in this country costs us so much as compared with, say, borrowing in Britain. I have seen figures recently published in the <i>Economist</i> from which it would appear that Britain at the present time <Col N="2254" /> is borrowing mostly at 2½ per cent.  I do not know why we have to pay 3¼ per cent.  Possibly the Minister for Finance knows, but I think the public are entitled to know.  In the borrowing of £1,000,000 the difference would amount to something like £7,000.  We cannot afford that.  It is bad enough that we should have to borrow to meet expenditure, but it is worse still that we should have to borrow at too high a price.  I appeal to the Minister to find some method which will enable him to borrow for suitable employment schemes.  I have always objected to borrowing for the present schemes. They are not productive.  They do not pretend to aim at the removal of unemployment, but are temporary expedients. We are not entitled to borrow for temporary expedients.  I tell the Minister that the farmers are doing their bit, and if they find next harvest that they have crops to reap, and that men standing at the corners are drawing the dole, there will be trouble.  Surely farmers who have worked hard and tried to produce food are entitled to help.  It is up to the Minister and to the Government to provide some plan to deal with that position.  I am not referring to the plan that was there ten years ago to bring the people home from America. That was all cod.  It was never meant. It was an election dodge and nothing else.  That is no good to us now.  We are in a tight corner, and all must put their shoulders to the wheel in order to get out of the rut.  Consequently, I again appeal to the Minister to look around for productive schemes.  They are there.  They have to be tackled boldly.  Nobody has yet shown any ambition to tackle them boldly.  Workmen must be placed in this position, that they can earn a living, and that they will not be demoralised by the dole or be beholden to anybody for charity.  That situation is approaching in this country as surely as it has come to other countries, and the Minister should note it while there is time to do so.</P>
    <P>The world is at war and there is talk about the new order that is going to be established.  We have peace here, thank God.  What are we doing to <Col N="2255" /> establish that type of order which will ensure that the poor are fed, and that what they want will not have to be bought in a black market in competition with people who have money to buy?  The present position is not reassuring. I want the Minister and his followers to realise that it is no matter for congratulation or for complacency that we have not had new taxation.  It is otherwise.  We have no plans and no new taxation.  If we are going to spend what we borrow it is a dangerous practice. That may be necessary sometimes but, in my opinion, we have overstepped the point when it was wise to continue doing that.  I advise everybody to picture the real situation, and that is that we are borrowing because we cannot inflict any further taxation on the people, because, in other words, they cannot bear it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual presentation of the Budget presents Deputies with the opportunity of reviewing the position of the country and relating the policy of the Government to the prosperity or lack of prosperity affected thereby.  As the position has been very widely debated I do not intend to deal with it at length, but the three cardinal points that struck me are those affecting unemployment, food and fuel. Judging by the standard of supplies at present available one is inclined to say that we are not getting value for our money from the policy being pursued by the Government.  I would not quarrel about the size of the Budget or the amount the Minister had to provide if I knew that it was going to be put into channels of a constructive character, that would enable people to be put to useful work, and to build up brighter prospects for present and future generations.  A previous speaker has pointed out that that has not been done, and that the money spent was not put to very useful purposes. I hold that that is perfectly true.  Time after time the Government have been appealed to, to depart from the niggardly method of tinkering with the unemployment problem, and to grasp it boldly, by spending money and taxation to put people into employment at reasonable rates of wages which <Col N="2256" /> would enable them to become useful citizens.  To spend money in that way is not wasteful.  Wise spending is the best form of economy.  I know of no better form of economy than of employing workers, because they do not hoard their money or build up bank balances. They spend their money, and it is put into circulation in buying the needs of their families and in that way is of certain advantage to the whole community.</P>
      <P>There were remarks made during this debate about the demoralisation of the dole.  I consider that a man standing idle in the street who is without the dole is to be pitied.  The demoralisation is not in the dole.  It is in the fact that the Government allow people to rust for want of employment.  While it is regrettable that there should be queues at the labour exchanges, at least they serve one useful purpose, by bringing these unfortunate people from the secrecy of their hungry homes to the front streets, where the attention of passers-by is focussed upon them, and perhaps it may make them realise that they have a responsibility towards the unemployed. They have a hard lot to bear and it is degrading to see Irishmen, and particularly Irish women, standing in queues and still more regrettable to hear innuendoes from people in responsible positions suggesting that there is lack of a desire for work.  We were told this afternoon by one Deputy that when some fellows playing cards at Phibsboro' were asked to go to save hay they told the farmer to bring the hay in and that they would save it. Was that incident meant to convey the attitude of Irish workers towards employment?  These unfortunate men at Gardiner Street were whiling away the time playing cards because, incidentally, if they were caught doing a side job they knew they would be disqualified from further benefit.  If they went to save hay for a farmer who might employ them only for one evening, when they finished with him the labour exchange would not give them anything.  It is a vicious system into which we have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real acid test of Irish workers' attitude towards employment will be <Col N="2257" /> found in the never ending stream going to Britain to labour even underground and in work of that kind.  They are prepared to take any risks and show that they are not slackers but are prepared to work.  The tragedy of it is that we cannot get the Government to see their way to provide work for these people at home.  Deputy Brennan pointed to works that could be usefully done here.  That was pointed out from these benches time after time, in an endeavour to get people put into useful employment like the reclamation of land or afforestation, which are wealth-producing activities.  Men employed in that way would not be wasting their energy.  They would be improving themselves and adding to the national wealth.  The only difficulty is the provision of money.  I will not go into that question now, as the Government and the Minister do not seem to see their way to recognise that these activities would be a form of wealth.  They tell us that they have to borrow at a high rate of interest.  There is work waiting to be done here.  The arrears have been piling up for many years, and the men are idle.  They are leaving the country.  I am sorry to say that never in the history of the country was emigration so great, not because of land trouble, but because of the absolute failure of the Government to face up to their responsibilities by providing useful employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton has spoken on the question of fuel and of cutting down woods and making timber available for the people.  I agree with a good deal of what the Deputy said, but his statement went further.  He said that sufficient timber to roof a house could not be got here.  That is a very poor compliment to present policy in that respect, and very undesirable.  Since this emergency arose, in the area from which I come we have luckily been able to build hundreds of houses, using native timber.  I have seen it go through the process of seasoning and it should not be said of our native timber that it is so inferior and useless that nothing could be done with it except cut it up for fuel.  There is plenty of scrub wood which could be cut down for that purpose but a good deal of our timber is useful in the provision <Col N="2258" /> of housing in the absence of the foreign timber which has now ceased to come in.</P>
    <P>On the question of turf, which has to do with our main fuel problem, Deputy Belton asked why the wages of the turf workers were not fixed before the price of turf was fixed.  That would seem to be a natural question.  But that was not done.  Speaking in the House the week before last, the Minister for Supplies said that if an increase took place in turf workers' wages it would have disastrous results for the consumer. I would argue against that that the figure paid to the turf worker has an inconsiderable bearing on the price eventually paid by the consumer. The fixed price for turf is £3 4s. Od. and, if that is related to the wage paid to the worker in the bog, it will be found that it is very little influenced by it.  In my own county, the wage was 5/- per day and the regulated price £3 per ton.  Turf cut at 5/- a day in Limerick was delivered to the different institutions there at 35/- How is one to account for the difference between a price of 35/- for turf cut at 5/- a day and the price of £3 to the consumer for turf cut at 5/- a day? There ought to be some investigation into those prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £3 in the city and the price delivered to public institutions was 35/-.  It will be agreed that 5/- a day was not unreasonably high remuneration.  The County Council of Limerick recognised that and unanimously recommended that 7/- a day be paid to these men.  They have not yet succeeded in getting ministerial sanction for that.  Neither have the requests from other counties been sanctioned. The Government stands pat because the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Hugo Flinn, puts down his heavy foot and says that 33/- shall be the maximum.  He relates that, I suppose, to the agricultural wage.  On another occasion he did not relate the figure in question to the agricultural wage.  He related it to his own opinion of what an Irish worker was <Col N="2259" /> entitled to get.  He told us that if we protested against a wage of 21/- a week the workers affected would tear us limb from limb if they could get at us. Irish workers will not now accept 33/- from Mr. Flinn.  He has an opportunity now of going to them and presenting them with 33/- and I hope he will keep all his limbs together.  They are not going to accept 33/-.  The result is that the turf-cutting season is being frittered away.</P>
      <P>In various counties, men are standing idle and the good season is being frittered away.  Turf is being treated as wheat was treated.  Deputy Belton said that the producer ought to be paid.  He should, but Deputy Belton did not go far enough.  He spoke only of the farmer-producer.  Surely, labour ought to be paid, too, whether engaged in the production of turf or of agricultural products.  It is unfortunate that the Government cannot see their way to consult the county councils and people on the spot and have a fair wage paid to these men. They are reasonable and a bargain could be struck between them.  This high and mighty attitude is not the right attitude.  That was done in connection with wheat and we see the result now.  If the increased price had been given for wheat in time, there would have been a bigger sowing of winter wheat, but the opportunity was lost.  We are presented with the same policy in regard to turf.  This dictatorial attitude is taken up and representations from the local bodies&mdash; or such of them as have escaped the guillotine&mdash;are receiving very scant respect.  If that continues, the happy position in regard to turf production last year may not be repeated in 1942-43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the previous speakers adverted to the hardship caused by the scarcity of bread.  We were told about the bread queues in Dublin.  Bread queues are not confined to Dublin, though they may not be so spectacular elsewhere.  There is a good deal of complaint, particularly along the western seaboard, even up to Donegal. It may be surprising to learn that we <Col N="2260" /> have hunger in County Limerick, even in the centre of it, known as the Golden Vale.  The people there are supposed to live on the fat of the land. I have here a list of men and their families and the amount of flour they are able to secure at the present time. I was dealing with the Departments concerned to-day and the particulars I have cannot be controverted.  A man with a wife and 11 of a family receives one stone per month, another with seven of a family one stone, another with ten of a family one stone.  A man with 13 of a family received no flour this month.  Two other men with families of 12 and 17, respectively, received one stone per month.</P>

      <P>The hardships caused by the food situation have been stressed, but that has not been generally accepted by the Government.  We have been told that, in many cases, there was no necessity for bread queues, and that the people were there only because they wanted fresh bread.  In a part of the country where the people are supposed to be reasonably comfortable, the position is as I have stated.  That has taken place through lack of sufficient planning on the part of the <Col N="2261" /> Government.  The situation is not one of which the Government should be proud.  We are told that the shortage of bacon and the drop in the pig population are attributable to the fact that wheat was found in the stomachs of pigs sent to 16 out of 33 bacon factories. How carefully did the Government go into that question before making these harsh charges against the people&mdash;that they were feeding wheat to pigs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The man found guilty of feeding wheat to pigs or other animals would deserve very serious treatment. I have been making investigations in a small way in my own area, and I do not think that the case is established by the reports the Government have got from their inspectors in the bacon factories.  It is possible that some wheat was found in the stomachs of pigs.  If so, it is just as likely that it was picked up by those pigs after it was being loosely threshed.  If a farmer decided to feed wheat to pigs, he would not do so without boiling the wheat.  If boiled, it would not be possible to discover the wheat in the stomachs of the pigs.  On this slight foundation has been based a very serious charge against the farming and pig-rearing community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of the 6/- cut inflicted by the Government and of its general policy is that the people have gone almost clean out of pig production.  I suppose I would be safe in saying that at the present time we have not one-third of the normal pig population in the country.  We have not sufficient bacon even to feed ourselves.  We have been drawing on reserve stocks for some time past, and now we are going to be rationed.  I think that is a very serious situation for the Government to contemplate.  If there is one thing that we should be able to develop to maximum capacity and to continue in all circumstances, a thing which has been a great source of wealth for this country in the past, it is pig production. The decline in this industry is a matter which calls for very serious consideration by the Government.  Every effort should be made to devise some steps to arrest the decline that has been evident <Col N="2262" /> ever since the setting up of the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board.</P>
    <P>That board was established to give confidence to producers and to stabilise to some extent, prices over the whole year, but the reverse has happened and we have had a continuous decline in the industry.  The cardinal mistake made last year by the Government in reducing prices by 6/- per cwt. at a most critical juncture has been well-nigh fatal, and will want to be speedily attended to if it is not going to have disastrous consequences on the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We find that at the same time that our big population is dropping, our milch cows and our poultry are also rapidly disappearing.  All the stand-bys of the community are fast disappearing off the map and we have got a corresponding reduction in the standard of living to try to meet that depression.  The workers' standard of living is forced down by expedients such as Order 83, but the real truth is that the national wealth is disappearing and we are making no attempt to build it up.  I suggest to the Government that if they continue this policy and if expenditure is going to be carried on along the lines on which it has been carried on in the past, there will not be many more Budgets to be brought before this House.  It will not be a question of imposing taxation on this or that, because there will be nothing left to tax.  Indeed there is very little left at the moment to tax. I am, however, more worried by the general position of the country than by the size of the Budget.  I am much more concerned to see our pigs, our milch cows and our poultry disappearing for the want of feeding stuffs of some kind.  Things which, as I say, were considered stand-bys, that were considered as a sort of nest-egg by the rural community and eventually for the country as a whole, are fast disappearing under the ægis and the misguided policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government should adopt a much more courageous policy than they have operated for some time past.  Let us not talk of a new order after the war.  What about a new order <Col N="2263" /> now?  We are not in the war and now is the time to reverse engines.  Everybody is prepared to throw in his lot and co-operate with the Government in building up a much more prosperous condition in the country, so that there need be no necessity for workers to fly from their own country, leaving their wives and their children here to compete in the market for a declining volume of commodities.  The money that is sent from England enables these people to make demands on the declining quantity of these commodities in a way that the Taoiseach deprecated and put forward as an argument for refusing to permit increases in the wages of Irish workers.  He said that to increase Irish wages would be to enable people to make bigger demands on that market.  But these people who receive money from England are placed in that unfair position as against home wage-earners, of being able to purchase larger quantities on that diminishing market.</P>
    <P>I want to relate that fact to the policy the Government has pursued in regard to the wages paid to workers here at home.  Every man who leaves the country is able to send home £5 or £6 per week to his dependents.  Has not the spending of that money an unfair influence on the declining volume of supplies available for workers who earn their wages in this country?  The argument that to increase wages would be to enable workers to make further heavy demands on our dwindling supplies is one that has been used to many deputations who have gone to the Government to put before them the unwisdom of keeping down wages while prices are soaring.  Despite the utmost efforts of the Government prices have continued to soar but, notwithstanding that, we get Order No. 83 and Order No. 166 which to my mind is not any improvement.  It does leave room for some slight adjustments in wages, but the conditions under which it has been imposed are demeaning and degrading, and are intended to be so, to workers and their organisations.</P>
    <P>From every angle the Government has seemed to set itself to ride roughshod <Col N="2264" /> over existing democratic institutions. They have scrapped, as far as they could, the trade unions and limited their powers.  They have scrapped a large number of public bodies by Order.  They have a record of having scrapped 31 public bodies since they came into office, 31 bodies the members of which were elected by the same franchise by which they themselves were elected to power&mdash;the votes of the people.  Sometimes without a semblance of inquiry, merely on some slight allegation of inefficiency, down comes the guillotine and out goes another board.  This may be considered very good policy by the Government, but I am reminded that someone at one time said: &ldquo;Whom the gods destroy they first make mad.&rdquo;  The going-mad process is a very serious thing for the country as a whole and very grave discontent is evident amongst the people.  Apart from the political side, the economic position on the presentation of this Budget is anything but a happy one and it does not reflect any credit on the policy which the Government has so far pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister for Finance since he came into power has a good deal to answer for. Since he became Minister he has not introduced one balanced Budget in this House.  He has brought in year after year a drunken unbalanced Budget, one that is not able to stand on its own legs.  How can we expect the people of the country to be thrifty when we find that the head bookkeeper of the country cannot even balance his own books?  That is setting a very bad headline.  We are always told that our people are extravagant and thriftless. Where do they get that tendency only from the Minister for Finance and the Government Front Bench?  I would ask the Minister to realise that the extravagance of a good deal of our people may be attributed to his failure to bring in balanced Budgets.  They say to themselves: &ldquo;If the man in charge of the national bookkeeping of this country cannot do his bookkeeping correctly why should we try to do it?&rdquo; The people of the country are in a very serious position at the moment.  We find that there is a lack of practically <Col N="2265" /> all essential supplies, essentials of life and essentials of production.  It will take our best efforts to overcome these difficulties.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Government to try to tighten its belt more in the future than it has in the past.  The Government has issued too many Orders and has not seen to it that they were carried out.  That is one of the ridiculous features of the situation.  Order after Order is dished out and we are told that if so-and-so happens, it will mean jail for the offenders.  I certainly say that if Ministers carried out the terms of these Orders they would be doing only their duty, but they have not carried them out, with the result that the country is not being properly governed.  It is being governed by gangsterdom and by black markets run by people who are absolutely outside the control of this House.  The Government is responsible for that.  We are to-day in the grip of one of the greatest black markets known in Europe.  There is not the slightest effort being made to deal with it.  I agree that the black market has saved a good many people and kept them in employment, but it is unfortunate that that should be the case at all.  I myself know that in my end of my county there are dozens and scores of people working on the bogs to-day who would not be working there at all, and would be out of employment, were it not for the fact that they can get tyres for their bicycles in the black market.  We have the Government coming along now and saying that tyres can only be sold at such a price, but what is the use of making an Order of that kind when both the Government and the people know that no tyres at all can be procured through the ordinary channels, that the only means that the ordinary labouring man has of getting tyres is to go into the black market, and that if he is not able to do that he may stay at home idle?  The blame for that is not on the working man, but on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things should never have been allowed to drift as they have been allowed for the last two years.  Some effort should have been made to forestall the position in which we find ourselves at the present moment.  No <Col N="2266" /> effort was made to ration the essential food supplies of the people, and the result is that our poor are in a desperate plight.  Everybody with responsibility in this country called on the Government, when there was a reasonable amount of supplies here, to bring in a rationing scheme so that rich and poor would be treated alike. At the present day, the ordinary well-to-do people and the rich people are in reasonable comfort, and some of them are very comfortable.  They have all the necessities of life, and more; some of them have enough to keep them going for the next two or three years in reasonable comfort.  Right beside these people, you have the poor and the lower element of the community, who have, practically, not a grain of tea to make a cup of tea for their husbands or their sons when they are going out to work on the bogs. How can you expect people to be quiet and easy in their minds and consciences when they see such things happening?  I ask the Minister and the Government to do something to equalise matters and not to have this canker in our midst.  Even though it is late now, I ask them to have a decent rationing scheme of all the necessities for the welfare of the people who have to carry on the work of the nation.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a great deal of dissatisfaction in the country over the way the Department of Supplies has bungled and muddled for a number of years.  The bungling and muddling of that Department has been the cause of nearly all our troubles, and I ask the Minister for Supplies and the Government to make some effort to govern in reality, and not to be allowing outsiders, gangsters and black marketeers, to be the governing factor in this country to-day.  What respect will the people, who elected us to this House, have for us if they find that the essential right to rule, which they entrusted to us, is allowed to go outside this House?  It is the duty of the Government to rule, and to rule with justice, and outsiders should not be permitted to be the governing factor.  Why is it that Mountjoy Jail is not packed to overflowing with all the racketeers who are operating in connection with all the <Col N="2267" /> different commodities in this country to-day?  It is because the Government are too cowardly and weak to do the job for which they were elected.  They are afraid of becoming unpopular in the country, but whether such action would render them unpopular or not, it is their duty to be just to all the people and not to a particular few.</P>
    <P>It is very sad, in going around the country, to see the destitution that exists in the homes of people with large families in this country, and I must congratulate Deputy Dillon on his able speech here, asking that something should be done for the family man.  Very often, a single man, living by himself, is able to knock out a living, somehow or other, but in the case of a family man, with ten, 12, and sometimes 14 in a family, and perhaps only one of them working, picture to yourself the destitution and desperate misery that must exist in that household. Yet, we, who claim to be a Christian people, stand idly by and allow that kind of thing to happen.  I think it is only right and fair to demand from the Government and the people of the country that the family man should get first consideration in this State.  We complain that we have a dwindling population here, but what else can you expect when the more responsibilities the family man has&mdash; the more children he brings into the world&mdash;the poorer he will be and the less chance he has of getting work? In the City of Dublin, for instance, the first thing a man is asked by a boss is whether he is married or single.  If he is single, he is elected for work immediately; if he is married and has one or two children it is doubtful if he will get any work, but if he has ten or 12 children, he is told to clear out, that he is not wanted there.  You have the same thing when it comes to getting a house or a lodging.  There is very little chance for a man with a large family, because the children are supposed to be dirty little things, who will tear down the walls, break the glass in the windows, or soil different parts of the house.  I think that that is a terrible blot on us, who claim to be a great Christian people.  We are all <Col N="2268" /> crying out about the decline in population, but we are not making the slightest effort to help the increase of population by seeing that the family man, first of all, must get all the necessaries of life.  The family man should get preference over the single man, and he is not getting it.  The only hope in this country of bringing up a clean, healthy race of people is to put first things first, and the first thing that should be done is to ensure, in the case of the family man, that there will be an adequate allowance for every child he brings into the world, for the good of the country, for the good of Christianity, and for everything else.</P>
    <P>I must say that while going around my county I found a great grievance amongst old age pensioners and the widow and orphan pensioners as to the manner in which the referees or inspectors in the country assess the different means of the poor.  I have experience of these committees myself, and I say that the calculations that are being made in the assessment of those people's property are desperately unfair.  A man with four or five acres of bogland is put down as earning £50 or £60 income on that, which is absolutely ridiculous, and the result is that, instead of getting 10/-, he only gets 1/- or 2/-, and is lucky even to get that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wanted to call attention to it, and I think something should be done in that matter.  After all, these poor people have only a few years to live, and we should not do anything to prevent their having some little happiness for their few remaining years until, as one might say, they are lucky enough to be released from the bondage in which they are held here.  With regard to emigration, of course, it is unfortunate that after 20 years of native Government we have the same old canker here, and that the only outlet for our people is to get out of the country as fast as they can.  It certainly is a blot on the Government <Col N="2269" /> and on all of us, who proclaimed for many years&mdash;some suffered death or imprisonment on account of it&mdash;that we wanted the right to govern this country ourselves.  We have got the right to rule it now, but what have we done with it?  First of all, we got a country with no national debt, and to-day we have a national debt of £111,000,000, with no return to be shown for it.  We are faced with a declining population, emigration is rife all over the country, and we have this burden of £111,000,000, with absolutely nothing to show for it.  That has been brought about by muddling, incompetence, and all that goes with bad government.</P>
      <P>The people of this country have nothing for which to thank the Government, but they certainly have a lot to condemn them for, because they spent years and years making false promises to the people, and then, when they did get into office and got the power to spend, they went on for years feeding the dog with its own tail, giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  Thanks be to God, however, they cannot go on doing that, because there is no money left now.  What we want here is business methods.  As Deputy Belton said, if we had six or seven real businessmen running the country, there might be some hope, but at present the whole system of government here is run on narrow political lines.  The whole thought in the minds of the people opposite is: &ldquo;If we do this or that, what will the people think of it; will it be good or bad for ourselves, and can we go to the people and be secure for another five years?&rdquo; That is the whole idea, and it is a wrong idea.  There should be more honesty and honour in people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are lucky, I know, to have escaped the revages of a war that has torn Europe and the whole world as under, with the exception of a few little nations, but I think that no thanks are due either to the Government or to ourselves for having escaped the ravages of the war, and I think it ill becomes us as a Christian and Catholic people, to sit here complacent, seeing the destruction that is taking place, and not to thank, within our hearts, what really has saved us, and as honourable men to say that it <Col N="2270" /> is the hand of God alone that saved us and not any efforts of our own.  After all, we are here now in the third year of the war, and yet we find that not the slightest effort has been made by the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or the Government to make some suitable return to the Almighty for His blessings, of making a suitable public demonstration of our loyalty and faith in Him for having saved us in the past and in the present, and praying that He will save us in the future.  Would not one think that a Catholic Ireland and a Christian Parliament, when they see what is happening throughout the world and how we here are being kept from this war through the Divine Providence, would make some suitable return, a public manifestation of our faith, to Him who has saved us: that we would call a national day of prayer to show that we who have survived 500 years of persecution are prepared to proclaim to His Divine Majesty Himself that we are loyal and true to Him, and desire to make some return to Him for what he has done for us during the last three or four years, and implore that He will protect us in the future?  How can we expect to be kept immune from the war if we sit here and do nothing ourselves and make no return to Him?  I think it is a disgrace. I have been watching day after day to see if some effort would be made by the Government or by An Taoiseach or someone in a responsible position to proclaim to the world that we owe our immunity in this war to no other source than God Himself.  I would ask that something would be done in the coming year to show that we appreciate our position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryAMcDevitt" hpid="Mr. McDevitt Mr. McDevitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDevitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Keyes has said, this Budget gives Deputies an opportunity of reviewing Government policy and of taking a picture of the country as a whole.  The Minister for Finance naturally does not want Deputies to enter into details of the wages paid for the cutting of bogs and matters of that description.  I do not propose to follow the course pursued by Deputy Keyes.  What I would ask the House to do is to take stock of some of our blessings.  Deputy Giles <Col N="2271" /> finished, apparently, on that note, though he began his speech with a highly amusing description of the Budget as a drunken and unbalanced Budget that could not stand on its own legs.  He did not elaborate his argument by telling us how we could balance the Budget except by resorting to borrowing, as the Minister proposes to do.  I am quite certain that if the Minister had put further taxation on the people in the Twenty-Six Counties there would have been a howl of horror from the Deputies on the opposite benches.  Year after year we have heard, very often, that the people are not able to stand any further taxation.  Certainly, this year, if there had been any increase in taxation, that howl would have been redoubled because of the growing seriousness of the emergency position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we find it impolitic, and perhaps not good economics, to impose extra taxation this year, there seems to be only one feasible alternative, and that is to resort to borrowing. Economies there might be here and there, but economies on the grand scale of £4,500,000 would be very hard to find in our present circumstances. Therefore, the Minister did perfectly right tomorrow, and I venture to say that 98 per cent. of the ordinary people of this country thoroughly agree with him.  In this period statesmen all over Europe have been telling us that this war is being fought to decide the fate of the world for no less than 1,000 years.  I read in the newspapers some time ago that a statesman in South Africa made a statement to that effect.  That may seem to be an exaggerated statement.  When statesmen and heads of governments speak in that way it may perhaps be said that this war will decide the fate of the world for at least 100 years.  We here in this country, by our own unaided efforts, are trying to paddle our own canoe.  We know the demands that are being made on the people of the warring nations.  If we can steer clear in this war, surely we are entitled to ask that posterity will bear some share of the burden of our efforts.  We are a creditor country in a relative sense. <Col N="2272" /> We are probably the greatest creditor country in the world, bearing in mind our population and resources.  Since the nations engaged in the present desperate life and death struggle have no hesitation whatever in piling up colossal debts that will have to be borne by their successors, then we, who are not in the war but are of it, did right, I think, when we decided to saddle some of our present burden on the generations that are to come after us.</P>
    <P>I go back again to the Budget, and submit to the House a third proposition. Had the Minister not borrowed but, instead, put on extra taxation, I say again that there would have been a devastating barrage of criticism from the benches opposite.  Those who listened to the debate on the Central Bank Bill will have heard Deputy after Deputy repeating speech after speech about all the millions&mdash;the £250,000,000 lying across the water, and the hundreds of millions lying under the control of the Irish banks&mdash;and asking this Government why, in heaven's name, did they not make that money available for the development of industry.  The very same arguments would have been put forward on the Budget had the Minister for Finance not decided to borrow.  The Deputies opposite would have besought him to borrow.  It all boils down to this, that when Deputies sitting on the Opposition benches talk as politicians they do so in order to get their speeches reported in the local papers, so that no matter what the Government do, whether they turn to the right or to the left or keep to the centre of the road, they are bound to go wrong.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies on the opposite benches, instead of blaming the Government for everything, to search their own consciences and ask themselves&mdash;apart from making political speeches here in this House&mdash; what can I personally do to help this country out of the situation in which it finds itself?  If they honestly do that, and go down to their constituencies and give that example by their work and advice, as far as they are able to do it, they will find that they are doing far more for the House <Col N="2273" /> and for the country than by making attacks here on the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDevitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing at all.  The Government like that and are not afraid of it, but, taking the country as a whole, I think it would be better for Deputies to give the example I suggest than to be attacking the Government. Let them combine some action of their own with their attack.  I have kept as closely as possible to the Budget statement. I ask Deputies to face facts in regard to the supply position and not be always harping on the black market as if there was nothing else in this country but a black market.  There is a black market in every country in the world that finds itself in short supply of certain commodities.  I venture to say that this Government have tackled it as effectively as any other Government. The vast majority of goods in this country can be bought in the ordinary way and in the ordinary shop the same as ever.  If there is a black market, the only people who are encouraging it, despite all the Government are doing, are the wealthy section of the community.  There, again, Deputies should exert their influence and use their position to stop that.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to depart from the Budget position, but I ask Deputies to count their blessings.  There is the inestimable blessing of peace for one thing.  There is, despite the speeches we have heard from the opposite benches, a reasonable degree of prosperity in this country.  I say a reasonable degree of prosperity, because there is no man, farmer or industrialist, who can make a fortune out of this war as they made it out of the last war. The workers generally are well clothed and, so far as supplies allow, well fed in this country; far better fed than the workers are across the water or in Northern Ireland, despite the high wages there and the so-called prosperous conditions.</P>

      <P>Because of the lure of easy money.  But food and money are <Col N="2274" /> not synonymous terms.  You may earn £12 per week in Manchester or Birmingham, but you will only get one egg per month.  A pound note is not the same as an egg.  The Deputy should know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDevitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hard for me to explain British psychology during this war, but I have my own ideas as to why they do not buy our eggs. Let us take a look at Northern Ireland, where the great wages and the prosperous times are supposed to be. I come from a Border constituency and probably am more in touch with the Six Counties than any other Deputy here.  I can tell you quite plainly that, were it not for the food produced by the farmers in Donegal in the shape of butter, eggs and commodities of that kind, the people of Derry City and Omagh would be on very short rations. I have been highly amused when reading in the papers about the questions put by the Rev. Dr. Little from the County Down to the British Home Secretary, asking him to put a stop to the wholesale smuggling of foodstuffs out of Northern Ireland into the Twenty-Six Counties.  As a matter of the fact, the boot is entirely on the other foot.  Let us look at our taxation.  It used to be always said, to put it in Northern lingo: &ldquo;When saxpence is saxpence in the South we'll come in.&rdquo;  So far as the South is concerned, they are more than &ldquo;saxpences&rdquo; now, and they have not come in yet.  But the fact remains that taxation here works out at £12 10s. per head per annum, while in the Six Counties taxation amounts to £34 per head of the population.  We are, I believe, the most lightly taxed community at the present time on the face of the globe.  That is blessing No. 4.  Our people, as I said before, live in peace and enjoy reasonable prosperity, and our workers, despite what may be said by Deputies on the Labour Benches, are earning far higher wages than they have earned for the past five years.  Last week, at the Letterkenny hiring fair, good farm workers got £40 per half-year, all <Col N="2275" /> found.  Two years ago they were only getting about £20.  If that is not a sign of a reasonable degree of prosperity, I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>Himself and a few youngsters.  It was only a pastime for them.  There is no good in exaggerating difficulties and saying that we are a poverty-stricken, hopeless people without an idea in our heads.  Let us be straight and true.  Deputy Davin is trying to get me into a hole, but he will not succeed.  There is not an agricultural labourer idle in my parish. The fact is that farmers cannot get workers.  We have heard talk here of people standing idle at street corners. I have not seen a man standing idle at a street corner for the last two years, owing to the policy of the Government to encourage the farmer to produce everything for himself.  If unfortunately, there are men found at street corners next year or towards the end of this year you may be sure that they will not be agricultural labourers. Unfortunately, due to lack of raw materials, we may have industrial workers idle and on the dole, but I will guarantee that there will be no agricultural worker idle who wants work.</P>

      <P>Thanks be to God, our workers have an alternative.  They need not remain under the sway of any <Col N="2276" /> slave-driver, as they have an alternative at hand.  If they are not satisfied with the work or the wages they are getting, they have a remedy.  They can go across in a boat which will only take four hours; but they can come back just as quickly.  I would ask Deputies occasionally to count their blessings I say that this Budget is the best possible Budget the Minister could have introduced.  Had he introduced any other Budget, he would have got the very same criticism.  As I say, he could not have introduced a better Budget, and he has the people 98 per cent. behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister had a somewhat difficult job to try to frame his Budget, this year.  I am sure that when he was making up his mind he thought of the old saying: &ldquo;Let well enough alone,&rdquo; or the other old saying: &ldquo;Let the hare sit.&rdquo;  Possibly he was wise when he reverted to the policy of borrowing.  Lest Deputy McDevitt may think that the Minister can borrow money for nothing, I would remind him that the Minister has got to pay back that money, if not now, some time in the future.  After all, it is an old saying: &ldquo;That he who goes a'borrowing goes a'sorrowing.&rdquo;  At the moment the capital debt of this country is well over the £100,000,000 mark.  We do not mind that as long as the money is put to good use.  Every one will agree that the Government cannot solve everything, that the Government cannot cure all evils from which human beings suffer.  I have never asked the Government to solve the problem of unemployment for the simple reason that I have sufficient commonsense to know that this or any other Government could not solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Deputy McDevitt is concerned, I am sure that he is one of the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party who, at some election four or five years ago, told the people in Donegal that if his Party was elected they could solve the problem of unemployment. I do not blame the Government for their inability to solve it, but I do blame them for telling the people that they could do so.  Human <Col N="2277" /> nature being as it is, it cannot be done. But a Government can, by the introduction of suitable legislation, do much to help people to get employment through private or public initiative. The old saying still holds good: &ldquo;Man shall earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no short-cut on the road to prosperity.  We thought there was in this country some years ago.  We thought when we got our freedom that the money would come just because we were free.  Instead of lying on the bed that we ourselves selected, we tried to show the world what great people we were.  We tried to go one better than other people.  We maintained a standard of living which the resources of the country could not hope to keep up with, and we are suffering for that to-day.  I am not going to dwell on that aspect.  I hope the idea that the Government could solve the unemployment problem has gone for ever.  Any money we spend at the present time should be spent as far as possible on work of a reproductive nature.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Budget statement I find, in the portion dealing with unemployment, the aggregate of the amounts which the Government spent trying to relieve unemployment.  I have no doubt they were perfectly sincere in trying to do all they possibly could for those who were idle.  The various amounts that the Government spent in this way totalled £6,000,000. Of that amount £1,250,000 went to what are known as special emergency employment schemes; about £750,000 went to ordinary employment schemes, schemes supplemented by subscriptions from local authorities.  There were other sums which went to the local loans fund to provide for the building of houses.  In the aggregate, the amounts came to £6,000,000.  I wondered whether portion of that money could not have been utilised to greater advantage.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying what was done in the past, and neither am I criticising the Government's present intentions, but it did occur to me that something should be done in the direction of keeping up the standard of our harbours. As the Minister is no doubt aware, <Col N="2278" /> harbours such as Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford, those on the western seaboard, and big harbours such as Cork, are in danger of deteriorating by reason of the fact there are no ships coming in.  Going around Dundalk quays the other day I saw nothing there but mudbanks and the river silting up rapidly; nothing but the silent cranes, their grant frames sticking up in the air.  It was a most uninviting sight and it occurred to me that if something is not done to keep the harbours in a state of preservation they will soon reach an almost irreparable stage.  We should remember that a stitch in time saves nine.  When the war is over it will be beyond the financial resources of the harbour authorities to bring the harbours back to the position that they occupied before times became so serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider this matter seriously with his colleagues in order to get a definite decision.  Those who know anything about harbours are aware that some are more easily maintained than others by reason of their position.  I trust the Minister will come to the conclusion that something must be done along the lines that I have suggested.  Then you must consider the men who have been engaged in unloading coal and other cargo boats. I am sure that in the different ports there were as many as 150 or 170 men earning a living.  During the past year, but particularly in the last six or seven weeks, I do not think those dock labourers have earned a penny.  A very serious position has arisen for them. They are not accustomed to other work.  Like the miners, they have been brought up to that form of labour; they have been accustomed to it all their lives and the different harbour authorities are not in a position to provide even skeleton schemes that would give some of the men employment.</P>
    <P>Some harbour authorities may be lucky, but I know that that is the position in Dundalk.  I realise that it does not add to the reputation of a town or district to say that it is practically down and out, but I do say that in that particular respect Dundalk has been hard-hit.  I make an urgent appeal to the Minister to bring this matter before the Government.  I trust that the <Col N="2279" /> position that exists in all the harbours in the Twenty-Six Counties will be taken into consideration and perhaps some money can be voted and works of a constructive nature carried out so as to leave the harbours in the condition when the war ends that they will be able to meet the, new situation that will arise.</P>
    <P>The next matter is one that may not appeal so forcibly to the Minister. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction as regards the supply of butter.  In the Dundalk district it was very scarce.  I am not here to criticise the Government or to blame the Minister for Agriculture, but I should like to submit this point to him.  In view of the fact that the price of butter has been increased, I think it is only right that the people should have an opportunity of getting all the butter they are willing to pay for.  I realise that, owing to the very severe weather recently, the supply of milk was somewhat down and the manufacture of butter was limited.  Is there any means of ascertaining the quantity of butter that has been manufactured in the different creameries? What method of distribution is adopted?</P>
    <P>I am not making any charge, but I should like to know if it is possible that an unscrupulous creamery manager could give a couple of tons of butter to a lorry-owner near the Border on condition that he would get 2/- or 2/6 a lb. for it, and then tell his customers: &ldquo;I can give you only 25 per cent. of last week's order&rdquo;?  Is it possible that that could happen?  Could unscrupulous wholesalers get a ton or two of butter on the understanding that they were going to distribute it evenly among retailers to whom they always distributed butter and they would then tell the retailers that they got only 50 per cent. of the quantity of butter they got the preceding week?</P>
    <P>Could that happen, or was it all due to the weather?  I do not make rash statements and I do not blame the Government for everything, but it is very strange that retailers of butter say, in a large town like Dundalk, who were accustomed to getting a couple <Col N="2280" /> of hundredweights of butter every week should get only 40 lbs. or 50 lbs. in a particular week, while a small man, to whom you would never think of going for butter, could get perhaps 60 lbs.  I do not know how it is done, but that is the position, and I honestly went out to get the facts for myself. That is why I ask whether it is possible that an unscrupulous creamery manager is putting the money in his pocket and saying: &ldquo;I am selling butter at the controlled price.&rdquo;  It is very hard on poor people to have to go around the whole town looking for butter without being able to get it.  I went around the town myself looking for a pound of butter.  Having failed I sent one of my boys out to the country to look for it, and eventually he got a pound of Cork manufactured butter in a shop across the Border. He travelled the whole town of Dundalk and the countryside, and the only pound of butter he could get was in a little huckster's shop across the Border&mdash;1 lb. of butter manufactured in Cork.  There is something very peculiar happening in regard to the matter.  That is why I want the Minister to bring it before the Government, so that they can examine this aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to tea, I am reliably informed that there are people in business who were cute enough not to take ration cards, and yet those people are getting their quota of tea based on the quantity which they got in the particular year selected by the Government.  It seems there is no remedy.  Those people are getting the tea, and can charge what they like.  I can understand the existence of a black market for tea that is coming in surreptitiously across the Border.  I know there are people who pay 15/- or 16/- a lb. for tea, but that tea would not be here unless they brought it across.  That is a matter, I think, over which the Minister or anybody else has no control.  A certain amount of swopping of commodities goes on, and, if people are prepared to take the risk of paying 15/- a lb. and perhaps losing all the tea afterwards, that is their funeral.  What I am referring to is tea within the Twenty-Six Counties. There are retailers of tea who took no <Col N="2281" /> ration cards and, therefore, they need not give tea to anybody.  I think that is one of the factors which contributed to the establishment of a black market in tea within the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to impress on the Minister again is in regard to the question of wages.  Surely it is about time that the Minister should bring the matter before the Government, so that, through a sense of justice, honesty and fair play, they will remove the restriction which prevents the members of our public bodies from giving a few shillings increase to county council workers.  I am one of those who always took a strong line in regard to wages and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on those matters not alone here but on public platforms, and I never made wild statements about what a man should or should not have, but I say that no Minister can stand over a payment of 30/- a week to those men in the year 1942, when prices are so high, especially in view of the fact that the members of the county council unanimously agreed to give those few shillings increase. Agricultural labourers have got an increase of 3/- per week, and surely it is only a matter of common sense, justice and fair play to allow public bodies to give a similar increase out of their own money; they are not asking the Government for it.  Is it that the Government want to drive the men from the roads on to the bogs? If that is the game that is being played, why not be honest enough to say so, and get all the county surveyors to dismiss the men and tell them they will have to go on to the bogs to produce turf?  One could understand that attitude, but personally I cannot understand the mentality of a Minister who deliberately flouts the unanimous opinion of a public body in regard to what is only a reasonable increase. At the present time, nobody can say that 33/- a week is too much for a county council worker.  For that reason I would again ask the Minister for Finance to bring this matter before the members of the Government and have that Order removed altogether in so far as it applies to those workmen. The Government gets much criticism&mdash;<Col N="2282" /> possibly some of it deserved and some of it undeserved&mdash;but in my opinion the Government, through the Minister for Local Government, is deliberately inviting criticism in so far as the wages paid to those workmen are concerned.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, after all that has been said on this Budget, I think that, taking an impartial view, matters could be much worse than they are.  We sometimes pride ourselves on being the greatest people in the world.  Well, we are not; we are no better and no worse than any other people.  We are left to our own resources now.  We have to rely on ourselves.  The acid test has arrived for all of us.  Do not let us fail.  It is up to every man to do his best to pull the country through in the very trying times that lie ahead. That cannot be done by undue criticism; neither can it be done by lack of initiative on the part of whatever Government is in power.  We must all be up and doing.  We must all cooperate. If we do, we will be able to pull through.  I was rather disappointed at some of the remarks made here to-day about the farmers, about prices, and so on.  I will not go into it now, but this I will say, that I know as much about the farming community as the next man, and, as far as I can see, the general body of farmers seem to be fairly well satisfied with the prices prevailing at the present time. The only thing that annoys them is the lack of material, especially fertilisers, oil for their tractors, and so on.</P>
    <P>In general, the situation could be much worse.  We hope and trust that when next year arrives this war will be over and we will be able to look to the future with greater confidence. That greater confidence can only be brought about by people coming together and doing all they possibly can&mdash;each in his own way and in his own district&mdash;to work together so that we may, please God, surmount the difficulties that face us.</P>

      <P>With all respect to the members of the House, especially those who spoke in this debate, I am not a bit sorry that it has ended.  This is the fifth day and at times it has been very tedious.  This afternoon Deputy <Col N="2283" /> Brennan talked about the danger of being lulled to slumber.  I was often nearly lulled to slumber by some of the tedious and long-winded speeches &mdash;mostly irrelevant, with all respect and with due deference to the Chair&mdash; on the subject of the Budget.  It was my duty&mdash;I will not say my pleasant duty&mdash;to listen to them.  I imagine it must be a record for length, if not for interest and excitement, in this kind of debate on the Budget.  There were speeches that&mdash;if I may be permitted to comment on them&mdash;I thought were excellent contributions.  Two outstanding ones came from my own side of the House, I am glad to say.  The first was a thoughtful and thought-provoking speech delivered by Deputy Childers, a type that we are becoming used to from him in the House; the other was one delivered by Deputy McDevitt. He praised the Budget, I admit, but Deputy Davin will agree that it was an excellent contribution to the debate and gave a lot of useful information, some of it new to some of us and new to me, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, most of the speeches were hardy annuals, trotting out criticisms and complaints about the Department of Supplies.  The vast majority of the many words to which we have listened dealt with that.  However, I am not objecting to that, but we have had many discussions in the last year and a quarter&mdash;since last November or December twelvemonths &mdash;on various aspects of supplies.  We have listened to many complaints about shortages and about the activities of the Department.  I am sure we will have them again.  As long as the war lasts, we are bound to have them, and with greater volume and intensity as supplies become more and more difficult to obtain.  Listening to many of the speeches, the question often came into my mind: do the speakers realise there is a war on?  It seemed that they have no thought of the difficulties of a Minister for Supplies, of a Government, of the country as a whole.  There are difficulties that no government&mdash; not even a government of archangels, with all the ability that, presumably, archangels would have&mdash;would find it in their power to solve.  I do not object <Col N="2284" /> to forceful criticism and I am sure the Minister for Supplies and the Government as a whole do not object. Whether we object or not, we get that criticism.  I have indulged in criticism myself and did make full use of my opportunities, and now that I am on the other side of the House and have responsibilities, I do not object if Deputies make full use of the opportunity given them to give the Government the criticism they think it deserves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn asked me a number of questions that I cannot answer.  I cannot answer the one about butter. The Minister for Finance has a lot of sins to answer for&mdash;some of them maybe, that even the Deputies have not thought of or discovered yet.  I have plenty of responsibility and many sins of omission and commission to answer for, but I am not responsible for the fact that the grass did not grow and that, therefore, there was not enough milk or butter in the last month.</P>

      <P>It takes the rain and the little bit of sunshine we have got in the last few days has helped, and already the butter situation is very much improved.  The Deputy is anxious that I should spend money in a variety of ways, and he makes suggestions about harbours&mdash;good practical ones, with all respect to the Deputy.  My job as Minister for Finance usually is to criticise schemes when they are put up and try to get good ones; but I do not need to go out looking for schemes on which to spend money: there are very many being pressed upon me&mdash;not all of them as good or useful as the one suggested by the Deputy some moments ago.  If the harbour authorities themselves have the interest of their own harbour and docks at heart, they should be up and doing and should put <Col N="2285" /> forward these schemes themselves.  I expect some of them will take note of the suggestions made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I need not go out to look for schemes.  There are many&mdash; some of them hare-brained schemes&mdash; put up every week in the year to the Minister for Finance, clamouring for more and more money out of the National Exchequer.  My job very largely is to sift the schemes, or at any rate throw out a lot of them which would not be helpful in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Several speakers referred to the paucity of the old age pensions.  Undoubtedly, 10/- a week will not give the old age pensioner a lot of money to go on the spree with every week, but from my own knowledge of a number of them, they regard it as a generous sum.  Like every other Deputy in this House, I would like to see more given to them, if we could afford it, and would like to see the widows' and orphans' pensions and the old age pensions and the amounts spent on social services bigger than at present.</P>
      <P>I noticed one or two Deputies complaining about the means test in connection with old age pensions.  That test cannot operate very much to the detriment of the pensioners.  Of the total of 142,578 old age pensioners on the 31st March, 121,089, or approximately 85 per cent., are getting the full 10/-.  Where, then, is all the complaint about the means test?  More than 85 per cent are getting the full 10/-, so there is not much foundation for the stories indulged in, mostly by members of the Labour Party and by one or two Deputies on the main Opposition Benches.  This afternoon, one Deputy complained bitterly about that means test, but it is not depriving them very much if 85 per cent. get the full amount.</P>

There cannot be many applicants thrown out on account of the rigour with which the means test is enforced.  That would not be the reason.  These are some questions that were put to me that I thought I would answer, but I was interested to find out if there was any foundation for the suggestion that there was a cruel attitude adopted by officials operating the means test towards the old age pensioners.  These are the figures I got, and they show that that accusation is not proved.</P>

      <P>That is my belief, on these figures, and the figures, I think, are convincing evidence of what I say.  Deputy Norton talked, amongst other things, about the question of a trade agreement.  The question of a trade agreement, to be made by this Government with Great Britain, has been raised here, to my own knowledge, several times already.  It was raised on the Budget last year and it was raised on other occasions.  It was raised in the Seanad.  I said more than once in the Seanad, and I said it here, that we have said publicly and openly that we have no objection in the world to the making of a trade agreement that would be useful and helpful to this country and, if such a thing were to be made, it would also have to be useful and helpful to the other country making it.  There is no reason that I know of why we, who do such a large amount of business with our neighbour across the Channel, should not have our business put on a good commercial basis by agreement or otherwise.  By agreement might be the better way. <Col N="2287" /> We have no objection but, as I have said, and as others have said, it takes two to make an agreement of that kind.  There must be two parties to it. We have no reason to object.  There is no reason why, if a suitable opportunity offered, we should not make that agreement.  We have expressed that opinion in public and in private where we thought it would be heard and listened to.  Deputy Norton wants to know was Britain hostile.  He also wanted to know about the question of coal.  There are great difficulties about coal, and great difficulties about petrol. The supplies position speaks for itself. Is it not a fact that there is a great shortage of coal in Britain?  There is nothing like the shortage that there is here, but so far as I know&mdash;I have not been there&mdash;there is a shortage in Britain.  According to the newspapers, they are doing their best to get British miners who went into the Army and Navy back into the mines to produce coal.  One Deputy made the remark to me to-day that the North of Ireland evidently gets coal, because the trains can be seen rushing down from the North, and that they do not seem to have any of the transport difficulties so far as coal and fuelling of engines is concerned that we have here.  At any rate, whether that is so or not&mdash;it probably is true&mdash;there are difficulties in England at present, great difficulties. They are rationing coal to industries and to private individuals. They are rationing petrol more and more strictly every month, beginning with the last six months.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I wonder does the Deputy know? Deputy Norton said that our sterling assets were not worth a dozen cocoanuts. These sterling assets that are &ldquo;not worth a dozen cocoanuts&rdquo; financed our adverse trade balance of 1939 and 1940 to the extent of £16,523,000 in 1939, and £13,822,000 in 1940, and in other years before that, more or less to the same extent. Therefore, there is no foundation for the exaggerated statement of Deputy Norton that our sterling assets are not worth a dozen cocoanuts.  With all the goodwill in the world, we cannot get things that are in short supply.  We cannot buy coal.  We cannot buy petrol.  We cannot buy iron, steel and other things, with these sterling assets at present except to a very very limited extent.  That is admitted, but it is not true and it is not right to say that our sterling assets are not worth a dozen or any other quantity of cocoanuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> If we are piling up credits owing to the position we are in, and continuing to pile up credits, we are in no different position from other neutral countries in Europe.  We are all&mdash;the neutrals in particular&mdash;more or less in the same boat as far as the piling up of credits is concerned.  All countries are piling them up with one or other of the belligerents.  The same difficulties arise there with regard to supplies of essential raw materials.  They are in short supply with the belligerents as they are with the neutrals. The belligerents generally have control of them and it is very difficult for the neutrals to get them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn was quite right in talking of the question of employment. He called to mind what I stated in my Budget speech, that there is £6,500,000 set aside in the Estimates this year for the provision of work and employment.</P>
    <P>Six and a half millions is a very good proportion of the total expenditure for the year.  That amount of money is scattered through the various Estimates, and is put aside to provide employment in one way or another.</P>
    <P>That £6,500,000, or a similar amount in these Estimates for years, has not, admittedly, solved the unemployment problem, but with the addition of the hundreds of thousands of pounds provided by local authorities, that amount of money has given employment to a very considerable number of men who would otherwise be on the unemployed list and perhaps the dole as well.</P>
    <P>I intended when dealing with Deputy Norton's point to refer to what he said about a trade agreement.  He used the word &ldquo;punctilio&rdquo;.  There was no question of punctilio, self-esteem, self-respect or anything of that kind involved. We are quite prepared at any time to make a business agreement with Britain or, if there happens to be any with any other country, that could send us supplies, or that would trade with us.  We would be happy to make such an agreement.  There is in existence, and has been for the best part of the year, certain arrangements&mdash;not an agreement, but barter arrangements. They have been in operation to a modest extent.  If it would help our <Col N="2290" /> supply position I would be glad, and I think the Government would be glad, if the barter arrangements that have been in operation were extended and enlarged in scope as well as in substance.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Budget Deputy Cosgrave, in his magisterial way, lectured us on finance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Cosgrave does contribute on financial matters, there are few men who make as many blunders on finance as he does.  He made a number of them in dealing with the limited finance he discussed regarding certain items in the Budget statement.  He talked about the corporation profits tax and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By reason of the concessions which he made he would be at a loss approximately of £500,000.  We might expect then that he would get in £900,000 as the result of the excess profits tax of last year.  On looking up the returns we find that he has only got £270,000.  He did not devote any of his statement to the reasons for the drop in his estimated revenue in that respect.  It can scarcely have been that there was such a catastrophic drop in profits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no serious drop in my Estimate.  I had estimated to get from corporation excess profits tax and the other changes, roughly an additional £1,400,000.  After the debate on the Finance Bill I made certain concessions which I said might roughly cost me £500,000.  They cost me a little more.  As a matter of fact I got <Col N="2291" /> £910,000.  Where Deputy Cosgrave learned that I could only get £270,000 out of excess corporation profits tax I do not know.  There is another reference. I would not call it a blunder.  I will let Deputies judge the wisdom of it for themselves.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no allowance made this year for over-estimation, and it was one of the characteristics of Budgets of the Minister's predecessors to have such an allowance made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no such allowance made last year and none was made this year.  Last year not alone did we not save anything on over-estimation but, as the House will remember, we had supplementary Estimates totalling nearly £3,000,000, and I imagine before the year is out&mdash; although I hope the sum will not be as big as last year&mdash;instead of making an allowance and reaping the benefit, we will probably have under-estimation.</P>

      <P>I would not call them profiteers.  I think there is a connotation about that word that would not be justly attributable here.  The suggestion of profiteering is something that is wrong and unjust, certainly in the present times.  That would not apply there.  The word should not be used then.  Another of Deputy Cosgrave's discoveries was when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We must bear in mind that most, of those companies which have been established since 1924&mdash;or is it 1934&mdash; have a further concession of 20 per cent. deduction from income-tax.  If the level of income-tax is at 7/6 then the companies which have a certificate from the Minister for Finance are liable only for 6/- income-tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no foundation for that statement. The companies got no concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the 20 per cent. concession done away with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a 20 per cent. concession to individual investors; companies get none.  That came from the gentleman who lectures us so frequently.  He knows all when it comes to finance.  There is another statement about tobacco and the amount that the Minister for Finance estimated to get.  Deputy Cosgrave said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Last year the Minister imposed a very high rate of tax on tobacco, amounting to 5/6 per lb.  He told us solemnly that he expected to get <Col N="2293" /> additional revenue of £1,870,000 from that.  He actually got £600,000, not £1,870,000....  Why is it that the tax which was then imposed to bring in £1,870,000 succeeded in raising only £600,000?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Deputy's question.  The figures he quotes are correct.  In my Budget statement, I counted upon an additional £1,870,000 from the increase in the rate, making a total of £6,735,000.  That is what I expected to get.  Actually, the receipts were not my estimated £6,735,000 but £7,410,000. The result was £670,000, approximately, better than I estimated&mdash;not £600,000 less.  Where Deputy Cosgrave found that mare's nest I do not know. Not satisfied with lecturing this humble Minister for Finance, who does not claim to be a financial wizard, Deputy Cosgrave lectures all modern Ministers for Finance, if you please. He says: &ldquo;Budgets are unbalanced because Ministers for Finance are dishonest.&rdquo; Is there a budget in Europe at present that is balanced, in the classic terminology and phraseology of Deputy Cosgrave?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You should go into an accountant's office sit there for a year and see how they balance there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have worked in a chartered accountant's office and I know what balancing budgets means. Not satisfied with lecturing this non-wizard of finance, all the Finance Ministers of Europe who are not able to balance their budgets&mdash;the reasons ought to be known and understood by the average citizen&mdash;are, according to the high and mighty financier on the opposite side, dishonest.  It is a pity they did not appoint him dictator-in-chief to balance the budgets of France, Germany, Britain, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. Where is the balanced budget amongst any of them?  They are all dishonest financiers?  The Deputy is completely lost here.  He ought to be put up on Mont Blanc to survey the whole of Europe, financially, and keep all the Finance Ministers straight.</P>
      <P>I now come away from finance to deal with another topic referred to by Deputy Cosgrave.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" />&ldquo;At that time we set up a defence machine</P>
    <P>&mdash;that was about May or June, 1940&mdash;</P>
    <P>to deal with that situation.  It does not appear that the intervening two years have worsened that danger. While at that time we were satisfied to expend a sum of, approximately, £6,000,000 in the year to defend this State, we are now, in a less dangerous time, prepared to spend over £9,000,000, and that requires some justification.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where did Deputy Cosgrave discover that we are in less danger now than we were in May or June, 1940?  What information has he on this subject that I have not got?  If he has any special information, I wish he would let us know and let us into the secret as to why this is a less dangerous time than 1940, and why there is less likelihood of our being in trouble of any kind as a result of this war now than there was in May or June, 1940.  I should be very happy, and every member of the Government would be very happy, if we could have the information on which he founds that opinion.  Personally, I hate to see money wasted.  I hate to see money that might be usefully spent on constructive work&mdash;in building up this country and the nation&mdash;spent on an army.  If I had my way, I would not spend £9,000,000&mdash;I would not spend even the £2,000,000 we used to spend&mdash; on an army if I were convinced that there was no danger or risk and that it was not necessary to have an army. I am satisfied that not alone is it necessary for us to have an army but that, probably, we ought to have a bigger and better-equipped army and that that would be one of the principal means of keeping us out of the danger that Deputy Cosgrave seems to think has passed.  I hope he is right in thinking that the danger is past, but I do not see any foundation for his belief.  No man in this House is less warlike than I am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could save £500 or £500,000 of the money spent on the <Col N="2295" /> Army, I should be very happy to do so. I am not a militarist in any sense of the word.  I regret that we have to spend money on an Army.  It may be that the expenditure enables young men to keep physically fit, but I would rather see the large number in the Army occupied at other work&mdash;work of more permanent, constructive value to the nation.  They are doing work of immense value, as things are, but I cannot see, for the life of me, how Deputy Cosgrave comes to the conclusion that we are in less danger now than we were.  No information has come my way which would lead one to that conclusion.  If Deputy Cosgrave has information that neither I nor the Government have, we shall be glad to get it from him.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy Cosgrave says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I wonder, if the Government were themselves submitted to examination before any impartial body, whether they would escape being abolished if they got a trial such as they have given to others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He did not give much trial to the members of the Dublin Corporation when he abolished that body in 1924. He made charges against them which he never attempted to substantiate but aside from that, which is the best body entitled to examine, criticise and subject to judgment, the Government?  The people of Ireland, the most impartial body, the most competent body, the body with the best right to examine, judge and investigate the doings of the Government.  They have the right to fire out the Government.  In the last ten years we have had several elections and the Opposition used, as was their right, the platform to point out the demerits, the wrong-doing and the inefficiency of the Government, according to their view.  They did it on every platform in every village and town in Ireland.  They got all the best speakers they could mobilise to tell the people of the wrong-doing, the evils, the infirmities and the incapacity of this Government and what was the result? What would be the result in the next election?</P>

      <P>There is that for all of us.  I shall be called, probably, before Deputy Davin, and I hope I shall have less sins to answer for. Deputy O'Higgins made, if I might respectfully say so, a reasonable, vigorous criticism of an unbalanced budget.  He laid it on as hard and as thick as he could in reference to the shocking example which was being given to the country by borrowing. Borrowing was the last refuge&mdash;these were not his exact words&mdash;of an unscrupulous Minister for Finance.  That was the sum and substance of his remarks. He was very eloquent on the subject.  Here is an extract from the report of his speech:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the headline set in this Budget?  The headline set for every family is this: &lsquo;Spend all you want to spend and borrow the balance.&rsquo; That is the way to run a house. Whatever you want buy it, and whenever you are short borrow.... Standards of finance, sound in normal times, must be departed from in time of war.  The justification for such Governments and Ministers for Finance is: &lsquo;We are at war.&rsquo; I do not admit that there is a carry-over of that justification.  I do not concede for one moment that because countries at war have entirely departed from any attempt to balance budgets, a small, poor country at peace is entitled to gobble that, hook, line and all, and say that all our previous conceptions of finance must go by the board, that there is no responsibility even to put a face on balancing the budget and that, whatever the difference between revenue and expenditure, it can be met by borrowing.  It may be sound, but it is a precedent that I believe will remain as a shadow over this House for a great many generations of Governments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a just criticism.  The Deputy is entitled to his point of view but if I err in borrowing, I am erring in good company.  I am erring in the company of what Deputy Cosgrave called dozens of Finance Ministers, of every country I know in Europe, in not attempting this year, at any rate, to balance the Budget but to borrow.  So <Col N="2298" /> much for Deputy O'Higgins.  As I say, the Opposition is there to criticise. Whatever the Government does, the Opposition will criticise.  As Deputy McDevitt said, and said very well this evening, if the Minister for Finance had imposed additional taxation this year to balance his Budget, imagine the howls of execration there would be from the Opposition Benches but, of course, as he did not put on taxation, but borrowed, he got the howls of execration all the same.</P>
    <P>I have just quoted for you Deputy O'Higgins on this year's Budget.  Here is what he said on last year's Budget as reported in column 242 of the debate of the 8th May, 1941:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Minister, although, as he says, it may not be the soundest kind of budgetary stance, is right, in an exceptional year of this kind, to come before the House and say frankly that there is still a very big gap left between expenditure and revenue and that that very considerable gap had to be bridged by borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He clapped me on the back for borrowing. He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Normally, I am told that it is a rather doubtful procedure but, in a year such as this, I think it was perfectly permissible.  It is certainly permissible and defensible when we view the weight of taxes that must be imposed even to narrow the gap that still remains.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus Deputy O'Higgins in 1941 and I have just read for you Deputy O'Higgins in 1942.  Whatever I did of course was wrong, but he did not object to borrowing in 1941.  He recommended borrowing as did Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan said last year: &ldquo;Why did the Minister not borrow more?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure it often occurred to other Deputies that politicians, like other people who shall be nameless, require good memories, and if Deputy O'Higgins had recalled the fact that he made this statement, recommending borrowing in such strong terms last year, he would not have been so voluble <Col N="2299" /> on the opposite attitude in his speech of last week.  Deputy McGilligan, last year, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If that is the situation, would it not be better to borrow a little more now when production is still maintained at some point, rather than to have to go to people and ask them to lend money because production has broken down?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He wanted borrowing last year and, although he did not come in this year, if he had come in, he probably would have given me a lambasting for attempting to borrow this year.  However, that is all in the game, and I do not object; only it is useful to be able to point out the inconsistencies. Deputy Cosgrave, recommending, as I mentioned earlier, that the Army cost should be reduced, stressed the same subject last year, and we had some passages at arms last year about the submission of the Army Estimates to certain bodies for examination, and so on.</P>
    <P>On account of all the talk and crosstalk that there was here last year about the Army Estimates and their being submitted and examined, as we were told they should be submitted, to the Defence Conference, I thought that probably Deputy Cosgrave would take the initiative himself this year and ask his own representatives on the Defence Conference to look carefully into the Army Estimates and see what they could do, at any rate, in the way of making suggestions for economies. I asked the Minister for Defence if the Estimates were submitted, and he said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I asked him were they gone through carefully, and he said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I asked did those colleagues of Deputy Cosgrave, who is so anxious for economies, make any suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is only about one other matter that I have to deal with&mdash;I have probably kept the House too long already&mdash;and that is about the concession we propose to make to certain companies, which Deputy Davin and others criticised. <Col N="2302" /> Having heard deputation after deputation, representing a number of these companies, having heard the Federation of Irish Industries, representing a variety of companies, I am satisfied that a number of these companies that will benefit by the concession would be seriously injured in their prospects if the concession were not granted.  I am sure that nobody in this House, even including all the members of the Labour Party, will deny that industries have been established here, established in good faith, that big capital or small capital, as the case may be, has been put into them, and that employment has been given in great numbers in some cases. I have examined the facts and figures that were put in front of me, and I am absolutely certain that I am doing the barest justice to some of these new companies in making the concession I propose to make.  I do not think that I am over-generous, and in fact I think that the concession I propose to make will mean, in the case of some of these industries at any rate, the difference between life and death.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in his speech the other day, quoted the case of one industry which, he thought, would benefit to an exaggerated extent under this concession.  I am not sure that I recognise the industry or company he had in mind&mdash;I am a bit doubtful&mdash;but if I am right in thinking that the one I have in mind is the one to which he referred, although not by name, I believe that that company will not even ask to benefit under this concession, that it would suit them better not to ask to come in under that umbrella, so to speak, and that they will do better without doing so.  Accordingly, I think that the case made by Deputy Norton falls to the ground&mdash;that is, if my estimate of the company he has in mind is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy, Dockrell asked about the total cost of the staff of the Department of supplies.  The provision in sub-head A of the Vote for Staff is £65,591.  There is a note at the foot of the Estimate which, I think, gives the figures that the Deputy was looking for.  The allied services, and services charged against other Votes, amount <Col N="2303" /> to, approximately, £82,000.  Therefore, the total cost of staffs in the Tables is £65,591, plus £82,000, approximately, or a total of £147,000 odd, but the figures are in the book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

      <P>Yes, the figures are in the book, at the bottom of the page. I think Deputy Dockrell was under a misapprehension in his reference to discontinuance of exemption after the death of an individual.  There is a specific exemption from the revaluation of stock in the case of a continuance caused by death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

I have my own views on this matter, but I want to keep an entirely open mind on the question until I get the report of the committee and see what recommendations they make.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one word more that I would like to say on the subject of borrowing.  Deputy Cosgrave made a reference to a certain country in Europe.  I was not sure what country he was referring to at the time.  He made reference to a country that was expending large sums on military equipment and on the Army, and said that it was able to get materials on the lease-lend principle.  I was not sure of the country he was referring to.  I thought it was Sweden, but some others said to me that they thought it was probably Turkey.  I tried to get full particulars of the financial budgetary position in Turkey and failed.  I did get figures for Sweden which is a small neutral country like our own.  I propose to give to the House the results of my investigations. They will be useful for the purposes of comparison.  I do not suggest that they are of any more value than that. <Col N="2305" /> I got the figures officially from the Consul-General's office here for Sweden.  What I propose to quote from is dated January 14th, 1942.  It is issued by the Swedish-International Press Bureau and is described as the 16th Annual Edition.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Budget proposal presented by the Government is of record size for Swedish conditions, mainly due to the very large sums for the country's military and civilian defence preparedness.  The ordinary Budget for the period July, 1942&mdash; June, 1943....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They divide their Budget into an ordinary Budget and an extraordinary Budget.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...foresees a total expenditure of 2,324,000,000 kr.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is over £136,000,000.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...for purposes which can be characterised as of more or less normal nature.  The high extraordinary costs for Sweden's military preparedness in its present mobilised state as well as certain other appropriations of estimated transitory nature are taken up in a special emergency Budget totalling 1,335,000,000 kr.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is £78,530,000.  That is their military budget for a population of 6,500,000.  The ordinary Budget is £136,706,000, and their military budget £78,530,000.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Of this amount, 1,220,000,000 kr. are calculated for military purposes, bringing Sweden's total expenditure for defence up to practically 2,000,000,000 kr.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is £117,647,000 for Sweden.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...while it is intended to cover the emergency Budget through borrowing...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to note that&mdash;that this £117,647,000 is on the military side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...but the ordinary Budget is to be balanced by taxes and other current revenues, which are calculated to be of the same size as during the current financial year.  In connection with the presenting of the <Col N="2306" /> new Budget, the Swedish Minister of Finance stated that the total expenditure of the Swedish State during the two years from the beginning of the war up to September, 1941, had amounted to about 7,300,000,000 kr....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>or £429,412,000.  That was the sum imposed by Sweden for two years largely because of the war.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...or about 1,200 kr. per head of the population.  About 4,000,000,000 kr. of this imposing sum had been met by taxes and other current revenues, and about 2,600,000,000 kr. by long and short term borrowing, while the rest was covered out of cash funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that, as I said earlier, if we are sinning by borrowing we are sinning in good company.  In our Budget of this year there is a sum of at least £10,500,000 that can be regarded as emergency expenditure, because, of the total Army expenditure of £8,942,000, I am taking £2,000,000 off. That £2,000,000 is roughly what we used to spend on the Army in normal times.  If you take the total on Army expenditure, the cost of the Department of Supplies, special emergency schemes, damage to property, personal injuries and the cost of food allowances, you get a total of £12,634,000.</P>
    <P>That is emergency expenditure for which normally we would not have to budget.  If we take £2,000,000 off that for the ordinary pre-war Army expenditure&mdash;it was about £1,700,000&mdash; that would give us £10,000,000, or £10,500,000.  At a modest calculation that is emergency expenditure in this year's Budget.  On the basis of what is done in Sweden and Switzerland and, as we know, in Britain, and, though we have not much intimate knowledge of their finances, certainly in Germany and in Italy, where they probably borrow to a much greater extent, if we borrowed £10,000,000 we would be doing just as other countries are doing.  I think that it is wise to borrow the modest amount of the total emergency expenditure that I proposed to the Government and, later, to the House that we should borrow this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2307" /> I do not at all agree with what a number of Deputies said&mdash;I think Deputy Brennan was the last person to use the phrase&mdash;that our taxation had reached saturation point.  I do not accept that.  There are still shots in the locker and still taxes that could be introduced and which would bring us revenue.  It does not follow that because we propose to borrow a pretty considerable amount but, nevertheless, in proportion to our total emergency expenditure, a modest amount this year, that we need necessarily follow that example in the year to come.  Each year has to stand on its own feet.  How do we know that the war may not end&mdash;let us hope that it will&mdash;and that when the time comes to consider budgetary problems next year these emergency things may be forgotten&mdash;they will have to be paid for, of course&mdash;and left out of account and that the money which is now expended on military and similar purposes may be used for development and national work of a more lasting and constructive kind than we are at present forced to spend it on, largely through forces over which we have no control.</P>

      <P>This Resolution deals with the corporation profits tax. When the Minister was speaking he recalled some remarks of Deputy Cosgrave when he spoke on that matter on the day the Budget was introduced. The Minister suggested that Deputy Cosgrave was entirely wrong when he indicated that the Minister did not get the revenue out of his new corporation profits tax which he expected.  The White Paper of receipts and expenditure that was issued immediately before the Budget of 1941, where an estimate <Col N="2308" /> was given of the receipts and expenditure for the year ending March, 1942, indicated that it was estimated that the corporation profits tax, as it then stood, would bring in £648,000. The Minister then indicated that he was putting on a tax that would bring in an additional £1,400,000.  He agreed, after subsequent discussion, to reduce that by £500,000; so that he expected then to get from the new taxation £900,000 in addition to the £648,000 which he indicated as the estimate of receipts at the old rate.  That would bring in £1,548,000.  According to the White Paper published before the Budget of the actual receipts for the year ending March, 1942, the receipts from corporation profits tax were £910,000.  What Deputy Cosgrave was pointing out was that, instead of getting £1,548,000, which he was expecting as a result of the old rate of taxation plus the new, the Minister got £910,000, and that, therefore, the receipts from the general corporation profits tax were down by £638,000.</P>
      <P>If that is not correct, I think we should get a clearer explanation of than the Minister gave us when speaking, because it is important that we should have a clear view of the trend of revenue.</P>

      <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the White Paper issued for the year ending 31st March, 1942, gave £648,000 as what he estimated at the old rate.  If the Minister refers to the table explanatory of the Budget for 1941 he will see that his expected tax revenue was £26,045,000, which included £648,000 that he expected from the corporation profits tax at the old rate.  I am taking off the £500,000 from the £1,400,000 and I am saying that the Minister expected to get an additional £900,000.  The table explanatory of the Budget added on an additional £1,400,000 to the £648,000 which was included in the tax revenue, and I would ask the Minister, in the light of what he said, to refer again to the White Paper issued before the last Budget and the White Paper issued this year, and to the table explanatory of the Budget issued in 1941, because what Deputy Cosgrave said is perfectly correct, and it is important that we should understand what the trend of the revenue really was.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a matter which will interest the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and I should like him to listen to the discussion because he may become involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated earlier to-day that I wished to refer to the inadequacy of the gas supply in the evening in Dublin under the new order that has been issued by the Gas Company, and to the difficulties in which the people in Dublin, particularly the working classes, find themselves as a result of that order.  Under the order the only time gas will be available after 1.30 in the afternoon is between 6 and 7 o'clock, and penalties are threatened by the Gas Company that gas supplies will be cut off if any person is found using the gas after 7 o'clock or immediately before 6 o'clock.  If we take the building industry in Dublin, the men engaged in that industry do not get their principal meal in the middle of the day.  The greater part of the workers get half an hour for a meal. They break off at 5 o'clock and are home shortly after that time.  Their principal meal is taken immediately after they come home.  Under the present arrangement a man who takes half an hour to get home arrives at his house about 5.30.  Normally he would get his principal meal then, but now <Col N="2312" /> he has to wait for half an hour until the gas is turned on and then he has to wait while dinner is being prepared.</P>
    <P>In any of the houses that I visited this morning&mdash;and I have been in quite a number&mdash;the general consensus of opinion among the women was that no meal can be prepared in an hour.  We are going to have, with regard to that particular class, a very serious situation. If a man gets home about 5.30, it will probably be about 6.45 when he can get his meal.  Take districts such as Marino, the North Dock area and down along by the East Wall. You have large numbers of workers in these outlying districts who are in the building industry, but who are in ordinary occupations in the city.  They are unable to get home for the lunch hour and the practice of taking the major meal in the evening is widespread.</P>
    <P>Some people think that taking the principal meal in the evening is the height of leisured respectability and elegance, but the conditions under which people work in the City of Dublin are such that in a very big number of working homes the principal meal has to be taken in the evening.  The principal meal cannot be provided in these houses if gas is available only from 6 to 7 o'clock.  The number of houses entirely dependent upon gas is very large.  Even in corporation houses, where they have electricity, the electricity has not been used for cooking and will not be allowed to be used for cooking now.  The difficulty of using the ordinary fire for cooking has come to this that there are many houses in which there has been no coal for 12 months and the odd meal that is prepared is cooked on a fire composed of sticks and turf.  It will be seen, therefore, that gas is of the greatest possible importance in these homes.  Whether the gas can be provided, I do not know, but if gas is available for one hour only in the evening, then we will have a very serious state of affairs in working-class districts.</P>
    <P>There are certain things involved, and the first is the health of our people.  That is a matter of prime <Col N="2313" /> importance.  The position is rendered all the more difficult by reason of the shortage of supplies.  It must be remembered that many people are subject to illnesses and, because of the shortage of supplies and the lack of gas with which to cook the food that is there, the situation will become increasingly serious.  A certain amount of public discipline is involved, too.  If this is to continue, then there must be a fuller explanation and closer contact between the authorities and the people. There must be some explanation as to what has been responsible for the situation that exists and what will be done to remedy it.  Public discipline and morale are involved.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to-day by the Minister's statement.  I hope the Minister for Supplies will be able to qualify that statement, that he has no responsibility in the matter of gas hours.  I think he has a very serious responsibility, even if it has to mean a control of the gas hours, to see that adequate gas is provided for what is the principal meal over a very large part of the city.  I submit to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that this matter is well worth inquiring into. He should examine what the result of the situation is likely to be if it lasts for any length of time.  I think that such a situation cannot last without inflicting the greatest possible hardship, physical and even mental hardship, on large numbers of people.  This is a matter that requires very urgent consideration and very urgent consultation with all the people likely to be able to help in the matter and there is great need for a Government pronouncement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to Deputy Mulcahy I should like, on behalf of other gas concerns throughout the State, to appeal to the Minister not to apply to these gas concerns the conditions which he possibly might apply in the City of Dublin.  I have some experience of running a gas concern and I am very alarmed, as all people who have a responsibility are, at the position in relation to the production of gas.  I know the situation in Dublin is very acute and requires urgent attention on <Col N="2314" /> the part of the authorities.  From my knowledge of the situation, the Minister's responsibility in this matter begins and ends with allocating the available supply of gas coal to the various gas concerns throughout the State.  If any serious consideration has to be given to the control of the supply of gas, I do suggest to the Minister that he should leave that to the local concerns, and not make the issue a national one to be directed by him, because, in my opinion, what will suit in one district certainly will not suit in another.  Conditions and hours which may suit in the City of Dublin, for instance, will not suit us in the town of Drogheda, and incidentally I may mention also the town of Dundalk in my constituency.  It is for that reason that I ventured to intervene in this discussion raised by Deputy Mulcahy on the question of gas.  I do know that the position is that gas coal simply cannot be obtained, and we are getting our proportion of it as it arrives, but we find great difficulty in the town of Drogheda in keeping up the gas supply.</P>
      <P>We have to use very inferior qualities of coal, and the simple answer, in my opinion, to Deputy Mulcahy's question to the Minister is that the gas coal is not available, and, judging from the reports which I read in the <i>Gas World</i>, it is not likely to be made available by the British Ministry of Mines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy is quite right in saying that the curtailment of gas supplies in Dublin is a very serious matter. It is bound to cause a great deal of hardship, but there is nothing we can do about it, and Deputy Mulcahy had no suggestion as to what we might do about it.  It is almost impossible to give any more adequate explanation <Col N="2315" /> of the causes of the curtailment of the gas supply than that given by the Gas Company in their public statement. As Deputies will remember, the Gas Company stated: &ldquo;The curtailment of gas supplies was due to the inadequacy of coal supplies and the unsuitability for gas-making of most of the coal received. An important contributing factor, however, has been the use of gas outside authorised hours.  In addition, the unsuitability of the coal, together with the insufficient saving in gas consumption, has resulted in our production plants being seriously overloaded, and it is now imperative that major repairs be carried out to them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It may be no harm to avail of this opportunity to give the House, and through the House the citizens of Dublin, a clearer picture of the position in respect of supplies of gas coal than they appear to have.  For a great many months past, the Dublin Gas Company has been facing the problem of how to limit the consumption of gas to the production of gas.  I do not want to enter into any technical details.  I do not know that any Deputy here would be any more competent than I am to discuss this matter as a technical problem, and I think we can assume that the Dublin Gas Company has all the technical advice that it requires and is efficient to handle a very difficult situation in the best way. But no amount of technical advice or no degree of technical efficiency will enable the Gas Company to produce gas without coal, and for months past the Dublin Company has been unable to obtain, either through its own efforts or through the efforts of the Department of Supplies, the quantity of suitable coal necessary to meet normal consumption.  Even such quantities as can be obtained are frequently delayed through causes outside the control of anybody in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal average production and consumption of gas in Dublin was 9.2 million cubic feet per day, which required practically 4,500 tons of gas coal per week.  Since last September, the quantity of gas coal allocated to the whole of this country by the British Ministry of Mines is 1,000 tons per <Col N="2316" /> week.  May I remind Deputies of the figure I gave them earlier?  The normal consumption of gas coal by the Dublin Gas Company alone was 4,500 tons per week.  The quantity of gas coal we have been getting since last September for the whole country is 1,000 tons per week.  That 1,000 tons of coal per week is allocated by the Department of Supplies to the various gas companies in the country, and the allocation is made upon the basis of normal usage.  Out of that import of gas coal, the Dublin Company gets, on the average, 660 tons per week, against a normal consumption of 4,500 tons. Every effort is made by the company to supplement that supply of gas coal with any other kind of coal that could be used for gas production, but the average imports of all classes of coal by the Dublin Gas Company since the beginning of this year have been 2,700 tons per week.</P>
    <P>When the company introduced the rationing scheme at the beginning of March, it was hoped that the hours then provided for would limit the consumption to the desired extent.  The hours of supply were cut from 24 hours a day to ten hours, with an additional hour on Sunday.  Notwithstanding that big reduction in the hours during which gas was available, the consumption of gas in Dublin fell only from 9.2 million cubic feet to 8.3 million cubic feet per day.  Now, it is important to know that of that consumption of gas, not less than 2,000,000 cubic feet were consumed during the off hours.  The gas company informed me that there are no practical means, under the system of mains in Dublin, of preventing that irregular use of gas.  The availability of gas in the mains during the off hours is confined to certain parts of the city, and, so long as the people living in those favoured areas are proof against all appeal and all threat, that excess consumption of 2,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day will continue.  For the consumption of 8.3 million cubic feet, which was the average daily consumption up to yesterday, approximately 3,200 tons of coal per week were used, against an average weekly importation by the company of 2,700 tons.  The fact that <Col N="2317" /> the consumption of gas in Dublin was not brought down in relationship to the importation of coal necessitated the introduction of the further rationing scheme which begins to-day, and it is estimated that this further reduction in the hours during which gas will be available will reduce the consumption to 7.1 million cubic feet. 7.1 million cubic feet is the quantity of gas which can be produced from 2,700 tons of coal.</P>
    <P>If the imports of coal fall below that figure, further restrictions will become inevitable.  When speaking of coal, it should be mentioned that very serious difficulty is being experienced in using a great deal of the coal which is brought into Dublin and which is included in the figure of 2,700 tons to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As I have already told the Dáil, in that 2,700 tons there is only 660 tons of the type of coal which ordinarily would be used by a gas-producing concern. A great deal of the coal coming in is slurry, and Deputies will probably remember that a very serious accident &mdash;which might have had fatal results&mdash; occurred some months ago when slurry was being used.  Deputies will note that the reduction in the number of hours during which gas is supplied from 24 to ten only produced a reduction in consumption from 9.2 million cubic feet to 8.3 million cubic feet. Although it is now proposed to restrict the hours of supply to five and a half, the consumption is estimated to be 7.1 million cubic feet.  It is clear that, if the 2 million cubic feet of gas which is now being used irregularly in the off-hours by people in certain districts, could be saved, it would be possible to get back to the position which existed up to to-day.  On the other hand, if the imports of coal fall further a more serious situation will arise.  Again, those people who are using gas during the off-hours will still have the benefit, to the detriment of everyone else.  It cannot, therefore, be too strongly brought to notice how these people are affecting the whole supply of gas to the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It may be asked how the company has been carrying on with their supply of coal below their consumption.  The <Col N="2318" /> reply is that they came into the beginning of the year with some stocks still on hand.  It was not a very large stock &mdash;only 5,000 tons&mdash;but it helped to eke out the supplies arriving in each week. That stock now is practically exhausted. On six occasions this year, the Department of Supplies came to the assistance of the Dublin Gas Company, by giving supplies of coal from the very limited national coal reserves.  I may also mention that, but for those national reserves of coal, the gas undertakings in Cork, Limerick and Dundalk might have been closed, at least temporarily.  In addition to coal, the Dublin Gas Company uses substantial quantities of fuel oil for gas production.  The restricted supplies of coal, as well as the inferior quality of the coal available, would require an increased usage of fuel oil; but that commodity&mdash;like all other petroleum products&mdash;is also severely restricted. However, we are endeavouring to give, out of the restricted supplies available, the largest possible proportion to the Dublin Gas Company.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that, in the quotation from the Gas Company's statement which I read, reference was made, first of all, to the inadequacy of the coal available; secondly, to the poor quality of that coal; thirdly, to the difficulty of preventing the consumption of gas during the off-hours in certain districts; and, fourthly, to the problem of plant repair.  It is the practice of the Dublin Gas Company to repair its plant during the summer months, and that process is being carried out at present.  The type of coal available to the company is such that more maintenance work is required than in normal times; and the fuel capacity of the plant at present, while those repairs are being undertaken is only 7.6 million cubic feet per day from the type of coal that is being received.  Therefore it is clear that, even if all the coal which the company could use were available, its total maximum production under present circumstances is 7.6 million cubic feet per day.  Having regard to the fact that it is not getting all the coal required, and that the coal it is getting is unsuitable for gas production, its <Col N="2319" /> total estimated output per day is 7.1 million cubic feet.</P>
    <P>No matter how we arrange the hours during which gas will be supplied in the city, the total amount of gas that can be supplied is 7.1 million cubic feet.  Now, as between individuals, there may be a difference of opinion as to the hours during which a supply of gas is most convenient to the majority of the people.  The hours during which it is now proposed to supply gas were fixed by the Gas Company, but were fixed by them with reference to their knowledge as to the portion of the day during which gas was in most general demand by Dublin householders.  We could alter those hours to some extent, but not if that alteration involves a larger consumption of gas than 7.1 million cubic feet, because that is the total quantity that can be made available.</P>

      <P>If that is the total quantity, why not run the evening hour from five to seven and give the people who have the work to do for their families the whack out of the gas available, and leave less to be consumed by the luxury hunters spoken about, who use gas after hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  If it is the people who get gas in the off-hours who are meant, what I have said is that no practical means exist of stopping them. Gas is still in the mains after the supply is cut off at the plant, and that gas drifts into certain portions of the city the altitude of which is higher than the centre of the city.  The people with houses in those areas cannot be prevented from using that gas, except in the manner which the Gas Company proposes to adopt.  They are making it a breach of contract between themselves and the individual to use gas during the prohibited hours and have said that, if they find individuals are using gas during those hours, they will cut the supply off altogether.  Apart from the enforcement of penalties of that kind, there is no physical method of preventing the gas being available to the householders in those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could, in fact, prevent the <Col N="2320" /> usage of gas during the off hours in those districts, there would be 2,000,000 cubic feet per day available, which would enable the gas company to restore the hours that operated up to yesterday.  Therefore, it is very largely a matter of securing, in the districts concerned, the co-operation of the public in not using the gas in the hours during which it is prohibited.  If they will co-operate, if we can secure that gas will not be used during those hours in those districts, 2,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day can be saved; and then the 2,700 tons of coal per week which the company gets will enable gas to be maintained during the ten hours that it was available each day up to yesterday.  This is assuming, of course, that the 2,700 tons of coal will continue to be received.  There can be no guarantee of that.  I do not want Deputies to misunderstand my attitude.  I appreciate as well as any other person familiar with Dublin conditions the hardship the curtailment of the supply is going to mean.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to say that more than 80 per cent of the houses in Dublin have gas for cooking laid on. That very high proportion of the number of residents depending on gas for cooking will give Deputies an indication of what curtailment of gas will involve, in the way of inconvenience and even of hardship.  But there is no remedy, at any rate, to be found by altering the hours during which gas is available, as it is not possible to make more gas available.  The total quantity of coal available, operated in the plant of the gas company, will not produce more than 7,100,000 cubic feet of gas, and that is all that can be given.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to convey to the gas company any representations made to me by Deputies as to the suitability of the hours they have chosen, but we cannot alter those hours in a manner which involves a greater consumption of gas.  If we make the evening hours 5 to 6, 5.30 to 6.30 or 6.30 to 7.30 or substitute an extra hour in the evening instead of midday, we cannot make available gas in greater quantity.  These hours are those considered by the gas company as the hours during which <Col N="2321" /> people are most likely to require gas, judging by their own records of usage.</P>
    <P>It is a matter upon which individual opinions are not agreed.  No two classes of people will agree as to the most convenient hours, but I think very little alterations in the existing hours could be made which would not cause as much new hardship as it would remove.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to hold out any prospect of an improvement in the position. Contact has been made with the British Department of Mines and this question of a larger supply of gas coal has been taken up with them on many occasions, the most recent of which was in the present week.  From the information supplied to me from that Department, it is quite evident that there is little prospect of any increased supply of gas coal.  Perhaps in some circumstances it might be possible to get a supply of other classes of coal.  An inferior slurry has been available to the company up to the present, and part of the company's difficulties are due to the fact that it has had to use that inferior coal.  The use of it has involved the breakdown of plant, and has occasioned the repairs now in progress.  I think we have to accept this position as one of the things inevitable in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>Has this question of six to seven, as the only hour after one o'clock, been the subject of consideration between the Minister and the Gas Company or any other people in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The Gas Company informed me of their proposals <Col N="2322" /> in the matter of a reduction of hours during which gas would be available.  I requested reconsideration of those hours, in the light of certain representations which I made.  The Gas Company did reconsider the hours, and made some minor changes in them, but they informed me that their knowledge as to the usage of gas in the City of Dublin indicated that the hours now in operation were the hours during which the great majority of the people wish to take gas and did, in fact, normally use the greatest quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister that the hour six to seven cannot stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be 5.30 to 6.30 or 6.30 to 7.30, but it is not possible to increase the period.  If you increase the period, it involves the use of more gas than is available.  There is no other possible solution of this difficulty in present circumstances.  We must secure the non-usage of gas in the off-hours by the people in the favoured districts, when gas is available to them in the off-period as at present.  If we can get those people to realise that they are causing widespread hardship and inconvenience in the city, by availing of their accidental position; and secure a general understanding amongst them to comply with the requirements of the company, and not to use gas during the off-hours, assuming the resulting saving can be translated into terms of coal it may be possible to extend the hours again.</P>
