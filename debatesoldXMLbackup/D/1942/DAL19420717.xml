      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night that the draft schemes for the services referred to by Deputy Mulcahy and, I think, Deputy Byrne, have been sent to several Departments in the last few weeks.  I think they have had them at least a month.  We have got back comments from the A.R.P. section, and I understand that we are prepared to adopt one or two amendments that they suggested to us, and, as far as they are concerned, I think the scheme is almost ready for publication, but we have to wait to get the views of the Minister for Defence so far as the L.D.F. is concerned, and of the Minister for Justice in relation to the scheme for the L.S.F.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The schemes, of course, will all be founded on the same basis.  It is contemplated that the basic rate for compensation will be as in the civilian scheme save that all members of the three services will be treated as earners.  It is also proposed to provide for compensation, within certain limits, in respect of loss of earnings by members of these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is loss of earnings in addition to the basic allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not know whether it is still in dispute but there was a dispute about the period over which that should operate.  I think it is agreed upon now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean that if a man was earning £5 a week and the basic allowance is 18/- that he will get £4 2s. 0d. as well as the 18/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not get full compensation for loss of earnings in addition, during that period, whether it be 13 or 26 weeks.  He will not get both.  He will get the loss of earnings, and, in the later period that would not be covered by the loss of earnings allowance, he will get the compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the loss of earnings calculated on the workmen's compensation basis or is it the total replacement of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>On his real wages, within limits.  There are limits. Deputy Mulcahy raised a point about the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  That does not exactly come under this Vote, but an amendment of that Act has been under active consideration for a good while, and I think it is approaching conclusion.  I do not think we can at all consider adopting the British rate of compensation here, however deserving the case might be.  In comparison with us, the British are certainly a very rich nation and have resources that we could not command.  As I said last night, we do not know the extent of our liabilities and nobody could know under present circumstances the total sum we are likely to be called upon to pay.  Therefore, we will have to walk warily and prudently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> I agree that for many of the people who may be injured the scale of allowances is certainly very modest in comparison with what some of these people may be earning but, as I say, we do not know what we are likely to have to pay.  When this war ends, if it is found that our liabilities are relatively light there is no reason why in the light of the fuller knowledge and in the new circumstances we should not reconsider and revise the proposed grants.  The difficulties which arose in respect of demolition and rescue squads and which were referred to last night, will, I think, be got over when the scheme is published.  I understand that agreement has more or less been reached with those in charge of the A.R.P. services who deal with the demolition and rescue squads, and whatever difficulties have arisen and have been responsible, as we are told, for the failure of some of these bodies to operate, will probably disappear.  I hope so, at any rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not have heard of this basis of loss of earnings for a period if we had not got the Minister to speak this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and, as a matter of fact, the people who are involved were not aware of it either, so that it would be advisable that, as early as possible, the Minister would make an announcement on these lines and would indicate that the proposal would be retrospective, so that the emergency services might begin to function in a full way, having the security that compensation will be available.  I want to ask also whether it is the approach of the Government to these cases of compensation that people who have been injured in this way will not be pushed on to the poor law authorities for assistance to rear their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we have family allowances, the position will be met, but not till then.  On Deputy Mulcahy's point as to the Minister's announcing the scheme of compensation on the basis of earnings, may I suggest to the Minister that forthwith the details of the basis of that scheme should be announced?  I do not believe that if a man who was earning £8 a week when he joined the Local Defence Force meets with an accident, he will get compensation and £8 a week during his period of disability. I imagine there will be a scheme analogous to, if not identical with, the workmen's compensation scheme, under which he will get a percentage of his earnings within certain limits, so as to keep him in reasonable comfort until he can resume his normal avocation; but it is a great mistake, if you are putting out a reasonable and even generous scheme, to have it come as an anti-climax as a result of having raised hopes too high.  The whole details of this scheme ought to be given now, when the scheme has been mentioned at all, and that at the earliest possible moment, lest misapprehension should arise.  May I also ask when people who have proved claims two years ago, or two and a half years ago, for compensation in respect of damage done to their premises by bombs will be paid?</P>

The rest of the legislation seems to be directed towards administration and the only issue of principle which I have been able to detect is: who owns credit money in this country?  Is it the private property of the joint stock banker, or does it belong to us, the people of Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very thing I intend to do.  I now allege that what is enshrined in this Bill, as amended on Report, is the statement implicit that credit money is the property of the joint stock bankers of this country. I challenge that implicit statement and I now propose to disprove that contention. This is the last occasion upon which we shall get an opportunity of ventilating this point, and if it is not ventilated now, it may very well be disregarded for our time in this country and that would be a disaster for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two methods of rebutting the contention that credit money here belongs to the Irish people.  One is the method of denying its existence, and that, as I understand it, is the position of the Leader of the Opposition. The position taken up by the Leader of the Opposition and by those who think with him is that a banker lends the money of his depositors and shareholders and nothing else, and that, therefore, the public have no concern with the activities of a bank, other than their personal dealings with it.  I propose to submit to the House that, far from that being true, the day the banker gets established, the least of his business is the lending of his money or that of his depositors and shareholders, that that represents only one-tenth of his activities and that the remaining nine-tenths of his total activities consists in lending and dealing in a commodity called credit money <Col N="929" /> which he creates on the strength of the fact that he is functioning in a community consisting of law-abiding men who maintain, by their several individual exertions, a stable community. This conception is so revolutionary to many persons who have never given any study to banking that a large number of people, without examining the evidence, simply throw their hands in the air and say that it could not be true; but the astonishing fact is that it is true, and, by the mercy of Providence, these facts were made manifest and placed forever on record in the evidence of the Committee on Finance and Industry which sat under the chairmanship of Lord MacMillan in 1931, and the minutes of whose evidence have been reported.  On the seventh day of that inquiry, there appeared before that commission, Mr. Frederick Hyde, managing director of the Midland Bank, Ltd.</P>

      <P>It refers to the powers given under Section 7.  I questioned the Taoiseach and I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now the Taoiseach reminds me that it has been said or implied already that the central bank will not create credit.  Can we put it out of our discussions, can we take it that none of us has any doubt about the matter, that, in fact, the central bank cannot possibly create credit?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach replied: &ldquo;I would not say that.&rdquo;  I then asked the Taoiseach whether he suggested that it could create credit, and he replied: &ldquo;It can.&rdquo;  I again asked him how it was intended that the central bank would give credit, and he replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are certain powers here which would have the effect of causing an expansion of credit.  If these powers were sufficiently big to be able to have a complete influence on the subject, then I would be in favour of the Deputy's approach; but I think that if you were to put in the words the Deputy suggests, it would mean that you believe that the central bank, despite any counteraction that might be taken, any action taken in an opposite direction, would be able to expand and contract credit.  I do not think that would be the actual situation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He implied that the powers that are in the Bill were sufficient, or at least did have the effect of enabling the central bank to create credit, and that there were external forces that might try to counteract it.</P>

      <P>That is not the point advanced by Deputy Dillon. If the Deputy wishes to argue that such powers should be vested in the bank, well and good.  That is quite a different matter from setting out to expound and prove a theory on which there are divergent views.  It is surely possible to contend that the bank should have that power without proceeding to establish a controversial theory.  That would be purely theorising, and is quite a different matter from the question to which Deputy Mulcahy refers.</P>

      <P>Why does the Chair desire to restrict my liberty in this discussion? Surely this is the place to determine whether there is a valuable asset in existence, and if there is, to whom it belongs.  I am stating that this Bill is evidential of the fact that the Government knows of the existence of this invaluable asset, and admits the proprietorship of the joint stock banks, and, acting on that assumption, legislates for a central bank.  My submission is that that is wrong, that that property is ours, and that legislation should be based on the assumption that the property belongs to us.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;You must not say so.&rdquo;  Why should I not?  I am the elected representative of 8,000 people. Is it simply because my voice is a single voice that it is condemned to be silent?  If the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party want to say something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If any Party in this House wants to advance a certain theory, who challenges its right to do so?  I do not know what Standing Order prevents their doing so.  I never heard anyone allege that a Deputy must accept what is printed in a Bill.  I am advancing the theory that here is something valuable, that here is something which the central bank should have control <Col N="933" /> of.  I am trying to persuade the Dáil that it is not the property of the joint stock banks.  That it is my property and the property of other citizens. Surely that is relevant?</P>

      <P>I wish to direct the attention of the House to question No. 871, where Mr. Frederick Hyde, managing director of the Midland Bank, describes the accounts of the Midland Bank.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I had perhaps better say first of all what are the figures that we aim at, because we do not always succeed in hitting exactly the figures that we are striving for.  We say that we want to keep about 11 per cent. of cash.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At question 906, the Chairman asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The operations of the Bank of England, as the central bank responsible, of course, for the ultimate supply of credit, affect you as the distributor of credit?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To that question, Mr. Hyde replies:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It affects our base, and as we are always striving to keep 11 per cent. of cash against deposits, if you increase the total of cash by £1,000,000 we should go on lending or buying bills until we have increased the deposits by £9,000,000, and the £1,000,000 has been absorbed.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>9th January, 1930, at question 906.  He goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We should do that unless something were to happen to stop us from doing it.  That is to say that our desire to keep our funds employed will always mean that we should go on with our operations so long as we have a surplus to deal with.  When we lend that surplus it does not destroy the surplus; it comes back to us, taking the banks as a whole, <Col N="936" /> from some other quarter; so we have still got it to lend, but we have only nine-tenths instead of ten-tenths, and next time we have only eight-tenths instead of nine-tenths, and so it goes on, until we have reached a figure nine or ten times the original cash base.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, are those words proof enough to put this question beyond doubt, that, in so far as the transactions of the joint stock banks of this or any other country practising what is commonly known as the British banking system are concerned, one-tenth of the funds they handle consists of cash, the shareholders' capital and the depositors' loans, and that nine-tenths of what they earn their money on is money that they call into existence in our name? Having called it into existence in our name, they charge our Government 3½ per cent. for the loan of it, and they charge citizens in our name 5 or 6 per cent. for the loan of it.  I want to ask this House why Oireachtas Eireann, in the Central Bank Bill, adopts as its own the doctrine that there is some holy right in the joint stock banks of this country to demand from the people and the Government payment for the use of credit money which exists only in their imagination?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as advocating any radical or reckless course of financial procedure.  I am fundamentally strongly conservative ; all my personal interests would suggest the most conservative possible line of thought for the protection of my own personal property in this State, but it seems to me utterly fantastic that this nation should allow itself to be dominated and deluded by an obsession which I am quite convinced was created and sustained by financial interests in the great international financial centres in the world over the last 60 or 70 years for the purpose of securing for themselves a larger portion of the world's wealth than in justice or in equity they were entitled to.  I do not want this House to imagine for a single moment that I advocate the expropriation of the joint stock banks.  I do not.  I do not want this House for a moment to imagine that I envisage some revolutionary <Col N="937" /> change in our banking system overnight, because I think on investigation it will probably transpire that no such revolutionary change is desirable or requisite from the point of view of any section of the community of this country.  But what is vital is that we should know the truth, and, with that knowledge, firmly resolve that this vast bulk of money should be used not primarily to earn profits for any agent who happens to be handling it, but primarily to serve the interests of the Irish people in facilitating exchange, stimulating production, and ensuring employment for the largest possible number of our people.  Credit, it cannot be too often repeated, has many of the characteristics of dynamite.</P>
    <P>Prudently used it can discharge many valuable functions, recklessly employed it can destroy the whole fabric of the State.  I think the analogy, between the use of dynamite in a coal mine and the credit of the community, is close.  Dynamite skilfully used in a coal mine can produce a great abundance of riches for the people in the form of excavated coal if used by skilled miners in a proper way, but carried in the same coal mine, with the same purpose, by a foolish person it can precipitate disaster, not only upon the foolish person who brought it there but on associates who risk themselves in his company and, at the same time, the property it was designed to produce, will all be lost in the collapse of the mine.  Similarly credit prudently used can achieve immense blessings for our people, but employed along the lines sometimes advocated by &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; who write in the <i>Standard</i>, Catholic so-called, and certain other periodicals of that character, can bring the whole of this State crashing down about our ears.  It is for that reason that I attach fundamental importance to having a statement from the Government as to their attitude on this fundamental principle.  If Oireachtas Eireann leaves it firmly fixed in the minds of our people that it accepts as true what I choose to describe as Sir Walter Leaf's views of banking credit, i.e. that the bankers lend nothing but <Col N="938" /> their own money and that of their depositors, then the public are going to look for leadership in this vital matter to the &ldquo;crack-pots&rdquo; and &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; who want to use credit for the purpose of blowing up the whole State.</P>
    <P>If our Oireachtas Eireann, representing all Parties, will make it manifest to our people that they fully appreciate the true nature of money, that they fully appreciate their stewardship as the elected representatives of the people, that they are restricted in dealing with it only by consideration for the public good, and that they regard themselves fully entitled in strict justice, to deal with credit money any way they like, and regard themselves as restricted by no suggestion, and that this credit money is the private property of any individuals in the State, then it places us in the moral position of saying to the people not to let crack-brained schemes be foisted on them.  No responsible person in the State has any delusions about the matter.  The sole use of credit and the money of the State is for the service of the people and any use to which it might be put which conflicts with that is immoral and wrong and should be prevented by the Government of the day.  Then we stand in a moral position before the people which entitles us to demand that our people should reject unsound principles put before them.</P>

      <P>My criticism of this Central Banking Bill is that it does not seem to adopt that line of independence that it should adopt, but that rather it seems to imply in its contents that it acknowledges that private ownership of credit money is in the joint stock banks.  I am warning the Government that if our people get the belief that we in Oireachtas Eireann accept that view then their leadership will be, as I say, the crackpots who write in the so-called Catholic newspapers, who think that the use of credit can be availed of as a plaster for every ill, and that it can be applied recklessly and prudently without any relation to the ill.  I want to ensure <Col N="939" /> that leadership in that extremely vital sphere of our national life should be retained by Oireachtas Eireann, where it belongs.</P>
      <P>The only way we can keep it here is by demonstrating to the people that in this House there is well informed and wide awake opinion in this vital matter, and that we are ready to deal with it as it should be dealt with, if and when the necessity arises.  From what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said I suspect that they have greater sympathy with what I am now putting forward than they deemed it expedient to express. Why do they not deem it expedient to say what they think?  What is this mysterious power that imposes discreet silence on them?  I never heard of any man doing any harm by speaking the truth.  I am perfectly convinced that the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and his colleague in this fundamental matter are in agreement with me.  Why do they not say so?  If they did, all views on this extremely important subject would be laid on one side, and the whole discussion which is at present of a fundamental character, could move on a plane of tactics and strategy as to how best to use the credit money of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately abstained from dealing with any other aspect of this legislation that is about to pass into law because, in my judgment, until that is finally determined no aspect of the banking problem can be properly pursued.  I most strongly urge the Minister for Finance not to let the Bill leave the House without a clear declaration from him as to what in his judgment represents the true ownership of that credit money.  Mr. Frederick Hyde said he would expand £1,000,000 cash into £9,000,000 deposits. He would continue to expand credit so long as a cash basis was provided for him to do so.  I want the Minister for Finance to say clearly and explicitly to whom in his judgment that credit money belongs.  The bankers say, I have no doubt honestly if misguidedly, that it belongs to <Col N="940" /> the joint stock banks.  I believe that Oireachtas Eireann should say clearly and explicitly that credit money belongs to the people of Ireland, and that under our direction it should be so used, and that those who handle it as bankers are not its owners but its trustees for the people of Ireland and must ultimately render to the people an account of their stewardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>After the discussions that have taken place on this Bill during its passage through the House, we have learned a little more of the Government's mind on the matter of currency and credit than we could learn from reading the original Bill.  I do not know whether all they have in mind has been added in the amendment. What has rather overshadowed the whole debate is the feeling on the part of members of the Government who have spoken, that they do not know how to use the credit that exists here in order to do the work that is required, and that they do not know how to protect the credit that exists from the dangers that exist outside. In other words, while the Government are very strong for economic nationalism and self-sufficiency and on what is one of the fundamental weapons for dealing with our economic situation, they seem to become completely helpless in view of the way we are mixed up with the outside world.  Section 6 of the Bill sets out, in dealing with the general functions and duties of the bank, that they shall take such steps as the board may, from time to time, deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.  On the question of the welfare of the people, as a whole, I take the phrase of Mr. Carter Goodrich, representing the United States at the International Labour Conference at New York.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To-day the leaders of the free peoples see more clearly than ever that &lsquo;the daily life of working folk&rsquo; is the central concern of public policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I take that as summarising the situation fairly well.  In present circumstances, I take a sentence quoted from Mr. Seán Lemass, incorrectly described as Minister of Economic Defence, in the report by the Acting Director of the International Labour Office.  In his report, the Acting Director says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Ireland, Mr. Seán Lemass, Minister of Economic Defence, has stated that &lsquo;in laying plans for post-war reconstruction, the primary aim must be so to organise ourselves and the national resources at our command that poverty and all the social evils that arise from it shall be eliminated and no other claims can have priority over that&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept that as the primary consideration which the central bank should have in effecting their predominant aim &mdash;the welfare of the people as a whole. I do not want to argue to whom credit belongs.  I asked Deputy Dillon the date of the quotation which he read and he said January, 1930.  I think I pointed out before that many people in close, practical touch with the financial affairs of Great Britain have said very emphatically that, in monetary affairs, more than in most affairs, there has been a revolution in thought and in practice during the past ten years.  Deputy Dillon thinks that we can have what credit we want on the 10 per cent. or 11 per cent. cash basis.  I quite agree with the Taoiseach when he said that one of the difficulties the banks here have in giving credit is that they do not know to whom to give it.  I agree that there is any amount of money available here but that it is not being used.  If we are to look after the welfare of the people as a whole, the Government must make up their minds to use some of the credit available, even on the present cash basis, in order to carry out investment work in the country.  It is perfectly clear that industrialists and even agriculturists, in present circumstances, are not able to provide the employment that would maintain our people as a whole and enable them to bring up their families.  Deputy Dillon insists that we shall work on the basis of the 11 per cent. cash expansion but, in the revolution of thought and practice <Col N="942" /> that has gone on and, particularly, in the revolution in practice which has obtained since the emergency, while the 10 per cent. or 11 per cent. cash relation to deposits has been kept, the cash basis is no longer the causal factor.  I quote again what I quoted from <i>The Economist</i> of 16th November, 1940:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Though it is permissible to doubt whether the immediately responsible officials are fully aware of the true import of their policy in effecting given adjustments in the volume of bank cash through the appropriate open market operations, there can be no doubting the fundamental reversal in causal sequence which has taken place.  The new procedure of working from the given volume of credit which the authorities regard as necessary to meet the circumstances of the day, to the appropriate amount of bank cash is not altogether revolutionary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is causing the creation of credit to-day in Great Britain is that the Government wants credit for certain important things connected with the welfare of its people and the bankers simply create the cash to sustain that credit.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is only since September, 1939, that the adjustment of cash to the needs of the Treasury has become open and unashamed.  We may hope that the objectives which the new technique will be called upon to serve in future will be more constructive than the deficit financing of to-day.  But there should be no retreat from the principle involved. It is improbable that we shall allow ourselves to go back to a position where the amount of available credit is dictated by a total of bank cash itself determined by factors, such as the output of new gold, over which we have no complete control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The credit is there and can be got. We need not waste time over the question as to who owns it.  We want to see that it is used and we want to know who is going to use it and how it is to be used.  We cannot maintain our people and look after their welfare <Col N="943" /> except on the basis of the production carried on in the country.  Above all other times, this is a time when we want increased production.  If that production cannot be carried on through ordinary machinery, the Government has to step in.  The main trouble in the present situation is that the Government do not know how to step in.  There are various ways in which the Government can provide employment and assist agriculture and education.  On the agricultural side alone, both with regard to our present and future positions, we have to take cognisance of what people suffering under such difficulties as the British are suffering are doing.  On that subject, I should like to quote again from the <i>Times</i> to show the extraordinary amount of development and instructional work of that particular kind which is being done by various agricultural committees in Great Britain.  A sample was given in the <i>Times</i> of what was being done by the Surrey War Agricultural Committee:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every county war agricultural committee has now set up a demonstration sub-committee which includes practical farmers, members of agricultural education staffs and members of agricultural firms who are accustomed to dealing with the farmers' problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the demonstration given at Surrey, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This was an ambitious affair, staged with the help of Imperial Chemical Industries, Limited, and covering a wide field from hedge clearing with a powerful American tractor and &ldquo;bull-dozer&rdquo; to silage making, setting tractor ploughs, wireworm control, mechanical potato planting, straw pulp and re-seeding pastures.  The effect on the mind was indeed rather confusing and the visitor needed to be very clearheaded to find out what really concerned him.  But this first big demonstration showed how much scope there is for such educational work on the practical side....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At any rate, the money is there, if the <Col N="944" /> interest can be arranged satisfactorily. What stood out in my mind&mdash;if something else stood out in Deputy Dillon's mind&mdash;in the course of this debate, was the importance of the rate of interest and the utterly haphazard machinery that the Government had for influencing the position of credit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance challenged me on some of the statements I made with regard to the rate at which credit is being obtained in Great Britain.  In column 84 of Volume 87, No. 4 of the Official Debates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But for 90 per cent. of it&mdash;I cannot give an accurate figure&mdash;they are paying 3 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And when he went into it later, in column 205 of the 27th May, he gave certain particulars of borrowings in 1941 and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;About 25 per cent. was obtained from treasury bills, and bank deposits.  As the Deputy mentioned last night, there are very low rates of interest there, but the balance of 75 per cent. was obtained at 3 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to <i>Hansard</i>, page 478, 21st of April, 1942, where, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, Sir Kingsley Wood gave a summary of transactions from the 3rd of September, 1939, to the 31st March, 1942.  I am changing the order somewhat in order to divide them up in moneys borrowed at 3 per cent., 2½ per cent. and 1? per cent.  I want to put that information in relation to the Minister's suggestion that, in 1941, 75 per cent. of the British Government's borrowings were at 3 per cent.  Those borrowings, from September, 1939, to March, 1942, were:&mdash;At 3 per cent.: Funding Loan, £120,000,000; National Defence Loan, £120,000,000; War Loan, £302,000,000; Savings Bonds, £666,026,000; Defence Bonds, £432,227,000; National Savings Certificates, which I am putting at 3 per cent., £452,901,000, making a total of £2,093,154,000 at 3 per cent., or 35.5 per cent. of the total amount of money borrowed during the period.  Under borrowing at 2½ per cent., I put in <Col N="945" /> National War Bonds, £1,316,327,000, or 22.5 per cent. of the total.  At 1? per cent.  I put the Floating Debt, £2,144,795,000 and Tax Reserve Certificates, £191,515,000, a total of £2,336,310,000.  Therefore, on the figures given by Sir Kingsley Wood on that date, 40 per cent. of the total borrowing of the British Government during the period of the war was at 1? per cent.; 22.5 was at 2½ per cent. and only 35.5 was at 3 per cent.  It bears out more closely what outside writers on the situation are saying&mdash; and proving by their figures, I think&mdash; that Great Britain is fighting this war on 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>On that question, I raise again the query why we had to pay 4½ per cent. for £1,000,000 to enable local authorities to cut turf.  The rate of interest is the most important thing and, in that connection, you must come back to the question why we have to pay 1 per cent. on deposits here.  We must change that completely, if we are to deal in a satisfactory way with the present situation.</P>
    <P>On the question of rates, I would re-quote from <i>The Economist</i> of the 23rd August, 1941, page 223:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A long-term tendency has exhibited itself for the demand for bank credit to decline.  Industry and commerce, in so far as they are not self-financing, increasingly prefer to raise their finance by methods other than the short-term bank advance. A bank is to an increasing extent becoming an institution which holds the current cash of the public and lends it to the Government.  The joint stock banks are approaching the state from which the Bank of England started: their main liability is the circulating medium of the public and their main asset is a fixed loan to the Treasury.  That being so, the time is approaching when a recasting of the traditional structure of interest rates will be necessary. If it is argued that the rate of interest paid by the Treasury to the banks should be increased, because otherwise the banks will not be able to afford the costs that the holding of deposits involves, that amounts to a claim that the State should subsidise <Col N="946" /> the depositor.  It would be far more reasonable to require him to pay the cost of the services he enjoys.</P>
    <P>We get back to the statement attributed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in laying plans for post-war reconstruction, the primary aim must be so to organise ourselves and the national resources at our command that poverty and all the social evils that arise from it shall be eliminated and no other claims can have priority over that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should not have the situation here where people are allowed to draw huge sums of money out of the cash that is available and expect to get 1 per cent. on them for doing simply nothing. They may say it is not their fault, but while we are on a parity with the £ and while we are so influenced by the danger of the syphoning over here of the huge expansion of money in Great Britain, disturbing our situation here, and while bank rates are as at present in Great Britain, we can no longer afford in respect of idle money to continue paying the substantially large amount of 1 per cent. that we are paying for deposits.</P>
    <P>So that even while the Government drifts on, still unable to make up its mind how the credit of this country can be used in the present situation, I think active steps will have to be taken to see that this idle money is not pampered, cared-for, and paid for in the way in which it is being paid for at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is, no doubt, difficult to suggest what could be done, but I should like to make a passing reference to another matter, and that is the discrepancy that has arisen so definitely between the expansion of money here and the expansion of money in Great Britain. It is difficult to see what can be done, but there is a very serious danger there, particularly when we take into consideration that the expansion of money that is going on here is, very largely, not related to any additional employment or any additional production that is taking place here: that a very large part of the expansion is <Col N="947" /> taking place here as a result of wages earned by our people over in Great Britain and coming back here, and that an unknown and probably very large amount is coming over here simply as investments in real estate, or some other things like that, by people who have obtained or earned their money in Great Britain.  These are matters that must be reviewed and sized up at once, so that any serious development in that direction will not have gone to any alarming extent before some plans are made to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I have no complaint about the position in which we stand, say, in parity with the British £.  I think that nearly everybody in this country has always stood for stable exchanges, and I do not think that, after our experience in economic dealings with outside, we are the people, or this is exactly the time, to start shaking the exchanges up and down, one way or another, thinking that we could take any advantage out of it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have no serious objection at the present time to the position which leaves us copper-fastened to the £, but there is a number of things operating that might make it a very serious matter if we could not shift, as I say, and one is the great expansion of money in Great Britain as against the lack of expansion here, and particularly when some of the expansion here is not normal expansion. There is also the serious factor, I think, that the terms of trade seem to be running against us.  Our import price index figure for 1939 was 89.4, while for 1941 it was 156.9.  Our export price index in 1939 was 95.0, while in 1941 it was 147.8.  So that, as between the import and export price indices, the terms of trade are running against us to the extent of 14.7 as between 1939 and 1940.  If we compare the average figure for 1939 and January, 1942, which is the last figure we have here, then it is running against us to the extent of 20.9 points.  I am not quite clear exactly how that affects us in relation to the desirability of being at parity with the £ or not, but <Col N="948" /> I submit that there is a tendency there that ought to be taken into consideration as one of the factors in the situation which might dictate action of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Again, I simply want to emphasise that we have in this country, apparently, all the credit that we are likely to be able to use at the present time, but we have not the mentality on the part of the Government that would see that they will get that credit at a proper rate, and we have not any great idea on the part of the Government as to how they should use that credit.  The position with regard to this Bill is really, to some extent, that we are setting up a new section to the School of Higher Learning.  In light vein, I suggested to the Taoiseach, at one particular point during the debate on the Committee Stage, that that is what he was doing.  Well, such as it is, I say that the sooner it was set up the better, because if you do assemble the proper type of people to consider these matters, they may help to clear up the confusion of mind that exists on the part of the Government at the present time, and we may be in a position to use the very great credit that this country undoubtedly has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene&mdash;I hope quite briefly&mdash;for the purpose of trying to call attention to a rather simple and practical point, the elucidation of which, in my opinion, may tend to clear up a good deal of the obscurities on matters of theory which, apparently, are disturbing the House.  There has been a great deal of very interesting theoretical discussion on this matter, but in many cases people have been using words in different senses, as distinct from getting down to brass tacks.  My difficulty in relation to all these things is that it is the practical thing you are going to do that matters, as distinct from the theories that are behind your action.  For instance, in no controversial sense whatever, I would take up the statement of Deputy Mulcahy in which he says that while there is any amount of credit available, what <Col N="949" /> is lacking, apparently, is the mentality and the intelligence, either of the Government or otherwise, to use that amount of credit.  He pleaded that the Government, and anyone concerned in the matter, should actually come down to brass tacks and find a means of using the very large amount of credit which, he says, is in fact available.  He took, as an example, agriculture.  I immediately became very interested because I know the difficulty of deciding what to do, as distinct from what to wish, in those matters.  He quoted, apparently with approval, certain things that were done in Surrey in relation to the mechanisation of agriculture.  Now, what part of that mechanisation of agriculture does Deputy Mulcahy think the Government should, in practice, adopt in this country in relation to agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak of it particularly as mechanisation, but as showing the energy, the work, and the amount of money they are putting into what suits them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly&mdash;the amount of energy!  I am not questioning that at all.  Now, it is the easiest thing in the world to appeal to people to be energetic, to do something, but it is a much more difficult thing to say to anybody what to do.  The only particular example that Deputy Mulcahy took in relation to agriculture was its intensive mechanisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is quite wrong, and I think that if he refers to my statement, he will see that I simply took that as a picture of what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy took that as a picture of what they put all that energy into.  There is no difficulty at all in appealing for energy.  What are you going to do with all this indefinite amount of credit which is available? &ldquo;A, B, C, D, E and F?  These definite things I recommend shall be done.&rdquo; There is no difficulty at all in appealing for goodwill to use that money.  The thing is to find the method of doing <Col N="950" /> it.  What I do suggest, in all cooperation, is that Deputy Mulcahy now formulate for himself what he thinks the Government should do with £100,000,000 of that credit which he says exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that credit does exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I do. I think that is a mere matter of mechanism, and that we can deal with it.  My difficulty at the moment is to find those precise ways in using credit which will not destroy, in the process of use, more than they create.  That is a very hard saying.  I am asking the Deputy, and any other Deputy who is practically interested in this question, to come down out of the clouds of exhortation as to energy, enterprise and initiative, and to say: &ldquo;Given £100,000,000 of that credit this is what I recommend you shall do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that we ought to get it at less than the 4½ per cent. for turf production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree to that also. That is the point which I am now coming to as brass tacks.  There is a demand at the present moment in this country to know why turf costs 64/- a ton in Dublin.  It is a perfectly right and proper demand, one which, I think, the people are entitled to press right home.  They are doing a good service in pressing it home.  There is that demand just as there is a demand that that cost shall be analysed so that we shall know where the whole of it is going, why it is going, and whether, in its division over the different channels into which it flows, that division is a right division.  In the same way, in my opinion, there ought to be the same practical objective inquiry into the cost of the service which is undoubtedly being rendered by the financial and banking institutions of this country in the servicing of credit and industry.  There seems to be a sort of feeling of interdict&mdash;a holy of holies&mdash;that there are certain things you must not know, and must <Col N="951" /> not inquire into.  I want to know&mdash;I think the country is entitled to know and that a very definite service will be paid to the community when it does know &mdash; the actual out-of-pocket expenses involved in the service which is given by the banking and financial institutions in the servicing of credit.</P>
      <P>Now, I think it will be agreed&mdash; whether 4½ per cent. is too high or too low, whether 1 per cent. on deposits is too high or too low, whether in fact, some particular places at different times may or may not receive all the credit they require, or whether, conversely, as during the last war when money was poured out recklessly in the enhancing of the value of land, too much credit is not being issued at certain times&mdash;that a service is being done by those institutions, and that they have to receive in return for it at least the minimum out-of-pocket expenses involved in performing that service, plus a reasonable return upon their investment, regarded simply as an investment.  The question as to whether that is being done and how it is being done&mdash;how those expenses are being divided&mdash;is one of the deep, dark mysteries into which ordinary people are not, apparently, permitted to peer.  The expenses of the banking institution are the 1 per cent. interest on their deposits referred to by Deputy Mulcahy which he regards as excessive. Their income is very largely the 4 per cent., the 3 per cent., the 5 per cent. and the 8 per cent. in various cases related to different matters which they charge as interest upon the loans they make which the Deputy thinks is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance between those two things should be represented by a legitimate expense and a legitimate profit, and what I am suggesting is that one of the things we want to investigate is whether the expenses which are being charged to meet that gap are all minimum expenses, and whether or not the profit which is being charged in addition to those expenses is, in fact, a legitimate profit.  It is not easy for the layman to answer either of those questions.  There is <Col N="952" /> certainly no information in the possession of the layman, or available to him, which will enable him easily to answer those questions.</P>
    <P>As to expenses, we do not know anything. We do know that you have half a dozen banking institutions in the same small town.  You have an overlapping of branches of all sorts and kinds.  That may or may not be a right and proper thing, but it is a matter of legitimate criticism and of legitimate interest for investigation by the ordinary person in the community who has to pay the expenses when the time comes.  When you come to a profit of 13 per cent. or 14 per cent., maintained over a period of years, and when you have to try to trace that back through the bonus shares and watered capital which is taking place, it is very difficult for the ordinary person to find out what, in fact, is the profit which is at the time being paid on the original capital put into institutions of that character.</P>
    <P>Why I am raising that particular point is because it has been mixed up with, and is being gravely confused with, theoretical consideration.  You have heard in this House controversial and controverted quotations as to who creates credit, how much credit there is, and what is credit.  It is alleged that for 10 per cent. of cash&mdash;and what cash means to-day in a bank the Lord only knows&mdash;there is raised a structure of ten times that amount of credit, and that on that ten times amount of credit is being charged 3 or 4 per cent. interest.</P>
    <P>If that general statement is true, then there should be 30 or 40 per cent. being earned on the basis of the original cash.  Is that happening?  If the total amount which is being got by the banking institutions is not more than their legitimate outgoings in expenses plus a legitimate profit upon their capital, then whether they get that as interest upon ten times the credit or as interest simply upon their own investments is a matter of indifference.  The total amount which is represented by their legitimate outgoings and legitimate profit has to be obtained.  It is in order that that prejudice <Col N="953" /> may be removed, that any misunderstanding which may exist in this matter may be set at rest and removed, that I do think it is time that we had a &ldquo;show down&rdquo; on the actual expenses, the out of pocket expenses of the banking institutions and the service which they render to the community.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the only thing I want to say on the subject of parity and the rest of it is again of the same objective character.  When in pre-war times the values as between different currencies varied, they varied within very narrow limits; they varied within predictable limits and with predictable seasonality.  You knew the dollar would depreciate relative to the pound and the pound would appreciate relative to the dollar at different periods in the year, due to what we knew of the nature of the trading exchanges which would take place between these countries at different times in the year; and over a considerable period of time practically no change was made except that due to those variations in commercial interchange.</P>
    <P>Starting with the last war, when there was an extraordinary expansion of money without goods behind it, and following the last war, when there was a huge amount of nominal money being brought into existence and played about with in the form of reparations, promises of reparations, and interest on promises of reparations, extraordinary things happened as we know with the currency values of France, Germany and other countries.</P>
    <P>Since then there is no question about it that forces have been in operation in changing the relative values of currencies, one to another, other than the mere balance of commercial exchange which previously operated.  So far as pre-1914 considerations were concerned, the pound varied, as I have said, in the way that suited the general commercial interest and condition of the people of England.  The suggestion that it was manipulated in any necromantic manner I personally do not believe. It varied, without any relation <Col N="954" /> or regard to our interests, in as intelligent a manner as the British financial system could do it for the benefit of their own people.  In other words, at that period there were seasonal and other small variations in the value of money for considerations which were irrelevant to this country, but which were not necessarily hostile. They had no relevance to this country in so far as they were concerned predominantly with the interests of a purely industrial country and, therefore, they could not have any necessary relevance to the variation which would have been imposed if one was simply looking at it from the point of view of an agricultural country.</P>
    <P>What I want to make clear is that there was no relevance, but whether there was an actual damage is a matter of fact, and it is a matter which I have never yet seen investigated.  I remember a very able paper written by a late and very lamented member of the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Barrington, before the Statistical Society of Ireland, on the Irish farmer regarded as an economic man.  Looking back over a period of years, he examined the conduct of the average Irish farmer from the point of view of what a theoretically capable and intelligent man, under the actual circumstances of his life, would have done in relation to his land, and compared that with what the Irish farmer had done, and he came amazingly well out of the calculation; a purely theoretical and academic examination of the conduct of the Irish farmer faced by the actual variations of conditions and prices over a period of years, and what use he had made of his land and resources, looked at simply from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Again what I am suggesting is that somebody should take any period of our economic history, take the variations in the value of money relative to commodities, take the variations in the exchange values of the £ and other currencies, compare them with our actual circumstances and see whether on the whole the variations which have taken place have been in fact to our disadvantage or otherwise.  It will be <Col N="955" /> only an accident that they were to our benefit.  It will be only an accident that they were to our detriment.  But whether those variations were, in fact, a benefit or a detriment, no man in this country knows at the present moment and no competent person has ever investigated and set on record.</P>
    <P>I think the first time that my mind was turned to questions of this kind, in relation to Ireland at any rate, was a great many years ago when, wandering past some old bookstalls in the North of England, I came across a pamphlet, <i>Bi-Metallism and the Irish Land Question,</i> by Archbishop Walsh, a document which I recommend to the consideration of every Deputy who wants to understand the extent to which money variations and the rest of it can affect a particular case.  His contention was that the increase in the value of money&mdash;I am going back now 50 years&mdash;relative to commodities upset the whole finances and purpose of the Land Acts in this country and that in entering into an obligation to pay in gold&mdash;because at that time people did not calculate in anything but gold as a basis&mdash;over a period of 80 years annuities on land, we were doing a thing which was fundamentally foolish.  Archbishop Walsh at that time was in favour of linking together gold and silver for the purpose of preventing inflation, because silver was practically a commodity varying in consonance with other commodities at that time&mdash;a linking together of these two for the purpose of ensuring that when we entered into an obligation to pay over 80 years an annuity for land, we would be entering into an obligation to pay something which bore a constant relation to the amount of produce which, with ordinary industry, we could, over that period, get from that land, instead of entering into a speculation which meant that if the annuity in one year would be the equivalent of two cows, in another year it might be the equivalent of ten.</P>
    <P>I am solely concerned with the practicalities of this matter.  I think the theoretics of it could be talked about <Col N="956" /> from now to the Day of Judgment. There are practical things that can be done.  There is practical information that can be got, and that practical information ought to be got and those practical things ought to be done.  For instance, take a very simple case.  At the present moment, our holdings, rightly or wrongly, of what are called sterling assets, are leaping towards the skies.  Those figures are being published, but they are being published three months after date and are then the average of the previous three months.  Why?  Is there any particular reason why we should not know them earlier?  What I suggest is that there is a whole lot of vital information, statistics and the rest of it, which the community ought to know, which ought to be put at their disposal.  We ought to know facts in relation to certain things, ignorance about which is undoubtedly tending to build up prejudice. Whether deposits should have 1 per cent. paid on them, whether loans should have 3 per cent. paid on them, does depend upon the cost of servicing all that money and getting it into circulation. It is a matter which the community ought to know, and it is for that purpose that I have intervened in the hope that those practical pieces of information which could be made available should be in the possession of those who want legitimately to use them and so that investigations of such questions as the effect of the variation of particular currencies on our lives can be entered upon.</P>
    <P>The one other matter that I would stress, and I think it was stressed by Deputy Mulcahy, is the complete lack of security which now exists in old beliefs in relation to financial theories. I remember the managing director of the Bank of England, some eight years ago, saying that capitalism as we have known it has ceased to exist; that conventions of the kind which we thought were rocks, have ceased to exist.  We will have to prepare ourselves for all sorts of new ideas.  When this very excellent body, this very promising body which has been adumbrated in this Bill, the committee of investigation into financial <Col N="957" /> and other things, is set up, I sincerely hope that it will consist of a very considerable proportion of men who are not going to be bound by those conventions, who are prepared to recognise that conditions are changing, that things will have to be done in a different way and that some of the ten commandments of conventional finance will have to be departed from.</P>
    <P>I speak as one who has been fundamentally a conservative in economic and financial affairs.  I believe, however, in the doctrine that those things that are wrong must be removed from a structure in order that the things that are right in that structure may remain.  The bad wood may have to be cut out, defective material and defective theory may have to be destroyed, in order that the fundamental things will remain, because the fundamental things are not going to be changed by ten wars.</P>
    <P>Everything is going to seem as if it were in a state of chaos after this war.  The walls of the temple are being shaken in every sense and meaning of the term.  You are going to have disturbance, revolution, chaos of all kinds, but out of it the simple fundamental things will re-emerge as strong as ever they were.  Again, it is industry, hard work, honesty and seeking to deliver the goods, that will produce results.  But, however currencies may be shaken, and however conventions of all sorts and kinds may appear to be wrecked, the simple things will emerge again and, in a generation from now, all these things, however big they may now seem, will have disappeared just like a shower of rain.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, I am anxious that we shall ascertain as objectively as possible the facts that matter in relation to our finance and currency; that we shall accept those facts and work on them and, instead of a whole lot of wishful thinking, instead of a whole lot of great hopes without any foundation, that we shall each of us try to formulate, at whatever risk to our reputation afterwards, a series of things which we think could be done and should be done in preparation for the new world into which we are heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to hear the Parliamentary Secretary presenting himself here to-day in this mood of inquiry and in a special mood of detachment from all these banking problems that fall for consideration on this Bill.  I think when he asks for some concrete example of what the use of credit might do, he ought to be subjected to the discipline which Dickens talked of as having taken place in Dotheboys' Hall.  When a boy was asked to spell window and spelt it w-i-n-d-e-r, he received a clap on the ear and was sent out to clean the building.  The Parliamentary Secretary wants to know what credit could be useful for.  In the debates at which he was not present on this matter one thing emerged and that was that local authorities were charged 4 per cent. in connection with a five months advance of something short of £1,000,000&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary wonders whether credit could not be usefully availed of. The Parliamentary Secretary presides over the greatest mess that the Government has yet accomplished&mdash; and that is saying a lot&mdash;and one of the things that emerged in respect of that mess is that local authorities, for a five months advance of something like £1,000,000, were charged at the rate of 4 per cent. and that was in relation to a thing, the selling price of which the Government guaranteed and the selling price of which, under the Parliamentary Secretary's auspices, is at a point that is making the people clamour for at least an explanation, if they cannot get economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also wants to know if someone would only investigate and explore the mystery of banks and find out whether in fact their accounts are properly kept and whether we can see the true cost of the service they render to the community. Apparently he does not know that the Government, at the threshold of which he stands, have investigated that problem.  We know that the banks astounded the community by announcing they were going to ask for an extra sum for the servicing of ordinary accounts.  The Minister <Col N="959" /> originally held that matter up and then allowed them to have their charges. Surely there must have been an investigation of the costings of the banking system in relation to that matter, or were the Government just prepared to set general profits aside and say: &ldquo;We will segregate the small matter of the cheques and the keeping of the small accounts and we will allow them to have their extra remuneration&rdquo;?  I suggest that the Government, of which the Parliamentary Secretary is something of an adherent, must have already investigated that matter.  It is no mystery to them and he should ask them to allow him into the mystery that they have investigated, to which, apparently, they have found the answer.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody will be deceived by this pretence of detachment and open-mindedness on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary encroached on this matter of finance, credit, additions to our currency or to our credit, and of the inflationary effect they were having.  There was an explanation of that matter, not very clear and not very complimentary to the Parliamentary Secretary, given by the Taoiseach yesterday, when the Parliamentary Secretary was absent, and he comes here again, questing and querying to know whether this matter of the parity of exchange, the inflationary effect of the expansion of credit, has been investigated and thinks if we could all get together although there might be some difference of opinion, we would find general agreement in such matters. He seems to take his lessons quickly, not by the impact of reason, but only of discipline upon himself.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Bill, I have this chief objection to it, that if it had been introduced 25 years ago people might have said that it was not too badly out of date then, but it is now thrown to a somewhat disillusioned and dissatisfied people, at a time when the minds of people all over the world have got concerned with this matter of credit and whether credit is or is not a public matter, and whether it should <Col N="960" /> any longer be tolerated in the hands of private institutions or what are the varying degrees of control that should be established over this matter.  At such a time the Government come in here and give us this Bill.  I say that 25 years ago it would have been regarded as somewhat out of date; to-day it is an anachronism.  Yet, a one-time revolutionary Government come here with this as the best thing they can do for a disillusioned community, that is conscious of its underdevelopment and conscious also, from what it has heard from outside, that there is some slack at any rate to be gathered up in these matters of credit control.</P>
    <P>Fatigue is sometimes said to be the beginning of political wisdom.  That is applied to the really out and out revolutionary.  There is said to be always a limit to the extent of human endeavour and when people have spent themselves in revolutionary projects, fatigue comes.  We did not know the depth of the revolutionary feeling in the Government until we saw the extent of the fatigue that has come upon them in this matter.  What do they give us?  An opposition to the theories&mdash;to the practice&mdash;obtaining nearly over the wide world.  We are handing over whatever are the powers of the central bank.  The reason I am not so disturbed over the particular method of control contained in this is because I do not think this central bank has any great powers.  But, in any event, under the framework upon which a central bank is being erected here, we establish a control.  The control is a governor, to be appointed by the Government, three directors from the banks and a possibility of five others and, when they are appointed, the governor is there for seven years and the others are there for five, and this House loses all control over them except in so far as it will, by a specific piece of legislation, set up a new system, but there is no link preserved between the Parliamentary authority or the Government and this association &mdash;no bridge as between them.  There may possibly be induced some co-operation as between the two but, as far as legislation goes, there is no <Col N="961" /> necessity for even co-operation as between the ruling authority in the country and the bank.</P>
    <P>The bank governor only leaves if he is disqualified under certain conditions or else if the other members of the board unanimously request him to leave, and the conditions with regard to the directors are much the same, except, I think, that they can only be disqualified.  So, we establish eight or nine men&mdash;a maximum of nine.  We do not know how they are going to be picked.  No information has been given to us as to the qualifications that are going to be looked for in them.  An amendment asking that certain things might be required of them was rejected and the Government are at large with regard to six out of the nine.  Once they are appointed, for seven years as far as the governor is concerned, and for five as far as the others are concerned, after the preliminary period we lose all control over them and whatever functions they have in regard to the very vital matters of expansion or contraction of credit or any control they may have over interest rates&mdash;they have no control over the rate of exchange&mdash; whatever control they may have in these other matters, that is completely and entirely outside this House.</P>
    <P>I have read before and I return to it, the statement made by Mr. Crowther in connection with the situation with regard to central banks.  I am paraphrasing one part of what he has said.  He said that in the post-war period, when there were so many examples of central banks being dominated by the disastrous financial policies of Governments, there came a re-action, there came rather a move, in which banks had to be divorced from any sort of Government association and then he continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been a reaction from these views.  Private ownership of central banks may mean their ownership by, and control in the interests of, rich bankers or industrialists to the exclusion of the interests of the community as a whole.  Since this is still a matter of acute political controversy in many countries of the <Col N="962" /> world, it must be enough to say here that, whether or not the State owns the central bank, it must necessarily exercise a considerable measure of control over it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Where is the control we have over this bank&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This follows inevitably from the very large and important powers which the central bank possesses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That takes away from my argument, because this Bill does not give the central bank very important powers&mdash;it denies them in the main.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In fact&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>this writer continues,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the modern tendency is for the State to own the central bank but for the actual control to be in the hands of a governor or a board appointed for a period of years, and more or less independent of political domination during that period.  The dispute is, in any case, a somewhat artificial one.  The importance of banking policy for the community at large is fully recognised nowadays, and no responsible Government, whatever its political complexion, could afford to surrender so large a portion of the attributes of sovereignty to an autonomous body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At one part of that, Crowther, being conservative, takes a particular line, but he comes back to the matter in the end&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that no responsible Government, whatever its political complexion, could afford to surrender so large a portion of the attributes of sovereignty to an autonomous body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is nearly an autonomous body. Certainly, for the period I have spoken of, it is an autonomous body, except in so far as it can be said of any institution in the State, no matter how free it may be, that the Government, by legislation, can at any time come down upon it.  We are setting up an institution, and we set up that more or less autonomous body.  With regard to the matters which these people have to deal with, I want to give one other <Col N="963" /> quotation.  After reciting how power has got into the hands of a certain section of the community, the particular document goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This domination is most powerfully exercised by those who, because they hold and control money, also govern credit and determine its allotment, for that reason supplying, so to speak, the life-blood to the entire economic body, and grasping in their hands, as it were, the very soul of production, so that no one can breathe against their will.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we were setting up a real central bank, then it must be remembered that what we are doing is handing over, to whatever that particular set of individuals may turn out to be, the life-blood by which the entire economic body lives and giving them such a hold on the very soul of economic life that no one can breathe against their will.  If this bank had the powers that central banks ordinarily have, that is what we are giving to nine individuals, and, once we establish them for seven years or five years, we lose our control over them.  We set them up for good or for ill, and we say farewell to the control of those who hold the life-blood of the community, the credit upon which the State relies, the function of credit-working which has become recognised more and more as being at the very roots of all development of industry, agriculture and any form of production. I get away from that last quotation, which is from one of the Encylicals, to the last pamphlet I have here&mdash;a report by the Federation of British Industries, which is surely not to be regarded as an extreme type of body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy say what is the document from which he has been quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Encyclical &ldquo;Quadragesimo Anno&rdquo;.  This is a pamphlet called &ldquo;Reconstruction.&rdquo; It is a report by the British Federation of Industries and they have just a paragraph on monetary and financial policy, in which they say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The decisions of the Government <Col N="964" /> on this range of questions will depend partly upon international and partly on national considerations and developments.  It is considered premature at this juncture to raise specifically points dealing with this problem, but the federation would at a later stage wish to formulate and express its views when there is a firmer basis upon which to build than exists to-day.  Two things are agreed: Firstly, all plans for international trade are rendered precarious if they are subject to constant and violent exchange fluctuations; secondly, financial policy must be based primarily on the needs of industry and commerce.  The Federation of British Industries desires to reiterate the view it expressed many years ago, that finance should be the servant of industry and not the master.  The primary objective of monetary policy should be (1) to provide maximum employment; (2) to maintain prices at a figure at which production can be carried on with reasonable profit; and (3) to promote stability in the price structure and balanced production, both within the home market and in the field of international exchange at large.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At this point, the federation makes the submission that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;although it is premature to attempt to arrive at decisions on financial and monetary policy, it is recognised that this is an essential element in reconstruction both national and international; special importance is attached to stability of exchanges and to future financial policy being based primarily upon the interests of industry and commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the scheme by which that will operate will be through the ordinary joint stock banks in England, governed by the Bank of England, and the situation here will be that it will be the ordinary commercial banks, with some little impact on them by the central bank, but in so far as that central bank has control or any effect on the main things, it is again the Bank of England.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> The Government set out to give to the people of this country a new institution. It was to be one of the new progeny of liberated Mother Eire.  We have analysed it here, and it turns out to be another of the boarded-out children of the Bank of England.  We accept that position; we say we are tied to that position&mdash;and I do not mind people saying that is the situation as it has developed at the moment and there is no way of shaking ourselves free, but so far as the Bill is concerned, we never look to the day when we can get free and we never apparently even contemplated circumstances in which we might be driven to make some change.  If that change is to be made, it will require new legislation. The bank would not even be given the power, should the necessity arise, to vary the rate of exchange. We simply take the old section of the 1927 Currency Act and we tie ourselves to the position that British money and our legal tender notes must be freely interchangeable, and although people like the Parliamentary Secretary, in pessimistic mood, may see a crushing of British finance, there is no question, notwithstanding all that, of establishing of what was described in <i>The Economist</i> long ago as an independent steering gear for our own currency. We simply tie ourselves on and have no independent steering gear of our own.  We are attached to another moving concern and that, at a time, when it was said to be rather wallowing about in very rough seas.</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowther, speaking of central banks at another stage, analysed some of the circumstances in which banks find themselves and ends up with this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a pessimistic conclusion to our survey of the scope for banking control.  It would be less than frank not to acknowledge it as such. But it does not mean that nothing can be done.  On the contrary, there is room for a vast improvement in the theory and practice of banking policy.  Few central banks are sufficiently aware of their responsibility for the material welfare of their fellow citizens.  Fewer still are equipped to reach wise and prompt <Col N="966" /> decisions, and having reached them, to apply them by every means in their power.  One of the tasks of the immediate future is to increase the responsibility of the central bank, to induce it to concentrate its powers on the quest for equilibrium, to act not merely in periods of crisis, but at all times as the governor and safety valve of an economic mechanism which is constantly prone to get out of hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we giving any great concentration of powers in this to this group of people?  If we are not, we are doing a still more dangerous thing in handing over powers to this group of eight or nine individuals whom we shall elect and to whom we shall then say goodbye for several years.  Have we, in fact, given them any concentration of powers?  Do we give them any chance of being responsible for the material welfare of their fellow-citizens?  Do we think they are so equipped that they can reach wise and prompt decisions? Will they have any significant matter upon which to take a decision, whether it be wise or not?</P>
    <P>There is one other volume which deals with credit and I quote from it because it brings me near the point which was so much in opposition&mdash;the forward point of view which has been expressed in certain parts of the House. A section of the book deals with banks and industry, that is with commercial banks and not central banks, and it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not enough, however, that banks should merely be safe places where people can place their deposits. They are, in addition, the chief providers of credit, without which industry cannot carry on.  And, because they are the chief providers of credit, they must be in close touch with industry, watching its needs and helping its progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, this significant phrase occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The safety of bank deposits is of little value if it leads to a curtailment of industrial credit and so to economic stagnation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not industrially so far developed that it is unwise for us to stop <Col N="967" /> and ask whether there is stagnation, and whether the stagnation has been caused by any halt in the provision of bank credit.</P>
    <P>A point put which has loomed largely in the debate here is the safety of bank deposits.  We are told that there is a dilemma.  Of course there is something of a dilemma between the point of security and the point of advance because, if the advance goes too far, it becomes a risk.  Speaker after speaker has referred here on the question of the safety of bank deposits, to the great record which the Irish banks have.  They have a great record but one wonders has no harm been done by over insistence on the safety of bank deposits.  The safety of deposits is not exactly the final aim in banking.  I wonder have we too great a standard on that, aiming at too great stability and too great security?  I remember when I was investigating electricity matters, having it suddenly thrust upon me that the practices followed in that matter in this country were far behind the standards observed elsewhere.  I found in that connection that it was well known amongst engineers that, on the Continent and in America, in regard to such matters as bridge building or any schemes of an engineering type, those who followed British practices were certainly playing for safety, but that they were piling up expenses against themselves that only wealthy countries could stand.  I heard engineers debate that aspect of the matter and it was pointed out that, in such projects as bridge building, after every allowance had been made for stresses and strains, there had always to be a multiplication for a safety factor and the safety factor that the British employed was far in excess of the factor employed by any of these other countries.</P>
    <P>In regard to electrical development, I found that if we were to follow the British practice while we could proceed with that development on lines which would satisfy all these tests, it would be so shockingly expensive that the development could hardly take place.  We, therefore, moved away from these standards and we adopted <Col N="968" /> a standard more in keeping with that observed in some of the newer countries.  Nobody can say that electrical development along these lines has been carried through at any great detriment to the country.  Remembering all these things, one is inclined to ask whether by too great an insistence on the security of bank deposits we are not sacrificing a great deal of good that might be spread over an impoverished community by pursuing too closely one of the objectives of banking, the security of deposits.  I do not say that deposits should be risked; I simply ask should it not be possible to relax some of the standards of security so as to give under such conditions as may seem proper, some better aid to the community when they very definitely need it.</P>
    <P>On that matter, I spent some weeks past in investigation on a committee set up to consider the question of the provision of credit for the members of the agricultural community.  The scheme propounded for credit in the name of Senator Counihan still stands and will be promulgated by members of this Party when the proper opportunity arises.  Although the scheme was not favoured by all those with whom I came in contact, I think I can state without any breach of confidence that there was agreement that there was a problem of credit affecting farmers in the country.</P>
    <P>There was disagreement as to the size of the problem and there was definite disagreement as to the way it should be met, but that there was a problem nobody doubted.  As to the fact that there is going to be post-war, or in preparation for the post-war period, a still bigger problem, there was no doubt in anybody's mind.  That credit was part of the solution of it was certainly contended.  Senator Counihan through his plan tried to meet that problem and various other people definitely agreed.  On that, there is bound to be disagreement, but there is no necessity to go into it now.</P>
    <P>I said on another occasion that if we can keep ourselves aloof from the war, we cannot keep ourselves aloof from <Col N="969" /> the new ideas the war is creating, nor can we hope to keep this community of ours so much in the backwater that it will not be affected by the new schemes of which the world is thinking. All over the world people are saying that if democratic institutions win through this war, they have got to win through the post-war period as well. They have got to do this by giving better standards of living to the people living in these communities so that they may not in the future look longingly at the hectic period when another system held sway.  All over the world plans are being thought out for adjusting wages to the cost of living. Schemes are being considered as to how best a reasonable standard of living can be maintained for the community generally.  Many people are seeking, in terms of nutrition, to ascertain what is required to keep people in a sound state of health and to have that as a standard on which to base productivity.</P>
    <P>Then schemes are being discussed in regard to industry.  People are considering whether ever again the great mass of production in the world will be handed back to private enterprise, whether the community will ever again relax its hold on such essential things as coal, transport, etc.  People are thinking of what is the best way of promoting enterprise on the security and stability of Government backing. When it comes to international matters there are schemes on foot, whereby the old system of blocked exchanges will never be allowed to recur, schemes whereby nations will bulk their purchases through some such institutions as an investment corporation, and under which, if a nation sells goods to another country, it will be obliged to accept in payment other goods from that country.  All these matters hinge on to the big question of credit.  It is the life-blood, as was said in the Encyclical, of the community in trade. Here we are in this country in the year 1942 with all these examples of what other countries have done, and our only contribution to a study of these problems is to set up a bank with a board consisting of a governor, who shall hold office for seven years <Col N="970" /> and a number of directors who shall hold office for five years.  We throw them adrift from the Government and shun them because we think it would be a temptation to Governments which are financially embarrassed if they are too closely in touch with the monetary world.</P>
    <P>There is a great temptation, it is suggested, because they may play havoc with the private banks in the effort to expand credit.  Of course that may happen, but let nobody think that the central bank will be able to stand against any Government that comes in here and that is dishonestly-minded.  Such a Government will change the system if it wishes, and introduce a system that will be miles away from this.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Government at a very early stage of this that there should be some touch between a central authority on the monetary side and the State&mdash;those who represent the State; those who represent the community.  We could have spent our time valuably here trying to find out what was the proper relation to establish between that authority and the State.  We could have discussed here, pro and con, what are the systems in vogue in other countries, and whether we could adopt them and make some sort of institution of our own out of them, doing it with our eyes open to the dangers, trying to protect against the dangers, but at the same time trying to get some of the advantages which other countries have got.  But fatigue has overcome the Government.</P>
    <P>It is not merely that they are resting on their oars.  They have sunk back through the years, at least 25 years, when they give us as our new solution in the year 1942 the handing over of the function of controlling credit in the interests of the community to this group of people.  What the personnel is to be only the Minister and his colleagues know.  All I know is that when we establish them we lose our control over them.  That is what the House has decided on.  The only thing that pleases me in that connection is that, having given that group of people their independence, their autonomy, so that <Col N="971" /> they cannot be disturbed except through the unanimous recommendation of their colleagues or permanent ill-health, it is possibly a good thing that we have so narrowly limited the powers of those individuals with regard to banking, currency and the expansion of credit.</P>
    <P>There are three marks by which any good central bank can be known; one is that they have some control over credit, its expansion and contraction; the second is that in some way or another&mdash;and the more immediately they can do it the better&mdash;they can affect interest rates; and the third thing is that they can control the exchange rate as between currency in the country and its value outside against whatever it is to be exchanged for.  Judged by those three criteria, this is not a central bank.  It is the Currency Commission recreated, with the consolidated note issue taken from them.  Why any Government, in the year 1942, should have thought it desirable to foist that upon the people and call it a central bank I do not know. But if it has not been explained what the defects of that institution are at the moment, the defects will be found out in practice.  We have been told by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that that institution can affect the expansion and control of credit.  I doubt if they can; practice will show. The Minister has tried to show that there are some such powers; we will see how they operate.  Of course when we come to ask the Minister eventually why, when at a particular moment the need arises, the bank does not act, then the Minister can say: &ldquo;It is too bad, but the House took a decision when we appointed those people, and they are outside our control.&rdquo;  Under this Bill, we are saying goodbye to a central bank.  As far as the community is concerned, we are saying goodbye to the control of credit that most central banks operate for the benefit of the community, under communal guidance, in other countries.</P>

      <P>I am glad that I gave way to Deputy McGilligan.  He has made a speech which showed more progressive and clear-headed thinking <Col N="972" /> upon economic and financial matters than any speech which we have heard in this House for a considerable time. This Bill stands condemned because in the first place it puts the control of the central bank outside this House, outside the Government and the Parliament of the nation.  It stands condemned also because it fails to give to that central bank control over the expansion of credit and rates of interest which it is essential that a central bank should have.  It will be said, and indeed has been said, that that Bill is at least a step in the right direction; that it is some advance on the condition that prevailed before it was passed; that it at least sets up some form of central bank.  But I hold that a Bill which purports to effect a reform, and which does not in reality bring about any reform, does more harm than good, because it delays the carrying through of a really effective reform.</P>
      <P>It has been said in favour of placing the central bank outside the control of the Government that the same applies to the judiciary in this country, and that it is desirable that they should be independent.  There is no comparison whatever between the judiciary and the directors of the central bank.  The courts have no function in regulating, determining or controlling national policy.  The directors of the central bank will have a very important function in controlling the economic and financial policy of this country.  Because they have that function&mdash;a function which enables them to override any action of this House, and to hold up any progressive measure initiated by this House&mdash;it is desirable that this House should have direct control over them.  Under this Bill, that control has been deliberately placed outside this House and beyond the reach of the Government.  Again, this Bill gives the central bank no real power to expand credit, and no real power effectively to influence rates of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy yesterday sought to amend Section 7 of the Bill so as to give effective power to the central bank.  If he had succeeded in getting that amendment through, I am afraid <Col N="973" /> it would have caused apoplexy amongst some of the orthodox financiers of this country.  We might have heard of their being removed to a mental hospital, or that they were fleeing from the country.  There is no doubt whatever that if the power that he sought to give to the central bank had been given it would have fundamentally altered this Bill; it would have changed it from being a bad Bill into being a good Bill.  It would have made it a measure under which the central bank, if it so desired, could influence rates of interest and provide for an expansion of credit.  Deputy Dillon sought to waste the time of the House by disputing the ownership of banking credit.  That question is not of real importance, because whether the banks own credit or not&mdash;and everybody knows that they do not&mdash;currency and credit are so important that it would be the duty of the State, if it considered it necessary, to take over control. What could we do if we had under this Bill real control over the expansion of credit ?  I have argued that the real thing we should do is to raise the income of those who are producing essentials in food and fuel.  I repeated that so often that the Minister for Finance accused me of playing the same tune all the time, the tune that the old cow died of.</P>

      <P>I believe when the Minister made that suggestion that by the old cow he meant the agricultural industry.  That old cow is not dead yet, but she is dying under the operations of the present Government and the financial system.  The old cow is not dead ; she has still a kick left, and the Minister might find out that before very long.  There is only one way of bringing prosperity to this country, and that is to remove the disparity that exists between the income of those who produce food and fuel, and <Col N="974" /> the income of those who are fiddling around, pretending to be busy, but really contributing little towards the prosperity of the State.  Until the income of those who are directly producing food and fuel is brought up to the level of those who produce comparatively little there will never be prosperity here.  The only way to bring the income of those engaged in the production of food and fuel to the level of those not so engaged, is by spending more money on agriculture and on food production.  There can be no expansion of prosperity without expansion of credit.  The British and other Governments engaged in war could not expand production in war industries without expanding credit.</P>
      <P>We cannot expand production here until we increase the income of those engaged in agricultural production by spending from £10,000,000 to £20,000,000 more on agriculture.  The Minister may ask how is that money to be raised.  It cannot be raised by taxation of the present national income.  It must be raised by borrowing.  We cannot borrow now because the rates of interest would be too high.  In addition to that, those who at present control finance if they do not approve of that policy might say: &ldquo;We will not allow you to have that money.&rdquo;  They could hold up such expenditure because if the Government floated a loan for the development of agriculture they might say that they would not subscribe. Under Section 7 of this Bill the central bank has no power to take up such a loan.  Therefore the power of expanding credit is not vested in the central bank, and, the appointment of directors as well as control of the central bank, is put beyond the reach of Parliamentary or Governmental control.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies who spoke helped the Bill, and if the Deputy had the ability he could have spoken, then he might criticise other people.  It is regrettable this stage happened to be taken on such a day, because I am satisfied that many Deputies would wish to contribute to this debate, many to criticise the Bill and, perhaps, some to say a word in its favour.  We had serious and interesting contributions to-day from Deputy Dillon, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan expressed pretty freely his dissatisfaction with this measure that is now in the concluding stage.  Likewise Deputy Mulcahy was not satisfied, but not dissatisfied to the same extent, perhaps, as Deputy McGilligan.  I do not know whether Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy McGilligan spoke for their Party.  I rather think that they did not pretend to speak the views of the Party, because at different stages we had contributions from the leader of their Party, indicating that he did not hold their views, certainly not the views of Deputy McGilligan, and, to some extent, not those of Deputy Mulcahy either, on many of the important sections. It is an important Bill, and one that ought to be&mdash;and, generally speaking, was&mdash;discussed in an atmosphere <Col N="976" /> removed from the normal bitter Party tone to which we have become accustomed in this House.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that it is all on one side.  I am not suggesting that, but I suggest that where it has occurred&mdash;and it has occurred pretty frequently in recent <Col N="977" /> months&mdash;it did not begin this side of the House.  However, let us get away from that.  I want to mark and to mark with emphasis the different opinions that have been expressed on this measure by leading members on the Front Opposition Bench.  We had Deputy Cosgrave taking the attitude that things were well enough, that they should be left alone and that there was no necessity for a Central Bank Bill. What he said practically was that the Currency Commission was there doing the work, making a good job of it, so why change it ?  Deputy McGilligan took a contrary view, and so did Deputy Mulcahy, to some extent.  This Bill does, as I believe, make a big contribution to important developments in the financial and economic life of the community, or gives the opportunity to do so.  Deputy McGilligan thinks that this Bill is 25 years behind the times.</P>
      <P>I said on other stages of this Bill that, situated as we are and as our financial institutions are, I had failed to discover, and therefore had not put into the Bill any means by which we could institute a central bank that could control completely credit and currency here.  I frankly admit that I have not found a remedy for that position. It would be desirable and wise that we should have a central bank that would have complete power, like other central banks, to control currency and credit.  But that is not possible in the circumstances in which we find ourselves&mdash;circumstances which arise out of our long and intimate financial and economic association with Great Britain, the institutions which have grown out of that situation and the method by which they have grown, with liabilities and assets on one side and on the other.  In addition, we have the factor that, much against our will, our country is partitioned.  All these considerations render the situation most difficult and it has baffled me so far, to find any complete remedy.  I am obliged to confess that, at present, I can see no machinery which we could adopt which would give a central bank set up in this country the power completely to control credit and currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I freely admit that some Deputies on <Col N="978" /> the Opposition benches&mdash;and, particularly, on the front bench&mdash;contributed valuable help by speech and amendment.  Generally speaking, that help has contributed to making this Bill a better Bill than it was when introduced.  I cannot say that Deputy McGilligan distinguished himself by offering any serious amendment that would make the Bill a more efficient instrument for doing the things that he says are essential if this central bank is to have any power at all over credit and finance and the cost of credit and money here.  Deputy McGilligan spoke at length of the absence of power in the proposed central bank.  I do not remember one amendment in his name that definitely set down in black and white the additional powers he thought should be given to the bank.  I should have been glad to see down in black and white from him a definite proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He despaired of the Bill from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>He criticised at length to-day, again, the nature of the board and the powers of the Government over the board.  He did not put down any amendment at any stage to suggest another type of board that would be more effective in achieving the object he had in view.  He was not here to move many of the amendments he did put down.  It is true, as Deputy Mulcahy says, that he expressed disapproval of the Bill from the beginning.  He did make a number of criticisms and pointed out where he thought it should be changed here and there.  If he were serious and were doing his duty fully as a Deputy, anxious to make it a better Bill, as some other Deputies did, he should have put down his propositions in black and white and have them debated.  He did not do that except in regard to matters of minor importance.  In the case of most of these amendments, he was not here to move them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Bill is a very considerable contribution towards the setting up of a central bank that will have a very large measure of power to control and expand credit.  I do not think that anybody can deny that that power is contained in the Bill. <Col N="979" /> Deputy Dillon raised a question as to who will own that credit&mdash;the bankers or the people.  So far as credit can be regarded as a commodity&mdash;as it is regarded by some people&mdash;that commodity, like every other commodity, will be under the control of the Oireachtas and will be governed by the authority given by the people to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The central bank will have power to watch over and guard the finances, currency and credit of the country. Definite power is being taken in the Bill to keep that body in close contact with the Minister for Finance of the day, so that he will be advised in case of any danger or emergency.  Even without any danger or emergency, the Minister will be in close contact, by statute, with the financial authority, that is, with the board of the central bank, and will be kept informed and advised, from day to day or from month to month, as to any developments and changes which may be necessary.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, this Central Bank Bill is not the last word on central banking in this country. It is an important contribution to the development of central banking here but, no more than any other Bill passed through this House at any time, it is not necessarily the last word on the subject. If the Minister for Finance is advised, after due examination of all the circumstances by the board of the central bank, that further powers are necessary and that further steps should be taken to control financial operations, I have no doubt the Minister of the day would, if he thinks it wise, come to the Dáil and ask for those further powers.  At any rate, there is full power for the Minister to consult frequently with the board and be advised on any developments that may be necessary hereafter.</P>
    <P>Many people are of opinion that central banks can do marvels, that by some kind of monetary manipulation all the evils from which we suffer can be made to disappear, as if by the waving of the wand of a central bank board.  I have no delusions as <Col N="980" /> to what this central bank will be able to achieve.  I hope it will secure the stability that Deputy McGilligan thinks so little of, but which I think is a valuable asset to us.  I hope it will secure that the good name of our banking system, of our bankers and of our people generally in financial matters, will continue to develop and be made even more manifest.  The bank can help in a variety of ways, perhaps, to reduce the cost of credit here.  That would be a very important and very useful function.</P>
    <P>Without donning the mantle of prophet, as Deputy McGilligan did to-day, I agree that we may be faced with very difficult situations here after the war, and even before it ends.  We may be obliged to face changes of a radical kind in the economic sphere. I am hopeful that, before the necessity to face such changes arises, the board of the central bank will have had time to examine the whole financial structure here and advise the Government of the steps necessary to make our economic future secure, so far as that can be done through the control of credit and finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan quoted Mr. Geoffrey Crowther several times to-day. I have paid some attention to the writings of Mr. Crowther; they are worthy of study by anybody interested in credit and central banking.  However, I do not think even such an authority on monetary affairs as Mr. Crowther would be satisfied that banks can do the things that Deputy Dillon&mdash;and, to some extent, Deputy McGilligan&mdash;suggested they can do.  I might quote one short paragraph, and apply it to these two Deputies, from this authority, on whom Deputy McGilligan places such reliance.  It is from page 47 of Crowther's <i>An Outline of Money:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thus the bank does not &lsquo;create&rsquo; money out of thin air; it transmutes other forms of wealth into money. Even the mediaeval alchemists never hoped to make gold out of nothing; their highest hope was to transform lead into gold.  The banker's power is not even so great as this, for he cannot change a worthless substance into a valuable one.  But he can <Col N="981" /> turn immobile wealth into the mobile (or &lsquo;houid&rsquo;) form of wealth known as money.  He takes the immobile wealth as his asset and gives his I O U (which is money) in exchange. This is the very essence of the banker's business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the next page, dealing with the same topic, Mr. Crowther says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Creation&rsquo; is thus hardly an exact description of the method by which bank-money comes into existence, and it should never be used without the qualifications that have been discussed being borne in mind. Before a bank can &lsquo;create&rsquo; fresh money, it must have cash equal to at least 10 per cent. of the contemplated &lsquo;creation&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will give some satisfaction to Deputy Dillon.  Mr. Crowther goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even then the money cannot come into existence without being used to acquire some real wealth for the bank, or without increasing the bank's liabilities which are payable in cash or on demand.  But even when these qualifications are fully allowed, the banks' power still remains an enormous one.  There are limits to their actions, but within those limits the banks retain a very large power to determine both the quantity of money in existence and the persons into whose hands it shall be placed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The power attributed to central banks by the author of that book is given, to a certain extent, to the central bank we propose to set up under this Bill. It is limited, as I have said already, by circumstances here and by circumstances over which we have not complete control.  I hope that credit that can be expanded and that can be created will be expanded or created for the service of industry in this country&mdash;industry, even including agriculture. Up to the present, this Government or the last Government have had no difficulty in securing loans in this country.  We have had no difficulty in securing credit for State purposes. Our people are people who are thrifty, we have had large savings here, and <Col N="982" /> whenever it has been necessary to call on those savings for the service of the State, the people have readily responded, and so have the banks. People may differ as to what we have had to pay for that credit and the use of that money, but in relation to the cost of money elsewhere, generally speaking, I do not think it can be said that we have paid unnecessarily highly for the credit that has been advanced to us here by our people or through the banks.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan quoted, I think, from some report of the Federation of British Industries, that finance should be the servant of industry, not the master, and I agree.  I agree that it should be the duty of finance to be at the service of the State for whatever useful purposes the State requires to use it.  I agree that it is the duty of finance and of financial institutions here as well as elsewhere to help the State to provide employment and, so far as the Government of the day think wise or proper, to help in every way to improve the lot of the people and the lives of the people.  For all these purposes it is right and proper that money should be asked for, and made available by the financial institutions within the State.  As I have said, so far as the financial institutions here have been asked, up to the present, to provide credit and moneys for these purposes, they have not been denied.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan stressed, our banks, for long periods, have had the name of being very safe, reliable institutions. I agree with Deputy McGilligan that the safety of bank deposits is not the sole reason for the existence of the banks, nor has it been the sole reason for the existence of the banks in this country, but I do not agree with Deputy McGilligan in making light of the desire for safety and the desire for security.  Because of the desire for safety, and because of the safe way that our deposits and our savings have been managed and controlled by the banking institutions of this country and by the bankers, we have reached a position, the value of which Deputy Cosgrave has so often stressed in the course of the discussions <Col N="983" /> on this Bill.  We have reached that position, and I would not like to do anything that would take away from the good name that we have got here in that regard.  I should not like to see us getting away from safety and security, even in connection with the developing of industry in this country, to such an extent that we might undermine the secure position that we now enjoy and might reach the position that was reached 12 or 14 years ago in the United States of America, where so many thousands of banks closed their doors within a period of 12 months.  I am glad that the banking institutions here have such a good name, and I hope they will continue to deserve it, but I do believe that it may be necessary, in the difficult times to come, that credit should be more easily and more readily made available and, perhaps, more cheaply, too.</P>
    <P>I believe that the central bank that we are setting up will help to achieve these objects.  It is not, as I say, the last word on the matter.  It is a beginning: to set up institutions here such as most other countries already enjoy. It is a step that is bound to have important reactions sooner or later on our whole financial and, perhaps, economic development, but the powers, such as they are, belittled as they are by Deputy McGilligan and some others, are important powers, powers which, used wisely and prudently, will be of great advantage and service to the State and the community, and which, placed in the hands of prudent men, can be of very great value in the future development, even in dangerous and difficult times, of the economic, financial and industrial life of this country.</P>

    <P>Go ndaingnítear Scéim Aois-Liúntais na Meán-Mhúinteoirí (Leasú), 1942, do rinne an tAire Oideachais le toiliú an Aire <Col N="984" /> Airgeadais fé Acht Aois-Liúntais na Múinteoirí, 1928 (Uimh. 32 de 1928).</P>
    <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1942, made by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 (No. 32 of 1928), be confirmed.</P>
    <P>Is é is príomh-chúis don scéim leasuighthe seo deireadh do chur le leath-trom d'fhéadfaí do dhéanamh ar mhúinteoir ar bith, tré oibriú Mhír 9 den Phríomh-Scéim &mdash; leath-trom do thárla cheana féin do dhá mhúinteoir ar a laighead.  Faoi théarmaí na míre sin, má chailleann múinteoir a phosta tré ádhbhar ar bith agus, tríd sin, é do stad de bheith ina bhall den Scéim Pinsean, níl sé ion-ghlactha ath-uair sa Scéim, má tá sé ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois agus má tá níos mó ná dhá bhliadhain caithte ó stad sé de bheith ina bhall.  Os a chomhair sin, má tá a leithéid de mhúinteoir faoi 50 bliadhain d'aois, d'fhéadfaí a ghlacadh isteach sa Scéim ath-uair, mura mbeadh níos mó ná .10 mbliadhna caithte ó stad sé de bheith ina bhall. Le n-a rádh i bhfocla eile, do ceadóchthaí bearna, nach mbeadh ós cionn deich mbliadhan, do bheith i seirbhís mhúinteoirí faoi 50 bliadhain d'aois, ach ní ceadóchthaí ach dhá bhliadhain de bhearna do bheith i seirbhís mhúinteóir í ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois.  Do cuireadh an coingheall seo isteach sa bhun-scéim ionnas nach leigfí isteach ath-uair sa seirbhís múinteoirí meadhon-aosta do bhéadh tamall fada as an seirbhís agus ar dhócha a n-éifeacht do bheith laghaduighthe dá bhárr sin.  Do measadh, freisin, go mb'fhéidir posta eile do bheith le fagháil taobh istigh de dhá bhliadhain ag múinteóir ar bith do chaillfeadh an posta do bhí aige.</P>
    <P>Acht, le linn oibriú na Scéime, do fuarthas amach go ndéanann an coingheall seo leath-trom ar na sean-mhúinteóirí, óir do thárla nach dtáinig le cuid aca sin postaí nuadha d'fhagháil taobh istigh den spás ama do bhí orduighthe.  An leasú atáthar anois ag iarraidh a dhéanamh ar Mhír 9, d'athróchadh sé teóra na bearna seirbhíse ó 2 bhliadhain go dtí 10 <Col N="985" /> mbliadhna, agus dá réir sin, d'fhágfadh sé múinteóirí do bheadh ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois ar aon-téarma leis na múinteóirí is óige.  Mar atá baint ag coingheallacha na scéime seo leis na sean-scéimeanna, ní misde míniú gearr do thabhairt ar na míora éagsamhla, ionnas gur fusaide tuigfear a geuspóir.  Míora I&mdash;IV, níl ionnta ach na gnáth-choingheallacha maidir le teideal na scéime agus leis na mínighthe.</P>
    <P>Mír V, ghní sí roinnt leasuighthe ar an mbun-scéim, agus atá siad sin luaidhte sa Sceideal.  An ceann is mó tábhacht aca sin, is é an leasú úd atáthar a dhéanamh i Mír IX é, .i. spás deich mbliadhan do bheith dhá chur isteach i n-ionad spás 2 bhliadhan maidir le bearna seirbhíse i gcás múinteóirí ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois.  Na leasuighthe eile atá luaidhte sa Sceideal, atáthar ghá ndéanamh ionnas go n-aistreóchthar an Aire Airgeadais go dtí an tAire Oideachais, cúram riaracháin an chiste pinsean agus neithe eile bhaineas le hoibriú na scéime.</P>
    <P>Ach maidir leis na neithe is mó tábhacht bhaineas le moladh pinscan, tá an smacht dhá fhágáil ag an Aire Airgid mar do bhí sé.</P>
    <P>Mír VI, is é is cuspoir di deireadh do chur le hádhbhar beag gearáin do thárla ann i gcás beagáin múinteóirí. B'fhéidir nár mhisde dhom a mhíniú nach éigeantach do mhúinteóirí bheith ina mball de'n Scéim, gur tré n-a n-iarratas féin leigtear isteach iad, agus go gcaithtear fiadhnaise áirithe fé n-a sláinte, etc., d'fhagháil uatha sul a leigtear isteach iad.  I gcás gnáth-mhúinteóirí Meadhon-Scol a leigtear isteach, do socruigheadh go bhféadfaí a seirbhís in-phinseanta d'áireamh ó dháta nach mbéadh os cionn 15 míosa roimh dháta a n-iarratais chun ballraíochta&mdash;ar choingheall gur híocadh a síntiús do'n Chisde Pinsean le haghaidh na tréimhse sin. I mbliadhain a 1935 do rinneadh Scéim Leasuighthe do bhain le cás Mhúinteóirí Meadhon-Scol a raibh seirbhís in-phinseanta déanta aca roimh ré mar Mhúinteóirí Náisiúnta.  Ba riachtanach do na múinteóirí seo a ughdarú, taobh istigh de dhá mhí dhéag ó na-a leigint <Col N="986" /> isteach sa Scéim, go n-aistreóchthaí a síntiús pinsin go dtí Cisde Pinsean Mhúinteóirí na Meadhon-Scol.  Do thárla dá bhárr sin, gidh nár chuspóir é, nár bh'fhéidir níos mó ná 12 mhí de spás ama do bheith idir dáta a leigint isteach sa Scéim agus dáta a n-iarratais chun a leigint isteach. Mar sin de, do bhí sé de leath-trom ortha sin nach raibh ach 12 mhí de spás aca-san, gidh go raibh 15 míosa ag múinteóirí eile.  Táthar ag iarraidh deireadh do chur leis an éagcothromacht sin agus na múinteóirí go leir do chur ar aon-dul sa scéal&mdash;rud a dhéanfadh an leasú atáthar a dhéanamh ar Mhír 5 de Scéim 1935.</P>
    <P>Mír VII, is é cuspóir di ughdarás d'fhagháil maidir le húsáid na síntiús do'n Chisde Pinsean do bhí íoctha ag Múinteóirí Meadhon-Scol do ceapadh ina gcigirí agus ar ceaduigheadh dóibh a seirbhís mhúinteóireachta d'áireamh mar stát-sheirbhís bhunuighthe le haghaidh pinsean.  I mbliadhain a 1929, nuair do rinneadh Scéim Pinsean na Múinteóirí Meadhon-Scol, ní raibh ughdarás dleaghthach ar bith ann le seirbhís mhúinteóireachta d'áireamh le n-a aghaidh seo mar stát-sheirbhís, agus do rinneadh riaghail do chuirfeadh i gcumas cigirí mar iad siúd a mballríocht sa Scéim do choinneáil, ionnas go bhféadfaidís pinsean moillighthe do tharraingt tar éis a n-éirghe as an stát-sheirbhís.  Ina dhiaidh sin do socruigheadh, i n-Alt 21 de Scéim Pinsean 1936, go bhféadfaí&mdash;faoi choingheallacha áirithe&mdash;seirbhís mhúinteóireachta d'áireamh mar stát-sheirbhís, agus atá úsáid dhá dhéanamh de'n tsocrú sin ag cigirí áirithe do bhíodh ina múinteóirí.  Do réir na gcoingheall faoi n-ar ceaduigheadh sin dóibh, do chaithfidís na síntiúis do bhí íoctha aca le Cisde Pinsean na Meadhon-Mhúinteóirí d'aistriú chuig an Aire Airgeadais, agus is é is cuspóir do'n mhír seo an t-aistriú sin do dhéanamh dleaghthach.</P>
    <P>Mír VIII, is é is cuspóir dí gan an tréimhse chéadna ama do leigint dá háireamh le haghaidh pinsin mhúinteóireachta agus pinsin mhíleadhta, agus, freisin, chun socrú do dhéanamh le haghaidh cáis ar bith ina mbéadh in dá chineál sin pinsean saothruighthe ag múinteóir.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Is dóigh liom go mínigheann an ráiteas seo agam gach nidh dá bhfuil sa scéim leasuighthe, agus táim ag súil go nglacfar léi go lán-toilteannach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one portion of this new arrangement to which I must enter an objection.  In Section 8, sub-section (3) it is proposed that a person who is entitled to a military service pension shall have to decide whether or not he will accept that military service pension for the period in question or agree to this new arrangement.  I want to enter an objection in respect of the period of service given in Easter Week.  Under the original Act of 1924, if a person were on active service during the whole of that week it was allowed to count as a period of five years.  During that week no teacher rendered any service in the teaching profession so that this military service period was a period over and above the period during which he would qualify for pension in the ordinary course as a teacher.  I am putting it that it was a period of exceptional stress.  On quite a number of men with whom I was personally acquainted it laid a lasting impression, restricting their subsequent healthy activity.  To that extent it appears to me that it would be both fair and equitable not to regard that period as one which would be interrupted by reason of any other superannuation arrangement that might be come to. It was not a case in which, in the normal course, it would be possible for a person to be regarded as having had, in any way, an interruption in his service as a teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government contribution in connection with this pension scheme is limited to a proportion of the amount in question.  If that is not so the Minister can correct me.  I take it the teacher himself contributes in a partial way towards his superannuation.  The State is liable in respect of the other period that I have mentioned: that is for the man's service during that period, and it is only in respect of it that I am making a claim.  I am putting forward a case for the subtraction of that portion of the pension which <Col N="988" /> would be attributable to his Easter Week service.  I think it is a fair recommendation to have it excluded.  I do so on two grounds: (1) that the Government make only a partial contribution towards this superannuation scheme; (2) that it was a period in respect of which there was no interruption of service as a teacher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools were closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools were closed during that period and he could not have given it.  So far as rendering service during that particular period is concerned, the person concerned would have had to devote a considerable proportion of his spare time to training and other things of that sort, and the best part of two and a half years was so occupied prior to this event.  All these services were rendered during two years and three months prior to the period I mention.  He did that in addition to his work as a teacher.  It may be urged that that particular exception has not been made in other superannuation cases; that is quite true.  We grew wiser as we grow older in regard to a number of cases perhaps, but not all.  I base this on the ground that only a portion of the superannuation is paid by the State, the other portion being contributed by the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave I should like to ask what the section referred to really means.  Section (4) (b) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If such person elects to retain such military pension or if he fails or refuses to make any election, no period of time which was reckoned as a service period or part of a service period for the purpose of such military pension shall, on the assessment of such teacher's pension, be reckoned as pensionable service for the purpose of such teacher's pension.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a period of about a fortnight around Easter, 1916, that for military service pension purposes was <Col N="989" /> reckoned, I think, as a period of five years.  In the case of a teacher who elects to hold his military service pension for that period, will five years, or whatever the period is, be taken off his teacher's pension, or will the fortnight only be taken off?  The House would like to know that.  Generally speaking, this is another example of the way in which the Government neglect to do their business in a reasonable and ordinary manner in so many different ways at present.  A secondary teachers' superannuation amendment scheme has been brought forward and there has been no consultation, good, bad or indifferent, between the Department and the teachers affected.</P>
    <P>Time after time we have stressed how important, in present conditions, the whole of our educational system is to our economic future.  Here you have an important body suffering under grave disabilities.  Between 1939 and 1941 the cost-of-living index figure for all items rose by 33 per cent.  If you compare the cost of living in February, 1939, with the cost of living in February, 1942, you will find it rose 37.5 per cent.  That means that the somewhat inadequate salaries paid to secondary teachers are worth considerably less to them now than they were a couple of years ago.  Nevertheless, out of their substantially reduced salaries, so far as value is concerned, the teachers are prepared to pay a small additional contribution in order to secure that their pension scheme will embody provisions such as those for civil servants, so that when they go out on pension they will get a lump sum by way of gratuity as well as a pension.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister why there was no consultation in regard to this matter with the teachers, and why, as he was reviewing this position generally, he did not review it with the view of seeing whether provision could not be made for a gratuity at the end of the term of service.  We complain that there are many things that we are not able to do to strengthen and secure our national existence and our national economy in present circumstances. But, in one of the main lines of endeavour from the point of view of the future, we have free scope, and that <Col N="990" /> is to tone up and strengthen and make vigorous and effective our whole educational machinery.  The secondary teachers are an important part of that machinery.  There are many things that they would like to have discussed and settled.  When there is an amending superannuation scheme, I submit that there ought to be consultation with them in order to frame a satisfactory scheme so that men and women secondary teachers will be encouraged to remain on as teachers and will know that their future, at any rate, is to some extent secured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending scheme which only attempts to deal with a small number of hard cases of teachers over 50 years of age who would be excluded from the benefits of the scheme if they did not succeed in finding re-employment within a period of two years; whereas if they were under 50 years of age, they would have a period of ten years within which to find re-employment.  There were some other amendments, but they are not of great importance, and I think it will be recognised by the House that it is not a suitable time to seek amendments of superannuation schemes giving increased benefits to members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister for Finance has very serious calls upon him at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are given to understand that the country is so overflowing with money, we do not know what to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the matter is really unavoidable, or of the greatest urgency, the Minister can very well argue that it can wait over at least until after the emergency period.  The teachers have been in correspondence with the office and, although there was no formal consultation, they have had opportunities and have been able to put up the points in which they were interested.  This is not in the nature of a general amending scheme.  If any further argument is necessary beyond the one we have&mdash;emergency conditions making it unsuitable to introduce such <Col N="991" /> measures at the moment&mdash;there is also the fact that the State is contributing a fairly large amount, about £4,000 per year, to the secondary teachers' pension fund and, by the time the maximum liability is being placed on the fund, the State will have to contribute, it is estimated, a sum of £10,000.</P>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the point that, if it is at all possible, the dependents of secondary teachers who die in the service should be able to get a gratuity somewhat on the lines of what the national teachers get at present; but the matter is not one for me, and I fear that, even with the best will in the world on the part of the Department of Education, it may be difficult to get a further amendment of this scheme.  I have promised to look into the matter and I shall certainly see if anything can be done. In any case, even if we have to wait until the emergency is over to bring about a further amendment, there is no reason why the matter could not be carefully examined.  The whole difficulty is that, if you are going to give additional benefits, you must provide additional contributions, and, of course, it will be suggested that the State should bear an additional contribution if further benefits are to be granted.  I do not know whether the teachers are prepared to pay for the additional benefit, or if they are particularly interested in this matter of the gratuity payable on death in the service.</P>
      <P>My experience is sufficient to indicate to me that there will be a demand that the Minister for Finance should bear his share of the burden.  Of course, we can point out that his share is already rather substantial, even though both the schools and the teachers are contributing already. However, the matter will be inquired into and, if it is possible, I hope that the secondary teachers' position will be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it will be possible to make the exception that Deputy Cosgrave would wish.  If we make an <Col N="992" /> exception in one particular scheme, we shall have to make it in all pension arrangements.  I understand that this is a general policy affecting all pension arrangements, that allowance is being made for military service pensions in all these cases.  I shall look into the matter, but I am almost certain the same policy is being followed with regard to all these superannuation schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that they had it up to the time this amending Order was brought in, and that he is taking it away.  That is the difference.  In the other cases, you got full notice, but this is an innovation.  I am asking for a modification of the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had, it is a greater hardship, I admit, but I understand this is a general policy which is being carried out and I do not see any hope of making an exception in a particular case.  I will look into the point that Deputy Mulcahy mentioned.  I am not in a position to say now whether the service period means the actual period of service, as, for example, in Easter Week or the five years, but I will communicate with him in connection with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>There is continuous service from 1st April, 1916, to the 31st March, 1917, provided such service included active service in the week commencing 23rd April, 1916.  You will find cases where there was a period worked of over a fortnight, or somewhat less than a fortnight.  For the whole period from 1st April, 1916, to 31st March, 1917, there is a period of <Col N="993" /> five years allowed in the schedule, but the greater part of that five years is concentrated as the equivalent of a fortnight around Easter.  It requires some explanation, if a man gets the equivalent of four years for pension purposes for that fortnight, whether the deduction to be made under Section 4 (b) is going to be four years&mdash; which would be absurd&mdash;or a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to consult the legal people about this matter, but if the position is that non-Easter Week pensioners will have the full period taken from their service, there would seem to be a case for taking four years from the Easter Week people also. Will you not be discriminating between the Easter Week people and others who may have given perhaps greater national service in a very particular way?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>People go out in the Rising of Easter Week, in a fortnight in which the schools were not open, and the Oireachtas passes a Pensions Act and they value services for particular purposes so much that they telescope a certain number of years into a small period, and now, because you are granted a military service pension for that small period, they must cut four or five years from your period of official life as a teacher.</P>

If a man were in receipt of one of those pensions, in addition to his remuneration as a secondary teacher and it stops on the date when he gets superannuated, obviously there is a greater hardship there.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £10, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1943, for the <Col N="995" /> Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the season it was reported to the Department of Agriculture that there were some surplus potatoes in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Louth and Monaghan, and the only effective way of getting rid of those potatoes was to get them taken over by the alcohol factories.  It was realised at the time that the freight from some parts of these counties to the existing alcohol factories would be extremely heavy.  The alcohol factories were paying £3 a ton and the average freight for potatoes delivered to these factories from growers in the vicinity was about 6/- per ton, but the areas where these surpluses existed were somewhat farther away.  The Department then asked the company running the alcohol factories to take those potatoes and the Department would give a subsidy of anything over 6/- a ton up to £1 a ton for potatoes delivered from some distance.  The scheme was advertised and this Supplementary Estimate is to pay that subsidy&mdash;the difference between 6/- and £1 a ton.  It is estimated that the total cost to the Department would be about £1,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that matter, I want to raise a certain sitution <Col N="996" /> that has arisen in County Monaghan.  I am not here concerned to apportion blame because, to tell the truth, I think the difficulty that has arisen in County Monaghan is largely due to a misunderstanding which has arisen mainly from the speed with which it was sought to solve the problem that there presented itself. There were two bases on which persons with surplus potatoes might dispose of them to the alcohol factories: one was that, in the ordinary course of business, a man could sell potatoes to the alcohol factories at the price the alcohol factories were offering; then there was some scheme, of which this Supplementary Estimate, I think, is a development, whereunder the Minister provided some bounty or something for certain classes of potatoes sent to the alcohol factory.  I think the alcohol factory, under the Minister's scheme, desired to deal directly with the producer of potatoes, not through a middle man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a certain number of cases&mdash;a very small number of cases&mdash;in County Monaghan, where we have a great many small farmers, there were men with a pit or two of potatoes who themselves could not undertake to fill a wagon to dispatch to the alcohol factory and who yet had, in their own small way, an appreciable surplus which was for them a considerable liability.  One or two enterprising persons thereupon set out, doubtless, partly for the object of legitimate profit and partly for the object of accommodating their neighbours, and acted as a collecting centre for these potatoes, which were delivered to them at the local railway station.  They filled one or more wagons with them and notified the alcohol factory that they were going to dispatch them.  That, however, transgressed the conditions of the special scheme because the alcohol factory was prepared only to deal with the producer.  In one case at least a man, whose authority I have to mention his name&mdash;McFarlane&mdash;had a quantity of potatoes gathered in this way&mdash;two or three wagons&mdash;and he was informed that the alcohol factory would not take them.  The alcohol factory, however, desiring subsequently to <Col N="997" /> come as far as they could to meet the unexpected situation, took one waggon from him and said: &ldquo;You will have simply to wait your turn in respect of the remainder.&rdquo;  These potatoes were left in open waggons at the station and, as might well be expected, deteriorated. The man entered into correspondence with the alcohol factory and they never seemed to get to to an understanding of what each other's difficulty was.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to put to the Minister is this: I recognise that when you are drafting schemes provisos are put into them which, when they are being put in, appear perfectly easy of fulfilment, but those of us who live down the country know how desperately difficult it is for small farmers or people living in rural areas to get the wheel of their intelligence around the axle of bureaucratic requirements.  They simply get confused and then both parties get at loggerheads and a holdup takes place which becomes virtually impossible to resolve.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, ask the Minister would he get in touch with the alcohol factories and say to them: &ldquo;The existing surplus of old potatoes is very small.  Cut the red tape.  If anyone offers you potatoes that you believe were honestly grown in Eire, do not inquire whether they are producers or what they are; take the potatoes and dispose of them; do not let them rot in railway waggons and, if you are guilty as a result of that, of some minor breach of the letter of the regulations that we have laid down, we will overlook it this time and between now and next autumn I will take all necessary precautions to make my scheme as simple as it can be made, if a scheme should prove to be necessary next autumn.  Furthermore, I will undertake through the agricultural overseers and instructors to ensure that every farmer in the country fully understands the conditions that must be complied with if he is to benefit under the scheme.&rdquo;  I believe, if that were done, a lot of unnecessary misunderstanding and difficulty could be removed.</P>
    <P>I speak with special feeling for the <Col N="998" /> people of County Monaghan who normally have used their surplus potatoes for the feeding of pigs.  At a later stage to-day the general question of the pig problem will arise but the Minister knows as well as I do how severely the County Monaghan pig feeders have suffered as a result of the dislocation that has taken place in that trade.  In these circumstances, I make a special appeal to him to tell the alcohol factories in Carrickmacross and Cooley to take all the potatoes offered to be qualified on the ordinary basis of the scheme and to rest assured that, next year, no room will be left for misunderstanding and that they will be free to carry out the scheme in accordance with the letter as well as the spirit of the law.</P>

I would like to know the return the country is getting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if the question of ensiling these potatoes has been considered or whether that can be done.  I would also ask why the scheme has been confined to four counties.  Does not the Minister know that there are surpluses all over the country, and what does he propose to do about that surplus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to confining it to the four counties, the reports went to show that any considerable surplus of potatoes existed in the four counties I mentioned, that is, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth and, secondly, they are the only counties within easy reach of the alcohol factories.  I did have reports, as a matter of fact, from my own county <Col N="999" /> and from Deputy Hughes's county that there was a surplus there, but I think the position in those counties, Wexford and Carlow, was not so acute.  Certain farmers had a few tons of potatoes to spare, but it was felt that they might get over the difficulty somehow or other.  I was in Wexford last Sunday, and that was one of the points about which I made inquiries. I found that they had practically got rid of the surplus for pig-feeding and so on, but it appeared that it would not be possible to get rid of it for pig-feeding purposes in County Monaghan, which, I think, was the worst county of all, from the point of view of a surplus.</P>
      <P>The first alternative in respect of getting rid of the surplus was human consumption.  The Dublin market, I believe, does draw to a great extent on the Counties of Cavan and Monaghan towards the end of the season, in May, June and July, when old potatoes are getting scarce in other parts of the country, and quite a good lot of potatoes did come from these counties during these months into Dublin, but, even so, there were some left.  The farmers had been advised by radio talks and otherwise to ensile their potatoes as far as possible, but that did not do away with the surplus, and the only alternative we could suggest was that they might be sold to the alcohol factories.  With regard to the value referred to by Deputy Brennan, I am sorry I have not got the figures here, but my recollection is that the yield was about 30 gallons to the ton of potatoes.  That means that the raw material alone of a gallon of industrial alcohol cost about 2/-, and I do not know whether you could regard that as an economic proposition.  When motor spirit is so scarce, however, I suppose it is well to get it even at that price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>About 3/- or 4/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was calculated, when the factories were being set up, as being somewhere between 2/- and <Col N="1000" /> 3/- a gallon, taking into account raw material, overheads and everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not as high as 3/- at any rate.  With regard to Deputy Dillon's question, there appears to be a date beyond which the alcohol factories cannot go, because when the potatoes commence to bud, the starch in them is rapidly converted, and they do not produce industrial alcohol to the same extent as potatoes in the early part of the year.  The factories do intend to go on for another few weeks, but they cannot go beyond that. The factories did give a preference to growers, and I suppose everybody will agree with that, but I see no objection whatever to the factories taking potatoes from traders, when they have taken any offered to them by growers. I will certainly take a note of Deputy Dillon's point and have the suggestion conveyed to the factories that they should take these potatoes, if possible, and if they get them within the time necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to next autumn, I should say that the factories will commence operations some time in autumn and will take potatoes from growers on the ordinary terms.  It would be well for growers to make up their minds roughly as to how they propose to dispose of their potatoes early in the year.  They could then get rid of the surplus in a reasonable period in the winter, when they are at their best for alcohol purposes and have a better starch content than later on.  That, of course, will be advertised in due course, and I am sure the growers will make up their own minds as to how best to dispose of their potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point seems to have arisen that at present absolute alcohol, which is widely used in scientific circles, both in medical and experimental laboratories, is unobtainable, but there seems to be some provision <Col N="1001" /> in the Industrial Alcohol Act which requires the industrial alcohol company to convert their product into petrol. If they were allowed to sell part of their product as absolute alcohol, it would be a very great contribution towards the provision of an urgent commodity which is not in supply anywhere else.  I ask the Minister, if necessary and if my statements be correct, to make an emergency Order at once, authorising the factories to dispose of their products for any purpose of which he approves, thus enabling scientific laboratories to get a supply of this commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the provision or organisation of cooking equipment on a large scale for the ensiling of potatoes?  It is all very well to advise farmers to ensile their potatoes, but it involves a vast amount of cooking over a short period which cannot properly be done if some equipment is not made available on a hire basis.  If the Minister is sincere in giving that advice, I suggest that some attempt should be made to provide the necessary equipment for doing that cooking for ensiling purposes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's question, I am afraid, is a technical matter which I could not answer, but I shall have it looked into.  My recollection is that there is some revenue regulation which compels the alcohol factories to treat the alcohol so that it cannot be consumed by humans, and it will be necessary to look into the point.</P>

    <P>In connection with this pursuit of fungi in the forests of Ireland, I wonder if I might inquire at this stage as to whether these forests, with the protection of which we are now concerned, are being used to the best advantage in the present situation? The point I wish to make is brief and net.  The Report of the Public Accounts Committee has been laid on the Table and I am, therefore, free to refer to matters which we discussed in the course of our investigations. It emerged at the Committee that the Army and other public bodies are finding great difficulty in getting supplies of timber and in some cases they had to get timber from outside sources and to pay large sums of money for it.  It appears that the secretaries of certain purchasing departments do not ask the Department of Forestry whether they can supply them with sawn timber and that they have been buying timber on the market.  Would the Minister consider, as co-ordination officer in regard to timber in the country, taking some measures to ascertain from the purchasing Departments of State what timber they require and whether he would be in a position to supply that <Col N="1004" /> timber so as to avoid the State's selling timber to one person on the one hand at a competitive price and, on the other hand, purchasing timber at an enhanced price through other Departments wherever they can manage to find it?  I bring all these factors under the heading of &ldquo;fungi&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>If pests and fungi are present in our forests, this is a step in the right direction, but it looks rather peculiar that the Minister, in his statement, did not tell us that some report had been presented to him to the effect that there had been a failure of trees due to fungi or pests.  I do not think any report of that nature has been presented to us.  I think it would be really useful if we had such a report, because my experience of some trees planted in my district by the Forestry Department is that they are growing very well.  I do not know whether this provision is necessary, and no information has been given to us on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not told us whether these pests, in fact, exist or have done any harm. Admitting that there are certain pests affecting trees throughout the country, has something in the nature of a plague been discovered with which the present foresters are not capable of dealing?  Could this pest, if it exists at all, not be dealt with by ordinary spray, or has some pest been discovered that cannot be treated by ordinary spraying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know that before this Vote is passed because this may simply be the thin edge of a wedge, something to introduce a huge scheme such as that administered by the warble fly inspectors. You may have officers stuck in every hole and corner, each carrying a tin of powder in his pocket or asking somebody else to carry a tin <Col N="1005" /> of powder.  I think we should not indulge in this ridiculous expenditure unless we get some definite information from the Minister that there is something substantial in this alleged plague. This method of introducing the matter seems a very obscure way of dealing with it and the House should be told whether there is something that will seriously affect the interests of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if you call in a scientist, or even a medical practitioner, you are not always in a position to bargain with him in advance to show you that there is something seriously wrong before you employ him.  There is a young scientist available who has been working on this matter.</P>

      <P>This young scientist has been working on this for some time and the Forestry Branch have no research facilities available.  We have embarked on a very considerable scheme of forestry development and it is almost certain that further efforts will be made in the future to extend it. It is going to be a normal feature of our activities here.  We have over 100 centres all over the country and we have very large staffs.  The trees that were planted 20 years ago under the first forestry scheme are now coming to maturity so that it is a very important thing that every care should be taken to ensure that avoidable disease should be brought to an end by whatever scientific measures may be necessary. The experts who are responsible to me, are fully taken up with ordinary administrative work.  They believe strongly that there is a good deal of work to be done in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is no indication that we suddenly discovered that there is some plague, but it is believed that there are these fungi and pests about which very little has been known in this country.  It is worth while, in the general national interest, having regard to the large expenditure already <Col N="1006" /> incurred on forestry and the fact that it is going to be a permanent function of government here to make these investigations. I shall try next year to have further information for the House on the matter, but I hope it will be realised that it is one which requires detailed examination.  There is only one person involved, and quite possibly it may take more than a year before we even have an idea of whether the matter is likely to be serious or whether the service should be continued, but I will try to have fuller information when the Forestry Estimate is being brought in next year.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister this?  If the Minister is making scantlings of timber, that is planks and boards, and selling them at a commercial price, and other Departments are buying scantlings and boards at famine prices, surely there ought to be somebody in the Government capable of bringing those two Departments together, instead of having everybody standing around flapping and saying: &ldquo;It is the other fellow's job.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, public works are held up for want of scantlings, and fellows are going into the sawmills of the Department and taking them away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two or three matters which I should like to raise.  The first one is in connection with the situation that has been precipitated in Cork, where prosecutions have taken place against bacon curers for purchasing pigs at a price beyond the scheduled price.  In consequence of the prosecutions and of the shortage of pigs, those factories are closing within the next week or ten days.</P>
      <P>I have had a communication from the bacon section of the Transport Workers' Union saying that they are making representations to the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce to convene a conference in Dublin early next week, at which representatives of the workers would attend to discuss ways and means of avoiding the serious position that would be caused by the closing of those factories.  It is clear from that information, and from the particulars given here in recent weeks that the numbers of killings of pigs have gone down from 21,000 to about 6,000, that there is a very serious situation in respect of the pig industry in the country.  It is not likely that it will be remedied in a short period.  The responsibility of the Ministry with regard to that matter is very grave.  I have dealt with this before, and there is no necessity for rehearsing what was said, but certainly during the Recess it is advisable that the Government should pay a little attention to the problem which is facing the workers in those various establishments, and to the loss that has been sustained by agriculturists by reason of the peculiar policy which has been adopted with regard to this industry.  They should review generally the agricultural situation in the country to see what can be done to improve matters.  I believe they can be improved.  I believe there is a surplus of certain foodstuffs in the country which should be available for pig production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which I desire to raise is the price at which turf is sold in this country at the present time, and the quality of that turf.  I do not intend to go into that to any extent, except to say that 64/- a ton is a prohibitive price, and that the quality of <Col N="1009" /> the turf does not reflect any credit whatever upon the scheme.</P>
    <P>The third matter which I want to raise is on the Vote which the Minister dealt with this morning, that is, personal injuries compensation for damage arising out of any action of the belligerents in or on this country.  The Minister gave us last evening particulars of the compensation which the new scheme proposes for adults and children, persons under and over 18 years of age, and so on.  He also informed us regarding a scheme that is in contemplation, but not yet finally adopted, for persons in the various voluntary services of one kind or another dealing with air-raid precautions, fire-fighting, and other matters of that sort.  In the course of his statement the Minister said that the State was in this case faced with the problem of providing for what might be almost an unlimited liability.  I cannot accept that statement.  I think on reflection the Minister himself will admit that there is at least an exaggeration implied in the statement.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there should be an early reconsideration of the sums which he read out here last night as being the basis of the proposals which the Ministry had in mind for dealing with those cases.  I want to put to the House just one comparison in regard to this matter.  There is in this year's Vote for personal injuries compensation an estimated sum of £25,000 for persons who have been injured by bombs or any action of the belligerents.  In another part of the Estimates there is provision for a sum of £3,000 for A.R.P. and fire-fighting agencies of one sort or another in which people may have been injured.  There is a total there of approximately £30,000.  On the other hand, we look up the sum which has been provided in this year's Estimate for damage to property, and we find that the sum is £250,000.  I do not intend to make any cheap comments upon the relative values of life and property but, obviously, if we are prepared to pay for property, if we admit the moral obligation on us to provide <Col N="1010" /> for the restoration of that property, surely the moral responsibility for providing for the lives that are in jeopardy is a greater one.  We make no complaint, whatever, regarding the sum that has to be provided for property.  It is quite true that property charge once dealt with is finished, and that the other is more or less a continuing charge for a number of years.  The disparity between the two provides even for that.</P>
    <P>The second point concerns persons who give service either in A.R.P. or fire-fighting services.  In these cases a scheme for providing compensation could very usefully and legitimately have been formulated before any liability whatever fell upon the State.  It is inconceivable that months and months after the occasion arose for providing compensation we have not yet decided on a scheme.  In these cases there is no justification whatever for not putting a person into even a better position than he was in prior to an accident.  In other words, if a man earned £6 a week prior to an accident which kept him from work, he should get £6 a week from the moment he met with the accident until he could take up his occupation again.  Whatever medical or other expenses had to be incurred should also be provided.  In connection with personal injuries compensation, I suggest that there should be at once an addition of 33? per cent. to the figures given.  The amount may be considerable, but, even with that addition, if bears comparison favourably for this country from the point of view of its economy with that in operation in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The third matter concerns compensation for the destruction of property. In the case of persons living on weekly wages it is very wrong to have assessors valuing any articles, whether common to the persons' homes or to themselves, by inquiring how much was paid for them.  Assuming that articles cost £5, £10 or £20&mdash;and I suppose that none of them have many articles value for more than £20&mdash;it is indefensible to deduct a certain amount for wear and tear.  These <Col N="1011" /> articles were going to last for a lifetime and the owners have not books and accounts to indicate what was allowed for depreciation.  They simply paid for these things and when forced out of their homes at a moment's notice&mdash;perhaps blown out&mdash;the least the State can do when giving them houses is not to grudge the few extra years' advantage they would have from articles which had already undergone four or five years' service.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister is faced with the usual Departmental objections as to the necessity for bearing in mind the increasing cost of running the State.  There are certain services that the emergency has imposed upon us which do not permit of that peculiar and, in present circumstances, antediluvian method of dealing either with compensation for property or to persons. It is not wise in these cases to say that we have to be careful.  Remember that for five years we have shown an entire disregard in the way of balancing our accounts.  No one knows that better than the unfortunate people who are at present without a roof over their heads, or short of wearing apparel.  They know what our indifference has been towards balancing the accounts of the State.  The extra sum that would be given those concerned would not upset anybody's purse, much less that of the State.  The House generally would prefer that we should put on one side of the account a sum of extra consideration by reason of the pain and suffering that has fallen upon these people by the disaster, and that we should approach consideration of it rather from the point of view of Christian charity than that of strict accountancy which is so prevalent in most Governmental activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has very properly referred to the very serious situation that is <Col N="1012" /> now about to arise owing to the shortage of pigs, and the unemployment that will result in the bacon factories. I told the House nine months ago that something like that was going to materialise if that situation was allowed to develop, and now it has come upon us.  Grave as the unemployment situation is going to be in Limerick, Tralee and other bacon manufacturing centres, I ask the House to realise what it means to small farmers in the West of Ireland.  I do not know if the Minister for Finance and his colleagues realise that, of the people who come into my shop in Ballaghaderreen, at least 70 per cent. eat no fresh meat at all.  They eat nothing but salt bacon. They do not eat salt bacon because they are poor.  Salt bacon is not a cheap form of food.  They eat it because it is their accustomed diet, and their domestic arrangements are moulded for the proper consumption of that form of meat.  They have no facilities for cooking fresh meat except by frying or boiling.  If hard salt bacon is completely taken out of the diet of these people&mdash;as I fear is going to be the case before Christmas&mdash;a situation will obtain west of the Shannon that will lead to an acute crisis.  There is no reason for undue alarm but, at the same time, I think it would be less than my duty if I did not warn the Minister that a crisis of real magnitude will arise if there is no bacon available. People who normally have rashers for breakfast take them as a semi-luxury and could get along without them.  I do not know how far the curing of all bacon as hard salt bacon would minimise the shortage.  Something should be done along such lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than once in the last three months I asked a Parliamentary Question here as to when there would be a public inquiry, as required by statute, into the wreck of an Irish ship off the Antrim coast.  The Minister stated some weeks ago that a public inquiry would be held some time by the Department of Industry and Commerce. No further steps have been taken to that end, and I suspect that machinations are proceeding to try to prevent its being held.  I am, therefore, under the painful public duty of alleging publicly that the master of <Col N="1013" /> that vessel was drunk and incapable in his berth when that vessel struck the Antrim coast.</P>

      <P>I can get no other means of directing attention to the matter but by alleging a gross public scandal.  I want to know the circumstances under which that ship went to sea.  It may seem that this is done by me without due form.  I make this allegation because I want to see the conduct of the management which put that man in charge of an Irish ship and of Irish seamen examined.  It is all very well for us here to take the philosophical view, put it on the long finger and say that we shall wait for the Minister to act.  In the meantime, the lives of Irish seamen may be put in peril.  If the Minister had acted promptly, as it was his duty to do there would have been no necessity for me to raise the matter in this form.  I have twice raised it without any suggestion of the nature of the anxiety I felt.</P>

    <Col N="1014" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done that and no other course is open to me but to force on the Minister, by publication of the facts, the necessity for carrying out his promise to hold an inquiry forthwith. If I am proven wrong.  I shall be glad to express my profound regrets and apologies to all concerned as publicly as I have now spoken.  There is provision made in the statute for the holding of public inquiries.  There was a clear duty on the Minister to hold an inquiry in this case.  It seems to me that there was a clear duty on the management and the master of the ship to demand an inquiry, once the ship had struck the coast in the way it did, so that the <i>prima facie</i> appearance of negligence might be disposed of, if there were extenuating circumstances. That public inquiry has not been held and I allege that, at this moment, attempts are being made to prevent its being held.  I want to warn those who are making these attempts that, as long as I am in this House, they will not succeed.  The inquiry will be held and the responsibility of the management that allowed that situation to develop will be brought home. It is in view of these facts that I deem it my duty to mention the matter here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter I want to mention relates to censorship.  I do not want to open up a debate on censorship, but I want to utter the warning in this House that I uttered before.  If this House stands for the principle that the Censor can abuse his powers so as to steamroll the humblest Deputy of this House and prevent his views from legitimately being heard in the country, that precedent will subsequently be used to steamroll all political opposition.  I fully sympathise with the temptation of persons who find themselves in profound variance with the views expressed to shake their heads and say: &ldquo;Perhaps it was as well it was censored out of the papers, so as not to have disturbance.&rdquo;  Make up your minds to this: that if Deputy Frank Aiken, Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, once gets it into his head that, with the consent of Parliament, he can ruthlessly assail an individual Deputy, with the aid of the powers confided to <Col N="1015" /> him as Minister, you are only preparing your own destruction, because if you give that gentleman an inch he will take an ell.  If you lead him to believe that the House will stand for that kind of base and shameful abuse of powers entrusted to him as trustee, he will use them sooner or later against the principal Opposition and against the Labour Party.  When he does so use them, it will be too late to fight him.  We still have our liberties preserved in some measure here.  If we do not use them for one another's protection, the day will soon come when the Executive will be in a position to prevent you from using them for your own protection.</P>
    <P>It is a pleasure to me to pass from the controversial to the non-controversial. I had recently to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to the case of Mrs. McLoughlin, the widowed mother of the very gallant officer who lost his life in the tragedy of Glenmalure. On that occasion the Minister was good enough to say that he would review the circumstances of this case with a view to ascertaining whether anything could be done or not.  Is the Minister for Finance in a position to forecast any legislative measure which would restore equity in this situation? Even though he be unable to announce the terms of any such legislation, if he were able to forecast that, on the House re-assembling, some measure would be introduced to meet the situation it would greatly relieve the present position of the bereaved lady.  I know that, whatever the Government may find themselves in a position to do, their sympathy is quite as strong as mine in this case, and I trust that, in these circumstances, it may be possible for the Minister to give some indication of what he intends to do when the time comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of this Bill to ask, before the House adjourns for a considerable time, that the Minister state what proposals the Government have for the supply of ships to carry goods and necessary materials for the various trades here so that men in <Col N="1016" /> employment may be kept in that employment and those who are out of employment may be re-employed.  We may not have an opportunity for some months to draw attention to unemployment conditions.  In the City of Dublin, unemployment is rife at the moment.  Down at the North Wall, one sees only two ships&mdash;one on the north side and one on the south side&mdash; whereas a few years ago there used to be 20 or 30 ships loading and unloading. The dockers are standing idle. Can the Minister assure us that efforts are being made to get one or two extra ships to bring in supplies so as to keep our men in employment?  The Leader of the Opposition made reference to the compensation given for loss of life and property at the North Strand.  I have protested against the inadequacy of the compensation for both.  Will the Minister give us some idea as to when the corporation may hope to get the vesting order they applied for to take over the property there and to get on with the work?  Will he also say when it is proposed to pay compensation to those who lost their property, so that they may get to work and provide employment? I suggest that the amounts the Government have provided for compensation are grossly inadequate, having regard to the sufferings of these people.  I support Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion that the House should urge the Minister to give a 33 per cent. increase in the amount he has asked, in order to meet the difficulties and pay adequate compensation for injuries to persons, for loss of life and for loss of property.</P>
      <P>At the moment I do not know the maximum amount that any person can get for injuries received.  I have a case in point, where a girl on the North Strand was so badly injured that I earnestly hope she will get £5,000 or £6,000.  She was a girl of 22 or 25 years of age, and her prospects are ruined for ever.  Without mentioning the name, I may say that one side of her face was almost blown off.  What surgery has done I do not know, but I mention the case in the hope that the Minister, when dealing with it, will see that adequate compensation is paid to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> My principal reason for rising is to ask the Minister what the Government's definite proposals are for the unemployed and for those likely to become unemployed in the very early future on account of the scarcity of materials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote is availed of sometimes to ask a variety of questions on a variety of topics.  If the Minister had had notice of the topics to be raised, he might have been in a position to give a satisfactory answer, but as these questions came to me in the course of this debate I am unprepared to give answers to most of them.  Probably, many of them have been raised in a rhetorical way, not necessarily for answer now, or looking for information, or possibly for the purpose of giving publicity to the points to which Deputies wish to call attention.  At any rate, some of the questions raised should be answered by the heads of the Departments concerned, and I regret I have not material available at present on which I could found answers.  For instance, the prosecution of bacon curers in Cork, which Deputy Cosgrave raised, is something I am not in a position to deal with.  I understand the whole question of pigs will be raised later on this evening, and if the Minister is here he will, no doubt, deal with that point.  I have heard at home of the difficulty of buying bacon, but beyond that I have very little acquaintance with the subject.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will, and at great length, as he usually does; and, if I may say so, not uninterestingly either.  I am not an authority on the price or quality of turf, but I can say that my own experience&mdash;Deputy McGilligan gave his experience, in the debate last night, in regard to the quality of turf; and I suppose he is just about as much an authority as I am&mdash;is that I have seen turf supplied at home by our usual merchant, who used to supply coal, and it is good turf.  People with a knowledge of turf may say that it is <Col N="1018" /> not the best; probably it is not, but it gives us a good fire, and I do not suppose there is much difference between it and the turf generally supplied in Dublin.  I admit that it is dear but, speaking entirely as a tyro, it seems to me to be of decent quality and it gives a good fire.</P>

      <P>I do not believe they would bother going out to pick sods from the stack, even for the Minister for Finance.  I would feel very complimented if I thought they did that, but I do not think it is likely to be true.  As a soft-hearted person, I would like to be generous to people who have been injured.  Deputy Cosgrave is in the same mood to-day.  I am not saying he would not always be humane: I am sure he would be.  However, in dealing with the cost of government and the expenditure by the Government, and the lavish generosity by the Minister for Finance to the services, Deputy Cosgrave has been far from complimentary at any time I have heard him speak here in recent years, and since I became Minister for Finance, in particular.  The whole burden of his speech on this subject and of the speeches of his colleagues, particularly on the front bench, has been that the Government is the most extravagant that could occupy the office of government here.  They say the Government is throwing out money with its two hands, placing a terrible burden on the taxpayers and on the farmers.  Now, when it suits them, we hear the other side of the story.  They ask why the Minister cannot be generous, why he cannot be openhanded and large-hearted and humane and give out generous compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Opposition: they can play this dual rôle with political profit to themselves.  The Minister for Finance and the Government, however, have the responsibility for asking the taxpayers to foot the bill later on.  I would like to be as generous as anyone else in this House to those injured, in the circumstances we had last year, when people were <Col N="1019" /> injured through bombs falling or exploding in the country and around the coast.  I would like to be generous to the people in the voluntary services &mdash;the A.R.P. services, fire-fighting services, demolition squads, and so on.  I would like to see them treated justly, if not generously.  They have given voluntary service in times of danger and difficulty, and have often been at the risk of their lives.  I would place as much value on the life of any individual, no matter how humble, as I would on any piece of property, relatively speaking.  People who offer their services and risk their lives should be treated with every consideration.  At the same time, we must measure what it is likely to cost, and then we have to come down to pounds, shillings and pence, and try to work out in money values how far we can go.  You cannot compensate people adequately in money, if they are injured in such circumstances. You cannot ever restore a limb or an eye, or part of the face or figure to the type of person referred to by Deputy Byrne.  It cannot be done.  All you can do is to try to help them out by giving them some monetary compensation that, perhaps, will enable them to live.</P>

You cannot compensate them, but then it is a question of getting down to pounds, shillings and pence, and in the matter of compensation there has been the experience of the last war where, when it had to come down to a question of assessing these losses and injuries in money values, certain schedules were laid down.  For instance, there were certain people in this country who gave services to the British in the last war and who suffered losses and injuries, and where there was a loss of a leg, or an arm or an eye, or where a limb was injured, or hurt in other ways, a schedule was laid down that they would be compensated to such-and-such an extent, for total incapacity or the relative amount of incapacity, as judged by the medical boards.  I suppose we will have to have something of that kind <Col N="1020" /> this time also.  The value, for instance, that would be put by a young lady on her appearance or her attractiveness&mdash; her possible value, let us say, without speaking disrespectfully, in the marriage market&mdash;might be put at a very high figure by the lady concerned. I do not want to delay on that topic. All I say is that, as Minister for Finance, I have to come down to pounds, shillings and pence, and some board will have to deal with these matters within the limits laid down&mdash; I will not, individually, be doing it&mdash; and I hope that the people concerned will be treated as generously as possible.</P>
      <P>These schemes, as I said last night and as I said again this morning, for A.R.P., fire fighting and other services, are a long time in preparation&mdash;too long, I admit.  There has been a great delay, but there were various reasons for that.  However, I hope they will be published before very long.</P>

      <P>The schemes were prepared, I think, last September or October, and then it was thought; on examination, that they were not all they might be, and they were withdrawn and others are in process of being substituted in their stead.  With regard to property claims, large numbers of these claims have already been settled, and settled to the satisfaction of the people concerned.  I gave the figures last night, and I think the Deputy will find in the Official Report such other figures as he requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave talked about the people who will be asked to show their accounts and their books when claiming value for lost property.  They are not asked to do that.  They are not asked to produce bills and books, but they may properly be asked to say the value they set on their furniture, and so on.  After all, it must be remembered that the officials concerned have to remember that every act of theirs and every penny they spend is bound to be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and by the Committee on Public Accounts.  As Deputies <Col N="1021" /> know, the officials are severely cross-examined and have to account for every penny spent in that way, and the Minister also has to take responsibility. The officials have to be very careful about public money.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about the matter raised by Deputy Dillon, concerning the wreck on the Irish coast. I should like to say, however, that I think it was not a wise or prudent proceeding for the Deputy to make a charge in public against any man in the way the Deputy did here to-day. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has the safety of the men at sea just as much at heart as Deputy Dillon, or any other member of the House has, but to make a charge of that kind against a man in a responsible position&mdash;a charge that may not be true&mdash;may have the effect of ruining that man's career for the rest of his days, and I think it is a thing that Deputy Dillon ought not to have done.  There are other ways of getting a remedy.  Likewise, with regard to the Censor.  Of course, the Deputy can make charges, and has often made plenty of charges, against the Censor, but the Censor is well able to answer for himself, and I do not think it is necessary for me to defend him.  I shall only say that I believe his powers are properly used for the safety of the State and its people, and that he has no apology to offer to anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, which stands in the names of Deputy Bennett, Deputy MacEoin and myself:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the failure of the Minister for Agriculture to provide a fair price to pig producers has resulted in an alarming falling off in production, now inadequate for our needs, and which will inevitably fall far below our requirements in the coming months, and considers that in order to stem the decline of this essential industry and encourage maximum production under present difficult conditions more adequate prices should be fixed and guaranteed to <Col N="1023" /> operate for a considerable period, with less drastic regulations with regard to maximum and minimum weights in relation to prices.</P>
    <P>I regret that provision was not made earlier in this session to give the House an opportunity of discussing this very important matter.  Unfortunately, it is coming on at the end of a very long session, at the end of a long week and, one may say, at the end of a long day, and for that reason it possibly may not get the attention that it deserves. However, I suppose we ought to be thankful for small mercies when we have got an opportunity at all of discussing it.  We were constrained to put down this motion because of the very grave and alarming position that now confronts this country not only from the point of view of the supply of one of the most essential foods for our people, namely, bacon, but also because of the vital necessity of preserving, as far as lies in our power under the present difficult conditions, one of the most important and valuable branches of Irish agriculture.  I feel that all sides of the House will agree with me when I say that the best and most profitable system of agriculture, at all times, is mixed farming.</P>
    <P>The marshalling of our resources under efficient methods for the purpose of securing maximum production must be based on one fundamental factor, the preservation of the existing fertility of the land and the building up of that fertility to a higher and still higher degree, so that maximum production shall be secured and maintained.  Vital to this consideration, in my opinion, is the feeding of animals on the farm.  That is more vital than ever now when we are being called upon to put more and more land under cultivation.  Under a system of good husbandry the proper restoration of humus to cultivate the land is through the medium of farmyard manure.  The pig, particularly on the smaller farms, plays an important part in the production of the vital raw material necessary for the production of grain and other crops and the succeeding grasses.  On the smaller farms 75 per cent. of that valuable <Col N="1024" /> and rich manure&mdash;pig manure&mdash;is produced.  Through the pig industry, because of the almost complete absence of artificials, the maximum production of good farmyard manure should be a primary consideration for the Minister's Department.  I fear that under the strain of the emergency, the lowering of the fertility of our soil will have very serious reactions on our post-war production.  It cannot be too strongly stressed that, side by side with more cultivation, we must have more in-feeding of animals on the farm.  That is a matter which, in my opinion, is vital to the best interests of Irish agriculture, and it has not in recent years received the attention that it deserves.  We are simply mortgaging our future in agriculture by the exploitation of the soil and by drawing on our greatest capital asset.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  I am not saying that drawing on that fertility can be avoided under present conditions, but the production of good farmyard manure would greatly help its restoration.</P>
    <P>The possibility of prosperity for Irish agriculture is gloomy in the extreme if the views of the Minister for Agriculture are correct.  He thinks there is no future for dairying and, with Canadian competition, no future for pigs, and, in fact, he is very dubious about poultry.  I want to ask the Minister if he is throwing up the sponge, and if he is not prepared to make any effort to save those great branches of Irish agriculture.  For ten years his Party has worked a policy of self-sufficiency.  It appears to me to be an extraordinary situation that we, with a population of less than 3,000,000 people, with good arable land that aggregates about 12,000,000 acres, should have any food problem at all at the present time.  I do not think we would have that problem if a proper organised effort, with vision and foresight, had been made.  The policy that we have pursued has brought about a situation whereby the people of the country can now obtain only about 35 per cent. of their requirements in bacon.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this whole matter it might be well to try to get a picture of the pig industry in its <Col N="1025" /> true perspective.  In 1931 our exports in live pigs, bacon, hams, fresh pork and other pig meat amounted to £4,680,000.  Immediately before the war the position was that our export of live pigs had disappeared and that we were exporting about 500,000 cwts. of bacon.  With the falling off of imports of essential raw material for the production of bacon, namely, maize and other meals, that export eventually disappeared.  In 1940, our weekly killings were about 21,000 pigs. The decrease in production still continued, and in 1941 the average was 15,916 killings per week, or in round figures 16,000 per week.  That was the average number of pigs slaughtered in the bacon factories for that year, and represented roughly a reduction of 25 per cent. on the numbers slaughtered in previous years.  Those figures continued to fall but not to any alarming extent until about the 1st February, 1942.  In the last ten weeks for which I have figures, up to the 4th January, the weekly average of killings was 6,330 pigs.  I think that does not represent more than from 35 to 40 per cent. of our requirements.  I think the Minister said in the Seanad that at that time it would represent about 83 per cent. of our requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost.  Leaving the amount in cold storage out of the picture, because it is only a matter of weeks until that is ended, the present position is that our supply of pigs is from 35 to 40 per cent. of our requirements. I think that is a very gloomy picture when we consider that this has <Col N="1026" /> been a very valuable part of Irish agriculture, particularly for the small farmers.  In his analysis of agricultural holdings in County Cork, Mr. Murphy points out that on a number of holdings where he made an examination 20 per cent. of the income of the farmers was derived from pig production. In my opinion, in other parts of the country the earning capacity of the farmer from pig production will be far greater than 20 per cent.  In Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, even in parts of the Minister's own county and in some of the poorer districts of other counties, like North Carlow and parts of Wicklow, the people for many generations have relied on pig production to a far greater extent than Mr. Murphy calculated for Cork&mdash;namely, 20 per cent.  So that, if a great many of our people relied for their livelihood in the past to a great extent on the production of pigs, some of them on small holdings, I have no doubt, to the extent of 50 per cent. and if that is now disappearing, it is a very serious matter indeed from the point of view of agriculture, apart altogether from the national point of view of the supply of bacon.  When you couple with that that the pigs on these holdings were a great medium for the supply of the necessary farmyard manure for the preservation of fertility, we come up against a more serious matter still.  If that medium for the production of rich farmyard manure has disappeared on many small holdings, it means that it will have a very serious reaction on the future fertility and productivity of those small holdings from the point of view of supplying an essential food commodity.  We have heard of people queuing up for bread.  I wonder whether in the next week or so they will be queuing up for bacon.  It is an extraordinary thing that in a country that has always been noted for pig production we are now unable to procure a supply of bacon for our people. It is an extraordinary anomaly that such a thing could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when referring to this matter in the Seanad, said that the price factor was not the ultimate cause of the decline in pig production and suggested that it was lack of the <Col N="1027" /> necessary feeding stuffs.  I do not agree with that.  Undoubtedly, the lack of feeding stuffs was bound to have a great effect on the number of pigs that we could produce; I concede that to the Minister.  But I certainly believe that if the situation was properly handled the pig industry would not have declined to its present level. When you take the figures in the official returns with regard to oats, barley and potatoes and examine the problem from that aspect, you will find that we produced last year 684,000 tons of oats.  Of that quantity, 33,250 tons came under the control of the Cereal Distribution Committee, leaving, roughly, 650,000 tons which had not come under their control.  We produced 142,000 tons of barley, and 60,000 tons of that went for malting and brewing, leaving 83,000.  We produced 3,689,000 tons of potatoes.  There was an increase over the previous year of 571,000 tons.  Apart from what came within the control of the committee, a considerable quantity of these potatoes was used for human consumption, but I suggest to the Minister that a very substantial proportion of the aggregate was consumed by animals on the farm.</P>
    <P>When our economists examine the problem of price and get down to the price of meal mixture, they suggest, as in the report of the Pigs Commission, that it takes 4.10 lbs. of meal to produce 1 lb. of bacon and, I think, 5/5 per cwt. to cover other costs. In other words, to produce bacon profitably, the price of the pig ought to be five times the price of the meal mixture.  If the meal mixture costs 24/-, the price of the pig ought to be in the neighbourhood of £6.  I agree with that aspect of the matter, but there is another aspect from the farmer's point of view.  I think this is what happened, and this is why I disagree with the Minister.  Because it was far more profitable to feed cattle last winter, quite a substantial quantity of what was produced on the land, even potatoes, went into the production of store cattle.  I know large numbers of farmers who fed potatoes to cattle for <Col N="1028" /> the first time last year.  I am one of the number.  For the first time in my experience I fed to cattle all the potatoes I grew, over and above what I required for poultry and human consumption. If the price of pigs had been more attractive, the potatoes fed to cattle by a great many farmers would have been fed to pigs, and a lot of the grain fed to cattle last year would have been fed to pigs.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that you can get a meal mixture at a certain price and, if you relate the price of bacon to that mixture, and show a margin of profit, that is enough.  The farmer is wiser than that, and he decides whether it is more profitable to feed grain and potatoes to cattle or pigs.  Last year a vast quantity of that food would be fed to pigs if the price was made attractive.  It was found far more profitable to feed it to cattle. We exported as fine a type of store last spring as was ever sent across the Channel.  The animals were in excellent condition and they did not reflect any shortage of food.  The stores exported last spring were as good as ever went through our ports.  Quite a lot of these stores went out and we merely got credit for them.  We fed valuable grain and potatoes to these animals and all we got was credit, and that credit may or may not be honoured&mdash;that lies in the lap of the gods.</P>
    <P>It must not be assumed that I am condemning that situation, or that I suggest we should change the situation and no longer produce cattle for export.  I am not suggesting any such thing.  I am suggesting that the price of pigs should have been related in some way to the price of the cattle, because that would ensure that the farmer would be satisfied it was a good proposition to earmark some of his home produce for pigs instead of putting practically the whole lot into food for his cattle.  I am not saying there would not have been a reduction in the output of bacon, but to a very great extent that reduction could have been counteracted by an examination of the problem and an anticipation of what the farmer was likely to do in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> The commission that is responsible for fixing pig prices ought not to ignore all the economic conditions that a farmer is bound to take into account. The farmer has to balance his budget, pay his men and meet his bills. Although his patriotism is at times appealed to here, he cannot afford to be so patriotic.  He must produce the things that pay him best.  The Minister has a very big responsibility in this matter.  I fear the problem was not properly tackled.  No foresight was shown in the approach to it.  The Minister got fair warning of the decline in the pig population.  There has been a steady decline over a long period and some effort should have been made by the Minister to ensure that the industry was not going to be stripped to the very foundation.</P>
    <P>The industry has practically disappeared. Not only are the sows cleared out, but the number of boars is declining. It will take considerable organisation to get farmers and others not only to stock sows, but boars as well.  The Minister knows quite well that a man who was accustomed to keeping a boar, and has sold the animal, will be reluctant to get another.  A man may easily enough get into the keeping of sows, but before a man takes up the maintenance of a boar he wants to be assured that there is some future for the industry and that people generally will be induced to get back into pig production.</P>
    <P>In February last the price dropped by 6/- a cwt. Mr. O'Mara of Limerick City, at a public meeting a few weeks ago, described that as a calculated act on the part of the Government. Undoubtedly it was a calculated act to reduce the price of pigs by 6/- a cwt.  It was deliberate, in my opinion.  I suppose the Minister will tell us he thought that was necessary so that the price of pigs would be made unattractive and that there would be no temptation for farmers to feed wheat to pigs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the whole question again but it has been questioned very often here whether in fact there was any foundation for the charge that wheat was fed to pigs at any time, or that that was done to any <Col N="1030" /> extent.  I would put it this way to the Minister&mdash;are we going to permit wheat production to overshadow every other branch of agriculture, to the detriment of some of the most important branches of agriculture?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Wheat is a reserved food for human consumption at the present time.  It cannot be used for any other purpose.  It is the policy of the Government to reserve it absolutely for human consumption, and I suppose the circumstances of the time have forced that policy on us but is it not possible to co-ordinate the different branches of Irish agriculture so that one branch may not be developed to the detriment of the other?  That is what happened here. The Government, in their anxiety to ensure the maximum production of wheat in this country, are going to permit the most valuable branches of agriculture to go to the devil, simply to disappear and not worry about them.  The only industry that the Government and the Ministry can offer the Irish farmers and Irish agriculturists is the production of wheat. That is their only policy.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not going to stand behind the implication that he is unable to find ways and means to ensure that the policy of wheat production will not injure other important branches of Irish agriculture?  He must realise that that is a disastrous policy for this country.  It is a disastrous policy for Irish agriculture and for the country generally if in our efforts to produce wheat we must allow other important branches of agriculture to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that the reason why the price of pigs was dropped by 6/- a cwt. last February was in order to safeguard the position with regard to wheat, to remove the temptation to feed wheat to pigs.  We talk of the price of pigs dropping from 112/- to 106/-.  We also have a grievance with regard to the price arrangement that has been operating for a considerable time and the classification of pigs.  We can understand that, before <Col N="1031" /> the emergency, we were bound to have a certain classification of pigs because we were catering for an export market that demanded a certain quality, the best quality cuts, and we know that we were exporting the best quality and that the heavier type of pigs were mainly consumed at home. When that market went, was there any useful purpose served in adhering to that classification?  I submit there was none whatever.  Last January and later, the price for the first and second class grades of live pigs was 83/- and 66/- A 16-stone pig at 83/- is worth £8 6s. and a 17-stone pig at 66/- is worth £7.  It means that the farmer who produced an extra stone of bacon had to take £1 6s. less for his pig. Surely there was no justification for that.  It could not be justified at any time.  We complained in this House time and again that people brought their pigs to a fair and, because the quotas of the local factories were filled, had to bring them home again and in the time that intervened between that date and the time they sold the pigs, the pigs got overweight and the farmer had then to take less for them.  The farmer who could not sell his pig when it was 16 stone, and who sold it when it was 17 stone, suffered a reduction of £1 6s. in the price he obtained when he was really supplying an extra stone of bacon.</P>
    <P>Even the people that we were supplying with bacon on the export market, the British people, found it desirable to increase their grading since food became scarce owing to the emergency. The Minister probably knows that the grading there is much heavier to-day than it was, and that in fact at any time, but particularly during the emergency, when a man produced a pig heavier than the desirable weight, the most he was penalised was that he had to take the price of a 16-stone pig for his 17-stone pig.  That was the most they fined him.  In other words, he had to supply a stone of bacon free, whereas here a man is fined £1 6s. for supplying that extra stone of bacon.</P>
    <P>We suggest that that grading should be done away with altogether at the present time.  It is admitted that it <Col N="1032" /> is easier to produce the heavier weight pig.  When a pig ceases to grow and is fully developed and has grown the bone, muscle, hair and skin, it is cheaper and easier to put on flesh. That is obvious, but that is all the more reason why we should encourage the production of the heavier type pig during this emergency, when we find it very hard to secure the necessary food for the production of bacon.  That grading should be removed altogether. If you like, you could limit it to a 20-stone pig, live weight, or even higher. Some people might desire that the limit should be higher, but I think if you aim at the production of anything from 16 to 20 stone live weight, and if you set the limit at 20 stone, if a man produces a pig heavier than 20 stone, if you want to penalise him for producing an over-heavy pig, he should not be asked to take less than the price of a 20-stone pig, but should simply be fined for the amount of bacon produced over the most desirable weight.  In our opinion, the grading should be done away with altogether and, if there is any limitation to be put to the weight of a pig, that limitation should be fixed at a much higher point than it is at present.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister referred in the Seanad to the fact that, because the Canadians were supplying very cheap bacon to the British at present, we could not compete.  I agree with that. The Canadians, at the very commencement of the war, realised that their normal market in Europe for wheat would to a great extent be cut off, owing to the blockade and the position of the countries which were brought under subjugation by the enemy, and that they would have a huge surplus of wheat and maize.  They decided to convert it as far as possible into pigs.  They had the foresight to plan for that and they made a deal with the British to supply them with something like 7,000,000 lbs. of bacon per week, at a price with which we could not compete, but at least we should not be in the position of being unable to supply our own requirements.</P>
    <P>I go further and say to the Minister that, at all cost, even if it is necessary to subsidise the exportation of bacon, <Col N="1033" /> it might be well for us to keep our industry going and to keep the foundation stock in existence so as to be in a position in the post-war period to expand that production.  If we let it go now, when the emergency comes to an end, we may find it very difficult, or almost impossible, to build up this industry again.  I think it not unlikely that, when the war is over, and with starving people in Europe, the Canadians may revert to their former policy of supplying wheat to Europe and may possibly go out of bacon production to a very great extent.  If that happens, we shall get the opportunity again of going back into the market.  We should bear that in mind and should plan for that sort of situation developing.</P>
    <P>There is also the other aspect that there may be post-war difficulties, so far as the purchasing of our essential, our normal requirements, like tea, oil and coal, is concerned, in that we may not be able to use our sterling assets. Even looking at it from the most favourable point of view, that the Allies may win, it may so happen that the British may not be in a position to permit us to use our sterling assets there.  They may insist on trade on an exchange of goods basis, and, if we are faced with a position in which we must secure our imports of essential goods and raw materials for industry on an exchange of goods basis, where are we, if an industry like the pig industry, a valuable industry which was always the medium of exporting goods in exchange for essential imports, disappears? That is an aspect which ought not to be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the manner in which the bacon curers have been treated and to the recent prosecutions of bacon curers in Cork.  I think the bacon curers have been very badly treated, have been scandalously treated in their efforts to keep their industry going and to keep men employed. They were forced to pay a controlled price and they found that, in many instances, they were unable to compete with the market prices offering.  We had the position that pork butchers were free to buy bacon at any price.  They were not subject <Col N="1034" /> to control and they were paying as high as 130/- and 140/- a cwt.  Naturally, when the bacon curers went into the market to buy, they were up against that competition, and were unable to compete, if they were to observe the controlled price, and would be unable to secure supplies if they continued to pay the controlled price.</P>
    <P>They were faced with a dilemma, and, in their anxiety to keep the industry going, and to keep men employed, they paid more than the controlled price.  I do not know that we should be so deeply concerned about that when we appreciate that the price of bacon for consumption was controlled all the time, and, if they were operating within that control in abnormal circumstances like the present, the commission, I think, might have put the telescope to their blind eye.  There are many more peculiar things than that happening, and people are permitted to get away with them.</P>
    <P>As there are many other Deputies. including Deputy Dillon, anxious to speak on this matter, I do not want to occupy very much more time.  I simply want to say that so far as this Party is concerned, we think the control exercised by the Pigs Commission at present serves no useful purpose whatever.  In fact, actions taken by that commission in the past have proved disastrous to the pig industry, and notably the reduction in price which took place last February.  I suppose we cannot altogether blame the commission for that, because they simply took a direction from the Minister and the Government.  The factory quota, of which we have complained here time and time again, and on which the Minister promised to make representations to the commission, was certainly not operated in the interests of the pig industry, and at a time when transport conditions are very difficult, valuable transport and money were wasted in bringing pigs from one factory to another in order to try to maintain this quota.  I, and many other people with me, fail to understand why there was so much anxiety about the preservation of that quota.  We feel that there is no necessity for the administration of that provision <Col N="1035" /> in our present circumstances, or even in the circumstances which have obtained for many months.</P>
    <P>In regard to price, the price of pigs in Northern Ireland to-day is about 132/- a cwt. dead-weight, and I personally cannot see that there is any hope of building up this industry again if we do not fix a price approximating to that figure.  Our price ought to be at least 130/- a cwt. and we ought to cut out classification.  That price ought to be available for any pig, up to a maximum weight, if you want to cut out the heavy pig, although the heavy pig, in view of the shortage of fats at present, might not be at all amiss.  We feel that a price of at least 130/- a cwt. should operate in respect of a maximum of 20-stone live-weight and even higher, and we suggest that a long-term price ought to operate now and that if people are to be encouraged to keep pigs, if people are to hold on to the few bones of the industry that are left, the few scws and boars that are left, there should be some hope held out to them or some assurance given that there is some future for the industry.  That needs to be done immediately because if the few bones that are left disappear, we shall have nothing to build on.</P>
    <P>People are now in desperation not knowing what they should do, whether they should sell out what is left and clear out of the industry altogether. They want to get an assurance now, if they are to remain in the industry, that there is some future and some hope of prosperity and profit in the production of pigs.  The Minister ought to make some announcement on that important matter at the earliest possible moment.  There should be a long-term price fixed and that price should be adjusted, in my opinion, every six months according as the situation becomes more difficult or less difficult.  An announcement during the period ought to cover, in my opinion, 12 months.  If there is an announcement of a guaranteed minimum price that price ought to operate for the next 12 months.  It might be reviewed in six months time so as to cover a further 12 months.  The people then will know <Col N="1036" /> where they stand at least for 12 months and they can plan ahead for that 12 months.  If that is not done, one great industry that has always been associated with this country in the minds of everybody the world over is going to disappear.</P>
    <P>We were talking a short time ago about the conversion of surplus potatoes in four Northern counties and we voted £1,500 for the transport of potatoes from these four pig counties to the alcohol factories.  It is an extraordinary situation that that provision had to be made.  I assure the Minister that that surplus exists all over the country, that thousands of tons of potatoes have gone rotten on people who were encouraged by Government policy to produce a huge crop of potatoes, many of them without any intention of using these potatoes for animal feeding.  Many of these people were not feeders and had no intention of feeding the potatoes.  They produced the crop on the understanding that a profitable market would be provided for that crop.  They have been sorely and bitterly disappointed.  No attempt was made to provide that market.  In fact, the market that would have been there, by people buying potatoes for pig feeding, was destroyed by the action of the commission and of the Minister last February when, at a critical period, and after a progressive decline in the numbers of pigs, the price of pigs was reduced by 6/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested to-day that there should be some limitation set to the purposes for which pigs should be used at present.  I think that is a very wise suggestion.  In fact, I would go even further.  I do not know whether any pigs should be killed at present for pork purposes.  Any pigs we have should be converted into bacon.  We can do very well without pork.  We have plenty of fresh meat substitutes for pork in the way of beef, lamb and mutton.  During the present acute shortage of bacon I do not think that for some months to come permission should be given to sell pig flesh as pork.  We want a very clear and categorical reply from the Minister on these matters.  We want no equivocation. It is a very serious matter for <Col N="1037" /> the country.  Bacon is an essential, staple food and from the point of our main industry, agriculture, we should know what steps the Government are going to take to preserve this great adjunct to Irish agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this thing clear.  The reason the price of pigs is at an uneconomic level is because Dr. Ryan, Minister for Agriculture, recognises that pigs are oats and barley. There is the key to the whole secret. Oats and barley are the feeding stuffs for pigs and, in the situation in which we find ourselves at the present time, the Minister for Agriculture is ready for the sake of the voluntary production of wheat at 50/- per barrel, to ensure that no other cereal will be allowed to compete, in its attractions for the farmer, with wheat at 50/- a barrel.  It is for that reason that malting barley is being sold in England at 70/- a barrel while here it is being sold at only 36/-.  For identically the same reason, the price of pigs must be kept down to an uneconomic level because if it is not, the farmers will sow barley, crush that barley, feed it to the pigs and sell the pigs at a good price.  The brewers then would not get an ounce of barley at 36/- and the acreage under wheat would inevitably dwindle because it would be infinitely more profitable to grow barley and to feed it to pigs.  Goodness knows, I have abused the Pigs and Bacon Commission enough in my day but, believe me, the commission have nothing to do with the crisis which confronts us at the present time.  The crisis which confronts us at present is due solely to the fact that the Government want wheat grown at 50/- a barrel voluntarily and to do that they have got to make every competing crop unattractive <i>vis-á-vis</i> wheat.  Get this now into your heads, because sooner or later you will have to realise it and if you do not realise it soon, it will be too late.  There is no escape from that dilemma except to make the growing of wheat compulsory on every farmer with more than a certain acreage in his holding and take control off the price of barley and <Col N="1038" /> oats.  I say in this House if that is done now, we can get enough wheat off the land of this country to feed the whole population without any imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Within 12 months we shall have more wheat, oats and barley than are required to feed our people, and sufficient also to maintain a profitable live-stock industry.  If you do not do that, you will be faced with a situation in which you will have neither wheat, oats, barley, pigs nor fowl.  It is because you will not face that, you are in the difficulty in which you find yourselves at present.  There is no reasonable price that can be offered for wheat which will make wheat growing in this country attractive as compared with oats and barley. That is an inescapable fact.  You would want to give 100/- a barrel for wheat to make it an attractive crop as against oats or barley if pigs were allowed to reach their ordinary economic level at the present time, and if you pay 100/- a barrel for wheat you will force the price of bread up to a level which no wage earner in this country can afford to pay, thus starting an inflationary spiral the end of which God alone can see.  Therefore, we may dismiss from our minds any thought of raising the price of wheat to a level which would make it attractive <i>vis-á-vis</i> oats and barley on an open market.  There is no use in wrangling over our different views as to the best way to get wheat for the consuming public of this country prewar. The Government followed a certain line of policy, and we are all now committed to that policy whether we like it or not.  Therefore, the only way we can get wheat now is off the land of this country.  If we cannot pay a price which will make it an attractive proposition in the ordinary economic sense, we have to place on the land owners of this country an obligation to produce it as part of their duty to the community in consideration of the community's guarantee of their title to the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> Now, I do not think it is sensible to go down into the congested areas and ask a ten-acre farmer to sow a percentage of his land in wheat, because I think the result of that would be to get an altogether undue proportion of land sown in wheat which would produce no crop at all.  But, if you classify the farmers into those with 20 or 30 acres and more on the one hand, and those with less than 20 or 30 acres on the other hand, you can say to the men with 30 acres of land: &ldquo;You must sow 5 or 10 per cent. of your land in wheat.  If you are sensible men you will pick out the best acres of your land and put them under wheat.  The vast majority of you will get a reasonably adequate crop, and it will be your duty to turn it over to the Government at 50/- a barrel.  There will be a very few amongst you who will get a ridiculously inadequate crop, and the produce of that you will also turn over to the Government at 50/- a barrel.  We recognise that that will involve you in certain loss, but there is a war on, and everybody has to do his part.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Then you will say to those farmers: &ldquo;Any loss you sustain on the acres reserved for the other purpose can be more than made up by growing oats and barley on a larger acreage than you had originally intended, which oats and barley you can feed to pigs, if you can dispose of it in no other way, in the knowledge that the price obtainable for pigs is at such a level that oats and barley fed to them will pay you far better than they have ever paid you before.  There is no limit to the margin of profit you can take.  If you were in the habit of sowing ten acres of barley and oats previously, now that you have what you consider the unprofitable burden of wheat production on your shoulders sow 20 acres of oats and barley this year and feed it to pigs.  The price of pigs is at a level which makes oats and barley profitable.  If you do not want to stop at 20 acres of oats and barley, then sow 50 acres, and feed it to pigs. The sky is the limit.  The more pigs you produce, the better pleased we will be.  We are going to let pig production go up and up until we have so many pigs in this country that the competition between one producer and another will of itself determine the <Col N="1041" /> level of pig prices.&rdquo;  All this thing about putting oats into one little division, barley into another division, wheat into another, pigs into another, and then having perhaps a hen in a coop in another division, is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;. Anyone who knew anything about farming would not go on with that absurd nonsense.  Does anybody imagine that a farmer goes out with one oat in his hand to see who will buy it?  He looks at a field of oats as something he will negotiate in its final form.  He looks on it as no more than the raw material of his industry.  A man making motor cars does not discuss only the price of screws.  He is interested in the motor trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does anybody imagine that he comes along and says: &ldquo;Motor cars are what I am interested in.  I do not give a damn about the price of steel. I do not give a damn about the price of tyres or anything else that goes into the motor car&rdquo;?  What do you think is put into the pig?  Pig?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pigs are fed on oats and barley, just as the motor car is built with steel.  Why can you not get into your heads that the reason why the price of pigs has been beaten down is in order, through pigs, to beat down the price of oats and barley?  The Minister for Agriculture does not give a damn about the price of pigs, <i>qua</i> pigs.  His concern is to ensure that oats and barley may not be profitably used through the medium of pigs. Until you change that situation you will never get a price for pigs.  Why do not Deputies open their eyes to that fact?  What is the use of talking about pigs, pigs, pigs, when the Minister's sole concern is to beat down the price of pigs through the fixed price of oats <Col N="1042" /> and barley?  There is only one way you can get out of that dilemma, and that is the way I have shown you. Every Deputy in this House knows it is the only way to get out of it, but some of those sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches will not advocate it because they want to save their faces, and some of those sitting on the Fine Gael Benches will not advocate it because they think it is a dangerous policy to say anything adverse to the &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; campaign.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is to face the truth.  Tell the people that the only basis on which wheat can be produced in this country is by compulsion. Nothing else will get the wheat out of our land.  Nothing else will induce the farmers of this country to grow wheat except compulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no other way, except a price of 100/- a barrel for wheat as opposed to oats and barley. If you have an open market for oats and barley there is no way of getting them to grow wheat in this country if you do not raise the price.  Those are facts, and so long as we go tinkering about trying to make skilful political manoeuvres we will plunge from one disaster into another as we have been doing for the past 12 months.  The one basis upon which we can get wheat grown in this country is by compulsion. There is one way in which we can get pig production in this country and that is by making it profitable.  If you make the production of barley and oats so infinitely more attractive than wheat can be at anything less than 100/- a barrel, then you will wipe wheat off the face of the country unless there is a statutory obligation on every farmer who has land over a certain acreage to grow it whether he likes it or not. That ought to be done now.  Did Deputies hear what the Taoiseach said <Col N="1043" /> last night about the schemes he put up, and that the wiseacres said could not be carried out?  The Taoiseach said that after ten years' experience he had made up his mind that the only mistake he made was that he did not barge through.

The safeguard is to be able to say to him that if he experiences a loss, because of a statutory obligation, there would be a chance to recoup himself in oats, barley and pigs. A man could grow sufficient feeding stuff to fatten 250 pigs on his farm and as a result would be able to produce other crops and get extra output, not only by way of compensation for any loss he would sustain, but in substantial additional benefits which he could never hope to get unless wheat-growing was made compulsory.  Pigs at the right price would give a profit.  There is no escape from that position. Deputies cannot talk around it and make speeches.  These are the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the House the facts.  Deputy MacEoin will get his chance and I am sure he will make a great hand of it.  As to the classification of pigs, when we were trading in the London market we could not provide half the bacon it wanted.  In Ballaghaderreen, Skibbereen and Kinsale not one customer wants the class of bacon that is wanted on the London market.  As a matter of fact our people in rural Ireland like fat bacon. Most of the pigs that are offered for sale now are too thin and would not dress the cabbage.  I remember cutting side after side of bacon to have it rejected by a potential customer.  If I go to a bacon factory and ask them to send me five or six sides of bacon the price is 170/- per cwt., whatever the weight, but if I drive four pigs to a bacon curer, and one of them is 3 lbs. over the maximum for grade A, a cut of 20/- is made in the price.  Is not that so?  Let us not stop there. When the four pigs are slaughtered and the heads and hooves are taken off, if I tell the bacon curer that I will take eight sides of bacon he hands me an invoice for 170/- for the four pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I see Deputies shedding crocodile tears about the bacon curers I have to laugh.  When I hear that the poor bacon curers are only anxious to keep their men at work, and that they are running around the country and spending their money trying to get pigs to keep the poor fellows employed I am inclined to laugh.  I know these tough boys.  There is nothing soft about them.  It is not love for the workmen that makes them trot around the country trying to get pigs.  As Deputy Hughes referred to the quota system being in operation I will tell a story about a certain firm in Waterford that could not fill the quota, and that with tears made strong representations about poor workmen being idle and that it wanted pigs to keep these men employed.  The firm went to the Bacon Board and said that there were pigs within reach of Waterford that could be transferred.  The tears then <Col N="1045" /> dried up and the boys in Waterford said that they had a factory in Sligo and that they would send the pigs there.  The workmen in Waterford were then forgotten, but others became indignant and demanded as a right that they should get the pigs. They got them.  All the solicitude and the crocodile tears about the poor unemployed part-time workers in Waterford vanished, but there was no relaxation of the solicitude to get a profit of £1 per pig for the shareholders of the bacon combine concerned.  Do not talk to me about breaking of hearts over the unemployed workmen.  I know these people too long.  A large part of the misfortunes which afflict the bacon and pig industry to-day are directly due to the activities of the bacon curers for the past ten years.  A great deal of the present misfortunes has been brought upon it by their utter folly.  It is for us to clean up the mess as best we can.  I do not go as far as Deputy Hughes in suggesting that grading should be done away with, on the grounds that it is wrong to produce heavy pigs.  I do not think we should encourage the production of bacon heavier than 20 stone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree on that.  I remember the time when pigs were brought to fairs when they were as big as young donkeys.  Once a pig has reached maturity and begins to grow as big as a young donkey he has to be maintained on the ration.  Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider fixing 20 stone as the outside limit at which a pig would be received in a bacon factory, and beyond that weight a severe penalty would be levied.</P>

      <P>Then Deputy Hughes and I agree.  It is customary for Fianna Fáil to tell us that this branch or that branch of agriculture is finished.  That is so, if this country is to endure the blight of Fianna Fáil. That blight is sufficient to finish anything, not to mention agriculture.  But, common sense prevailing, we can produce pigs in competition with any country in the world.  I do not care to what level the price of pigs goes; let me import the raw material of pig-feeding, and I will produce pigs in Ireland in competition with any country in the world.  But there is no use in asking farmers to produce pigs in competition with the United States if the farmers there are paying 20 cents per bushel for corn and we are paying 8/- a cwt. for barley.  What is wrong in importing the raw materials of agriculture any more than importing the raw materials of paper, of boots or of any other industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> Post-war, I look forward with confidence to bringing in as much cheap feeding stuff for live stock as is requisite, converting that into the product for which this country has been famous and exporting it with profit to the producers and with advantage to the community. To those who talk about competition from other countries, I say that, given the same opportunities, we can meet and beat them in the British market wherever and whenever they show themselves.  Let us not accept the ludicrous Fianna Fáil imbecility of protesting that we are able to do nothing that other countries can do, that we are unable to do the things which we have been doing in past years better and more cheaply than other countries could.  That doctrine is all nonsense.  The Irish people, saddled with the blight of Fianna Fáil, are paralysed and hamstrung, but give them a good Government, an Irish Government, a Government solicitous for its own people and not for the political follies of the leaders of its Party, a Government concerned with the interest only of our own people, and we shall beat our competitors as we beat them before.</P>
    <P>Telescope these two motions.  There you will find the key to your difficulties. If you imagine that you are going to get Fianna Fáil to do anything effective to meet this situation before disaster overtakes this country, you are living in a fool's paradise.  They have not the perspicacity to do so and, if they had, they have not the moral courage.  Unfortunately, they prefer to preserve the Fianna Fáil face to doing their duty to the community as a whole.  Nevertheless, it does serve a useful purpose to lay down lines on which effective reform can proceed, because, sooner or later, this Oireachtas will have to take the matter into its own hands and, despite the present Minister for Agriculture, do that which is necessary to secure an abundance of goods for consumption at home and for export abroad.  Until we do what I suggest, far from having that abundance we ought to have and always had, we shall find ourselves confronted with something approximating to famine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Let me conclude with this note of warning: I suppose I am free to say that the output of pigs will, inevitably, be affected by the output of potatoes. As sure as we are in this House, we are faced with a drop of at least 20 per cent. in the yield of potatoes in the coming autumn.  Make your calculations in that knowledge, because that factor has got to be faced.  That is nobody's fault.  Weather conditions have operated, or some circumstance the precise nature of which I do not know has operated, over wide areas, to reduce the yield of the potato crop by about 20 per cent. Let us get that clear in our minds, find ways and means to achieve the purpose of this resolution and thus secure an adequate price for pigs and abundant provision for everybody in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been mentioned, it is a pity that we should come to discuss this resolution at the eleventh hour of the last day of a long session.  The matter is, however, so important and the facts so intimately concern practically every section of the community that it was encumbent on us to discuss the subject here before we adjourned for a fairly long period. This shortage in pig production affects practically every section of the community &mdash; producers, consumers, bacon manufacturers and their workers.  We have to consider what the causes of the shortage are and what action might be taken to improve the position.  The scarcity of feeding stuffs has, I grant, been the chief cause of the immediate reduction in the production of pigs, if I may use the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; as referring to the past 12 months or so.  Long before we had this aspect of the situation, there was, however, a gradual diminution in the production of pigs for other reasons than the scarcity of food.  Deputy Dillon, in the closing portion of his speech, referred to the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board and suggested that the board was culpable. In another portion of his speech, he whitewashed them.  I say, as I said from the start, that the institution of the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board was inimical to the interests of <Col N="1049" /> the producers.  It seemed to me that the investing of a body such as the curers with the powers given to them by that Act, with practically no representation of the producers or consumers, would inevitably result in their arranging conditions and prices to suit their own ends.  So they did, and I do not blame them.  With the institution of that board came a downward course in the pig-producing industry.</P>
      <P>Recent occurrences have strengthened the fears I held at that period and have held ever since.  They more than strengthen the case I made against the board on many occasions here.  In a recent court case, a prominent curer giving evidence on oath said, in regard to this particular matter, that he was paying more than the fixed price.  In addition, he said that, openly and with impunity, he had paid more than the fixed price for a matter of six or seven years.  The six or seven years coincided with the period of existence of the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board. This particular gentleman was a member of that board for the greater portion of that period, and was responsible with others for fixing fair conditions and prices, as between the bacon curers and the producers, with fair consideration for the consumer.  I praise his honesty, although, perhaps, I blame his discretion.  He openly admits that, for seven years, he has paid more than the fixed market price arranged by the board.  If that is not conclusive proof that an unfair price was being fixed by the board&mdash;unfair to the producer or to the consumer, or perhaps unfair to both&mdash;no evidence that anybody could produce could prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, we have had other bacon curers, in other parts of Ireland, brought up for paying more than the fixed price.  The defence is that they are paying it to get pigs and so keep workers in operation.  Perhaps that is true, but I have my suspicions.  Like Deputy Dillon, I do not really credit that there can be such a number of people so philanthropically desirous of expending their time and money in providing work for others.  I hope there is, but I do not credit it.  I do <Col N="1050" /> not believe these particular gentlemen are the philanthropists that they expect us to believe they are.  If they are at the moment giving more than they can reasonably be expected to afford for bacon, it is only an admission that the profits they have reaped in the last seven years were more than they should have been, and that they are now making restitution to somebody.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that we have to consider the causes of the decline. I said that the matter of feeding has aggravated the position, and that it is extremely difficult to find a solution. The real culprit is the Pigs and Bacon Board, and unless and until that board is eliminated&mdash;horse, foot and artillery &mdash;there will be no resurrection of the pig industry in this country.  I said that one of the greatest injuries from which the industry has suffered is the gradual elimination of the cottage producer. Pig rearing was not always a profitable industry for the cottage producer, but through pure Irish conservatism he clung to it, in ill times and good times.  It was his particular method of saving, and whether it was profitable or not, it helped himself and his wife to put together a few pounds for the rainy day.  He was accustomed to raise his pig and sell it in the local market, unhampered by regulations and control, classes, prices and grades; he could enter into a bargain with a buyer, irrespective of weight and condition; and it was a source of pride on his part to make a good bargain. He resented being compelled to adopt another practice later, and go into the factory with his pig, deliver it there without knowing what he would get for it, and be presented later with a docket describing the condition, grade, and weight, and the price he would get.  Not every man&mdash;certainly not the small man&mdash;would put up with those particular conditions.  They ceased to produce, and it is questionable whether we will ever get them back gain.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the production of pigs in the past shows that the cottage producer provided the big proportion of the pigs killed.  It was not always the large producer who filled the factories. In the elimination of the very small <Col N="1051" /> cottage producer lies, more or less, the great reduction in the last few years. As I said on another occasion in this House, it is rare, in travelling through the country nowadays to see two pigs in a labourer's house or small cottage. When the county councils were building houses, provision was made, in many cases, for a piggery, as it was believed that the cottager would rear pigs.  They are not doing so now, and the piggeries probably never will be used for that industry, as we have killed it.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what we must do to bring it back.  First of all, we must get rid of the Pigs and Bacon Board.  To some extent, it has got rid of itself, as the evidence of the gentleman I mentioned has damned it, if anything could damn it.  The admission by other curers that they are now prepared to pay more than the fixed price for pigs, and charge nothing extra to the consumer, is an admission that it is not an appropriate price&mdash;or else they are greater philanthropists than ever existed before in this industry. They are stretching the credulity of the people rather far, and I, for one, will take that statement with a grain of salt.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the first thing the Minister should do is to wipe out this board&mdash;horse, foot and artillery&mdash;and then see what should be done to deal with the position.  I suggest something on the lines of Deputy Hughes' proposals&mdash;that we should provide for a fairly long-term reasonable price.  When I say that, I do not mean that we should arrange a price for a month, and then review it.  I mean that the Minister himself, without the board at all, through his own Department, should fix an economic price for six or 12 months ahead.</P>

      <P>Make it a good price. Necessity knows no law&mdash;in finance or anything else.  The country wants <Col N="1052" /> bacon more now than at any period since we formed a Government here.</P>
      <P>We have been told by various people that there are no fats.  There is no margarine, and the ordinary housewife in Dublin finds it difficult to cook her food, and if bacon goes out, with the rest of the fats, where will these people be?  Bacon is a necessity for the people of this country at the present time, and we have got to produce it, at whatever trouble it may entail on the producers, and on the Government to assist them.  I suggest that the price to be paid must be such as will make the production of pigs economic and will encourage the producer.  Deputy O Briain can put the price as high as he likes, and I shall not say no.  Is that a fair challenge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the fixing of a fair price to Deputy O Briain because I believe that he is as much interested in the production of pigs as I am, and if the Minister is satisfied with that I am satisfied too, but I do not think the Minister is going to leave it to Deputy O Briain or to me to fix a fair price.  However, the Minister has got to consider the question of what is a fair price.  I have suggested 150/- or 160/- a head for 12 months.  You can then see what will happen at the end of 12 months, and can review the price every six months afterwards.  At any rate, some prospect should be held out to the producer that, when he has produced and fattened the pig, he will get a certain price for it: that he will know what he is going to get, and not be subject to these changes, at short notice, by the Pigs and Bacon Board, as to classes, grades, weights and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody said that there are three classes of pigs now, but in the early days there were two.  First, you had classes 1, 2 and 3 for weights, but there was another, that is forgotten, but which we should remember because it nearly killed the industry.  You had classes graded up and down for the pig itself as to quality, and then, when the pig went into the factory and was killed, it was graded also according <Col N="1053" /> to three qualities.  A short experience of that procedure served to eliminate one of these.  It is not dead yet in one respect, but as far as quality is concerned, it died two or three years ago.  I remember having an argument with an inspector of the Department of Agriculture in connection with this very matter.  He was trying to impress on people the necessity to grow pigs, and then he went on to talk about weights and grades of pigs.  I asked him: &ldquo;What, in the name of goodness&rdquo;&mdash;as Deputy Dillon would say&mdash;&ldquo;is the idea of having this business of three different classes of pigs?  I never saw three classes or grades of bacon.&rdquo; He replied that he did not know, but a week or two afterwards I saw that, so far as the grade or quality was concerned, it had been wiped out.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should eliminate all these hampering restrictions on the production of pigs.  Whatever about them when we had an export trade, and when the country to which we exported needed some particular class of pig, there is no necessity for it now when we want to produce pigs for our own people.  Let us get away from what Deputy Dillon would term &ldquo;codology&rdquo;, and fix such a price as will induce the producers to provide pigs.  It would have the effect, perhaps, in addition, of providing the quantity of tillage that the Government and the people of the country require in order to produce food for the human population, and if there is a fair and satisfactory price arranged, it would probably pay the farmer to put in an additional acre or half-acre of tillage to provide food for the pigs.</P>
    <P>The position of the bacon curers has been mentioned in connection with the factory workers.  Now, I have as much sympathy with the factory workers as has anybody in this country, and so far as keeping the bacon factories open is concerned I would go as far as any other Deputy, but do not let us be faced with this trash that the bacon curers are prepared to pay an altogether uneconomic price in order to keep the workers going.  They are not. They are prepared to pay that price, because it is going to pay them, and if <Col N="1054" /> they are admitting now that they can pay a higher price than that fixed by the board, without increasing the price to the consumer, then, in the name of goodness, let them do so, and do not be hauling them into court if, as a result of what they are doing, they are encouraging production.  With those few suggestions, I think we ought to leave the matter in the Minister's hands, hoping that before this House meets again he will have made some attempt to solve what, I admit, is a very difficult proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important motion for the farmers and pig producers in the country.  The position with regard to the pig industry in this country is that the people are getting out of the feeding of pigs, and I should like to review some of the causes of that.  One of the chief causes, I think, is the uncertainty of prices.  People, when they are buying young sucking pigs, are not certain of the price they will get when the pigs come to be sold.  You have farmers giving £3 and £4 for sucking pigs, as they did last September and in the previous year, but when they came to sell these pigs later on, they found that there was a very small margin of profit, a margin of only £1 or £2.  That has been going on for the last three or four years, and it is that uncertainty of prices that discourages farmers from producing pigs.  They pay so much, and there is not a sufficient margin of profit when they come to sell.  They have to feed the pig for four or five months, or six or seven months, and £1 or £2 is not enough of a margin of profit when one considers the present cost of feeding-stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that tends to discourage production of pigs is the giving of a high price for low-weight pigs, because when you encourage people to sell pigs at a low weight, it means that they have to pack them up with feeding, which is very costly at the present time, so as to get them in a certain condition for sale at that weight, whereas, if you had a price fixed for a high-weight pig, the farmer or producer could carry on the pig during its growing stage at a much <Col N="1055" /> cheaper cost.  I remember that when we used to feed pigs&mdash;I used to feed them myself and we always had ten or 15 pigs&mdash;they were let out on the grass during the summer and got practically nothing else.  Plenty of farmers kept herds of pigs and fed them in that way during the summer months, and the pigs matured during those months at a low cost.  Then they were taken in, packed up with feeding, and ready for sale in a couple of months.  In other words, there were only a couple of months during which their feeding cost was high.  This scheme of giving a high price for the low-weight pig has done away with that sort of pig.  I know&mdash;and Deputy Dillon said the same thing&mdash;that the ordinary people in the rural districts do not want this light pig.  In fact, it is a rarity.  What the ordinary people in the country want is a good, fat bit of bacon, to bring home, to put on the pan, and fry it for the breakfast, and grease the bread with it, and they fry it for dinner and supper also.  That is done away with, and they have no fats now.  This scarcity of pigs, in fact, is having reactions with regard to sheep in the country, because at the present time, if you go into any country butcher's shop, you will find that he is getting more and more sale for the fat old ewe.  The country butchers sell a number of ewes at the present time, and that is the reason that ewes are now at a high price and getting scarce.</P>
    <P>Pigs are getting scarce because the poor people in the rural districts, instead of buying bacon, are going into the butchers' shops in the country towns and buying this fat mutton.  They bring it home and, by rendering it down on the pan, have it for their breakfast, dinner and supper.  It is really a waste of food to be killing ten or 12-stone pigs.  Farmers would not think of doing that when they want bacon for their own use.  They will not kill a pig unless it is at least 20-stone dead-weight.  I kill three or four pigs in the year and they are all up to that weight.  They can be converted into yellow, fat bacon which becomes quite firm.  It is lovely to eat.  Bacon is being sold in the shops to-day and, when it is <Col N="1056" /> put on the pan, you will not get enough grease from it to cover an egg.  The reason why many farmers are going out of pigs is because it is too costly to finish them at a certain weight so as to get the controlled price.  If they were allowed to run the pigs in a certain way, to feed them on raw food for four or five months as they developed, and were then put on good food when being finished, production costs would be lowered and the quantity of bacon available would be increased three times.  What is causing the scarcity of it is that the Government are encouraging the payment of high prices for pigs of low weight.  The English Government are doing the opposite.  They are giving the high price for the heavy pigs because they maintain that it is a waste of food to be killing pigs of low weight.  They maintain that their system leads to a saving of food and is the better one for the nation.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has led to the present situation is the uncertainty with regard to prices.  In November and December last farmers paid high prices for young pigs, and when they came to sell them in February last they were faced with an Order made by the Pigs Marketing Board reducing the price of bacon by 8/- or 10/- a cwt. If the Government want to increase pig production they must fix a good price for pigs and there must not be any uncertainty about it.  It should cover at least a period of 12 months. The present price of 110/- per cwt. is not an economic one.  It represents about 1/- per lb. for bacon, but if you go into the shops you find that bacon is 2/10 per lb.  That leaves too big a margin between what the producer gets and what the retailer is paid for selling the bacon over the counter.  If the Government would make an Order that pigs should be up to 20-stone dead weight when offered for sale, and if a decent price were fixed for them at that weight, thousands and thousands of pigs would be produced.  If the people were satisfied that pig production was going to be a paying proposition they would produce.  I suggest to the Minister that he should fix a price for heavy pigs.  If he does that <Col N="1057" /> it will encourage people to produce heavy pigs.</P>
    <P>I think that the bacon curers should be compelled to alter their present method of curing bacon.  If they did the bacon would not be so sweet to eat.  The bacon they are curing at present, if not consumed within a week, will go bad.  When farmers kill a pig they cure the bacon in such a way that it keeps for five or six months. The bacon curers should be compelled to do the same.  If they are, there will not be so much food going to waste.</P>

      <P>This debate has ranged over a wide field.  I notice that the Minister seems to be very anxious to get up to reply to us.  This motion expresses the opinion that the failure of the Minister to provide a fair price to pig producers has resulted in an alarming falling off in production. That point was lost sight of by many speakers.  Earlier in the debate I tried to keep the motion within that limit but, apparently, I failed to do that.</P>

I would like you, Sir, to take note that, if Deputy Dillon puts down a motion about beet or wheat, it will be discussed in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>He was allowed great latitude by the Chair.  I will leave it at that.  This motion affects farmers, cottiers and labourers, in fact every person in the country.  It deals with the price of pigs and nothing else. We have put it down with the object of seeing that whoever produces a pig will get a fair price for his labour. Those of us who are associated with this motion are satisfied that we are not getting a fair price for the pigs we produce on our farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The Minister has established a Pigs and Bacon Commission.  They know as much about the matter as John Brown knows about producing wheat&mdash;I will leave it at that.  Here are the facts. I have fed my pigs.  I want to sell them in the Longford fair or in the fair of Mullingar.  I have got to the stage that I must sell my pigs for the price that I can get for them.  I have to pay my annuity.  The Land Commission will not give me much time and will send out their notices.  I cannot sell my pigs and, therefore, I cannot pay my rates, I cannot pay my annuity, and I am left high and dry.  I have to bring them home.  I know there are bacon curers such as McCarrons of Cavan, O'Maras of Limerick, Dennys and so on.  I have to take my hat in my hand and go to one of those bacon curers and say: &ldquo;I have five pigs here to sell, will you have them?&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;No, our quota is full; we cannot take any pigs from you.&rdquo;  I say: &ldquo;What will I do with them?&rdquo;  and he says: &ldquo;I do not know what you will do with them, but you can bring them back in a week's time or a fortnight's time.&rdquo;  I have to bring the pigs home again and continue to feed them.  Then the Pigs and Bacon Commission send out a notification that they will send representatives to a certain fair to buy the pigs or, alternately, they send down an order to some bacon curers that they must buy the pigs that I had brought in to them before but which they would not buy. That leaves me in the state of mind that I say to myself: &ldquo;What is the use of my feeding pigs?&rdquo;  The result is that the pig population to-day is not sufficient even to meet our own requirements.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what he proposes to do about this motion, keeping in mind what I have said.  I go out with my pigs to a fair or market and I can get a certain price for them, but it will not pay my production costs.  There is no use in my producing pigs if I do not get paid for their production.  The Minister has made these Orders.  I am perfectly satisfied that he has not consulted a single person who knows anything about the matter.  He has consulted his civil servants.  I would suggest to <Col N="1059" /> the Minister that there are strong supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, such as the O'Maras of Limerick, whom he could consult as to the best thing to do and that then he would make no mistake.  I would go further and suggest that there are Deputies from Monaghan from whom he could get the facts and that as a result he would be able to keep pig production at a very high standard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes in his speech gave as one of the reasons why pigs were decreasing in number that it paid better last winter to feed cattle than pigs.  I am only just putting that on record for the moment.  I think we can pass away from it.

      <P>The Deputy suggested that meal at 24/- per cwt., taking five cwts. of meal, would mean 120/- for every cwt. of meat.  Of course you can take that if you wish, but I do not think that we can afford to have a farmer sell his oats and have all the middlemen's profits come out of that oats before it goes to another farmer. Obviously, there must be some big profits to some middlemen if it is costing the feeding farmer 24/- per cwt. In my opinion, there is no use in trying to make a price for pigs that will enable that purchasing farmer to feed pigs on a profitable basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is more, I bought all the meal required for them during that period.  I kept strict accounts in connection with these pigs and I made a profit on pigs during the last four or five years.  Take a mixture something like this: 2 cwt. of oats, 8 cwt. of potatoes, and half a cwt. of meat-meal&mdash;I cannot make that much. less than half a cwt.  If you like, you may add two gallons of skimmed milk per week and then take oats at 15/- a cwt., which would give a very fair return to a farmer growing the oats himself, and potatoes at 5/- a cwt., which would also be a very good return, and the meat-meal at the ordinary market price, say 12/- a half cwt.  With the skimmed milk at 1½d. a gallon, that works out at 86/- for the ration, and that ration will produce 1 cwt. of meat.</P>
      <P>That is a fair sort of ration to take if we are going to have pig production under present circumstances, when it is so important to have enough grain for human needs, and when it is obvious we can only feed pigs on odds and ends around the farm-a little oats and potatoes, and so on.  On that ration the present price is not unreasonable. I am now merely arguing against Deputies opposite, when they say that farmers are losing on pigs at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point made by Deputy Hughes is one with which I agree to a certain extent.  It is the point about grading.  I do not agree with Deputy Bennett, who says, in a very off-hand way, that the whole pig industry has been ruined through grading, and particularly through quality grading.  At the time grading was introduced we <Col N="1061" /> were setting out to compete against a very serious rival in the foreign market. Everyone knows that the Danes built up very big business for bacon in the British market by producing a uniform side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>What the O'Maras of Limerick taught them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were putting out sides to order, and it has been pointed out to me by Deputies on the Opposition benches, as well as by others, that pre-war, if a wholesaler went into a Liverpool store and said: &ldquo;I want 1 cwt. sides of bacon exactly uniform and of 52 or 56 lbs. weight, with so much lean and so much fat,&rdquo; he could get them, because the Danes were catering for that market.  We had to set out here, if we wanted to recapture that market, to try not only to get our farmers to bring into the market pigs of a certain weight, but to breed a certain type of pig.  That was necessary at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time it is not so important, but I think Deputies will agree that we cannot drop it altogether. I remember Deputies on the Opposition benches suggesting that we should not slacken on our inspection of eggs and butter, even though England, at a time like this, might be prepared to take whatever we would send her, as in the last war; they suggested we should carry on and keep up a strict supervision, so that when the war is over we will be able to compete in the foreign market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When, therefore, I advocate that we should keep some control over those things, I am looking to the future with some hope.  Deputies opposite accuse me of having no hope for the future. If I had no hope, and if I were convinced we could never get back to the British market again, I would say: &ldquo;What is the use of all this control? Let the factories do as they wish; let the farmers get back to the old, undesirable types of sows; let them produce fat and lean pigs and do as they like, because it does not matter.&rdquo;  But <Col N="1062" /> we must keep in mind the possibility that we may be looking for a foreign market when the emergency is over.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes on one point which I have examined recently. That is the point where the pig goes from one grade to another.  At the present time the first grade ends at 1: 2: 7.  If the farmer happens to sell the pig at 1: 2: 6 he gets a certain amount of money, but if the animal goes to 1: 2: 8 he gets less.  I have examined that position to see if it would be possible to do as Deputy Hughes suggests; that is to say, that if the pig goes into the next grade, at least the farmer will not get less than if it was 1: 2: 7.  There is some legal difficulty and I am having the matter examined.  I shall try to get over that difficulty if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dillon appeared to agree that there is some necessity for stopping pigs at a certain weight.  They spoke as if there was no necessity for the fat pig.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission stop at 14 stones dead, and Deputy Hughes stops at 16 stones dead.  The commission are examining this point about grading and I am sure they will consider it from the point of view of certain Deputies who spoke here to-day.  We might go higher on the grades and not victimise a person whose pig is between 14 and 16 stones.  We might give a little more encouragement to that type of pig.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes seemed to be somewhat inconsistent on one point, but perhaps I did not catch properly what he said.  He attacked the commission on the grounds of wasting valuable transport in bringing pigs from one centre to another.  Suppose one factory gets too many pigs, the excess over the quota should properly be transferred to the factory which may not get enough.  I felt that there might be a waste of transport and, even though there was a legal obligation on the commission to adopt a certain course, I felt that they might get over the difficulty and not have the pigs transferred in that way.  As a matter of fact, they did do something like that: they more or less agreed that they would leave the pigs at the factory by <Col N="1063" /> enlarging the quota somewhat.  Deputy Hughes says that we treated certain factories scandalously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said you were treating the curers badly by prosecuting them and bringing them to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission brought these curers to court because they went far afield for their pigs and were paying greater prices than they should pay; otherwise they would not get the pigs to go a long distance.  If you have a factory that goes outside the ordinary radius for pigs and goes into another factory's territory and pays higher prices, is it not obvious that transport difficulties arise?  In view of the transport difficulty, I think the commission were quite right in trying to make factories stick to their own areas and not go outside them, and that, after all, is what they were doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point we must come to, I suppose.  The point raised by Deputy MacEoin perhaps arises there.  Deputy MacEoin raised the case that has often been raised here before, that a farmer goes to the factory and says he has pigs for sale and wants to sell them to-morrow or the next day because he wants the money, and the factory says they cannot take them because their quota is filled but to come back the next week or the week after and they will take them.  Deputy MacEoin wants to know what that man can do.  In practice&mdash;I think I have mentioned it here at least a dozen times&mdash;whenever the Pigs and Bacon Commission have been got in touch with they have always got over that difficulty by telling the farmer to bring them in and they would direct the factory to take them.</P>

      <P>What happened was that the bacon factories said: &ldquo;We cannot take your pigs at your price.  We are getting too many pigs.  We will take them at £1 a head less.&rdquo;  That is what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin said a few foolish things in the course of his speech and I had the forbearance not to interrupt him.  Deputy Hughes raised another point to which I must refer.  He said that there was a surplus of potatoes which might be fed to pigs and he said that farmers who grew potatoes on appeal from the Government had now, some of them a big surplus of potatoes on hands and had no market for them and were disappointed.  Perhaps I am not right in thinking that Deputy Hughes wanted to bring blame on the Government for that, but I do not think he has any right to do that because I defy Deputy Hughes to take up any local or daily paper dealing with what I said to the farmers when I was going through the country that does not show that on every occasion I said to farmers that they ought to grow more potatoes, that if they were not wanted for human food they were a great stand-by for animal feeding. I think it is asking too much if Deputies want the Government to regulate all these things.  The farmer will make up his own mind.  The great majority of farmers do make up their own minds as to what they will do with <Col N="1065" /> their stuff and they do not want the Government interfering at every turn. If a farmer has potatoes on hand, he makes up his own mind early in the season how he is going to dispose of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett comes after Deputy Dillon.  If pigs were dear, Deputy Dillon says, farmers would grow barley to feed it to the pigs and give none to the brewers.  I do not want to dwell on Deputy Dillon's scheme for more than one moment.  I shall just deal with one aspect of it. He says we should make wheat compulsory and then let them grow all the oats and barley they like and feed whatever pigs and cattle they like with it and have no control whatever on either pigs or grain.  What would be the result?  If there was a very high price for pigs, we would get more than we want and the surplus would have to be sold on the British market for 131/- a cwt.  That would be no great encouragement to pig producers or barley growers.  Deputy Dillon has an idea that he can solve this problem in a very simple way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The one objection that I see to this scheme is that I believe, if that were done, the first thing that might happen would be that farmers might feed their wheat to pigs.  Of course, I know the members of the Opposition do not agree that any farmer did that at all.  I do not say that it was done on a large scale.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; oats and potatoes.  I did mention meat-meal.  I say that if there was a very high price for pigs and if the farmer was compelled to grow wheat he might feed some of that wheat to the pigs.  So that we would have to go a bit further in compulsory wheat growing and have compulsory collection of the wheat.  I am not saying at all that I am against compulsory wheat growing.  It may come to that but I say it is not as simple as Deputy Dillon makes it out to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And there might be other difficulties arising.  Certainly, what Deputy Dillon says, that whatever the farmers lose on the wheat crop they can make up in pigs, would not hold because, if every farmer in the country is going to lose as much as Deputy Dillon makes out on the wheat crop, every farmer in the country cannot make up on pigs because we would never consume all the bacon; we would have more pigs than we could use and the surplus would have to go on to the British market at 131/- a cwt.  Deputy Dillon says, when the war is over, let us import all the feeding stuffs free and we will compete against any country in the world. I do not know whether we could or not.  After all, it takes 5 cwt. of meal to make 1 cwt. of bacon.  That means really that we would have to get five shiploads of maize from Canada against Canada's one shipload of bacon going into the British market. I think, if we had to pay for five ships <Col N="1067" /> against Canada's one, we would not be in a very good position to compete against Canada in that particular matter.  I do not see very much good in a sort of machinery being set up in this country, having nothing whatever to do with agriculture, for the import of maize, to be fed to pigs, the pigs going to the British market and our having to pay a subsidy on that.  If it is not linked up with our agriculture in some way it is not very much good to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon talks about the members of this Party as being a lot of lunatics and imbeciles.  I think there are 70 or 80 members of this Party and I am reminded of the old story of the woman who, when she saw the regiment pass by said: &ldquo;They are all out of step but my Johnny.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett would not like to name a figure below what the Pigs and Bacon Board would fix later on.  I think that was his anxiety. What is really the cause of this decline?  I propose to say what I think about it and if any Deputy disagrees with me as I go along, let him tell me where the fallacy is.  The first point is that any small pig offered is bought&mdash; it is not brought home.  The price of the small pig depends on demand.  If small pigs are plentiful, they come down in price, and, if they are scarce, they go up in price.  On what does demand in respect of small pigs depend?  It depends on the supply of feeding stuffs the farmer may have on hands to feed these pigs, and on the number of small pigs offered.  The price of small pigs for the last 18 months has been very good.  I have returns which are gathered every week from fairs all over Ireland, and the price has never been below 45/- for pigs 12 weeks old and it has frequently been up to 65/-.  This very good price was probably due to a scarcity of small pigs rather than a surplus of feeding stuffs, but at any rate the prices were very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further point is obvious that every small pig offered at a fair was bought and put into fattening, so that there could not be any more pigs put into fattening no matter what the price was for the last three or four months.  Whoever had feeding got these pigs and put them into fattening. Therefore, within recent months anyway, whatever we might think about a long-term policy, the numbers of fat pigs had very little to do with the number offered on the market.  If <Col N="1072" /> we want to get an increase in pigs, the way we must start is by encouraging the farmers to breed sows.  You must commence there; you cannot commence anywhere else.  What is it that influences the farmer to put his sows to service?  In my opinion, it is the number of small pigs.  That is the big factor which influences him, and also if he has the feeding&mdash;otherwise he cannot do it.  The price of small pigs, as I say, was very good since the beginning of last year but, in spite of that, the number of sow services went down every month as compared with the same month in the previous year. That was the position, although the price for small pigs was good.  I think we might stop there and say that there must have been something to prevent the farmer from sending his sow to the boar.  It was not the price of the small pig.  The only thing preventing him from doing so was the uncertainty with regard to feeding stuffs. That was the big factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the uncertainty of prices when he wanted to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of small pigs was very good all the time.  Let us take the price of fat pigs to see what influence that had.  The price of fat pigs was raised five times from the beginning of the war down to February, 1942, and every month during the period in which the price of fat pigs was going up, sow services were going down so that in fact the raising of the price of fat pigs had no good influence in increasing the number of pigs.  In fact, the number of pigs was going to the boar was going down every month.  The first reduction in the price of bacon pigs since the war started was in February, 1942.  A rather peculiar feature, although I do not claim it is connected with the reduction in the price, was that the next month, March, was the first month for two years where sow services increased as compared with the corresponding month of the previous year.  I am not asking Deputies to believe that that was due to the reduction in the price <Col N="1073" /> of pigs, but it is a rather peculiar thing that the price of fat pigs was reduced in February, and that the first time there was any increase in sow services since the war started was in March.  That increase has been going on since.  Now, the fact is that we are short of bacon and I think we have to face the fact that we are short of bacon because we have no feeding to give pigs.  Some farmers may have a surplus of potatoes, but I do not know of any farmer who has oats and barley to spare to feed to animals.  That we did not breed so many pigs may be entirely attributed to the fact that we had no feeding stuffs for them.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the question of sow services, we get these figures from the country and though they are not complete, they are a very reliable index of how things are going.  If we place the same reliance on these figures as we did in the past I think we may look forward to an improvement in the position in September.  There should be more pigs offered to the factories by that time and there will be a fair number of pigs available until after Christmas.  We should at least have enough bacon for home consumption at that time, but then supplies will fall again during the spring months and we may not look for another improvement until we reach the corresponding period next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the records show whether the sow services increased at the same period in previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they were going down practically since the war started.  That, I think, was due to the fear of not having feeding stuffs and the price of fat pigs did not influence the situation in any way.  I think it is due to the fact that farmers had greater hopes of the coming harvest that they began to put sows back to service in March and the number is still on the increase.  If we could guarantee that we would have enough feeding stuffs for the coming winter, I think the number would increase still further, but that is a thing we cannot guarantee.  Every Deputy has the figures in regard to the area under barley, wheat and oats.  We <Col N="1074" /> must make sure, first of all, that we have enough wheat for human consumption. We cannot have a scarcity of bread above all things.  We must also have enough seed for the coming year and, if possible, carry over a small amount of wheat to the following year.  If we could cut out imports it would be a great thing as it would leave shipping free for the transport of other commodities including farm requisites.  After that there would be no objection I am sure to anybody using grain for pig feeding.</P>
      <P>I think, as I say, the situation is on the up-grade.  We are passing through a rather bad month at present as far as bacon supplies are concerned.  That shortage is likely to continue for the month of August.  After that, we shall not be so badly off until, say, February or March, when we shall have another three months when supplies will be just as bad as they are at the moment.  For the month of June we had 83 per cent. of the consumption in June of last year.  For the present month we have 60 per cent. and for the next month it will be down to 50 per cent.  Probably it will improve from that on.  That is the position at the moment.  If however, we overshoot the mark, and produce too many pigs, we shall get a very poor return for them on the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that we have all these things under active consideration. In my opinion there are three different questions involved. There is the immediate question of making the best use of the pigs and bacon we have.  That is a matter about which we shall have to do something in the very near future, that is to say, to see that the pigs are distributed as equitably as possible, taking into account the difficulties of transport, etc., amongst the factories, and that the factories in turn will distribute their bacon as equitably as possible amongst wholesalers and retailers, giving a preference, if you like, to the country consumer.  That is the immediate problem.  It is being considered at the moment, and we hope that we may be in a position to make a statement in reference to it in the course of <Col N="1075" /> a week or two.  The second thing is that we should as far as possible try to produce enough bacon for ourselves while the war lasts.  If we were sure that feeding-stuffs would be available, we could do that.  I am a little bit hesitant about encouraging pig production even yet.  We have the acreage all right, but some people fear that the oat crop and the barley crop will not be as good as last year in some parts of the country.  Deputy Dillon has stated that in certain parts of the country the potato crops will not be as good.  We want to see how the crops will turn out before we can definitely say to the people that they should go ahead and produce more pigs.  As soon as possible we shall take a decision on that. Lastly, we are trying at the same time to make the best shot we can at what is going to be the post-war position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it only a shot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as much as anybody can do.  We are having the position examined as well as the likely position of other agricultural products when the war is over.  I should like to put it to Deputies that we should not take any step in the way of doing away entirely with grading or doing away with the Livestock Breeding Act, as it applies to pigs.  We want to keep all these regulations in force so that, if there is a market when the war is over, we shall be in a position to take the best advantage of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters with reference to Deputy Dillon's speech to which I should like to refer. Unfortunately &mdash; I think deliberately and of malice aforethought&mdash;he telescoped the two motions into one because he was anxious to get away from the House and anxious, probably, to go home after a busy week.  He talked a lot about wheat, oats and barley.  I have a great admiration for Deputy Dillon's power of expressing his ideas.  I think he is gifted in that way.  I think there is no Deputy in the House capable of doing it better than he.  He is capable of pontificating in a very dogmatic fashion, and possibly to those who are ignorant of <Col N="1076" /> the facts with which he is dealing, he may sound convincing.  But he certainly did not convince me, and it appears that he did not convince the Minister, when he talked about a free market for oats and barley.  I object to control possibly as much as Deputy Dillon.  Because we believe in freedom &mdash;we talk enough about freedom in this House&mdash;we all object to control, but. under present conditions, when we control in one direction we must regiment in another.  Here is the position in a nutshell, and to my mind it is the most effective answer to Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>He asked that the control be taken off oats and barley.  That might work out all right if you could keep out the speculators, the gamblers, but the moment you say that there is a good supply of oats and barley in the country, that it is required for human and animal food, and that there are no means of importing any substitutes such as maize, the man who is anxious to speculate and to make money out of that situation will immediately jump in and corner all the oats and barley he can get.  A number of those individuals might do that, and corner a considerable quantity of our supplies of oats and barley.  Then they could simply sit on top of that heap of oats and barley until somebody came along begging for supplies.  That sort of speculation would simply force the price up until it would hit the ceiling. In order to prevent that, you must have some control.  You must put some ceiling on, so that the price cannot go beyond that level.  In present circumstances, I think any reasonable Deputy must agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, too, talked about the compulsory growing of wheat, but I think we had better leave that matter over until we come to the other motion. He talked about the price of barley. Evidently, he does not know the history of barley growing in England in the last couple of years.  I know he is aware that the price of barley, at the end of this season, went as high as £7 or £8 a barrel, £16 a quarter, but there were reasons which contributed to that; it was not that the British Government fixed that price.  It was <Col N="1077" /> because in the previous year the British Government, realising the shipping problems and the necessity for supplying that vital food, wheat, concentrated on wheat production and ignored the supply of barley for their essential purposes, mainly for stimulants. Early this year there was a growing shortage of stimulants and certain of the defence services were kicking up a row.  The naval authorities said that men could not be expected to face the perils of the sea without stimulants, and that stimulants would have to be supplied at all costs.</P>
    <P>The result was that any barley which was available in any part of England was bid for, and those high prices were offered&mdash;as much as £7 and £8 a barrel.  This year, the British Ministry have fixed the price of barley at £3 10s. per barrel, but there is a controlled acreage.  The acreage is limited.  If a man is permitted to grow a certain acreage of barley, side by side with that he must grow a certain acreage of wheat.  His acreage is controlled by local committees.  However, I think that too is a matter which we might more profitably discuss on the other motion, with your permission.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in replying to the speeches that were made on this motion, at one time got very hot under the collar.  I do not think there was any justification for that.  We came in here to assist him in a very difficult situation; to point out, as it is our duty to point out, that a very valuable industry is rapidly disappearing, and that something should be done about it.  The one point with which the motion specifically deals, that is the question of price, was not in fact referred to by the Minister at all.  I am sorry that he kept away from it.  I do not know whether it was deliberate on his part; he probably overlooked it.  He did deal with many other aspects of the problem. He dealt with a certain feed, a mixture of 2 cwts. of oats. 8 cwts. of potatoes, 1/2 cwt. of meat-meal, with some skimmed milk.  I think he said that that worked out at about 80/-.</P>
    <Col N="1078" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>He went on to show that that was profitable; that you could feed pigs profitably on that mixture. I went to some trouble to point out to the Minister that, in dealing with a mixture for pig-feeding purposes, you cannot ignore the fact that it is profitable to feed cattle at the present time, store cattle particularly. The Minister thought he had caught me out when I mentioned cattle, but I specifically referred to store cattle.  The Minister knows that there is a big difference between the price of stores and the price of fat cattle.  Nobody can deny that there is some money in cattle.  The fact that cattle are so profitable is the salvation of our people at the present time. The fact that their price is attractive induced a great many people to feed them last winter.  I gave figures for our production of oats and potatoes, and I asked the Minister what became of the surplus which was not used for human food.  It did not go to pigs. With the exception of the surpluses of potatoes that are here and there through the country at the present time, the bulk of that must have gone to cattle.  The Minister must concede that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, our oats always did go to cattle.  It never went to pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, we have a big increase in oats this year.  I am sorry that Deputy Fagan&mdash;a man who has more experience than I have of the cattle trade&mdash;is not here.  I firmly believe that we exported better stores this year than ever we did before, for that very reason&mdash;that the people were attracted to feeding them.  They saw that there was more profit in that line than in feeding pigs.  I do not come from a very great pig producing county, but we do feed a fair amount of pigs there.  I know people who would have 15 or 20 pigs in the ordinary way, and who went out of pig production altogether, and the food which they would have fed to those pigs was evidently fed to cattle.  The grain and potatoes were fed to cattle. I can assure the Minister that that is <Col N="1079" /> the case.  As far as my experience goes, that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I am not disagreeing with that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That, undoubtedly, happened.  If the price of pigs had been a bit more attractive, I say there is no doubt that a certain quantity of that food would have been fed to pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had not the pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a good deal about sow services, yet notwithstanding the fact that there were three or four increases in price over a period it did not influence the numbers that went to service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deductions could be drawn from that.  In the first place the increases had no reactions on pig production.  The people did not react to the increases at the time because there was no long term price and no assurance from the Minister or from the commission that that price would operate for a period.  We have been urging that for a long time, and I think the Minister is coming round to the view that there must be a guarantee over a long period so that people in the pig business will have an assurance that if they expand production they are safe for 12 months.  We suggest that there should be a revision of price every six months, and that that price should operate for 12 months.  In my view there is a different explanation for the increased sow services in March even though the price dropped in February.  The position became alarming in March, and the whole country knew that there was going to be an acute shortage of pigs, as we had not sufficient bacon for home requirements.  Intelligent farmers then decided to get into pig production because it would pay.  Pigs were bound to be profitable.  We had not enough bacon for our requirements, and none for export.  It would be profitable to put sows to service because <Col N="1080" /> young pigs were bound to command a better price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the position. We had more bacon than we wanted in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a Parliamentary question about the pig position in March, and the Minister gave figures which were published.  These figures were studied by the people.  I am sure the Minister will credit farmers with a fair amount of intelligence in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is probably a good deal in what the Deputy is saying, but in February curers were pressing to be allowed to export bacon because there was so much bacon on hands.  At the time there was a lot of bacon here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious reason why more sows went to service was that people began to appreciate that the business was going to be profitable.  The right time to go into any business is when supplies are getting scarce.  Unfortunately long before the outbreak of war we had numbers of people who went in and out of pig production periodically. They try to chip in when prices are high, and go out when prices are low.</P>
      <P>That was bad for the industry and we should discourage it.  However, that attitude is there still and people are chipping in because they know that there is an acute shortage and that bacon is going to command an attractive price.  As the Minister pointed out, despite four or five increases in price the decline of the industry continues.  It is an extraordinary situation that for the first time in two years there was an increase in the number of sow services immediately after a drop of 6/- in the price. The obvious explanation is that people began to realise, owing to the acute shortage of pigs and bacon, that the industry was now going to be profitable.</P>

      <P>We are in agreement on many things, doing away with grading to a great extent, and that we must have a maximum weight as distinct from heavy pigs.  It is only a difference of a stone one way or the other.  If 18 stone or 19-stone live-weight was fixed the man who produced animals above that weight should be penalised.  The fairest way would be that he should lose on whatever was produced in excess of that weight.</P>

      <P>The Minister ignored one item, the extraordinary fact that the consumption of bacon fell considerably over that period.  The consumption of bacon in 1931 was 825,844 cwts., and in 1937, 567,822 cwts.  The Minister need not talk about balancing imports <Col N="1082" /> with exports.  He is beginning to appreciate the gravity of this question. Although no attempt has been made to stem the decline in the industry it is good news that the tide is just beginning to turn.  It is beginning to turn, because every farmer with business foresight appreciates this fact, that no matter what control is there, there must be good times coming for pig producers owing to the acute shortage of bacon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my own name and the names of Deputies Brennan and Browne, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the importance of stimulating the maximum production of cereals both for human consumption and for further agricultural production, and the necessity for leaving a fair margin to the producer as a means of eliminating incentives to illegal transactions, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the prices of oats and barley as fixed by the Minister for Agriculture are insufficient to meet the increased costs of production and the inevitable reduction in yields consequent on the scarcity of manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the motion, the House must bear in mind that, during this period of emergency, the dominant consideration must be the maximum production of food for human and animal consumption from the soil of this country.  We feel that, in order to stimulate production, the necessary incentive must be held out to the farmer. On the last motion, I referred to the question of control.  I agree that control is objectionable where it can be avoided but, in this case, we must set a limit somewhere.  We must have a ceiling to those prices.  If the Government are to control wages and prices of other commodities so as to restrict the spiral in prices which must, inevitably, follow an increase in the price of other commodities, we must agree to some limit in this case.  With the increase <Col N="1083" /> in the volume of money coming back into this country not only for live stock but because we have a credit balance of trade at present, and with substantial sums coming in from people who left the country to obtain work and are sending back money to their families, there is an inflationary tendency.  The Government have, I think rightly, attempted to control that situation and keep prices within reasonable limits.  For that reason, I think we must have a measure of control, particularly in the case of oats and barley, to prevent speculation.  It might be all right to leave market operations in connection with oats and barley free if one were sure that no speculation would occur but, obviously, there are men with sufficient vision and foresight to avail of the opportunity to corner a certain amount of that grain and force up the prices. The sky would then be the limit.  On the question of fixation of prices, I do not think that we can offer any criticism. It is necessary under present conditions.</P>
    <P>A couple of evenings ago, the Taoiseach gave us first returns of this year's crops and they were, from his point of view, disappointing.  He told us that the present acreage of wheat was 585,000, an increase of 26.2 per cent. on that of last year; that the acreage under oats was 881,400, an increase of 12.7 per cent. and that the acreage under barley was 180,600, an increase of 14 per cent.  Root crops, generally, have decreased.  Potatoes have decreased and there is a very substantial decrease under sugar beet. The Taoiseach informed us that the acreage he aimed to secure under cereals was 2,000,000.  The aggregate acreage under cereals is 1,657,700, an increase of 17.3 per cent. on that of last year, but falling short of the 2,000,000 acres aimed at by 350,000 acres.  That shows that our effort in this regard has not proved a success, that we are still short by a very substantial amount.  Under present conditions, with the difficulty of securing supplies from overseas, that is a very serious matter.  To secure adequate <Col N="1084" /> production, two things are essential. Prices must be sufficiently attractive to induce people to till the land.  They must feel that the work is profitable and that the price is fair in the circumstances. The other essential is proper organisation and proper aid in the way of equipment of all sorts to help the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>In the fixing of the prices, we must take into account the cost of production. One of the things on which I have criticised the Minister for Agriculture on several occasions is his arbitrary method of fixing prices.  The consultations he had with agricultural interests were very few and far between. His consultative council were asked to meet only once or twice a year and the term &ldquo;consultative council&rdquo; is, I think, a misnomer.</P>
    <P>They are simply told what the Minister intends to do and they listen to that and discuss the matter.  Then they are dismissed and he does what he likes afterwards.  That is a rather peculiar sort of consultation; it does not strike me as being consultation at all. The Minister's intentions are generally announced beforehand, and they are merely asked to express their views on them.</P>
    <P>I complain not only about the arbitrary method of fixing prices without consultation, but also that the Minister has no costings of any sort in relation to any crops.  I do not know how he arrives at his figures when fixing prices.  Certainly, he cannot proceed on a costings basis.  It is only fair and right that, in determining a fair price to the farmer for grain, he should proceed on a costings basis. Otherwise, I do not know how he can arrive at a figure to cover the cost of production and leave a fair margin to the farmer.  It cannot be denied that the cost of production this year is higher.  The cost of labour under the wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board is higher; the casual labour required for harvesting operations and general production is bound to be higher, owing to the numbers who have gone across to work in Great Britain; plough parts and implements <Col N="1085" /> cost substantially more; harvesting operations, twine, and the various things necessary, cost more; and threshing charges are higher.  I do not want to go into the details of the cost of production generally, but there is no doubt that it has risen.  On the other hand, the lack of artificial manure, and particularly the lack of nitrogenous manure, is a very grievous handicap from the farmer's point of view.  That is particularly applicable in old tillage districts, on worn lands.</P>
    <P>There will be a very substantial reduction in the yield on many lands where there has been constant cultivation over a period.  In fixing prices, we must not overlook the important consideration that the more we extend the acreage under cultivation the more marginal land we are taking into the pool.  Undoubtedly, that lowers the average output.  As we bring more and more land into cultivation, we must be bringing in more marginal land. Therefore, the price must be fixed, not on the output of the best soil, but on the results obtained from these marginal lands.  This raises a very important matter&mdash;how best to treat the man living on marginal land.  This matter has given rise to a good deal of agitation in England in the last couple of years: while the prices fixed there under the present system of price fixing may leave a fair margin of profit to certain types, those living on marginal land, mountainy land, and the poorer and lighter soils may not be getting a reasonable margin of profit.  The anomaly about the whole thing is that, invariably, the best farmers are to be found on the poorer land.  They have to work harder and pay more attention to the crops in order to get the best results.  If they neglect that, they are failures.  Therefore, it is hardly fair to such men, who are the hardest workers, to tie them down to a price based on yield alone.</P>
    <P>I think there is a lot to be said for a subsidy on acreage.  It would ensure a common profit to all farmers, irrespective of fertility, whether growing on the rich soils of North Kildare and Meath or on the poorer lands of the West, or on the mountainside. <Col N="1086" /> That is an aspect of the problem of fair prices that should be taken into account.  It secures that the profit arising out of the growing of grain goes in common measure to all.  It helps to bridge the gap between the man forced to live on marginal land and the man living on rich land. There is a lot to be said for the operation of an acreage subsidy, though it would give rise, undoubtedly, to problems. At present, whatever price is obtained for oats, wheat and barley is a direct charge on the consumer, and the question of taxation does not arise. Obviously, if we introduce a subsidy on an acreage basis, money would have to be provided for that purpose; but I do not propose to go into that now.</P>
    <P>The price of oats is from 21/- to 25/8.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not present at the moment, as I am not sure whether that is a seasonal or a quality price.  I do not suppose the Minister for Supplies knows anything about it.  I take it that it is a quality price.  It is right that we should recognise that a man with good quality grain should be paid for quality.  In dealing with home consumption, we must remember there might be as much as or more than a stone of oatmeal in the difference between good oats and oats of poor quality, so I am glad there is a differentiation there, which, I presume, refers to quality.</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister would agree with me that the bulk of the oats is sold from marginal land, where it is not profitable to grow wheat.  Those people find it difficult at all times to carry on.  They are forced to cash the crops immediately after the harvest, and the only crop that can be cashed is the oat crop.  The House should remember that only about one-sixth of the total production of oats is offered for sale.  I suggest that most of that comes from the poorer and marginal lands, where farmers are forced to sell immediately after the harvest.  For that reason I feel that the present price is not fair.  In considering this whole matter the Minister must remember he had the Cereals Distribution Committee controlling prices last year.  The price fixed was ignored to a great extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> There were vast quantities of oats sold that did not come under that committee, or were not sold by a licensed dealer.  In fact, a great many merchants, all through the country, who were dealing in oats, paid far more, and charged far more, than the controlled price, and the reason for that was that the controlled price was far too low.  It was unreasonable, in the circumstances, and no one was prepared to pay any attention to it. Because the price was so low, there was no inducement to sell at that price and, as I said before, with a good deal of black-market operations going on, that set of circumstances, to my mind, forced up the price above what would have obtained if a fair and reasonable price had been fixed in the first instance. So that the result&mdash;and I know that many people agree with me&mdash;of fixing an abnormal price last year was that prices were forced up; many an illegal transaction occurred, and prices were forced up to a level that would not have been reached at all if a more reasonable price had been fixed in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We suggest that 28/- would be a fair price for oats.  I understand that Deputy MacEoin says that he would not take it.  Well, he can make his own case.  Personally, our intention&mdash; and, of course, it is the Minister's intention too&mdash;is to try to relate the price of oats to the price of wheat so that the growing of oats will not be more attractive than the growing of wheat, but there are certain marginal lands, as I said before, in this country where you cannot grow wheat under any circumstances, and as the bulk of our oats is consumed on the farm where it is grown, and not offered for sale, most of the oats that is offered for sale is sold off marginal land.  That is an aspect of the case that should not be overlooked, and even if it is off marginal land, I think the price of 28/- would be reasonable.  We are trying to avoid making exorbitant demands.  We want to be reasonable in the present circumstances, but we feel that the price the Minister has fixed is not justifiable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to barley, I agree <Col N="1088" /> with Deputy Dillon when he talks about getting more and more barley grown.  I think that in the circumstances we ought to try to get far more barley grown than we are growing at the present time, because it is our only salvation if we are to continue in pig production.</P>
    <P>It is very good pig feeding and we have any amount of land in this country which is suitable for barley production but is not able to grow wheat&mdash;poor land, again&mdash;and we should induce those people to grow all the barley they can on that type of land.  I think that a price of £2 a barrel is not an unreasonable price for barley, and, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, malting barley is commanding a price of £3 10s. in England, and that is the price in England not only for malting barley, but for barley generally. That means that Messrs. Guinness here are willing to pay £3 10s. for barley in England for the production of stout here, and yet the Irish farmer is expected, according to the prices fixed by the Minister, to supply barley at 35/- for the same purpose, and some of it, at all events, to be sold in the same market.  I think it is unreasonable and unfair to ask our people to produce barley at half the price that the English farmer is getting for his barley when our barley is going to be used for the same purpose, the production of stout for export.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to consider this matter last year.  I am satisfied that Messrs. Guinness are quite willing to pay more for barley than the price fixed by the Minister.  I know that there is a difficulty in adjusting the matter.  I was inclined to suggest that brewers should be put on a quota, that a quota should be fixed for brewing and distilling purposes; in other words that oats, barley, or anything that is required for brewing or distilling should be put on a quota and that those people should be permitted to operate without any price control, because, of course, you control their operation by the quota.  If Messrs. Guinness are permitted to operate under a quota, I have not any doubt whatever that they will pay much more than 35/-.  That might give rise to difficulties, as <Col N="1089" /> between one farmer and another.  I know that there is a difficulty there. If a man has got good-quality malting barley and gets it on the market early, he might get 10/- more for it from Messrs. Guinness, and as a result the other man might have a grouse.</P>
    <P>Whether it is possible or not to get over that difficulty I cannot say, but in any case, if we took the broad view of it, it would mean that these people who have been selling to Messrs. Guinness in the past and who always supplied the firms which malt for Messrs. Guinness with barley, would get a better price for that barley, because it is of good quality, grown on suitable land, is of a bright colour, and is generally suitable for malting purposes, and I think it would be unreasonable for farmers who have not grown barley in the past for malting purposes to grumble and complain if their neighbours benefited by the fact that Messrs. Guinness, and brewers generally, were permitted to operate here without restriction except in so far as they were restricted to a quota.</P>
    <P>What I am anxious to secure is that some of the profits that are going to the shareholders of Messrs. Guinness might be beneficially diverted into the pockets of certain farmers in this country.  I am not saying that in any spirit of criticism at all in regard to the firm of Messrs. Guinness.  I think that in recent years they have treated their grain or barley growers very reasonably, and we have nothing to complain about them in that regard.  With regard to this matter of quality, and the fixing of the price for oats, I should like to know from the Minister whether that differentiation between 21/- and 25/8 is a quality difference or a seasonal one.</P>

      <P>Well, we asked for that last year, and I think it is right that there should be a difference there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Does the Minister propose to fix the price of seed now?  I think it might be well if it were fixed early, so that at the start of the season the seed merchants could pick the best samples. Unless that is done some of the best grain offered in the early part of the season may be missed, and may go for feeding or other purposes.  Deputy Dillon talked about the compulsory growing of wheat.  What he meant by that was that the Minister would announce that a certain percentage of the total area of land under grain should be put under wheat irrespective of the quality of the land, the district, the altitude of the land or anything else.  That, of course, is impossible. If Deputy Dillon had any experience he would know that you could not risk growing wheat on high altitudes, because it might never ripen.  It would be more profitable to the farmer, and more profitable nationally speaking, to grow either oats or barley on that class of land.  Therefore, you could not in any set of circumstances make a general rule that would be applicable to the whole country for the compulsory growing of wheat.  The Minister said that he might be forced into a situation where you would need to have the compulsory growing of wheat.  I suggest that if there is to be compulsion it will be necessary to set up local organisations to deal with it. They have local committees operating in England.  There they control the acreage and decide whether the land is suitable or unsuitable for the growing of certain crops.  But if there was to be compulsion, you could not carry it out simply by sending down an inspector, say, to the County Longford to tell Deputy MacEoin that he should grow wheat on his land.  The inspector could not be expected to know whether or not the Deputy's land was suitable for its production.</P>
    <P>Local committees should be set up to deal with a question of that sort, and it is only by availing of that local knowledge that the best results can be obtained.  If the Minister contemplates doing anything like that next year, I suggest that he should operate through the medium of local committees on which he would have the right type of <Col N="1091" /> men who know their agriculture, men who would honestly and sincerely serve the nation in its hour of difficulty, and who would be capable of determining those problems.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question that I would like to direct the Minister's attention to, and that is that next year there will be a problem in securing a sufficient acreage for wheat production.  As I have said, the farther we go out the more marginal land we bring in.  Possibly, there is land in some of the rich grass districts, with a vast amount of plant food stored up in them for years, that would give us very heavy crops of wheat, land that we could draw on for two or three years.  There, again, you could only determine through the operation of local committees what quantity of that land could be put into cultivation.  I suggest to the Minister on this question of the preservation of fertility in land that has been in cultivation for a number of years, that I think it was a pity that first-crop meadows were not put into the quota.  The Minister knows that a good deal has been done by way of short-term leas in England, and by the utilisation of certain types of nitrogen fixing plants.  There is no encouragement to do that under the present Order.  I suggest that it might be well to encourage farmers to go in for short-term leas for the purpose of providing nitrogen through the medium of nitrogen fixing plants.  I think that is a matter that ought to be very seriously considered.</P>
    <P>As I said before, in the drafting of any future compulsory Order this question of food production is the most vital matter that this House and the Government have to consider.  In my opinion, we have not been getting the success that we ought to in the circumstances.  I think the reason is that the right methods were not adopted, and that we are lacking in organisation.  I think the Minister would be wise to draw more on local committees, composed of the right type of local men, who would be competent to deal with the vast amount of detail which is necessary and which <Col N="1092" /> must be attended to if you are to achieve the results desired.  There is the question of the provision of ploughing equipment and of cultivators of all sorts in districts where that equipment is lacking.  If the Minister contemplates the compulsory growing of any crop he should make use of organisations composed of local men who would see to it that there was no harsh treatment of anybody in connection with the administration of such schemes.  In our desire to stimulate maximum production we cannot rely on compulsion alone.  We must make the carrying out of those schemes attractive for the farmer.  The whole nation is dependent on him at the present time.  Many farmers are being forced to plough up some of the finest grasses in the world.  They hate like hell to have to do that.  You cannot blame them, because they have found that in their system of economy they have proved a very valuable asset to them.  Now they are being forced to break up that valuable capital asset in the national interest, and in that situation they are surely entitled to ask for fair compensation.  For that reason I suggest that there is room for a further adjustment of the price which the Minister has made.  We ask him to consider the representations we have put forward on this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to wheat which, I think, stands in quite a different position from the other cereals, because it is altogether for human consumption, I have always believed that we should give what would be a very fair price, if you like a generous price, to the farmer for growing it: that we should get him to grow it by the enticement of a fair price.  At the same time, of course, we made appeals to their patriotism and so on.  I have always held that a great number of farmers have responded just as much to the appeal to their patriotism as they have to the good price.  I think that if farmers were entirely looking after their own interests, as it were, we might not have got that large acreage. <Col N="1093" /> But they felt that the nation required it and they grew more wheat than they might be induced to grow according to their own economy.  I think we can say to the farmers that we are giving a good price.  They will not lose any money but, on the contrary, will make fairly good money on their wheat crop this year.  So far as the reports of the inspectors go, the wheat crop looks to be very good all over the country.  I have been here and there down the country myself and it looks very good; in fact, I think it looks much better than last year.  With the increased acreage, we may be in a very comfortable position.  We ought to have sufficient for our own requirements and for seed to carry on next year.</P>
      <P>But when we come to the other two cereals we are in a different position. The reason for that is that whatever surplus there is of barley and oats goes largely for animal feeding and we must keep that in mind when fixing the price of these cereals.  Deputy Hughes dealt with oats first and I might, therefore, take oats first.  Last year was not unlike any other year so far as oats were concerned.  The great bulk of the oats was kept by farmers on their own farm.  In peace time it was calculated that farmers kept about five-sixths of the oats for their own use.  They kept at least as much last year, if not more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many illegal transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They kept at least five-sixths which they fed to their own animals. We have to consider carefully, therefore, whether we should give a price that will entice them to neglect their own animals, as it were, in order to get cash for oats.  I think we should not go too far.  I admit that Deputy Hughes was moderate in his demand, which was only a few shillings more than the fixed price.  I think he will agree with what we have in mind in fixing the price: that the farmer to a great extent should feed the oats on his own farm.  We had a certain amount of oats marketed for certain purposes.  So far as I remember, I think about 50,000 tons are required <Col N="1094" /> for human food in the form of oatmeal and probably about the same quantity or a little less for the feeding of horses and other purposes, such as feeding for poultry in towns, that is, for animals outside the farm, as it were.  That is not very much.  About 100,000 tons probably would be the amount required, if we do not consider transactions between farmer and farmer. On our acreage this year that would only amount to, say, one-sixth or so, which is usually put on the market. But if we go beyond that, we will then be entering into the trade by which oats pass from one farmer to another, not directly, but by oats being bought by a merchant, sold by that merchant to a grist miller, milled by that man, and again sent back to the wholesaler and the retailer and sold to the farmer for feeding pigs and cattle.  That is not a very desirable business at the moment, because by the time the oats goes through all these hands it is very dear when it comes back to the farmer who has to feed it to his animals.  I do not know if that is a thing we need encourage very much.  We did give this matter a good deal of consideration.  I had in mind the farmer who will buy that crushed oats to feed pigs or cattle, and if the producer gets, say, about 24/- a barrel, by the time that goes back as crushed or ground oats to the farmer for feeding it will be very dear.  I think if we go very much higher it will be too dear; that it will not pay to buy it.  I do not think we will achieve very much by increasing the present price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I think that if we except the amount that goes for oatmeal for home consumption, and the amount that goes for the feeding of horses and poultry in towns, etc., there will be very little sale beyond that if the price is anything higher than has been fixed.  We thought it was better, rather than have a fixed price such as we had last year, to have a minimum and a maximum.  We thought, if there was any sort of rush for marketing, as there might possibly <Col N="1095" /> be in isolated areas immediately after the threshing, that at least they would get the minimum price for oats which would not be of very good quality.  On the other hand, oatmeal millers who want good oats, other people who want oats for feeding racehorses, and those buying oats for seed, who want the first quality oats, might probably give the top price fixed or near it, and get supplies in that way.  We have not yet fixed the price of seeds, but I think it can be taken for granted that the price will be fixed on the assumption that those who are buying seed oats will pay very near the top price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion. I think it will.  Certainly it will make a very big difference if the oats crop is not good, or if there is not an average yield.  There may not be very much put on the market immediately, even if there is an average yield, but I think there will be sufficient put on the market early in the year to fulfil our requirements.</P>
      <P>As regards barley, it is true that there is a price of 70/- for malting barley in the United Kingdom, but, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, there are certain restrictions on the British farmers.  It is, I think, extremely difficult to have any sort of differential price, except perhaps 1/- or so, between malting and feeding barley, because in all probability we will get more barley than is necessary for malting put on the market, and the farmer who puts barley on the market and who sees his neighbour getting, let us say, 40/- for malting barley, while he is only getting 35/- for feeding barley would have a very big grievance. That is one thing we had in mind.  I went further and I thought we might have had some sort of pooling arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various ways of pooling. <Col N="1096" /> If you like, you can say to Messrs. Guinness: &ldquo;You will have to give 5/- or 10/- in excess of this price for barley and distribute that over the lot.&rdquo;  That would be one way.  On the other hand, you could get some body, such as the Cereals Distribution Committee, to do all the buying and then distribute that and give a level price to all.  But it was really found impracticable to do any of these things. We could not see that it was practicable. We had to come down to a compromise at the end.  I think we fixed the price of barley pretty high for feeding purposes.  If you trace that barley from the producer to the miller and back again through the wholesaler and the retailer to the farmer feeding pigs and cattle, it will be very dear if it costs 35/- in the first instance.  I think it would be better to fix 30/- or 32/-, but we had to have some sort of compromise.  We thought we were going as high as we possibly could go for feeding barley at 35/-, and going down a little bit lower than we might go for malting barley, but on the whole I think it was the best thing that could be done. Taking barley at 35/- per barrel, if there is an excess over the amount required for brewing&mdash;there was not last year&mdash;and that is put on the market, and if some of it goes for feeding, it will fetch about 22/- or 23/- a cwt. as barley meal.  As Deputy Hughes pointed out, at that price it could not, with profit, be fed to pigs or cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point is with regard to wheat.  Compulsory wheat growing has been advocated by many people over the past couple of years. I agree with Deputy Hughes that we should try to avoid compulsion and over-regulation, if at all possible; but it has been put to me by farmers who grow a good lot of wheat that it is <Col N="1097" /> rather unfair that certain other farmers, who have land with a good amount of fertility&mdash;old grass farms&mdash; are not growing wheat; that they are using the land with an eye to conditions after the war and are growing oats, and it is unfair that they should be permitted to do that.  That indicates that compulsory wheat growing would not be objected to very strongly, at least by one group of farmers.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that if compulsory wheat growing is adopted, we would have to have some appeal machinery, whether on the lines laid down by Deputy Hughes or not I do not know. I agree it would not be sufficient to have an inspector at headquarters; you would have to have some appeal tribunal in every county.  How the personnel would be selected, I cannot say.  I expect that they would exempt certain mountainous and bog areas, and that they would have to hear individuals. Even in a wheat-growing area you may have a farmer with 40 acres of land who might be reluctant to grow wheat.  You would have to have a local tribunal to adjudicate individually and generally, if compulsory wheat growing were adopted. These local committees would need some statutory standing, so that whatever certificate they might give would be recognised by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Hughes was with reference to first-crop meadows.  In the last war first-crop meadows were included in the tillage quota.  They could be included now, but automatically, I think, we would have to put up the tillage quota.  I do not know whether Deputy Hughes would consider favourably extending the quota to 33? per cent. and leaving in first-crop meadow.  As the Deputy says, it might make for better husbandry, but I wonder would it make very much difference.  I know the sort of tillage they carry on in Deputy Hughes' county and in my county. Every farmer will have first-crop meadow in rotation and it will make very little difference whether you bring it in or not, but it might have a good influence in certain counties where they did not till before, where they till <Col N="1098" /> one piece of land and will keep tilling it until the war is over.  I feel that we are getting to a fairly high figure with 25 per cent.  It is not easy to go beyond that.  If we brought in first-crop meadow, and made it 33? per cent., we would need to give at least a year's notice.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hughes said, we ought not to get our requirements in the way of tillage through compulsion alone. We ought to keep the goodwill of the farmers.  I agree with that.  We have been proceeding so far on the two lines.  There is a Compulsory Tillage Order and a farmer must do so much tillage.  As well as that, we have been appealing to the farmer to do his part in the national effort and we have been fixing prices which were generous on the whole.  Some people might think they were not good enough, but, compared with pre-war prices, I think they are very good.  Even compared with prices in the last war, when there was very little control so far as soaring prices are concerned, I think we have reached practically what was the top of that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Barley was 50/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was 40/- and I think oats sold at 30/-.  As regards wheat, the price never went beyond 50/- in the last war.  I agree with a good lot of what has been said.  The only point that arises is the price of oats&mdash;that is where there is any great difference of opinion.  I can assure Deputies that the price of oats is not by any means a question between the producer and the consumer, it is really a question between one farmer and another.  When we keep in mind the farmer who will buy whatever surplus oats there may be for feeding his animals, I think on the present price we have gone nearly as far as we can go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion.  Even if he did not promise <Col N="1099" /> us anything great, the Minister was sympathetic in his statement.  Deputy Hughes comes from a tillage county, and if he makes an appeal for a better price it is obvious that the people from the non-tillage areas, people not so much accustomed to tillage, would have all the more reason to look for it.  The Minister spoke about the possibility of a Compulsory Tillage Order with a higher percentage and including first-crop meadow as portion of the quota.  I may say straight away that whatever percentage is eventually arrived at, if there is any need to make an appeal to my constituents in that connection, I am prepared to make it. When it comes to making an appeal to the people, I am quite prepared to make it, even if the figure goes to 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>In a particular area like mine, where there is a large amount of dairying, perhaps we have got to the peak point, if everybody carries out the required 25 per cent.  If you go much further than that, you may interfere with the equally essential industry of dairying.  I know that a difficulty has been created for some people.  I had to reduce the number of my cows somewhat. I do not know that a lot of that happened, but I feel we are near the danger point and anything beyond the 25 per cent. might be going too far. The people in Limerick do not till the low land: If they till at all, it is the grazing land that is tilled.  It is obvious that if you increase the present percentage you may reach the danger point from the dairying aspect.  However, I suppose the Minister is considering all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it would be no harm if the price of oats and barley were raised a bit higher.  Everybody knows that last year the fixed price did not control the price of oats in general, and I do not believe it will this year.  Ways will be found of evading the fixed price.  Many farmers will perhaps sell at the beginning of the season and accept the fixed price and, later in the season, farmers who evade the regulations may get a considerably enhanced price.  That occurred last year and <Col N="1100" /> everybody knows it.  I think it would be better to raise the price a little so that more would go on the market. That would have an effect on the assembly of seeds.  Last year there was great difficulty in getting seed.  Nobody was anxious to sell at the controlled price.  One had to travel through various counties to obtain seed.  Some farmers were not in a position to keep their own seed and many farmers like to change their seed, but when they came to purchase seed, the merchants had not got any and it was difficult to get it in other ways.</P>
    <P>There is an advantage in the merchant holding seed.  There is a probability that seed exchanged between farmers in different counties or in different parts of one county would not be attended to as well as it would be by a man who was used to assembling it.  The seed might not be as clean from weeds and there would be danger of propagating weeds.  As far as seed is concerned, it would be more desirable that it should be in the hands of reputable merchants who have always handled it but who found it impossible last year to get oats at the controlled price.  For that reason alone, I think it would be better if the price were fixed a little higher.  There would be greater circulation of seed and, in general, there would be less inclination to hold up whatever was available for the market.  I do not wish to delay the House by repeating arguments that have already been made.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the most important question that the Government has to face, or that any Government will ever have to face in this country, is the production of food for the nation.  The motion is very clear-cut. It is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in view of the importance of stimulating the maximum production of cereals both for human consumption and for further agricultural production, and the necessity for leaving a fair margin to the producer as a means of eliminating incentives to illegal transactions, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the prices of oats and barley as fixed by the Minister <Col N="1101" /> for Agriculture are insufficient to meet the increased costs of production and the inevitable reduction in yields consequent on the scarcity of manures.</P>
    <P>The farmer, in my opinion, is the most loyal servant of the State.  There is no person who has given more to this State than the farmer.  In the dark days of 1920-21 there may have been great companies such as Guinness and Jacob's; there may have been all sorts of people, bishops, archbishops, priests, but there was only one man who stood between the country and its immediate danger, and that was the farmer.  I want to pay a tribute to him, and to assert that he has always been the bulwark of the nation's defences.  The farmer at all times stood in the <i>bearna baoghal.</i>  The Minister for Agriculture may make an Order to-day; the Minister for Supplies may make an Order to-morrow; the Turf Controller may send out his ukase, and everybody thinks that all he has to do is to crack the whip and the farmer must bow to it and produce more, and more, and more and receive no reward.  It has been argued here this evening by Deputy Hughes that the farmer's reward was inadequate.  The Minister has stated that he is satisfied that his reward is great.  They are both wrong. No farmer has ever yet been paid for the service that he rendered to this State.  We have arrived at the stage to-day when our sons and daughters are running away from the country because it cannot keep them.  Why? Because you have a Minister for Agriculture who will not pay them for the service that they render to the State. The time has arrived, in my opinion, when there must be a very positive examination of conscience, not only on the part of the farmer but on the part of the Government in particular, to make sure that the people who render this great service of producing food, not only for the rural areas but for Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway, and to whom we all appeal to produce food and fuel, should get a compensation in relation to the service they render.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening I heard a short <Col N="1102" /> argument on the question of old age pensions.  I am merely making a passing reference, Sir.  The question was raised that although &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo; assigned his farm to his sons he was disqualified.</P>
    <P>His sons and daughters worked hard on the farm to produce food, not only for their own domestic purposes but for the nation&mdash;and the Government demands that of them.  The farmer is now called upon to produce the necessary material to keep the whole nation from danger and the compensation he is going to get for it is practically nil. He gets no help.  Fertilisers are very important.  Old &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo;, whoever he is, knows exactly the value of his land.  He knows well that if he does not put fertilisers into his field he is going to get no return for his labour.  He knows he must get fertiliser in some way.  The Minister for Agriculture says that he cannot get it except at a certain price.  The Minister for Supplies comes in and puts on his tariff.  The tariff has been on for the last four years, with the result that it was not possible to get in fertilisers to keep the land alive.  I see farmers to-day who have taken wheat, oats and barley off their land for two or three years in succession.  That land is not worth a box of matches to-day, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce made sure to impose a tariff upon the importation of fertilisers over so many years, and it was not possible to get them, unless one got them from Messrs.  So-and-So&mdash;and the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows whom I am talking about. The production of food for the people is the first important thing the nation has to undertake to-day.  The next thing is fuel.  Food and heat are all important matters.  We are in the unfortunate situation that we have a doctor as Minister for Agriculture who knows nothing about agriculture, although he may be a damn good doctor, and we have as Minister for Supplies, a man who is a trader in the City of Dublin, who knows nothing about Supplies, except in so far as they relate to a particular type of supplies for his own shop.</P>

      <P>I am going on to this point, that I think we should have a Minister for Agriculture who knows something about the job.  I can assure you, Sir, that I would much prefer to have the present occupant of the Chair, who comes from County Galway, as Minister for Agriculture than the best of them I have heard of, with the exception of one.  I say that the Galway man must of necessity know the difference between this turf and that turf, between this wheat and that wheat, and between this barley and that barley, and I assert that we have arrived at the stage at which the farmer who knows how to produce food, clothing, and fuel is the best soldier this country can have, and that the Government should use every care to encourage him to greater effort and greater production.  The more he produces the better he is, and I urge that under no circumstances should he be prosecuted for producing too much. That is exactly what this Government is trying to do to-day.  The more you produce, the less you are paid for it, and the harder the knocks you get. It is time the Government set about examining their own conscience, and, before they go much further, they will need to ask the people: &ldquo;Whither goest thou?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did try to be as sympathetic to the motion as possible, without accepting it, but that does not get us very much further.  I should like again to call his attention to one phrase in the motion&mdash;&ldquo;as a means of eliminating incentives to illegal transactions.&rdquo;  The Minister must have come to the conclusion that last year the price was too low, and that as a result there were many illegal activities and black market transactions in oats.  It is for the purpose of ensuring that those transactions will not be carried on in the coming year that we feel an adjustment is necessary. As I have said, I think the fact that that low price was fixed, led to greater activity in the black market <Col N="1104" /> and forced up the price to a figure higher than it might have reached if a more adequate price had been fixed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett referred to the fact that I come from a tillage county and he said that I complained about the price, but that the people of the non-tillage areas had more cause for complaint. I am afraid I do not agree with him in that, because, unfortunately, the position is that we have tilled intensively&mdash;we have, of course, better equipment than they have&mdash;and we have less fertility in our land.  We have to face a lack of artificials which is a very serious handicap on the man who has been tilling for a number of years. Any authority on agriculture must admit that in this emergency the man who has tilled for a number of years is more severely handicapped, because of lack of those artificials, than the man who has stored up fertility in his land.  I suppose that for that reason the nation in this emergency is forced to call on the man who has stored up that fertility during the normal life of the country, but I must say that the people in the tillage districts&mdash;I suppose they have no option but to till &mdash;are operating under a very severe handicap in that they have no artificials.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the farmers' patriotism; I suppose that as a section of the community our people are as patriotic as any other section, and maybe more so, but we cannot expect&mdash;it would not be fair to expect &mdash;our people to produce food from patriotic motives.  The unfortunate fact is that the financial position of the vast majority of our farmers is none too good.  That financial position is ever present to the minds of, and is a great source of worry to, the majority of them.  They are anxious to ensure that they are able to meet their liabilities, to keep their budget balanced and to pay their way.  If they are able to do that, they are quite happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on that point, I should like to say to the Minister that it is only during periods of this kind&mdash;and it is the history of agriculture&mdash;that the agricultural community get the <Col N="1105" /> opportunity of building up any capital reserves on which they can get their fingers.  This is a bad war from that point of view.  The farmer is getting very little chance of doing that and what I am worried about is the fact that he is not getting the opportunity to do that now&mdash;the opportunity which should be there, and that history tells him should be there.  I wonder is history going to change all round?  Is that post-war period going to be less difficult for him than the history of post-war periods in the past would suggest?  Is it a fact that he has not got to make better profits and to lay a little capital aside for the difficult times that are inevitable if we are to judge the position by history?  I think that is a serious consideration and it is an aspect of the case that, in fixing prices generally, the Minister ought not to overlook.  I give the Minister credit for being sympathetic. I am sure he would like to do his best, but he is a member of the Government and has to make his decision as a member of the Government and to some extent his hands are tied.</P>
    <P>On the question of the price of grain for malting purposes, the Minister suggested that he examined that matter and that he thought of a pooling arrangement.  I thought too of the possibilities of pooling and the conclusion I came to was that it would be hardly a fair proposition to put up to Messrs. Guinness that they should subsidise all our barley.  I was forced to come to the conclusion, after giving a good deal of thought to the matter, that we can only ask Messrs. Guinness or the malting people to pay on whatever barley they take into their stores and that it would be unreasonable to ask them to pay a subsidy on all the barley grown in this country. There were some friends of mine who were not in agreement with me on the subject.</P>
    <P>I felt that if there is a concession given to people who have always grown first-class barley for malting purposes, we should not allow a little bit of jealousy to prevent these people from getting a little more for their barley if the firms who are interested in the <Col N="1106" /> production of barley for malting purposes are prepared to pay a good price.  I know that that firm is prepared to pay something more for the barley they require.  When they have to pay £3 10s. a barrel in England, it is only natural to assume that they would be willing to pay more than the price ruling at present here, and I think that if people who have grown barley for Guinness all their lives get a little more for their barley, we should not object, and we should try to get that increased price for them.  I think the pooling arrangement is not going to solve the problem which the Minister rightly pointed out is there.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister was present when I adverted to the question of costings.  I am sorry the Minister has not a costings officer in his Department.  I believe such an officer was there some years ago.  Whether or not it was considered convenient to remove him I do not know, but he is not there now.  For many reasons it would be very useful if we had information as to costings.  The farmer is entitled to get prices fixed on the basis of cost of production with some margin over and above that.  He does not want any more than anybody else.  I had experience of making representations to the Taoiseach on the question of prices of wheat this year and I argued that we were paying a subsidy on flour and securing a profit to the miller of 6 per cent.  He immediately asked me if I were prepared to accept 6 per cent. for the farmer.  I said: &ldquo;Certainly, on the same basis as the miller gets his 6 per cent., plus his overhead costs.&rdquo; If the farmer is paid his costs of production, and an amount which will leave him a net profit of 6 per cent. on the capital invested in his farm, in his stock and in his implements, he would be quite satisfied with 6 per cent. net profit.  I do not think the Taoiseach was prepared to argue it on that basis; at least he got away from it as quickly as he could.  On this whole matter of the fixation of prices, I do not think it is fair to the farmer to fix prices in an arbitrary manner without having any examination of costs of production. There is just one other matter to which I should like the Minister to pay attention. <Col N="1107" /> That is the question of assembling seeds.  I think he will agree that it was not done well last year.</P>
