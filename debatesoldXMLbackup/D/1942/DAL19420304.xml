    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the influx of money from Great Britain, coupled with the diminution of supplies of consumer goods, is creating an increasingly rapid inflation in Ireland, and whether he will take steps to relieve the resulting hardship to poor people with fixed incomes, and fathers of large families in the lower income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy suggests, there is at present an abnormal influx of money from Great Britain, and there is also a diminution in the supplies of consumer goods.  The increased flow of money from Great Britain has, however, been offset by substantial contractions in receipts from other sources. Although the available quantities of consumer goods have diminished, I am not aware that avoidable increases in prices have taken place on any large scale.  There are other factors at work in producing an inflationary rise in prices, besides the two mentioned by the Deputy, such as increased prices of our imports in the countries of origin, and higher freight and insurance charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I may point out that hardship resulting from the scarcity of goods cannot be remedied by steps of a merely financial character.  I have, <Col N="2038" /> however, endeavoured, by the food voucher scheme introduced in my last Budget, to meet cases of hardship amongst the poorer sections of the community.  This scheme provides these people with what they most want &mdash;commodities, not cash.  In addition, by a system of rationing, subsidisation of commodities and control of prices, my colleague, the Minister for Supplies, also tries to secure an equitable distribution of available goods.  The possibility of further steps being taken in this direction is under review.  It has been and remains the policy of the Government to combat any serious inflationary tendencies that may manifest themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the price of a workman's boots has gone up from 21/- to 35/-, of a workman's shirt from 5/- to 9/-, of a workman's cotton vest from 3/- to 5/-, of long cloth from 8d. to 1/3 per yard, of flannelette from 1/6 to 2/- a yard, and that these prices are still rising? In the light of these facts, will the Minister consider the desirability of increasing the allowance made to old people who depend on small fixed incomes for subsistence and the question of making available family allowances to those persons who have large families and fixed incomes and who are now finding it impossible to feed and clothe their children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there have been increases in prices, perhaps of the amount mentioned by the Deputy, but I am not sure of the details with regard to that.  But this question, as I said in my reply, is constantly under review and the Government are always anxious to try to meet the situation so far as their resources allow.  The question of family allowances is under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister advert to the fact that, while it may be true that we have not got as many poor people as we had last year, those who are still poor are much poorer as a result of the inflation than anybody was last year, because that is certainly true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received a copy of a resolution passed by the Killarney Branch of the Post Office Workers' Union protesting against the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus, while the prices of all the ordinary commodities of every-day life continue to rise, and whether in view of the fact that it appears to have been impossible to prevent prices from soaring, he will reconsider this whole question, especially in the case of the lower grades in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a copy of the resolution referred to by the Deputy.  The decision to stabilise the Civil Service cost-of-living bonus was taken in the public interest and was arrived at only after careful consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances. The question of modifying the stabilisation of bonus is being kept under constant review, but the Deputy will appreciate that the financial situation, and considerations of public interest generally, have hitherto precluded any change in the stabilisation arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that, notwithstanding the attempt to control inflation to which he has referred, the cost-of-living index figure, according to the statistics published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, has risen by over 30 per cent. during the past two years, while workers' wages have either remained static or at most have increased by a small percentage?  In view of that tendency, which apparently cannot be controlled by the Government, will the Minister now intimate that the Government cannot persist in a policy of keeping wages low when they failed so utterly to control prices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, arising out of the bombing at the North Strand, Dublin, he will state (a)  the number of claims received, (b)  the total amount claimed as compensation, (c)  the amount of compensation paid to date, and (d) the number of claims finally disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy, so far as losses other than death or personal injuries are concerned, is as follows, viz., (a)  936, (b)  £121,315 19s. 6d., (c) £821 6s. 9d., including cases in process of payment, and (d)  118.  I would add that the last-mentioned figure relates to the amount under (c) and is exclusive of (1) cases in which it has been decided not to make any offer of compensation, (2)  cases in which an offer of compensation has been refused, and (3) cases in which an offer has neither been accepted nor refused; in any of these cases there may be an application to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>As regards death or personal injury claims, the Deputy is, no doubt, aware that a revision of the Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, 1941 (Compensation) Scheme, 1941, is intended. Accordingly, no payments have been made under that scheme, as applicants will be accorded the more favourable terms which will be embodied in the revised scheme.  Forty-five forms of application relating to injuries and 12 forms relating to deaths have been completed and returned.  Specific amounts of compensation have not, generally, been claimed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the terms of the Deputy's question that he has in view not only bodies established directly by the Government, but also those set up at the instance of Ministers. The preparation of information on those lines for so many years would necessitate an inquiry in each Government Department, involving an expenditure of time and labour which, in present circumstances, it would be difficult to justify.  It may be possible, however, for the Deputy to indicate more specifically what information he is seeking, in which event I shall see what can reasonably be done to make it available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions 5 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed of the position in a written statement by Deputies from the constituency and others.  At this period of the year, large scale employment works are normally carried out on the basis of part-time employment and part contribution by local authorities.  Owing to possible conflict with demands for agricultural labour these works are generally being shut down this week.  The works referred to in the questions are works done in substitution for these employment schemes; have been done on a full-time employment basis, and with full State contribution and are, where possible, being continued.  Their continuance in Meath, at present, is doubtful.  The rate of wages has been set at the present level in the hope that they can be continued.  When the position of agricultural labour becomes more clear, it might be possible to review the question.</P>

If the Deputy desires information in respect of a particular case or cases, I shall, as I indicated in reply to his question on the 18th ultimo, have the matter examined if he will supply me with particulars.  In accordance with a general direction given by me, all applications for duty-free licences for cotton half-hose received since November 20th, 1941, have been recommended.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state on what grounds he refuses to permit the Kildare County Council to increase the wages of road workers above 30/- per week, and whether, having regard to the high cost of commodities and the low wages received by such workers, he is now prepared to authorise the county council to increase the wages of such workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In August, 1940, local bodies were notified that the rates of wages paid to road workers employed on works financed either wholly or partly out of grants were not to exceed the appropriate rates of wages obtaining on the 1st September, 1939.  If increased <Col N="2058" /> wages are to be paid on such works it would have the effect of increasing the cost of works and reducing the number of persons who would benefit from the employment.  It is in the interest of unemployed workers that employment should be extended as widely as possible, and in the present circumstances it is not proposed to vary the decision come to in 1940.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of living has increased from an index figure of 72 in September, 1939, to 137 in mid-February this year?  In view of that very substantial increase, on what grounds does he pretend to justify as a Christian wage 28/6 per week to road workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the grounds which have been already stated in the reply, that as the amount of money which can be expended on this particular class of work is limited, it is socially more advantageous to give it to a greater number than would receive it if the cost of the works were to be increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in order to secure a considerably greater acreage under wheat this year, he will without delay formulate a scheme, on the lines of the arrangement between the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company and their sugar beet growers, under which farmers, who need such assistance, could get seed wheat on credit, to be <Col N="2061" /> paid for out of the produce of the crop.</P>

      <P>The arrangement to which the Deputy refers is rendered possible because beet growers sell their crops directly to the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company under contract.  It would not be practicable to make a similar arrangement in regard to wheat seed, as growers are free to sell their crops to any one of a number of millers and licensed dealers.

There is plenty of oats being sold in the local markets at 20/- to 23/- a cwt., but there is no oats going into the oatmeal millers, because no persons who own oats will take the Minister's fixed price, with the result that oatmeal urgently needed by country people to compensate them for the shortage of flour is being fed to hens and live stock, and these people cannot get oatmeal.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the existing emergency, pig production can be maintained only where the producer has himself grown the bulk, if not all, of the foods required for that purpose, or where swill or similar material which would otherwise go to waste is available.  The present <Col N="2064" /> prices fixed for bacon pigs are regarded as adequate to enable production in such circumstances to continue and I am not prepared to take steps to have them revised.  Feeding stuffs which can be utilised directly for human consumption should not be used for feeding pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What justification does the Minister offer for the reduction in the price of bacon pigs at the time when that reduction was made, and will he say if he desires that people should cease feeding pigs, or if he wants them to continue doing so, because many people believe that his approval of that reduction is an indication of the Government's desire to kill off the pig population?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, then, was the price 6/- higher three weeks ago? Does the Minister contend that the cost of production has gone down recently?  Does he realise that, far from going down, the trend of the cost of production is to go up, and how then does he justify a reduction of 6/- per cwt. in the course of the last few weeks?  If a price of 112/- per cwt. was just three weeks ago, how is the price of 106/- just now?  The truth of it is that the bacon curers were not making enough money and they wanted the Minister's help in making more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

As the Deputy is aware, however, provision has been made, by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1941, whereby time-expired regular soldiers, in common with other classes, may receive unemployment benefit in respect of contributions paid by them prior to their service in the Defence Forces. Having regard to that provision and to the fact that unemployed persons <Col N="2071" /> who are not qualified to receive unemployment benefit, have available for them a scheme of unemployment assistance, it is not proposed to recommend legislation of the nature to which the Deputy now refers.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware of the fact that practically all the long-service soldiers will on discharge from the Army have no credits in stamps upon which they can draw?  In view of that, will he consider at this stage making some financial provision to ensure that in such cases of discharge there will be adequate provision for the payment of unemployment insurance benefit on the assumption of the possibility of long-continued unemployment?</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, in accordance with the notice I gave you I should like to ask your permission to move a motion for the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order No. 27 on a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the suffering caused particularly amongst the poorer classes of the population by the shortage of bread supplies or their inequitable distribution under the restrictions imposed from the 23rd February.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I endeavoured to get an arrangement with the Minister for Supplies, through the Whip, so that the matter would be taken early.  In the course of supplementary answers, dealing with some of these matters to-day, the Minister intimated that he did not see any necessity for taking this discussion before 8 o'clock to-night.  I would ask the Minister to realise that this question of the rationing of bread is a difficult matter, and that he wants the co-operation of everyone in the country in connection with it.  Therefore, I think he must also realise that the proposals and action required in the matter are certainly, to say the least of it, not thoroughly understood.  There are two things necessary, first, that we here and the country&mdash;both from the Minister and through ourselves&mdash;would understand what is required; and, in the second place, that he would understand from the various parts of the House here&mdash;and every part of the country, from Donegal and Kerry up to Dublin is affected&mdash;what the situation in the country has been during the past week or ten days, as a result of the suddenness and the lack of plan and instructions that would help people to restrict the use of bread supplies in a reasonable kind of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest now that, by leaving the opening of this discussion until 8 o'clock to-night, while we will have an opportunity to hear him, he will have no opportunity to hear what has happened in the country.  It is very necessary that he should understand that.  It is necessary to try to fix responsibility somewhere or other for the failure that has taken place in this <Col N="2083" /> case, so that it may be remedied all the quicker and so that occasions of a similar nature may be avoided in future.</P>

      <P>I understand the House desires to learn what the present position is and the prospects in relation to turf and native fuel for next year.  The position at the present moment, as everybody knows, is much easier than any of us anticipated. I think the most optimistic of us last year certainly did not look forward to this period of this year as one in which the position would be in the matter of fuel as comfortable&mdash;I am using that phrase in its common meaning&mdash;as apparently it is at the moment. There is no excessive demand for the fuel which exists and, broadly speaking, there is a feeling of calm in relation to the matter.  I do not know whether I am responsible or whether <Col N="2091" /> some physical evidence of the existence of stocks has had that particular effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The country is divided, as you know, into a turf and a non-turf area.  The turf area covers some 83 per cent. of the total area at present and over two-thirds of the population. Inside that area at the present moment, apart from little pockets of difficulty which may exist, there is apparently no real fuel problem and no degree of anxiety and, with the experience which we had last year, with the new bog faces that were created in the main turf areas last year and with the organisation which was then created, there ought to be no cause of anxiety in relation to fuel in the turf areas next year if the turf areas themselves set about doing their job.  The first thing I would say is that the turf areas themselves must recognise that there will, in all human probability, be no coal of measurable quantity going into them next year, and that it is their business now, in their own interests, to get busy on producing turf.  There are a few areas which are on the border line, Limerick and Cork and a couple of others, which will require to give the maximum of their own effort if they are to be in as comfortable a position next year as they are now. That depends entirely on themselves. I am speaking now of those areas which can be expected to be self-dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the non-turf areas and its peculiar ease at the moment requires some examination and some explanation lest we might reason from the present ease of the position into any degree of complacency in relation to the future.  The explanation of the position is to be found in the statistics of coal import for the last six years.  The average coal import for <Col N="2092" /> the years 1936, 1937, and 1938 was 2,500,000 tons.  The import for the two years 1939 and 1940, the two first emergency years, averages 2,880,000 tons, giving in those two first emergency years a gross excess over the average normal consumption of some 760,000 tons.  The import in 1941 was 1,640,000 tons, but, if you add that to the excess obtained in the two previous years, and there is no evidence that there was increased consumption in those years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would only stay quiet.  He will be complaining later on that I have taken too long, and he is interrupting me already. The position at the present time is relatively easy because there was in the country for use last year an amount of fuel equal to the normal or very nearly equal to the normal.  If you put against the very definite deterioration in quality the fact that there was a very definite increase in economy, and if you balance those two against each other, it would seem that the position at the present moment might easily be that there was a cellarage or stock in the country not very different from a normal year.  In addition to that, if you come to consider <Col N="2093" /> the position in the non-turf areas, you can remember that out of the normal consumption of 2,500,000 tons something like&mdash;it is a very conservative figure; I think it should be higher &mdash;500,000 tons would have gone to the turf areas, which last year did not go. The result is that the whole fuel position last year, taking into account the accumulated stocks of the two first emergency years, the economy and all the rest, was as I have stated.  The position in the turf areas would be represented by the loss probably of upwards of 500,000 tons of coal, the equivalent of 1,000,000 tons of turf, and an extra production in the turf areas of, roughly speaking, 1,500,000 tons of turf.  Against that, in the turf areas themselves they began the year with the accumulations in their own cellars of the excess of the two first emergency years, and to that extent their position also was relatively comfortable.  I should say the position in the turf areas at the present moment is that there have been heavy inroads upon the domestic stocks of imported fuel, but, if the turf areas now take time by the forelock and produce all the turf they can, they will be in a position of comfort for next year. The position in relation to 1942, however, is very much less encouraging. The deficit of last year, on the 1941 figures, of 860,000 tons, is equivalent to 1,750,000 tons of turf, and there is no reason to anticipate that the import position of fuel next year will be as good as it was last year.  All the indications are to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1942.  All the indications are that the deterioration which began in last year, which got worse as you know as the year went on, and which is now showing signs of becoming critical, may mean that the figure of 1,600,000 tons which we imported last year may be very greatly diminished, and that, in order to make up a normal supply for the country, much more than 1,750,000 tons of extra turf would require to be cut.  The stock position at the present time is that there are <Col N="2094" /> something like 220,000 tons of national turf in store.  I will only give you round figures.  Dublin has 164,000 tons; Cork has 20,000 tons; Limerick has 5,500 tons; Waterford has 8,000 tons; Wexford has 5,000 tons; Drogheda has 6,000 tons; and Dundalk has 10,700 tons, giving a total of, roughly speaking, 220,000 tons.  In addition to that, there are in national stocks some 58,000 tons of wood, making a total national stock of native fuel in the non-turf areas, held at the disposal of the Minister for Supplies for ration distribution, of roughly speaking 278,000 tons.  While those are very considerable figures, they are not given for the purpose of their size. They are inadequate figures from the point of view of the iron ration that will be required next year.  They are put forward, first, so that the House will have a basic figure to work from, and secondly, so that they will know the length of the road and the hardness of the road that we still have to travel if we are to have the position right by next year.  If, next year, at this time, there was twice that amount in stock, it would be very good, and, if there were three or four times that amount in stock, it would be very well.</P>
      <P>I am mentally budgeting on the basis that we will have to calculate that at least one whole year of imported fuel may be absent and that it is our business to get as rapidly as we can, by any means we can, into national dumps in the non-turf areas, an iron ration of six months' supply.  If we have that, then we have time to look around to make provision in case of other emergency and a good many of the difficulties we have now in regard to the segregation of areas might be removed.  But the main thing is that an iron ration of something to that extent should be got into being and if, at the end of the emergency, we were to find ourselves with the whole of that iron ration unliquidated, on our hands. I think the national security that would come over the period through the having of it in our possession would be well worth the cost to the State of any loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best of the fuel position is <Col N="2095" /> behind us.  Whether the worst that is in front of us will be a very serious worst, or something which can be met, depends on whether we can make available for the purpose of transport this year the maximum amount of transport that can be got and whether we can make the maximum use of that transport.  It is a transport problem mainly.  Instructions have already been given to all the county surveyors and their organisations in relation to the production for 1942, with the exception, I think of two counties which happen to be in a special position. Their instructions are, first of all, that they are to co-operate in the production of everything that is required for their own counties.  That specially applies to counties which are on the border-line of being barely able to produce what is required for themselves and which, to the extent to which they default, must be a load upon the common pool.  Thereafter their instructions are to produce the absolute maximum of turf in areas from which it can be transported.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of cases of good turf-producing areas from which, in the light of our experience this year, we do not think that we could transport their possible production, because of difficulties in relation to main rail transport and the very great probability of a restriction in the ancillary transport which has been necessary, road transport to originating railheads.  Last year, as you know, we moved about 900,000 tons of turf with a maximum of about 2,300 lorries and a petrol consumption of about 700,000 gallons inside the turf areas.  It is very doubtful whether that amount of petrol, and the tyres that go with it, will be available for that internal transport in the turf areas next year, and it is absolutely necessary from this moment until the end of the emergency that the most efficient and economical use and administration shall be made of all such road transport, whether it is for distribution inside the turf areas or ancillary to rail transport out of the turf areas into the other districts.  Every care is being taken now for the purpose of seeing that that is done. <Col N="2096" /> In counties such as Mayo and Galway, where there are good labour supplies, in certain areas where we cannot for transport reasons this year look for the maximum production of turf, efforts are being made to get accomplished turf-cutters to transfer their work to those portions of the county from which we can transfer the turf, and in addition, as you know, we are beginning to organise a migration from the western counties to the midland bogs for the purpose of production. That will mainly take place into one area at the moment, Kildare, where there are some ten camps, each maintaining somewhere about 250 men, and where four or five barracks, houses and buildings of that kind are being converted for the purpose.  Somewhere about £120,000 is being spent in merely preliminary accommodation for the purpose of transferring some 3,000 men.</P>
    <P>It is worth while for Deputies to get that figure in mind, because we talk lightly sometimes of the setting up camps here and there in order to deal with emergency problems of that kind. We have found that the setting up of these camps presented a very difficult problem in relation to materials and everything else, and the idea that any large and sudden improvisation can be made along those lines definitely is not founded on fact.  This year we are making a beginning with a big experiment, and out of the knowledge and experience we will get of dealing with the problems which it creates we will be able to get valuable guidance for next year.  The intention is to do two or three times as much next year.</P>
    <P>In some ways the experiment on the midland bogs is not turning out as satisfactorily as we might have hoped. The problem of the midland bogs is a problem of shortage&mdash;first, a shortage of labour; secondly, a shortage of existing face banks, and thirdly, there are large virgin bogs of deep turf which are undrained, in which drainage almost of an arterial character has to be made in order that large production can take place.</P>
    <P>We actually did envisage, at one stage, only this year, using those 3,000 men, on the camps which have been <Col N="2097" /> created, purely and simply for preparatory work.  There is so high a proportion of preparatory work in the way of roads and drainage and in the way of creating new opportunities to produce turf that the proportion of actual turf, relative to the amount of labour employed, that is going to come out will be small.  The total output from the Kildare bogs this year is not going to be large, and it is definitely going to be costly, but it was one of those stages through which we had to go, and having regard to the fact that I think we must envisage 1943 and 1944, at least, as years in which this problem of the production of a minimum ration of fuel is going to be growing more and more difficult and more and more imperative in its necessity, that experiment had to be made in this year and next year will have to be carried on also.</P>
    <P>The transport problem was one, as far as the gross carriage of turf is concerned, which was practically new, and the capacity of the existing transport to carry has proved to be lower than, I think, ordinarily speaking, we had envisaged.  The main conclusions that we have drawn from our experience this year are these: (1) that any major contribution to the fuel problem of a particular year must be made out of the turf which had been cut in a previous year.  It is not possible to transport, over our existing railway system, and having regard to the time at which turf begins to be mature, out of its own harvest any very much larger quantity than we have dealt with this year, unless we are prepared to run at an absolutely full pace right through the wheat and the beet season. I know that that is the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what happened last year, and I hope it will not happen this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we will take up that later.  If we were starting this year, as we did last year, with nothing but the turf which was produced in that year, in my opinion, practically no increase could have been obtained in the total amount which was transported into the non-turf areas except by the invasion, the complete invasion, <Col N="2098" /> of what is now recognised as the beet season.  In addition to that, there has been thrown up this other awkward fact, very specially in relation to turf cut in virgin bogs or in light or mountain bogs, that there is a period of the year in which turf cannot be transported over long distances from the West and put into the non-turf areas in condition for use on arrival.  We have had consignments of turf coming through from the West which, when it arrived here, was definitely wet, definitely not in a condition to be offered to the consumers, and yet we have checked that turf up at the point of dispatch when it was dry, good turf on the bog.</P>
      <P>Once that turf is broken into in the West of Ireland, by the time it has been put into wagons and lorries and transported here, it is subjected to the rain and comes here in very bad condition. People living here in the City of Dublin, with its rainfall which, in the winter, is relatively not much greater than it is in the summer, have no conception of what happens when the heavens open out in the West and from 16 to 18 inches of rain may fall in a month, and most of it in a few days.</P>
      <P>In other words, the lessons we have learned from the transport this year are (1) that there is a limitation to the amount which can be carried; (2) that if you are going to have a large gross quantity you must accumulate it from the previous year and carry it in the months of March, April, May, June and July, before the next harvest is available; (3) that if you attempt to carry the gross quantity of your present harvest you must sacrifice your beet season; and (4) that there is a period, roughly speaking, the end of October and the months of November, December and January, in which, unless you are dealing with hard dry turf, which you can leave out anywhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You do, there is plenty of it, but it will not be all hard, dry turf, and unless you get that it cannot be transported.  However, a new technique <Col N="2099" /> is being developed to the extent of trying to segregate turf of the previous year and hard, dry turf of its own year, plus wood, for transport during those doubtful months.  What you have to remember is that the transport has to be all the year round, and the result depends upon seeing that every day in the whole of that year round all the transport that is at your disposal is in fact occupied by something, and that may mean that you will have to transport some turf before it is in proper condition.  It is more necessary to use up fully your transport by seeing that it is occupied than to make sure that all the turf which you transport has in fact been dried completely.  For that reason, new technical arrangements are being made to see to what extent we can dry the turf in the dumps.  As you know, the position in relation to a place like Dublin, where you have not got the wind or anything of that kind which is so much more helpful than the temperature in drying, is difficult, but as a result of some experiments made by a young engineer in Galway, one of the assistant county surveyors, this year, a new method of ricking is being tried in the hope that we may be able to take turf in whatever condition it comes, and put it into the ricks with a reasonable confidence that when we take it out it will be in good order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is what we are trying to avoid.  As you know, the turf at present is being ricked in huge ricks, and it was never put in these huge ricks before, but that has to be, having regard to the storage space that we have.  Those of you who have seen the storage space down at the Refinery site and down at the North Wall know that we have occupied practically everything that can be occupied.  For that reason we have to rick it in the way in we wish, and inquiries are being made as to the technical results of what is going on inside those ricks.  The next question I should like to deal with is <Col N="2100" /> the question of quality.  At the present moment, as I told the House, there is no reason whatever why any consumer in Dublin should be given by a fuel merchant other than good merchantable turf.</P>

We were in a position, in relation to a merchant who had refused to replace bad turf, to insist upon his doing it, and we were in a position to follow up that complaint by way of the merchant's yard to see what he was doing with the turf, and found that the statement that I made here in general was true in relation to his case&mdash;that there was no necessity why any one of his customers, any more than anybody else's customers, should be receiving unmerchantable or bad turf.

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very doubtful. Remember, this year, when we were bringing in turf to the utmost, there was no great demand for it.  In a year in which we are bringing in turf, in which the demand may be equal to the maximum supply, the turf which will go out may have to be turf which we take off rail and which we may have to transport to Dublin during the months and under the conditions in which only turf in inferior condition can be delivered.  But, to the extent to which it is possible by watching and <Col N="2102" /> guarding it, in the way in which we are now doing, we will try to see that the position which I have already declared, that there is no necessity for any consumer in Dublin to receive other than good merchantable turf, will be maintained.</P>

      <P>There may be bad turf in Dublin, but there is no bad turf being delivered to the merchants' yards. There is no merchant's yard in which there is not good turf to be delivered.</P>
      <P>But there have been merchants whose disregard for the quality of the turf which they sent out, whose disregard for the care that ought to have been taken in relation to that difficult commodity, did not show any great consideration for their customers, or any great desire for the permanent existence of a new trade in a national fuel which we are trying to build up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Give them to me; I am hungry for them.  The one man who did it managed to do a lot of good work.  I am asking for some more of it.  The segregation of the turf and non-turf areas, which gave certain difficulty to people last year, unfortunately must remain.  Every facility will be given to everybody to cut turf which will have the result of increasing the national pool and which will have the effect of bringing more economic turf into the non-turf areas. But it does not follow that everybody who goes into a turf area from a non-turf area for that purpose has any such intention, or even that his very best efforts would have that result.  This 160,000 tons of turf which has been accumulated in the City of Dublin for the Minister for Supplies has been brought from all sorts of places, in all sorts of conditions, at all sorts of costs.  Some of it has been carried 120 miles by road; some of it has cost one and a half times as much to bring from the bog to the railhead as it cost to produce, and there is no way out of it.  If you want a gross million tons, <Col N="2103" /> we have to take it where we can get it, in whatever circumstances are imposed by its geographical distribution and the distribution of the labour to handle it.  It is exactly the same in relation to the quality.  If we want 1,000,000 tons of good, hard, dry, black turf, we can get it over a very long period at a very high cost and by cutting a great deal more than a gross million tons of turf.  The 200,000 tons of turf that we cut on the new 1,500 miles of bog faces in Donegal last year was not all good, hard, black turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was good turf enough. That is the silly sort of remark that Deputy Davin would make.  That is an utterly irresponsible remark to make. It was as good as could be got under the circumstances.  It was mountainy turf out of shallow bogs.  Again, when I am speaking of the quality, if anybody wants 1,000,000 tons of good, hard, dry, black turf delivered in the City of Dublin in the coming year, he cannot get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no machinery to produce it, and there is nothing with which to transport that amount from the places at which it can be got.  You and I have got to take the best average turf from wherever we can get it.  My sole business is to see that we produce and transport, on a quantity basis, the best-quality turf available under these circumstances. You can see the position of an individual who goes into a county like Galway or Mayo, who buys the turf nearest to the railway, who selects the best turf in areas where there are plenty of skilled men and who goes to the districts where the charges between place of production and railhead may be negligible.  It is possible to buy parcels of turf under those conditions at prices at which one is able to undersell the Minister for Supplies, who has to take into his pool not merely the 14/- a-ton-on-the-side-of-the-road turf in Mayo, with direct rail, but turf carried by road 120 miles in order to make up for the lack of rail transport during the beet period <Col N="2104" /> of last year.  These people can buy the turf more cheaply and they are in a position, if they like, to drive up the price, the effect of which is to drive up the national price as well.  There is no limit to the price to which national necessity can be driven if individuals can go out, as they did in the early part of last year, and drive up the price at the bog of particular consignments of turf.  It is for that reason that the arrangement made last year is being maintained.  We want to facilitate everybody to any extent possible in producing, but we do want to be satisfied (1) that it is going to produce a total increase in the amount of turf, and (2) that it is going to enable the transport to carry a larger amount of turf.</P>
    <P>So far as labour and production charges are concerned, the intention is that the arrangements of last year, which, on the whole, worked very satisfactorily, will remain and that local custom and habit will continue.  We shall continue to work on piece rates, time rates and contract rates&mdash;whichever may be the most suitable.  Personally, I should like to see a larger proportion of the total cost going to the original producer and, especially, to the person who is trying to produce cheap turf in the remote districts.  I hope that some arrangement of that kind can be made.  I should be glad to see it.</P>
    <P>The amount of charges thrown on by the time one gets through to the dump is, certainly, discouraging.  We have, during the past year, set up what I think is a very efficient transport organisation.  It is being carried on under the control of the chief engineer of the Board of Works who, very fortunately for us, had a background of knowledge of railway and transport work.  We have now a department dealing with the coordinated road, rail and canal transport which is highly competent and to which the very big problem of transport this year can be safely committed. If, in fact, the result next year be not as satisfactory as we hope, I am quite sure it will not be due to any lack of competent control and prevision in relation to what is the critical problem&mdash; the problem of transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> As regards the conditions under which county councils will cut turf, so far as they are cutting for their own uses, they are working for themselves and it is their business to be as energetic and economical as possible.  So long as the same principle applies&mdash;as, I think, it did apply last year, greatly to the credit of that great organisation of engineers, who used their best efforts towards the economic and efficient production of turf for export&mdash;we shall stand over all the turf they do produce for export.  Even to the extent to which turf is produced for export and cannot be moved in a particular year, we shall stand over it, because we shall want it for the next year.  Each of the county surveyors has definite instructions as to what to cut and, to some extent, where to cut.  Their business is to cut the largest quantity of the best quality of the most transportable turf they can manage.  So long as they do that, the county councils financing them can have a complete sense of security that the cost in relation to the work will be met by those for whom they are producing the turf.</P>
    <P>Quite briefly, then, I am asking the turf areas&mdash;which I hope to see extended next year&mdash;to make absolutely sure that no one of them or any part of them is going to be a burden upon the very exiguous pool of national fuel and imported fuel that will be available. I am asking the county surveyors and the private producers in those areas, in addition, to cut as much good and exportable turf as they can manage.  We bought tens of thousands of tons of turf from the private producers last year.  We shall be quite willing to buy tens of thousands of tons from the private producers this year.</P>
    <P>We are looking for all the turf we can get in the inner belt around Dublin &mdash;Kildare, which last year did not produce the turf which it required itself, Roscommon, Leix-Offaly and Meath, etc.  We want both from the private producers and the local authority producers as much good turf as they can put in a position for us to take away. We, on our side, will get from the Department of Industry and Commerce, whose business it is to control this matter, as much transport as they <Col N="2106" /> can spare from other national purposes. We shall use that transport as efficiently and continuously as we can.  If that is done, if there is rigid economy now in the use of stocks and if there is complete and efficient organisation in respect of such fuel as may be created in the interval, then, while I see no ground for optimism, I hope we may get through next winter without running into any very serious condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of turf is not the business of the turf controller. The arrangement at present is that the turf controller is responsible for the production of turf and its transport into and ricking in the national dumps.  His business is to buy it as cheaply as possible and transport it as cheaply as possible.  The price at which it is sold to the consumer in the non-turf areas is a matter for the Minister for Supplies.  In the turf areas, price is a matter for the turf controller.  The line on which we have gone is that we should try to have produced that quantity of turf in those areas which, with wide distribution of production, would enable demand and supply reasonably to regulate the price.  On the whole, I think that, in the turf areas, that has been done. There were places where people got away with a bit more than they ought but that has not taken place to that large extent which would require machinery to deal with it.  The machinery which would be set up to deal with it might easily cause greater complications.  So far as the turf areas are concerned, the price is to be regulated by trying to make production equal demand and, in the non-turf areas, it is a matter for the Minister for Supplies.</P>

      <P>In some of the districts which the Parliamentary Secretary visited last year turf was being cut by the Cork County Council and by the Army.  Much of that turf is still in the bogs.  In the opinion of people who have been cutting turf all their lives, there was defective ricking.  They made the ricks too big and too wide. In those places considerations of space would not apply.  In the higher places, the people of experience believe that the turf will have to be spread out entirely and redried.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary take steps to prevent what has happened in Cork happening elsewhere?  The Army cut their turf at Donaghmore and they <Col N="2109" /> were looking for turf to supply the barracks around the area.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary see that, when bodies like the Department of Defence and the county councils cut turf, their turf will be at least of as good quality as the Army and the county council expect to get from the ordinary producer? The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that he would like to see the producer getting something more than he got last year, so far as price was concerned.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider a suggestion from me that the method of purchasing turf by weight might be discontinued? I maintain that that has led to roguery.  A man who has to carry turf by weight is paid so much per ton.  I have seen one case myself in which a lorry owner was paid in that way and he would not bring dry turf off the bog.  He brought wet turf because he was paid so much per ton. I think we might revert to the old system by which turf was bought by the box.  In that way the turf could be graded.  You would have &ldquo;spadagh&rdquo;, brown turf and black turf.  As long as you are buying turf and transporting it by weight, you are only encouraging roguery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They do cut it away. Once it is cut away you come to the turf.  When that turf is dried to the same moisture content, the heating value per ton of turf is practically the same, whether you get the light stuff or the heavy stuff.  There is no measurement which is closer if you can get dry turf.  If you could get the turf down to a reasonable moisture content, the weighing basis of buying is a perfectly sound one.  Hard turf, however, will not absorb water once it is dry, but light turf will very easily absorb it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he could give the House any information regarding turf briquettes?  Are any being produced now, or are any steps being taken to re-open production?  If he is in a position to say very roughly the quantity or weight which he hopes to have produced this year, I should like to hear him, because I think a great deal of the objections to turf which we hear, particularly in the city, would be removed if these briquettes could be produced.  I should also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary who is responsible for having turf ricked in the South of Ireland in a manner which leaves the ricks four feet wide at the top.  What madman is responsible for that, seeing that every drop of rain that will fall will go right down through these ricks of turf?  I have asked numerous people <Col N="2112" /> throughout the South of Ireland who issued the instruction or who was responsible for it and, so far, I have been unable to get an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No; you must have a certain angle in the sods in order to maintain stability because whatever the condition may be when you sod up the rick, when it dries inside, the rick tends to come down so the Deputy's proposition or <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> does not follow at all.  Deputy Linehan referred to a bog with which I am familiar.  That is very difficult bog; it is a high bog and one in which the drying factor is as low as any in the country.  I have very little hope of cutting two crops of turf on that bog at any time.  In other words, the position is that, in all human probability, you will have to cut turf and leave it on the bog for the next year. I think there is something in what the Deputy has said, that having regard to the fact that only a very small proportion of the total turf can be put into use in the year in which it is cut, special arrangements should be made in regard to the ricking of it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say something in reference to my question about turf briquettes.  I think some further information is also called for about the clamping of turf in the way I have described. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that as a result of the ricks being built in that way the turf is <Col N="2113" /> crumbling into dust?  In certain districts the sides of these clamps have been bulging out and breaking down and men are kept going trying to remake them.  In some districts 50 per cent. of the turf cannot be got out of these particular clamps.</P>

If he will give the identification of them, I will have them examined and I will know a great deal more about them than the mere statement that they are four feet on the top.  In relation to the Deputy's question about briquettes, there must be about 10,000 tons of briquettes here in the City of Dublin.  They are being produced at present at the rate of about 400 tons per week and being transported here. In my opinion, they are a very valuable and suitable fuel, and a fuel which I should like to see reserved for emergency purposes.  They are very adaptable from the point of view of small rationing in an emergency and I should rather like to see that fuel kept for&mdash;if I may use the term&mdash;the poorer people in case of emergency, when I think they would be very suitable.  That is what we have in view.  They are uniform in quality and uniform in size, and I could quite see a position in which they might be the currency of a district.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable controversy in relation to the town of Youghal which we may regard as typical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the whole of East Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I have dealt with the town of Youghal, the Deputy will understand who is responsible and what amount of care and attention is given to the investigation of such a question.  That is the information he wants.  The only serious argument put forward in the memorial in respect of the proposal to exclude Youghal from the scheduled area is based on the fact that Youghal is relatively remote from turf-producing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In present circumstances, however, the absence of a developed bog area in the immediate vicinity cannot be regarded as a decisive argument against the inclusion of any given centre in the scheduled area.  The real criterion in this respect should lie in the existence or otherwise of surplus stocks of turf in the area generally, in sufficient quantity to provide the fuel requirements of the centre in question and located sufficiently near at hand to allow distribution and delivery to consumers at a reasonable cost.  The above conditions may fairly be regarded as applying to Youghal, which is no more unfavourably situated in this respect <Col N="2116" /> than many other parts of the present scheduled areas, namely, Carlow, and East Limerick.</P>
    <P>The total stocks in the hands of the county surveyors and private producers in County Kerry and County Cork are likely to be adequate to produce the full requirements of these counties over the balance of the season on a most liberal basis.  The railway position has improved to a degree which makes possible relatively rapid distribution of these stocks on a scale sufficient to meet any demand likely to develop in Youghal or elsewhere in County Cork.  Turf may be procured from a variety of sources and in considerable supply at present at a price not exceeding 46/- per ton, f.o.r. Youghal, and this price is likely to remain relatively steady throughout the season.  Ever since the inclusion of County Cork in the scheduled area, we have been in close touch with the position in Youghal, with a view to detecting and remedying any problems of supply which might arise.  At no time has there been evidence of shortage. We have established contacts on behalf of the coal merchants with reliable suppliers and stocks in the merchants' yards are always sufficient to meet requirements. No difficulty in replenishing these stocks need be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The latest return of prices shows that turf is being retailed at 65/- per ton, or 3/3 per cwt.  The margin of 19/- per ton between the rail and free on rail prices is considerably excessive, and this matter is being taken up with the merchants with a view to securing a reduction.  It is significant that the Youghal Urban Council, which is responsible for the drafting of the present memorial, were invited, on 23rd January, to purchase from the Cork County Surveyor such quantity of turf as might be considered necessary to establish an emergency reserve for use in the town.  This proposal was discussed verbally with the town clerk on 29th January and repeated by letter on 16th February, but has elicited no interest or response of any kind.  Should the urban council, or the other voluntary bodies mentioned in the memorial, wish to obtain supplies of turf for free distribution to the poor, no difficulty need be experienced in procuring such <Col N="2117" /> supply.  We will give every assistance in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim that that statement is altogether apart from the answer to my question.  I asked on what grounds was East Cork made a turf area.  In relation to turf distribution, a portion of East Cork was entirely relieved from the operation of the Turf Order.  I refer to the Liberties of Cork City which the Minister had no hesitation in relieving. The position in Youghal and East Cork is that we have substantial quantities of coal which nobody is allowed to buy. We have the advantage, as a port, of being very near to, and having long-established connections with, the other side, and we have better facilities for getting in supplies of coal than almost any other place in the country.  I claim that the Parliamentary Secretary is denying the whole State the advantage of that position, because merchants with coal on their hands which they are unable to sell are not inclined to import, so that the effect of the Order in East Cork is to destroy the possibility of getting coal from outside.  We, in East Cork, are farther away from the turf areas than the areas he has relieved from the operation of the Turf Order and any turf coming into East Cork must come through those areas.  I am not confining myself to Youghal because we produce no turf there.  In fact, any turf we get comes to us through the City of Cork and other areas that the Parliamentary Secretary has exempted from the Turf Order.  In East Cork we have greater facilities for getting in coal than any other area.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought to consider that seriously. There is no justification whatever, on the merits of the situation, for making our area a turf area.</P>

There is no evidence that, at the moment, any portion of any turf area, including East Cork, is short of turf.  Deputy Broderick need have no fear but that we will be able to find good use for all the coal that can come into Youghal.</P>

We are putting the Deputy in a position in which he can get fuel, but his attitude is that he wants a particular kind of fuel.  He is not entitled to that.  I welcome the interruption of Deputy Broderick because it enables me to ask this question: Is there any other turf area which we have created which is in a position to say that it is suffering hardship? If there is any particular area included in a turf area that finds it is not getting its due and is suffering hardship, then let me have the particulars in writing.  If that is done, the same kind of examination will be made in relation to it as was made in relation to Youghal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>One is glad to see that, in this Supplementary Estimate, the Department of Forestry is looking for an additional £15,000 for the acquisition of land, and one can only hope that, at long last, there is to be some little advance in this matter. There is hardly a Deputy in this House who does not know that land is being offered&mdash;almost pitched at the heads of the Forestry Department&mdash;<Col N="2123" /> over a number of years, extensive areas of land, eminently suitable for planting and for nothing else; and, for some extraordinary reason, the Forestry Department has refused to accept that land, even when it is given with the fullest goodwill of all parties concerned or having any claim to the land, and given, if not for nothing, for practically nothing.  Therefore, I hope that this request for an additional sum denotes a departure from the old happy-go-lucky system of acquiring a piece now and again.</P>
      <P>The main matter to which I wish to draw attention in this Supplementary Estimate is that of the wire fencing or wire netting.  We are told that the operations of this Department have been hampered very greatly through the fact that they had not sufficient supplies of wire netting.  We are told further that, up to the present, 6,000 rolls of netting and 50,000 tons of barbed wire have been ordered from factories in the United States.  Only a portion&mdash;we are not told how much &mdash;has so far reached this country but, under the contract terms, payment is due on the dispatch of the goods from the factory.  One can understand and appreciate certain Departments of State&mdash;particularly the Department of Supplies&mdash;being, so to speak, &ldquo;caught out&rdquo; by this war.  Those Departments are responsible for the importation of a great variety of articles but, so far as I know, the only article in connection with their operations which this Department has to import is wire. Certainly, it is one of the principal articles, and I cannot understand why a little foresight could not have been exercised and a greater supply&mdash;even if not sufficient&mdash;obtained in advance.</P>
      <P>I think I referred briefly to this matter last year&mdash;either on the main Estimate or on some Supplementary Estimate&mdash;and I queried the Minister about it.  My recollection is that he told me that it was ordered some time last year.  Apparently, the Minister did not waken up to the fact that he was short of wire, an essential commodity in the activities of the Forestry Department, until the war had been going on for at least a year and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> The position the Department then found themselves in compelled them to place contracts in America, under the terms of which payment was due on the dispatch of the goods from the factory.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters in connection with this forestry work to which I would like to refer, but this is the main matter and one regarding which I want to get an answer now, so I propose not to say anything about the other matters until the main Estimate comes before the House.  I think the House is entitled to a very full explanation as to the position the Department found themselves in regarding wire netting and barbed wire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item which requires a little explanation, that is, the scheme by which the Department produced 100,000 tons of firewood which would go to Fuel Importers, Limited.  The Minister's statement says that that amount is now reduced to 88,000 tons and that the cost of felling this timber and transporting it to the station was a total of £72,000.  That is almost 19/- a ton, which would be a very high price if that timber is transported to the station in the ordinary way that timber is sent in bulk.  The Department's job is only to fell the timber, strip it and cut it into four-foot or six-foot lengths for transport.  If that is all the Department does, that cost of almost £1 per ton is entirely excessive.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly aware that people handling timber in the country districts, with sawmills of their own, are able to cut it into nine-inch blocks and sell it at a price not very much more than that.  I would like to know if the Department's timber is cut into four-foot or six-foot lengths, as if it is in those big lengths, the cost is entirely too high.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I want to put this point to the Minister: There is at the present time a very acute shortage <Col N="2125" /> of fuel in a wide variety of districts in the country and a number of charitable people are anxious to facilitate those who are short of fuel in cutting trees for conversion into timber for burning, much on the same lines as the Department themselves are trying to do in collaboration with Fuel Importers, but what happens is that where persons are anxious to give the necessary permission to their neighbours to come and cut trees which, in their judgement, may properly be removed from the woods on their premises, they are informed that they must apply to the Department of Lands for permission to do that.  That is reasonable enough; I do not complain of that; but when they apply they get a form that has to be filled up asking them by what title they hold the land, on what estate the land is situate; whether annuities are being paid upon it, and what proposals they have for planting to replace the trees removed; with the result that many well intentioned persons, contemplating the prospect of a protracted correspondence with the Department and generally getting entangled with the Department, simply say: &ldquo;We had better drop the whole business; I do not want to be saddled with an interminable correspondence which may end up God knows where.  The simple way is to let nobody cut a tree.&rdquo;  I suggest that, in the exceptional emergency in which we find ourselves, where a person writes to the Department for permission to cut trees for the convenience of his neighbours, an inspector, or Gárda sergeant should go to the premises and, if the proposal is a modest one for the cutting down of a dozen or two dozen trees, the trees should be marked and the land owner told: &ldquo;If you do not go beyond that, there is no necessity to go through the customary formalities involved in getting permission to cut trees.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the administrative difficulties would be insuperable, but if the Minister feels it is absolutely necessary for an inspector of his own Department to attend in such cases, I would put it to him that all the usual, normal questionnaires should <Col N="2126" /> be suspended and that nothing more should be done than that an inspector would go to the premises and say: &ldquo;How many trees do you want marked for cutting down and conversion into firing?&rdquo;, and if he is satisfied that the trees which it is proposed to cut down&mdash;and they are very commonly ash trees&mdash;are not going to make any material difference to the afforestation of this country, I suggest that a simplified procedure should be adopted&mdash;the trees marked by the inspector and the proprietor of the premises told to go and cut away.</P>
    <P>We are now at the end of this winter, but Departments move slowly and I am thinking of next winter when our problems will be as big, if not greater than they are now.  I suggest that between now and next autumn the Minister should work out the simplified procedure which I suggest and, in answer to any further application, propose to the applicant that this simplified procedure should be followed and warn him that while this simplified procedure is made available in this time of crisis, it must not be regarded as a precedent to be followed when the present emergency is passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has estimated the amount of the emergency fuel, that is timber cut for fuel purposes, at £75,000 up to the end of the financial year.  Could the Minister tell us what is the estimated amount of sales up to the end of the year or what is the amount up to the present time of standing timber?  Will the Minister tell us what is his procedure with regard to standing timber at the present time?  Has the fixing of prices in respect of fuel and timber introduced a fixed price which the Department charges to persons who buy standing timber?  Could the Minister say how that price is arrived at, what it is and whether the standing timber is now offered for competitive tenders? If there is a fixed price, how does he manage to allot standing timber to various applicants for different supplies of standing timber?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister given further consideration <Col N="2127" /> to the question of transplants that was raised recently by way of Parliamentary Question?  The Minister will remember that he was asked whether there was a surplus of transplants this year and, if so, whether it was proposed to destroy them in the way in which they were destroyed last year.  In reaction to his answer at that time, the Minister ascertained from various sides of the House that it was regarded as a shocking thing that these young trees would be destroyed, apparently at the suggestion of a section of the nurserymen.  Again I would ask the Minister if he has reconsidered the matter, whether he will say that this destruction will not take place; whether they are available to those nurserymen who want them, or available, as Deputy Allen and others suggested, to the county councils for their planting schemes?</P>

      <P>I could not say that either.  My only concern in the matter is to see that, as far as possible, in the interests of my own Department, the costs are recouped.  It is really only an accountancy matter.  Some officers of my Department might feel that our Department should show a profit on the matter, but at any rate we have reached the point that we have got an understanding to get a balance in the form of appropriations for whatever our outgoings may be in providing timber.  We have not yet finally agreed what the charges are to be but it is estimated that the Department's outlay on the scheme will be covered by a rate of £1 per ton, and that is the rate proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not include transport to the city.  I think that is reasonable.  It may be that in individual cases, as Deputy Linehan says, isolated merchants or even merchants in a big way of business, may be able to do better.  We are not trying to make any profit on this, and I am sure the officials of the Forestry Branch are anxious to get the best return possible. Having regard to the fact that the timber has to be felled, cut into logs and taken to the railway station, I think it is reasonable enough.  We have not received any complaint, I think, from Fuel Importers Limited that the price is unreasonable.  It seems to me that if they consider that in the final price to the consumers, the cost of felling and preparation for the market is unreasonable, it would be for them to raise the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have arranged to circularise the nursery trade with regard to these transplants in which Deputy Mulcahy is interested, and if I am satisfied that transplants cannot be obtained otherwise or that plants which other firms in the trade require cannot be obtained, I intend to make them available. I think the Deputy will realise that we must have some regard to the claims of those in the wholesale trade who say that they have stocks of certain species available.  At the same time, I do not want to have destruction of those plants, and I will go as far as possible to avoid having them destroyed. I explained, on the last occa sion when this matter was mentioned, that county committees of agriculture and others will have to get their plants from the members of the wholesale <Col N="2129" /> trade.  All we can do is to facilitate the wholesale trade, as far as we can, under the circumstances.  We cannot, obviously, deal with individuals.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Dillon's point, we have only a limited staff of inspectors.  I am told we have 16 in the country, and a very severe burden is being placed on those 16 inspectors in carrying out inspection and recommending the amount of replanting necessary, if replanting conditions are put in the felling permit, because those inspectors, like the Forestry Branch generally, are expected to carry out the normal work of afforestation in the country.  The House and the Government expect me to see that a very substantial acreage is planted.  There is all the more interest in that matter in view of the great amount of felling that is going on at the moment.  This whole question of felling and the setting up of a timber control has thrown a very severe burden on our inspectors, and I expect that the burden will become more acute in the future, because travelling is becoming very difficult, and more and more felling is likely to go on.  I must point out to the House again, and I hope to have their co-operation on this matter, that it is the law that felling permits must be obtained, and it is not too much to ask anybody to wait for a reasonable period if the Forestry Branch are not able to give a permit to fell right away, which they do in the vast majority of cases where there are only a few trees involved.  A farmer has a few trees near his house, or perhaps a few trees somewhere else, which he thinks, from more than one point of view, it would be an advantage to take down.  As a general rule the Forestry Branch tries to convenience such people, but then there are others who want to cut large numbers of trees, and in those cases there is no way out except to have inspection. If, as frequently happens, the owners choose to fell before they get a permit to do so, and before the inspector has reported on the matter, we have to prosecute them.  As in other matters in which the Government is interested, I hope that severe fines will be placed upon people who cut down trees without getting a permit.  If they find that <Col N="2130" /> the filling of forms is too arduous for them to undertake, they can easily get some assistance.  All they need do in the first instance is to go to the Civic Guard station and inform them of their intentions.</P>
    <P>After two and a half years, it seems to me that the amount of illegal felling during this war is increasing rather than otherwise, and I must ask the House to give all the co-operation possible to see that the law is carried out.  Otherwise, it will be quite impossible to maintain any proper form of timber control, and it will be equally impossible to enforce a proper replanting programme on those at present felling trees.  I should like to be able to meet Deputy Dillon in the matter, but I do not see how it is feasible.  A forestry inspector is not like Sir Boyle Roche's bird; he cannot be in several places at one time; he has to get about like any other Government officer.  I think the Forestry Branch has done very well up to the present in maintaining a very large annual acreage of new plantation, and, at the same time, looking after this additional work which has been thrown upon them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey complained about the delay with regard to wire fencing and meeting.  Of course, unhappily, military people are very keen on barbed wire and wire netting generally, and I am afraid that when it became evident that war was imminent the supplies were seized at once in the countries in which they are produced. The Forestry Branch were trying to get those supplies from Great Britain since October, 1939.  For many months, when supplies were not nearly as stringent as they are now, it seemed that we might get some from Great Britain.  After several months' endeavour, we had to transfer our attentions to the United States, and it has taken from May or June, 1940, up to the present to get even a very limited supply of wire fencing and netting from the United States.  I do not know what areas Deputy Morrissey refers to as being pitched at the Forestry Department.  Areas that seem to be very suitable might not be so very suitable, but, even if we are all agreed that they are suitable, there is <Col N="2131" /> still a certain procedure that has to be followed.  The title of the lands has to be looked into.  Investigations have to be carried out, and the price has to be fixed, and investigations often take a considerable time, particularly when the property is a large one.  The owners may not even be in the country at the present time.  If the Deputy&mdash; or any other Deputy&mdash;will communicate with me about any areas in which he is interested, and in which he knows that offers have been made to the Forestry Branch, I shall do anything I can to have the matter expedited.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to ask him a question. The Minister, perhaps, misunderstood me.  All I am asking is that there should be some simplification of the procedure, and I suggested certain lines that occured to me.  Would the Minister, for the period of the crisis, exempt certain classes of trees?  For instance, would he permit larch to be cut for this period without the customary licence, or, if that is not possible, would he simply say that the usual forms need not be filled but that the inspector will attend and mark specific trees which may be cut forthwith? All I am asking for is simplification of the procedure in order to make it less likely that there will be illegal cutting in future.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that fish merchants in Cahirciveen find great difficulty in providing timber for fish boxes, would the Minister's Department facilitate those people in future by making it possible for the Department of Supplies to grant those licences to the fish merchants concerned within a specified period?  Last year there was considerable delay in procuring those licences, and the people concerned were held up for weeks before this timber was made available.</P>

      <P>I cannot undertake, even in cases where timber suppliers have entered into definite contracts, that, merely by reason of the fact that they have entered into those contracts or want to get on with their business, <Col N="2132" /> they are entitled to priority of treatment over others.  I cannot agree with that.  Naturally, the Forestry Branch and, I hope, the Department of Supplies will try to facilitate such people, but we do not want to be in the position of being blackmailed into giving felling licences.  A certain number of contractors in this country seem to think that by entering into very speedy arrangements to purchase large quantities of timber, they can then come along to us and, on the threat that a certain amount of employment depends on their getting this timber, compel us to give them a felling licence.</P>
      <P>We are not going to be browbeaten in that way.  We will try to meet those who approach us in a reasonable frame of mind in a proper way, but I do not think advantage should be taken of the present position to force our hands. We will do our best to meet people, but we dislike those people who try to browbeat us into doing something we would not normally do.  All those people, both timber suppliers and private owners, should know by this time that there is a Forestry Act which has been in operation since 1928 and they should know that they are not entitled to cut timber without licence.  If they do so, we will prosecute those who purchase the timber and those who fell it.</P>
      <P>I have not much sympathy, therefore, with those people to whom Deputy Dillon refers, people who will not go to the trouble of carrying out the normal procedure.  We know that the regulations in many respects are irksome to people, but they have to fill up these forms.  Records have to be kept.  If any Minister is challenged here, that Minister must be in a position to state what actually happened and it must be realised that even though the filling of forms is rather tedious and troublesome, there is a definite reason for filling them.  The Department likes to have records of what has been permitted in certain cases.  I do not see how we can get out of the difficulty. Those who want to facilitate the public by providing timber are surely sufficiently intelligent to be able to follow the normal procedure.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £20,000, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries sustained by persons, not being members of State Services, as a result of the dropping of bombs by foreign aircraft and kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war.</P>
      <P>This Vote is required to meet expenditure during the current financial year under the Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, 1941, made by the Government on the 15th July last.  Article 4 of that order empowered the Minister for Finance to make a scheme providing for the payment of periodical or lump sums to persons, or the dependents of persons who suffer personal injuries resulting, broadly speaking, from breaches of our neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme under that order was formally made on the 17th September last, but in the light of subsequent representations as to the inadequacy in present circumstances of the scale of compensation provided for in that scheme, <Col N="2134" /> I have reviewed the whole position and have decided to make a new scheme which will revoke the existing scheme and will provide compensation on a basis which will permit of allowances to the dependents of persons suffering injury, and of allowances also instead of lump sums to the dependents of deceased persons.  Briefly stated, while I have felt constrained to retain the maximum disablement allowance of 30/- a week for earners provided for in the original scheme, I propose additional allowances as follows:&mdash;In respect of dependent wife or husband or in respect of any female person residing with a widow or widower for the purpose of having the care of his children&mdash;7/6 a week.  In respect of each dependent other than husband or wife&mdash;4/- a week.  Disablement allowances will be reducible by reference to the percentage degree of disability.  In the case of fatal injuries I propose allowances as follows:&mdash;For a widow over 45 years of age or, if under that age, in receipt of an allowance in respect of a dependent, or incapable of earning&mdash;18/- a week.  For a widow under 45 years of age not in receipt of an allowance in respect of a dependent and capable of earning&mdash;12/6 a week.</P>
    <P>For a widower dependent on deceased wife and incapable of earning&mdash;18/- a week.  In respect of dependents while living with a widow or widower&mdash;5/- a week, and after the death of the widow or widower&mdash; 7/6 a week.  For dependents of an unmarried man or widower or of an unmarried woman or widow&mdash;7/6 a week.</P>
    <P>The widow's allowance would cease on remarriage and an allowance in respect of any other female dependent would cease on marriage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make awards of compensation in respect of the dependents of deceased non-earners unless necessitous circumstances are established. For earners under 18 years of age the maximum disablement allowance will be 15/- a week.  For non-earners over 18 years of age the maximum rate will be 18/- a week, and for non-earners under 18 years of age, 9/- a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> As regards partial dependency, I cannot undertake to make continuing payments and I propose that partial dependency, but only in fatal cases, shall be dealt with on a lump sum basis measured by Workmen's Compensation Act standards, where the merits of a case are established.</P>
    <P>As regards classes of dependents I propose to include, in addition to those provided for in the original scheme, a child in respect of whom the injured or deceased person had placed himself or herself <i>in loco parentis.</i>  I have decided also that allowances in respect of children shall be payable up to the age of 18 years, unless they are prevented by physical or mental infirmity from supporting themselves, when the allowances will continue to be payable up to the age of 70 years.  Moreover, any injured child up to the age of 18 who is not an earner will be treated as a non-earner for the purposes of the scheme and injury allowances will accordingly be payable in respect of young children.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may consider that the revised scale of compensation which I have outlined is still inadequate, but in this connection I can only say that I am bound in a matter of this kind to take into account the consideration that in providing for compensation of this nature we are undertaking an unlimited liability, and the contingency of further incidents, giving rise to claims for damage to life and property on a widespread scale, cannot be ignored. Recovery from outside sources of the cost of compensation may not always be feasible, and we must have regard to the possibility that compensation payments may in large measure fall finally on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The actual payments of compensation have been provided for under sub-head A of the Estimate.  Under sub-head B provision is made for payment for medical and surgical treatment, and the supply where necessary of medical and surgical appliances.  It is the intention to afford such treatment at the expense of the Exchequer, on the advice of the Army Pensions Board, where it is considered that <Col N="2136" /> suffering may be alleviated and a reduced degree of disability secured.  In addition, the sub-head provides for the refund of medical and hospital expenses incurred by applicants contemplated by the scheme.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the basis of estimation must at this stage be in large measure conjectural.  It has been difficult to obtain definite figures as to how many people up to date have been killed and injured within the State by belligerent action.  Forms of application for compensation under the scheme have up to now been issued in reply to preliminary inquiries concerning 50 cases of death and 181 cases of injury ascribed to such action; only 19 forms in respect of death and 62 in respect of injury have so far been returned. Claims are coming in slowly, and it is probable that a considerable number of additional claims, at least in respect of injury, may be anticipated.  Round figures have accordingly been taken under each sub-head.</P>
    <P>It has been decided that, where responsibility for a breach of neutrality resulting in loss of life or injury can be brought home to a belligerent Power, a claim for compensation will be made by the State against that Power.  As indicated in the note on the Estimate, any compensation recovered will be paid into the Exchequer.  Where the compensation recovered in any case exceeds the payments already made under the scheme, power is being taken to pay the applicant or applicants concerned a sum not exceeding the difference between the two amounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. When this Estimate was first put down, I put down a motion to refer it back for reconsideration. The Minister has announced certain changes now which he proposes to make in his Personal Injuries Compensation Order which, as it were, answered to some extent my objection to the Estimate in the way in which it was presented, and which dealt with the matter for which I originally put down my motion to refer it back.  However, the changes that the Minister has made, in the amounts which he proposes <Col N="2137" /> now to fix for compensation, are welcome, and I personally see that this is an event of a certain amount of social significance.  I wished that the Minister would suggest that he appreciated that significance himself because, except we take advantage of properly considering some of the things that are arising to us now, we are not going either to be able to face them properly or to have a common outlook with regard to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister and myself were rather at cross-purposes when, previous to the introduction of this Estimate, I moved a motion to annul the original Order No. 98 which he now proposes to annul.  I should like to assure the Minister that at that time I was not proposing to torment him or proposing to be abusive to him or anything else at all like that, but I was definitely appalled at the lines upon which the proposals were drawn.  The point at which we came to definite cross-purposes was when I asked him, during the discussion, how a man could maintain himself and his wife and five children on 35/- a week.  The Minister previously had said that the compensation proposals were drawn on the lines of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  He said, as reported in column 1134 of the Official Debates of 3rd December, 1941:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not generous; it is not liberal; but I think it is just, and it is within our competence to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A week later, in the Seanad, I think he indicated that he had reconsidered the matter, but that he did not see that he could bring about any fundamental change in his proposals.  Well, I think he has brought about fundamental changes in his proposals, and I press the motion for reconsideration of the Estimate in order to put it up to the Minister to discuss the basis upon which he now makes these changes.  He has intimated that he is going to make certain changes, but that they may not all be regarded as adequate, and that we do not know how much they are likely to cost us.  What arises to my mind, however, is whether the new proposals are made in some kind of an actuarial frame of mind.  If the matter <Col N="2138" /> is proposed from the point of view of what figure we ought to put down, then I think the proposal is utterly wrong, and I am not satisfied with those figures unless the Minister tells us that he has now approached the matter from a completely different point of view, and that he has investigated what it will cost to maintain in reasonable circumstances the people whom we are proposing to compensate.</P>
    <P>In addressing myself to the annulment of the Order originally, I took the case of a man with a wife and five children, and I should like to ask the Minister if he has examined or caused to be examined what it would take a man and his wife and five children to maintain themselves, granted that the man was completely disabled, that the wife had to look after the home, and that the children were not capable of maintaining themselves.  This is a unique opportunity of approaching the whole of this thing from the only point of view that we can afford to approach it from if we are going to have any satisfaction in our consciences that we are dealing with certain social problems in the proper way.  I would point out to the Minister that comparatively recently, within the last fortnight or so, the British, who had established under an analogous order a series of war disablement pensions, have raised the rates of these pensions. Taking the case of a disabled man with a wife and five children, they propose to pay the man a pension of 37/6, having increased the original pension by 3/4.</P>
    <P>They have increased the pension of the wife by 10d., to 9/2.  They have increased the pension in respect of the first child by 10d., to 7/1, and of the second, third, fourth and any subsequent children by 5d., to 5/5.  So that the total amount now payable by way of war disablement pension in the case of a disabled man with dependent wife and five children would be 75/5, or an increase of 6/8 over what it was previously.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister has indicated that in his new order he proposes to fix for a disabled man here 30/-, or 7/6 less than the British scale; that he proposes to fix 7/6 for the wife, or 1/8 less <Col N="2139" /> than the British scale; that he proposes to fix 4/- for the first child, or 3/1 less than the British scale, and for all subsequent children, 4/-, or 1/5 less than the British scale.  Under the Minister's new arrangement a man, with his wife and five children, will get 57/6, or 17/11 less than the scale that has now been introduced in Great Britain.  Now, I mention this simply for purposes of comparison.  The British found it necessary to increase the amount of 68/9 for a family of that particular kind to 75/5, and generally, I think within the last fortnight or so, they have had to increase the rates they originally fixed by 10 per cent.  We have made an advance that cannot be counted in percentages at all.  It is a complete and radical change of mind, a radically different way of approaching the situation.  The Minister is changing, from a lump sum of 30/- a week for a family of this kind to 57/6, and the change is more even than is indicated there by the amount.  The change indicated to me that there is a fundamentally different approach. Now, I think we ought to get that approach, and one of the reasons why I suggest that we ought to get it is, that there are elements in the Minister's proposal that are disturbing and make us question whether the situation has been examined from the point of view that I think it should.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that in the case of a widow between 40 and 45 he proposes to pay 18/-, and that in the case of a widow under 40, and not having dependent children, he proposes to pay 12/6.  Now, the British, in their new scheme, have found that they have had to increase the payment to a widow of 40, in similar circumstances and without dependents, from 22/6 to 25/-.  So that, here, a widow between 40 years of age and 45 would only receive, according to the Minister, 12/6, as against 25/- under the British scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the situation here can have been fully examined.  In a country such as this, with so little opportunity of employment for women of that kind, as compared with England, why should we fix the age <Col N="2140" /> at 45 for getting the widow's full pension when the British fix the age at 40?  Nor do I think it reasonable that the discrepancy represented by 25/- and 18/- should exist as regards the amount of pension paid here.  The Minister indicated in the Seanad that one of his difficulties was that this scheme had to be applied to men of the Local Defence Force, A.R.P. and Local Security Force.  I agree, but that makes it all the more important that we should look at the basis of the scheme.  I suggest that it must be applied also to the Army.  In the light of modern circumstances, the provisions contained in the Army Pensions Act, 1927, are utterly insufficient for what they are required to do.  The Army Pensions Act of 1923 provided for payment of 42/- in the case of a man with 100 per cent. disability, with an additional 10/- if he had a family.  Therefore, a disabled man with a wife and family got 52/-, irrespective of the size of the family.  The 1927 Act changed that. Instead of getting 42/- for himself, he was, under that Act, to get only 26/- and instead of 10/- for the family he was to receive only 5/-.  At present, if a soldier is disabled as a result of his military service and if he has a wife and five children, he can get, under the 1927 Act, only 31/-.  When going through the House, the 1927 Bill received considerable criticism.  It was framed when we had passed away from the realities of the situation in which disabled men had received 52/- a week. I suggest that these provisions have, again, to be extended to the Army. Possibly that will mean large expenditure. When we consider the size of the Vote on Account, what it represents in general taxation, we must ask ourselves what it is all for if it is not to help our people to live a better existence, so far as their material comforts are concerned, and thereby to be more productive and to have a chance of developing their mental faculties, which it is necessary to do in order to have spiritual wellbeing. I do not hold back for financial reasons from anything we may have to face provided we face it with a knowledge of what we are doing.  If <Col N="2141" /> we are not able to do it, that is another question.</P>
    <P>We cannot face these matters in a proper frame of mind unless we are agreed upon certain fundamental things.  I think the time has come when we ought to co-operate in such a way as to get a clear realisation as to the amount necessary for a man, his wife and family to live.  An individual going into a house could get an impression of that kind.  I have done it in the case of quite a number of people in different ways recently, but I think it ought to be faced systematically and as an official duty by the State.  When presenting to us proposals for compensating people who have been injured as a result of war accidents, it is due to our people and to the circumstances that the Government should show that their proposals are based on a definite conception of the conditions in which the families affected are likely to be.  It is because I fear we have approached this matter from the Stone Age point of view of 30/- a week, that I am urging the Minister to go further and tell us that his proposals rest on an examination of the human position, adducing his facts to show that this is so.  When the new order comes forward, I shall consider it my duty to move to have it annulled, merely in order to discuss its details.  I shall do that in order that we may understand what we are doing and because I want the Minister and every group of Deputies to do the right thing in a matter of fundamental importance.</P>

      <P>When may the people who have lodged their claims for loss of house property, goods and chattels expect to receive payment of the claims?  If the Minister would answer that query, I should like to follow up what Deputy Mulcahy has said.  I agree that this series of proposals, which envisage the minimum income necessary for a man, his wife and family to live decently, places upon us the burden of co-ordinating them and finding a common underlying principle. I think that Deputy Mulcahy would agree with me that when we contemplate an injured man, with his wife and five children being provided with <Col N="2142" /> 57/6 to live upon, our minds must turn to the man working 54 hours a week as an agricultural labourer, with a wife and five children, who is very lucky if he gets 33/-.  I do not want to be taken as maintaining that we should consider 33/- a week a defensible income for any citizen of this State who has a wife and five children depending upon him.  I think that that is iniquitous.</P>

      <P>If it be true&mdash;and I agree with Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;that any compensation scheme brought before this House ought to have regard not only to the injury done but to the responsibilities of the person injured, surely neither Deputy Mulcahy nor the Minister nor I will be content to stop with our examination of social liabilities at that point.  If, as I think is true, Deputy Mulcahy's submission is correct, this House must go a step further and ensure that, if justice is done to the injured, it will be done also to those who are working in order that the injured may be maintained.  I invite the Minister, even though I may not be permitted to pursue this aspect of the problem in dealing with this question, to allow it to mature in his mind so that he or his successor, whoever that may be, will come to this House with a comprehensive co-ordinating scheme designed to secure for all incapacitated people a reasonable standard of compensation calculated in the light of their family responsibilities, and that annexed to it he will feel himself constrained to say: &ldquo;Having made provision for those who are injured and who have family responsibilities, I do not propose to forget those who by their labour are maintaining this State in existence and <Col N="2143" /> filling its Exchequer, and to those having responsibilities the public purse acknowledges its liability as well.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the tone of the remarks made by Deputy Mulcahy to-day.  It was very different from the tone of the remarks he made when this matter was under discussion before in the House.  I think I made a reasonable statement when I defended that Order before.  Deputy Mulcahy evidently did not think so, and I think he was quite unreasonable in his attitude.  However, that is over and done with now.  I am not an unreasonable person at any time, and I am always open to listen to any arguments put up by the Opposition.  I do not say I always agree with the arguments put up, perhaps for good reasons.  No matter who speaks in this House and makes suggestions to me, I certainly do earnestly consider the suggestions made, and the same applies to the Seanad when I go there.  I found there, when a similar motion to the one Deputy Mulcahy put down here in relation to this matter was put down there, a reasonable critical attitude and I met it in a reasonable way, as I am prepared to meet any reasonable criticism here.  I claim to be as kind-hearted and humanitarian in my instincts and perhaps as liberal even as Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>I should like, especially as a politician, to be able to play the role of the generous, benevolent, large-hearted public benefactor especially to people of the type we are dealing with in this Order, people who, for no reason of their own, have suffered because the neutrality of the country has been violated and have been injured&mdash;some of them met their death&mdash;because of bombs falling here or some similar reason.  That is the type of person that naturally everyone with reasonable human instincts would like to go to the fullest length to succour and help and benefit.</P>

    <P>That is the view that has been put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon.  Normally it is a view with which I would find myself in full agreement.  But I have to consider the <Col N="2144" /> matter from the other point of view, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, and, if Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Dillon occupied my position, I think they would naturally, having the responsibility of the Exchequer upon them, consider it from that point of view tinged with their own human instincts and feeling.  I have to balance one with the other.  There is the urge to treat those people who have suffered and who are likely to suffer as generously as possible, and there is the need for considering the very heavy burdens already on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon next week or the week after, and I am sure Deputy Mulcahy also, will be telling us how very heavily the taxpayer is burdened, and that we are grossly extravagant in expenditure. Language of that type, I am sure, will be modest compared with the language Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy will use about the Estimates which have been brought in.  The changes will be rung on that.  Instead of being kind-hearted, generous, public benefactors, they will be the very vigilant guardians of the taxpayer.  They cannot have it both ways.  Admittedly, they do try to have it both ways.  I am not saying that they are not sincere in asking for generous treatment for these people.  I do not deny that at all. That is the fortunate position of those who are in Opposition&mdash;they can have it both ways.  Unfortunately I cannot; I cannot even try.</P>
    <P>Our financial resources are not to be compared with the British resources. There is no use in comparing our resources here with those of the British.  If the British give 75/5 to a family and we give only 57/6, well, Britain is by far the richest nation on the earth; not even America can compare with it in wealth.  They are spending fabulous sums of money at present.  They think it is right to do so, because they are fighting for their existence.  But we cannot compare with them.  For the type of family that Deputy Mulcahy referred to, when, even by comparison, we pay 57/6 to that family and the British pay 75/5, I am not saying that the family are not entitled to a great deal more, but, taking into account all the circumstances, I think we are not ungenerous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> If we could measure to any extent actuarially what we have to face, we might be able then, measuring our resources, to go a great deal further. But there is no way of measuring what our liability is likely to be.  There is no yard-stick by which we can measure it.  Therefore, we have to be careful. Deputy Mulcahy, or whoever introduced the Military Service Pensions Bill in 1923 and the amending Bill in 1927, had some measure to go by, because the Government then knew the size of the Army, had actuaries to tell them what the possibility of death in the Army in normal peace times would be, and could measure the extent of the bill.  We have no way of measuring it.  In these circumstances, while I would as a humanitarian agree that, if we had the resources, we might do better, I think in the circumstances we have done as well as can be expected by those unfortunate suffering people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with notice given, I move the adjournment of the Dáil.  I considered it proper to-day to ask if we agreed that the bread situation, caused by the recent action of restricting the amount of bread and of flour available, should have been dealt with in the sudden and unprepared way in which it was done, producing a situation here that calls for review and urgent action on the part of the Minister for Supplies, and to see that bread distribution is ordered in a more satisfactory way, and that those classes of the population that have no reasonable alternative to bread to keep themselves and their families alive, will get particular consideration.  I put down certain questions to the Minister to-day, and I think it would have been much more satisfactory if the House, in approaching a discussion of the situation now, could have the answers before it.  We had a statement to-day, for well over an hour, about turf.  I have no objection to that, but I think questions about turf had none of the elements of urgency that questions about bread have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of coming before this House and making a statement analogous to that made about turf, the Minister for Supplies on last Thursday week left this House and broadcast a general statement suggesting that the consumption of bread and flour would have to be cut down by one-fifth as from Friday, February 27th.  He gave no reasonable details that would suggest how distribution was to be safeguarded, and, particularly, how the poorer classes of people were to be <Col N="2147" /> safeguarded in their requirements.  I suggest that it would have been more helpful, and that the Minister would have been warned of the difficulties and of the kind of situation he would have to meet if he had made his statement in this House and given Deputies from the various constituencies a chance of discussing it.  I do not want to take up time dealing with that now.</P>
    <P>I want to state what the position is, as I found it in the city, in a family consisting of father, mother, grandmother and eight children living in the workers' area on the north side.  Normally they would get, on Monday, five loaves, but actually got two.  They were people who dealt with and were known to a baker.  On Tuesday, they would get six loaves, but only got three; on Wednesday, they would get five loaves, but only got three; on Thursday they would get six loaves but got three, and on Friday they would get five loaves but got only three.  On Saturday they would get 11 loaves to bring them over the week-end, but up to 3 o'clock on that day they got only three loaves, and those were got by going into a queue.  They had that amount to bring them over the week-end, but by some of the children getting into a queue and waiting from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. they got two additional loaves.  There you had a family of 11 persons, who normally consumed 38 2-lb. loaves in the week, succeeding in getting 19 loaves with a considerable amount of difficulty.  According to a statement that was issued by the Department of Supplies, the situation was investigated, and it was understood that the panic that occurred during the week arose from over-anxiety on the part of customers of bakers' shops, and that arrangements were being made on March 2nd, so that the public who normally purchased bread in bakers' shops should have no difficulty in getting supplies any time during shopping hours. On Monday, March 2nd, when that family would normally get five loaves they got two, and got two small pans in another shop.  On Tuesday, when they would have got six loaves they got two.</P>
    <P>That was the position of one <Col N="2148" /> worker's family known to the baker, where there were no great complications about being the type of person who shopped here, there and elsewhere. In another better-class house on the North side, consisting of a father, mother, three children and a maid they would get on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, four loaves daily, and on Saturdays when they expected eight, they got five loaves.  For the full week instead of getting 28 loaves they got only 11. The five loaves they got on Saturday were only got by going into a queue in the morning and in the evening.  On the other side of the city a family consisting of a man and his wife and seven children normally got four loaves at a baker's shop and one loaf at a neighbouring dairy daily.  They would get that amount on five days of the week.  They actually got two every day at the bakery and they were able to get three in other places.  Therefore, since the Order was issued, instead of 25 loaves, they got 13.  On Saturdays they would normally get seven plus some flour to do some baking at home, but on last Saturday they got only four as a great compliment.  On Monday when the situation was supposed to have changed and when they should have got four plus one, they got only two and a small brown square.  On Tuesday they got three.  In order to get the two, a boy of 13 had to be kept at home from school and had to go into a queue.  These are examples, showing in a purely statistical way how families were affected.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has experience of the home life of these people and of the circumstances in which they live generally, will have some kind of an impression of what it means to be deprived of 50 per cent. of the normal bread requirements of the home.  Added to that there was the anxiety of not knowing whether they were going to get any bread and the fact that children had to be kept at home from school to take their place in queues.</P>
    <P>The confusion and the scenes that took place in some of the queues accentuated the hardship of these people in the last week.  This was entirely a result <Col N="2149" /> of the shortness of notice and the absence of any systematic arrangement to deal with the situation.  The situation was made worse for some people towards the end of last week and the police in the city got the idea of removing the younger people from the queues and not allowing young people into the queues.  The result was that many older people without families who could not leave their homes and who were depending on neighbours' children to get supplies for them, were disappointed by reason of the fact that after they had spent some time in the queues, the children were sent home by the police without any bread.  It seems to me astonishing, that, knowing the importance of bread to the working class here in the City of Dublin, the most careful examination of what was likely to be the result of any action by the Minister was not made beforehand.</P>
    <P>The Minister, apparently, appreciates that there are some classes of people to whom alternative varieties of food are available.  He suggested in his broadcast that retailers should be able to distinguish between various classes of people, that they should be able to know the people who are likely to have alternative foods and that, in the rationing of the bread, they should take that into consideration.  The Minister, having that appreciation of the situation in the city, surely ought to have remembered that there are certain districts in the city which should be particularly catered for in the distribution of bread and that in a rushed action of this kind the working class areas should have been catered for by instructions to the distributors to see that the full complement of bread was allowed into these areas until his Department was able to work out a system by which the definite amount that could be allocated to those areas was arrived at.  There have been many families who formerly received three or four loaves daily who were able to get only one.</P>
    <P>There are many families who get little or no bakers' bread and who buy flour.  There are very few families using bakers' bread almost entirely who do not get, over the week-end, a small <Col N="2150" /> quantity of flour to do some home baking on Saturday or Sunday.  The Minister no doubt has heard the very caustic comments on the announcement of his Department that over-anxiety on the part of the public to get bread caused the present situation, but the suggestion I heard most frequently was that the difficulties could have been lessened considerably if the Department of Supplies allowed the bakers and the bread distributors to formulate their own schemes.  It seems to me that the Minister in a rushed and panicky way issued an Order without any plans or arrangements behind it.  The reason that he would not answer the questions to-day is, I think, that he was not prepared to answer them because he could not hope to persuade the House that he had taken reasonable precautions to obviate the calamitous situation in which a large number of people found themselves during the past week.</P>
    <P>I do not want to read all the communications I have received on this matter.  I have had them from places as far apart as Donegal and Cashel. The position in Donegal is as bad as it is in Dublin but in a different kind of way.  The position in Cashel, to quote only one phrase from a letter that reached me this morning, is that &ldquo;the poor are like hunted rats looking for bread.&rdquo;  I raise this question principally to ask the Minister does he realise what the situation here in the city is?  Does he know no more about it than is indicated in the statement issued from the Department of Supplies? I ask him to tell us here what he proposes to do so that we may be able to help him by suggestions.  If he is not able to do any better than he has done up to the present, then I think the bakers and the retailers should be brought into consultation with no officialdom near them.  The problem should be put to them as business people in touch with consumers and the responsibility might be put on them to outline how they are going to serve the people of the city with 80 per cent. of the bread they got previously.  The problem is not a big one, but in the actual working out of the Minister's plan up to the present, <Col N="2151" /> it is the poor only who have really suffered.  Other people have been inconvenienced. The greatest amount of hardship and the greatest amount of misery has been caused to the people who can least afford it while the least amount of disturbance has been brought about amongst those who can get us much bread as they like in hotels and restaurants if they are not able to get it in their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, from inquiries I have made, that while the position in my part of the country may not be as bad as apparently it is here in the City of Dublin, certainly there has been a good deal of dislocation in certain areas which have not been able to procure sufficient supplies of bread.  I think we must say at the outset that this position has arisen largely because the Government did not at the beginning of the emergency take the step, which everybody outside Government circles thought was not only desirable but essential, of setting up a national register and of introducing rationing.  The position at the moment cannot be otherwise than one of confusion and chaos.  An order is issued by the Department and the responsibility for carrying out that order immediately in thrown upon retailers throughout the country, whether that order is to apply to bread, sugar or other commodities. Deputy Mulcahy has said that the Minister issued this order in a sort of panic.  I can quite understand that because it is only, of course, quite recently that the Minister apparently became aware of the serious position in this country in relation to its wheat supplies.  I remember that in a debate in this House as far back as November 13th last we were discussing wheat supplies, and some of us told the Minister, from the information which we had at our disposal, that there was a fear that we were going to be at least 100,000 tons of wheat short.  I remember the Minister in his usual way telling me that I was talking through my hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is <Col N="2152" /> mixing up who said what.  I think it was I who told the House that we were 100,000 tons short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Minister a little more about it.  The Minister will not want the Official Report by the time I am finished. When we asked the Minister: &ldquo;How much wheat have you already got into the stores?&rdquo; he said, 170,000 tons, but we were going to get 290,000.  All his calculations in respect of the subsidy and everything else, the House still remember, were based on 290,000 tons of home-grown wheat in the hands of the millers, and when, from this side of the House, doubt was expressed as to the Minister being able to get, after 13th November, 120,000 tons of wheat to make up his 290,000 tons, the Minister again had no doubts whatever this the 290,000 tons would be got.  It is only about six weeks since the Minister woke up to the fact that he was not going to get 290,000 tons, that there was no possible chance of his getting that amount, and that, instead of being 100,000 tons short, he was much nearer to being 130,000 or 140,000 tons short. That is the fact.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes further, and on the usual Government principle of trying to put the results of their own inefficiency upon the shoulders of somebody else said that this rationing of flour and bread is made necessary because of the farmers withholding wheat.  Will the Minister deny that he said that?  I want to say here and now, publicly, that that statement was not only untrue and unfair, but it was a dangerous statement to make.  It was absolutely untrue.  There were two reasons for the Government's failure to get in the amount of wheat they anticipated.  One was that we never had 490,000 acres under wheat last year and sufficient care was not taken to check up the figures supplied to the Department; and the second, and main, reason was not that the farmers were withholding wheat, but that the yield of wheat was down by 20 per cent.  The Minister made no reference to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go back on that matter any further, except to say that <Col N="2153" /> it discloses a state of affairs in the Department of Supplies and the Department of Agriculture that must create very grave doubts in the minds of members of the House and of people outside.  I want to say here and now that different and more effective machinery will have to be set up for the collecting of agricultural statistics. Those of us who come from the country know quite well how these statistics are generally got together.  John is met at the creamery and asked: &ldquo;How many acres of wheat have you sown this year?&rdquo;  John, knowing that under the law he must have 25 per cent. of his land tilled, says: &ldquo;I have nine or ten acres,&rdquo; when he might have only four.  That is bad enough, but his neighbour, James, is not at the creamery that morning, and John is asked how many acres he has tilled, and again he is not going to underestimate. That is the type of administration on which, I might say, the lives of the people are being made to depend. These figures are totalled up after collection and then there is a great flare in the headlines, from the platforms over the radio: &ldquo;490,000 acres of wheat.&rdquo;  They were not there, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>It is unfair for a responsible Minister to say to the people of the country that the rationing of flour and bread was brought about because the farmers were withholding wheat.  That created a very bad impression, very naturally, in the cities and towns, so much so that there were letters in the daily and local papers about it.  One letter was written by an official of one of the bakery unions in the city and these letters, of course, accepted the Minister's statement as being absolutely true.  I can speak only for the farmers with whom I am in touch in my own constituency, but I take these as being typical of the farmers in the rest of the country, and so far as my knowledge goes in this matter of grain&mdash;and I am certainly as close to them as probably any member of the House&mdash;the farmers in that area kept sufficient wheat for the needs of their own families and no more&mdash;and my blessing to them for providing for their own families.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I object is this statement last Monday week in <Col N="2154" /> respect of flour and bread, that where a person got five loaves, he would now get four.  I take it the same ratio was to apply to flour for home baking. What is the fact?  Is there a single purchaser of flour for home baking who has been able to get anything like his normal supply for the last three, four or five months?  Of course, there is not.  Let me give the Minister a couple of examples.  In the country areas, and particularly in rural areas and in some of the small towns, the normal thing is to buy what is called a half sack of flour, ten-stone bag.  If you went into any flour merchant in any town or village I know of over the last three, four or five months, and asked for a ten-stone sack of flour, you were told: &ldquo;I am sorry; all I can give you is six stone or five stone.&rdquo;  The person who went in for a stone of flour was lucky if he got a half stone.  That went on for the three or four months before last Monday week and the position since then is that the farm labourer or town person with a big family, who normally bought a ten-stone sack, got, instead of six stone, four stone, and the poor person who normally bought a stone at a time got a half stone, or perhaps a quarter stone.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have many people, inspectors and others, supplying him with information, but we are giving the actual facts as we find them in our own areas, and as we come up against them day in and day out.  It is information which we have checked so far as it is humanly possible to check it, and which we have obtained in order to get the actual position.  The picture I have painted for the House is a picture that could be painted, I am sure, by any Deputy from rural Ireland on any side of the House.  That is a situation that should have been provided against, and if the reduction had to take place&mdash;and there is no doubt that it had to take place in the circumstances because the wheat was not there&mdash;surely a much better way could have been found of breaking it to the people than the way which was adopted.  I am satisfied that if the Department and the Minister deliberately set out to create a panic and to cause queues to line up at the bread <Col N="2155" /> shops, they could not have adopted a better way than the Minister's broadcast on that night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now paying, or, rather, the poor people of the country, and particularly of this city, are now paying, for the complete displayed in 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941.  During all those years, it ought to have been obvious to the Government, which thought it necessary to set up a shadow Department of Supplies, that there was one vital need: to ensure an adequate supply of food for our people.  But the Government did nothing of any substantial value in the three years, 1938, 1939, and 1940 to ensure a substantial increase in the wheat acreage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early days of 1941 there was a panic when it was discovered that Grain Importers could not charter ships to ensure the delivery of wheat to this country, and then every Minister and official of standing in the Department of Agriculture wash chased around the country to make a panic appeal to the farmers to grow more wheat.  But, even then, we continued, by an emergency powers order, to require only an infinitesimal proportion of the arable land to be tilled, and in case anything should happen so that we would have an adequate supply of wheat, no stipulation whatever was made to ensure that the minimum acreage of wheat would be produced. In those years every possible blunder that could be made was made with classic brazenness, so far as the Government are concerned.  No serious effort whatever was made to plan our requirements.  Everybody knew that we had not sufficient wheat, that, in fact, we did not produce 30 per cent. of our requirements in wheat, and that we would have to depend on a mercantile marine to bring overseas the other 70 per cent. of the wheat we required.  The Government would not buy ships, and, though we have some of the most fertile land in Europe, they would not insist on it being tilled.  They could not be aroused from the slumbers in which they have been resting for many years, even to <Col N="2156" /> stipulate that the minimum acreage required for wheat would be provided.</P>
    <P>Because of all the inexplicable complacency, all that kind of economic stewing in which the Government have enshrouded themselves during those years, the poor of this city are to-day paying for the Government's mistakes. To realise that, one has only to witness the sad spectacle of persons waiting in rain and biting wind outside the bread shops in this city, and the hardships they are enduring to-day.  They have no fuel at home to heat them, and in order to get a loaf or two of bread they must withstand the rigours of the rain and the wind outside the bread shops.</P>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why the people should be obliged to do that.  They are only being compelled to do it because we have in office a Government which apparently believes in shock tactics and does not believe in planning.  The Government's only policy is to shock the public and to shock them as often as they can.  Every crisis in respect of supplies with which the country has been confronted has been ushered in upon the people before they have even got time to plan or think of an alternative method of dealing with it.  No effort was made by the Government to appeal to people who could very well afford it to economise in the use of articles which were in short supply.</P>
    <P>That is the position in March.  We were told by the Minister the other day that all one had to do to solve the bread problem was to reduce the consumption of bread from five loaves to four loaves; that once that happened everything would be all right. but we see how that has been falsified by the actual facts in this city and in other towns during the past week.  In face of that, what is the position going to be in June and in July and August, before this year's harvest comes in?  Is it going to be any better than it is now?  If the muddle that we have to-day is simply a sympton&mdash;reducing consumption from five loaves to four loaves&mdash;what is the position going to be later on when perhaps the consumption of bread will have to be still further curtailed?  We <Col N="2157" /> learned the other day, from a statement made by an official of the Department of Agriculture, that those who can afford it ought to use bread only for breakfast.  But poor people cannot even get bread for breakfast.</P>
    <P>If well-to-do people can afford to adopt a formula of that kind, then some effort ought to be made beforehand to create an atmosphere favourable to its adoption, but instead we get, after the Dáil has adjourned, a statement broadcast by the Minister for Supplies announcing a curtailment of our bread supply with no adequate propaganda undertaken to ensure that the policy of bread for breakfast only is to be practised by those people who can afford to buy vegetables at the high prices at which they are procurable to-day.</P>
    <P>The most striking part of the whole muddle has been the complete absence of any plan to take special care of the needs of the poor people or of the needs of working-class households.  So far as they are concerned, they have been put on the same basis as the wealthy, and not even on the same basis as the wealthy, because the latter, with their commercial connections, can always manage to get goods.  The poor people have to depend on the weekly credit they are able to get from a small shopkeeper. The latter may not be able to measure precisely the difficulties that he is likely to be confronted with, with the result that the poor suffer the greatest hardships in a crisis of this kind.  I have here a letter from a well-known social worker in this city, dated yesterday, in which he states that he has first-hand information of several women having to wait in queues for two and even three hours.  There were some cases of women, he says, collapsing from fatigue and having to be taken away in ambulances.  If those women have had to wait for two or three hours, have collapsed from fatigue and have had to be taken away in ambulances that is all because the Department of Supplies apparently believes in shock tactics so far as the poor are concerned.  I bet there were no wealthy to be seen waiting for two or three hours.  I bet that no wealthy people collapsed from fatigue, and I bet that <Col N="2158" /> no wealthy folk had to be taken away in ambulances.  But the poor people on this occasion&mdash;as they always do&mdash; collapsed, and were made the victims of that type of misapplied charity, all because this Department of Supplies will not plan and will not think in advance. At the last moment it simply announces that it is going to do certain things without any previously conceived idea as to the manner in which its proposals can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I have some letters here from people in other areas.  A woman in Meath Street writes to say that she has five in family, that she usually takes four loaves, but that last week-end, for two days, all she got was one loaf and a brown cake.  There was no reduction from five to four there.  Another woman, living in the Coombe, with eight in family, writes to say that she usually takes four or five loaves daily. For two days&mdash;Saturday and Sunday&mdash; she got four loaves, so that instead of ten loaves for two days she got four loaves.  That is the five to four formula.</P>
    <P>Another woman with seven in family usually takes four loaves a day and got four loaves for three days and waited in Meath Street in a queue from 10 o'clock to 3 o'clock to get those two loaves of bread on Monday last.  Another family of five in number usually gets three loaves per day; at the week-end they got one loaf and two small brown squares.  Another person living with six children in a flat got two Vienna rolls to keep two adults and six children over the week-end.  In small shops in York Street and Mercer's Street areas there was no bread, and not even cakes, after 3 o'clock on Saturday last.</P>
    <P>That does not even exhaust the figures.  I have a letter here from a woman, who says: &ldquo;I got no bread yesterday, and made up my mind to go into a certain shop in town&rdquo;&mdash;which is mentioned in the letter&mdash;&ldquo;early this morning, where I always get my bread; and after waiting one hour and fifteen minutes I was handed one turnover instead of the usual four.  The loaf in question was steaming hot and of no utter use to any woman with children.&rdquo; She goes on to say that she had left a <Col N="2159" /> child of three years to look after a baby one year and four months old. She says: &ldquo;I can assure you my mind was in a dreadful state when I had to go to another shop&rdquo;&mdash;the name is mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;and there I found people treated a little better, but with the same sad conditions.  Again I left home to try this shop and after waiting from 1 o'clock to 2.45 we were told: `No more bread to-day: come in the morning early'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a picture of what poor people are suffering in this city for the past week, and with no reason whatever why they should suffer.  They could have been spared that suffering if the Department would only plan and invite the co-operation of the public, and endeavour to plan their ukase to deal with the requirements of the people, and particularly the needy section of the community.  I took the trouble to ask bread-van drivers their experience in the delivery of bread.  Many of them told me that, so far as the wealthy people were concerned, and in good residential areas, there was a tendency to get as much bread as possible, and that in practically no case, except where they were refused, was there any disposition on the part of well-to-do people to cut down the supplies of bread.  If the bread vans, instead of being sent into those areas, had been sent into the working-class areas, and if half-filled vans had been sent into the well-to-do areas, we might well have saved the working-class people from suffering all that they suffered, while I do not think it would have inflicted the slightest inconvenience on the well-to-do.</P>
    <P>I had cases of complaints from my own constituency, where people depend to a large extent on bread vans which come out from Dublin.  In some places, bread vans did not go into those small towns for three days and people had to eke out an existence on whatever local bread they could get.  Can anyone imagine a more chaotic condition of affairs than that?  A number of people depend on bread from a certain supplier, and the bread vans which took those supplies daily simply do not come.  There is no explanation to the <Col N="2160" /> people concerned, there is no attempt to plan for the needs of the people concerned; the people are simply told they will have to put up with the hardship and get over it as quickly as they can and with the least possible complaint. Of course, we could have avoided all this mess and muddling if we had only planned last year.  We have no plan, no idea of a plan, no attempt even to plan; and anybody who suggests a plan to the Government or suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anything that is sensible would astonish the Minister, we all know that.  I want to make this appeal to the Minister.  Instead of kicking the football all round this economic field, without a glimmer of <Col N="2161" /> idea where the goal posts are, the Minister should stop and think and get some sense of direction and aim at the goal posts.  He has no notion as to what he intends to do or where he intends to go or what results he ultimately hopes to achieve.</P>
      <P>We get an example of the Government policy in respect of wheat prices. The declaration from the Government Benches was that 50/- a barrel could not be paid for wheat, that it was an extortionate price.  Then we get the Government retreating from that position and saying that 50/- is a fair price, as if it were not a fair price earlier.  You get the Government retreating, retreating, retreating and doing this only under pressure, when they are compelled to do it, and when they cannot resist the logic of the contentions advanced in favour of doing these things, and then doing them with bad grace and usually after a substantial portion of the population has been irritated by the Government's stubbornness in the matter.  Take, for example, the muddle about oats, which may be a very useful substitute for bread.  You could have got oats and stirabout in the famine years in 1846 and 1847, and some of our people were kept alive then on stirabout, but you could not get stirabout now, notwithstanding all the compulsory tillage orders and the boastfulness as to the extent to which our land is under tillage.  You cannot buy oatmeal in the city to-day.</P>

Where is all the oats gone?  Where are the wheat supplies?  Statements were made here that 490,000 acres were under wheat and the Minister expected to get 290,000 tons of wheat, allowing for the hold-back for seed for the following year.  Instead of 290,000 tons of wheat, the Minister tells us about 190,000 tons of wheat is all he got, but he told us with the same assertiveness that he believed that it would be necessary to import only 180,000 tons of wheat.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Supplies does not know what quantites of wheat we have in the country.  He told us at one time he had 290,000 tons. Then it turned out to be 190,000 tons. The Minister's calculation was out by 100,000 tons of wheat; in other words, out by 100 days' supply of wheat; in other words, out by over three months' supply of wheat.  He told us he expected to get 290,000 tons; that his estimate was out by 100,000 tons, which is over three months' supply of wheat out of the nine months' supply of wheat which we were then producing.  What credit can be placed on statements made by a Minister who makes such irresponsible calculations?  He then comes back to the Dáil and makes an entirely different statement and wants to contend that he is right on the second occasion, even though the statements are entirely dissimilar.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister for the muddle about wheat.  That is the fault of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, but the Minister ought to know what the wheat position is in the country.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey. I do not believe either that 490,000 acres of wheat were grown last year.  The method by which that calculation was arrived at would not bear examination for ten minutes because it is a loose, rough-and-ready method which might suit all right in peace times when you would have plenty of wheat, but which is an entirely fallacious standard for reckoning our wheat acreage at a time when we could ill afford to make miscalculations to the extent of under-estimating by over three months' supply the amount of wheat grown in the country.</P>

      <P>One fact that emerges from this whole situation is that during the past week, notwithstanding all the money that we spend on the Department of Supplies, notwithstanding all the eulogies that that Department occasionally reads to itself, the poor of this city have had to queue up outside bread shops to try to purchase a fraction of their bread requirements.  For the first time for a long period we have seen bread queues in the city.  They were visible in the city to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, of course. Everybody knows this except the Minister. If the Minister would walk around the town he would see them too. Everybody knows that queues were there to-day.  I would not be surprised to see them there to-morrow, too.  I saw people huddled in rain yesterday morning, not 120 yards from this House, in a queue about five yards long, the door bolted against them, waiting for whatever hot bread would be available for them.  That is the <Col N="2167" /> situation we have asked the Minister to deal with.  That is the situation we are pointing out to the Minister as one which calls for immediate and drastic remedy, and it is the Minister's job to supply the remedy.</P>
      <P>I believe, with others, that the way in which this whole problem of commodities in short supply should have been dealt with was by a scheme of national registration and by the issue of coupons for the commodities which our people need, with, if it is humanly possible, a bias towards those who are likely to suffer most by a shortage of supplies.  We may have logic-chopping arguments that rationing is a costly scheme.  Cost does not matter compared with honesty.  What is being said to-day is that the rich can get what they like because, when food is scarce, there is not a free market.  The rich can always get commodities.  What is being said to-day is that there is no honest administration in the distribution to the people of the supplies which are available.  Public confidence in the Government is being undermined. Public confidence even in this Institution is being undermined because when the people cannot get bread and cannot get the barest necessaries of life while they see others trading in black markets and getting away with it, public confidence is undermined to an extent that cannot be recovered merely by putting against that a saving of expenditure when expenditure might have avoided that undermining of public confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead with the Minister now, no matter what the cost may be, no matter even how sluggish the administration may be, to devise a national scheme of rationing.  It is clear to everybody that it is only in those circumstances that the poor will get at least the minimum provided for them by the State.  If there is a scarcity of one commodity or another, then we may be sure it is the poor will suffer. The only intelligent thing the Department of Supplies did for a long time was preventing a racket in the sale of fruit at the ports the other day.  If those were allowed out in a free market, <Col N="2168" /> does the Minister think many of them would have been bought by poor people?  Does not the Minister know perfectly well that the poor would never see one of them?  A scheme of fixed prices, a scheme of rationing, will at least ensure that the poor people will get their minimum requirements.  The Minister should have no hesitation whatever in introducing a rationing scheme, because even if it is a costly scheme it is at least an honest one, and now more than ever we want to convince our people that there is honesty in our administration, and that, if there is any bias, it is a bias towards those who need the goods most.  I do not want to be unhelpful in the matter.  I want to tell the Minister he has been on the wrong track.  He has been in the wrong train and he ought to get out of it.  He has been going in the wrong direction.  He ought to get out at the next station. He ought to recognise that he has been in the wrong train.  The correct vehicle is the one labelled &ldquo;rationing for the people&rdquo;.  The issuing of rationing cards will ensure for everybody a fair ration of goods.  If the Minister will do that and get after the black market racketeers he will at least be able to demonstrate to our people that, even though there are difficulties in administration, he is endeavouring to overcome those difficulties.  Probably, the people will then recover some of their faith in representative government, which they have lost because of the way they have been treated in the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>Yes; it is in connection with this matter.  Whether it is that bureaucracy has gone mad or dictatorship is growing in those Departments is a matter for the House to <Col N="2169" /> judge.  Last Wednesday I was cycling through a tenement quarter of the City of Dublin, and I was called by a very poor woman who was having a conversation with another.  This woman told me that she had found difficulty in getting bread.  She showed me one loaf in her arms and she said: &ldquo;That one loaf is for myself and my husband and eleven children.&rdquo; Lest there should be any exaggeration in the matter I asked the other woman what was her position. She gave me her name, and she said: &ldquo;It is true.  I got one loaf this morning and one loaf this evening for myself and my husband and eight children.&rdquo; In a few moments a crowd of women collected, and each of them told me the same story.  This is probably the poorest tenement quarter in Ireland. I refer to Waterford Street and Railway Street.  Leaving the Gresham Hotel, where people talk about prosperity, if you take the first turn to the right and walk around there for five minutes you will see how Dublin lives. Having heard those stories, you would ask yourself: &ldquo;Do we sufficiently praise those people, or do we know how saintly the tenement mothers of Dublin can be?&rdquo;  I took the particulars down on a slip of paper.  Mrs. Gleeson, 154 Summerhill, got one loaf for herself and her husband and eleven children.  She also had three small what she called &ldquo;penny cakes&rdquo;, for which she paid 7d.  Mrs. Noone, 40 Upper Seán MacDermott Street, got one loaf for herself and her husband and seven children.  Mrs. Herbert, from a better area, 39 Clonliffe Avenue, got one loaf for herself and her husband and six children.  I have a note here: &ldquo;Please call to 38 Waterford Street,&rdquo; which is a tenement house with about 18 rooms and, I think, 18 families, a family in every room.  With six or seven or eight children in every family, they got one loaf for each family in the morning and one in the evening.  Mrs. Cooke, 18 Summerhill, got one loaf early in the morning and one loaf in the evening for herself and her husband and eight children.</P>
      <P>The matter worried me quite a lot. I thought: &ldquo;If I call attention to this, will I be accused of creating some kind of atmosphere which will bring about a scarcity?&rdquo;  It worried me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> I went home, and at about half past twelve or twenty minutes to one in the morning I got up and sent the following telegram to An Taoiseach: &ldquo;Unequal bread distribution caused serious hardships in Dublin to-day. Immediate action is necessary to secure equality for all citizens.&mdash;Alfred Byrne.&rdquo;  I took the precaution of sending a copy to every Minister; I sent out twelve telegrams at 1 o'clock in the morning.  Next morning I went around the city, and to my amazement I found queues everywhere&mdash;not in one part of the city alone.  At a shop in the North Strand there was a queue at least 100 yards long.  In Wexford Street there was another queue; in Longford Street there was another queue; in Meath Street there was another queue; there was a queue of at least 200 children in Liffey Street waiting for their turn.  My complaint is that, having sent those telegrams to draw attention to the urgent necessity for doing something quickly, I got only one reply, and that was from the Minister for Agriculture on the 26th: &ldquo;Bread distribution: I am directed by the Minister for Agriculture to acknowledge receipt of your telegram regarding the above matter.&rdquo;  Now, I do say it is not fair to a parliamentary representative of a city like Dublin that he should get only one reply from a Government Department, having sent out 12 telegrams.  I put that to any member of the House and ask him to judge for himself.  In the last two or three days the position has been the same.  The bakers, to give them their due, I understand, made every effort on Friday to send out double supplies both morning and evening.  They did everything humanly possible.  In that connection, let me make another complaint. In all the papers on Saturday morning an announcement appeared from a Government Department, blaming the shopkeepers; throwing the onus on the shopkeepers, and suggesting that they were to blame.  I do not think it is fair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Supplies has caused a special investigation to be made into the position regarding bread deliveries in Dublin,&rdquo; states the Department of Supplies.  &ldquo;It has been found generally that difficulties which had arisen during the week were confined mainly to bakers' shops and were due to over-anxiety on the part of the customers of these shops to obtain supplies. The supplies of bread to all shops were practically normal during the week.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The statement continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Special arrangements are being made by the bakers to maintain more frequent deliveries of bread to their shops so as to meet all reasonable demands throughout the day. The public who normally purchase bread at bakers' shops should therefore have no difficulty in getting supplies at any time during shopping hours.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> If they could not get supplies, the indication is that the shopkeeper was to blame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The small family grocers usually take three or four trays of bread every day.  During that week they did not get the bread and they took that paragraph as throwing the blame on them.  They complain that it was not fair to put the blame on the shopkeepers.  Traders in Crumlin, Cabra, North Strand, Summerhill, Meath Street, Wexford Street and, Longford Street, among other places, have complained to me about that statement, which they took to mean that they failed in their duty to their customers.</P>
      <P>I did not put down my question on the Order Paper to-day without having been very well informed of the situation in Dublin.  The women whom I interviewed told me plainly how they were affected.  They said: &ldquo;Mr. Byrne, our only hope is through ration cards &mdash;give us our ration cards.&rdquo;  The suggestion about rationing is not mine.  I put down a question asking for a system of rationing because all these people feel that it is the only way in which they can get their supplies, and with ration cards they would not have to wait in queues for hours, as I saw women waiting last Friday.  I saw one woman at a baker's shop at 10 o'clock in the morning.  The shop closed at 2 o'clock and by that time she had moved, according to her position in the queue, up to the door of the shop. The shop was closed and it was indicated that it would be re-opened at 4.30.  This woman and several others refused to leave their places in the queue although they were standing in torrents of rain.  They had to remain there in order to get supplies of bread for the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a bread rationing scheme should be made operative immediately.  If the Minister is not aware of the fact, I have reason to believe that one of the biggest bakery concerns in the city is getting ready to organise some system of rationing. That firm recognises that in order to deal fairly with its customers it is necessary to start a rationing scheme, <Col N="2173" /> and I believe it has ordered the printing of cards for the purpose.  There is one bakery about to do something that all the other bakeries should do.  In that way they would help the Government. I think the Minister should put that suggestion to the bakers, that they should do their own rationing. That would go a long way to relieve the present difficulty.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that the time has now come to give hot meals to school children.  An emergency has arisen and he should allow the Corporation to use the equipment that they have installed in the Mansion House, at the expense of the citizens, for the purpose of feeding the poor children.  We saw an advertisement in last Saturday's paper suggesting that we should use more meat, soups and vegetables.  The Corporation are prepared to give 48,000 children nice hot meals if the Minister will only say the word.  These children at the moment are getting small, hard, unpalatable buns.  We are prepared to give them a decent hot meal every day if the Minister will only allow us to do so.  The Minister for Education has recognised the urgency of the matter and he has authorised a break in the school hours in order to allow the children to get a hot meal.</P>

      <P>This is the most important discussion, to my mind, that has been raised in this House since I became a member of it&mdash;since the days of the Provisional Government in 1922.  I think this discussion is most important, far more important than any other discussion that could take place in this House.  It concerns the feeding of the children and the safeguarding of their future food supplies.  I, and the people of the country, think that the time has come when the Government should recognise that all the brains of Ireland are not on their benches.  They ought to look around the Dáil and appeal to the chief Opposition and the Labour Party to help them to form a National Government, a Government that will give satisfaction to the people and that will be prepared to accept full responsibility in every emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will leave it at that.  I requested the Minister to-day to issue ration cards.  Many of the people and at least one bakery in the city are of opinion that that is the only way in which the people will get supplies. In this evening's papers it is reported that Mr. J. E. S. Condon, Clerk of the Dublin Board of Assistance, read a letter from a trader, in which it was stated: &ldquo;I had to refuse food vouchers as bread supplies have been reduced and I could not get sufficient to supply vouchers.  I cannot see <Col N="2175" /> my way to take any more vouchers.&rdquo; These are vouchers issued by the Government, vouchers as good as pound notes or postal orders and issued almost as cash.  Here is a shopkeeper saying he cannot take any more vouchers from necessitous people, the blind, the infirm, the unemployed; that shopkeeper cannot see his way to take any more vouchers from them for bread.</P>
      <P>It is not every shopkeeper who takes vouchers.  The person who is registered to get goods for a voucher cannot go to the shop next door.  That person cannot go to shops in Grafton Street, Henry Street or Mary Street, because those shops will not take vouchers.  The Government should realise that the time has come when they should ask for help from every member of the House.  This matter is a very serious one.  Please God it will get no worse than it is to-day.  I would be very happy to help the Minister in his difficulties.  I know that all the blame must not be put on his shoulders. The Minister for Agriculture should be here to give us an idea of what the future holds in the way of food supplies for this country, especially wheat.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that an opportunity has been given to me to deal with this matter.  I must commend Deputy Mulcahy for having confined himself to the matter of urgent public importance concerning which he gave notice to the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not think his good example in that regard was followed by other Deputies. Deputy Morrissey regarded it merely as an opportunity to make political propaganda against the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation which has arisen in relation to bread and flour supplies is one with which this House, naturally, must be very deeply concerned and in relation to the particular problem of distribution, with which Deputy Mulcahy is concerned, I think it is desirable that the supply position should be stated and understood. A necessary preface to any remarks dealing with the difficulties that a curtailment of deliveries of bread and flour has caused is a review of our supply position.  Quite clearly, this debate, if it is to have any value whatever, must be conducted in the light of that position.  Our supply position is such that a shortage of bread and flour is unavoidable, and Deputies must realise that they cannot talk themselves out of that position.  They should not attempt to delude either themselves or the public into the belief that there is any scheme, any method of rationing, any device which can be suggested by members of the Dáil, which will avoid a shortage of bread or flour.  That shortage is not now avoidable.  If we are lucky, the shortage will be a small one, and the difficulties caused by that shortage will be slight.  If we are unlucky, the shortage will be severe and the difficulties will be considerable.  Unless, however, we avoid this method of approaching the question as if there were some tap that the Government could turn on at will, and out of which would flow an abundance of flour and bread for all the consumers of the country, we will get on to what Deputy Norton calls the wrong track&mdash;he got on to the wrong track himself but I do not mean to follow his example.  Because of the fact that we are now facing a shortage of wheat supplies, we have to restrict consumption of bread and flour.  If we restrict it now, the reduction that it will be necessary to impose on consumers between this and the harvest will be a slight one.  If we delay restricting now, the reduction may be <Col N="2177" /> considerable, and the sole reason why the Government acted in February to impose this restriction was in order to reduce the hardships which the shortage of wheat would inevitably cause.</P>
      <P>When it became apparent that we were not going to get from the harvest the quantity of wheat which the Statistical Return entitled us to expect, the public were duly notified. Now, some Deputies have suggested that the Statistical Return was misleading. I think there is substance for that suggestion.  I do not believe I am incorrect in saying that I was the first to point out in this House the possibility that the Statistical Return, prepared in the usual way and submitted in the usual manner, might prove, in the event, to be inaccurate, but at no time did I lead this House to believe that 290,000 tons of wheat had been secured or was certain to be secured. The earliest occasion upon which the matter was discussed in the Dáil was that mentioned by Deputy Morrissey, November 13, and that I think is also the occasion to which Deputy Norton referred for the purpose of misquoting. On that occasion I said, according to the Official Report, column 607:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No matter what we may do, we will not have more than sufficient flour for human needs in this year. We may not have sufficient.  The estimated yield of 290,000 tons from the Irish wheat crop has not yet materialised; not more than 170,000 tons has yet come in.  There is, of course, still time for the balance to come in&mdash;the harvest was late&mdash;but if the full estimated quantity is not secured, then we will not be able to reach the end of the year with an all-wheaten loaf.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, in the course of a public statement, I made it clear that not merely had the deliveries of wheat to the merchants and millers fallen off seriously, but that the quantities of barley and oats coming on the market were also much less than were anticipated, and that our original plan, of making good the deficiency of wheat by a substitution of barely, did not appear to be capable of being put into effect. Early in January, when the situation <Col N="2178" /> had been reached in which there could be no doubt about the fact that the anticipated 290,000 tons of wheat was not going to come from the Irish harvest, in a statement in the Seanad I told the members of that House that the rationing of bread could not be avoided.</P>
    <P>Now, it does not matter in the least, for the purpose of our present discussion or any plans we may make to deal with our present position, whether the Statistical Return was accurate or not. If the wheat was not grown we would still be without it.  The fact is that only some 210,000 tons of wheat has come from Irish farms to the merchants and millers for manufacture into flour and bread.  Whether more wheat may yet come, it is difficult to say, but that is the total quantity we got to date, and that position left us short to the extent of about 80,000 tons in the quantity estimated to meet the requirements of the Irish people this year&mdash;in fact, something more than that, because the 290,000 tons of wheat that we expected to get was calculated on a dried wheat basis, whereas the 210,000 tons actually received was undried wheat.</P>
    <P>Our position at the moment is this: that the stocks of wheat in the country, in the hands of millers and merchants, if we allowed normal consumption to continue, would be exhausted on the 24th May.  On the basis of the reduced consumption now in operation, that is to say, 80 per cent. of normal, the stocks of wheat here in the country will be exhausted in the middle of June.  If, therefore, no more supplies can be procured from abroad or at home, all deliveries of flour and bread will cease in the middle of June.  However, there is no reason to anticipate that we will not be able to get further supplies of wheat to augment those already within the country, assuming that there is no very exceptional development in the war situation which will prevent us from doing so.  We require, on the basis of present distribution and present extraction to maintain the 80 per cent. deliveries until the completion of the harvest, an additional 80,000 tons of wheat.  Our original estimate was that we could import in the year, in our <Col N="2179" /> own ships, 80,000 tons of wheat.  I hope the repetition of the figures 80,000 will not confuse the minds of Deputies, because they have no relation, one to the other.  Of that 80,000 tons which we expected to be able to import in our own ships, 36,000 tons have already been imported, leaving a balance of 44,000 tons yet to be imported.  I have no doubt that if conditions remain as they are at the present time we will be able to import at least that quantity of wheat.</P>
    <P>I told Deputies before that the channel of importation <i>via</i> Lisbon had been closed to us by reason of the cessation of American sailings to that port.  Grain Importers, Limited, have been endeavouring to make arrangements to procure South American wheat, and shipping for South American wheat to Lisbon, with a view to transhipment to this country.  It appears probable that these arrangements will result in the importation of some quantities by that means.  I have placed on my table a figure of 10,000 tons against all possibilities of importation by that route.  We have available in this country some 20,000 tons of barley which have been purchased by brewers and held by them, in excess of the quantity required for brewing for the home trade, for the purpose of brewing for export.  As Deputies are aware, the malting of barley has been suspended by Government Order and restrictions have been placed upon the exportation of beer and stout.  On the assumption that we prohibit the exportation of beer and stout from this until after the harvest, that 20,000 tons of barley can be made available for human food and, on the basis of 75 per cent. extraction, it corresponds to 15,000 tons of wheat.  I know that customers of Dublin brewers in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain will be seriously inconvenienced if circumstances force upon us the necessity to suspend the exports of brewery products.  I trust that those customers will appreciate that it is only the dire need of our own circumstances, the necessity for keeping up the supply of human food upon <Col N="2180" /> a restricted basis, that will force that course upon us.</P>
    <P>The total of these figures is 69,000 tons, and I think there is a reasonable prospect that we will be able to increase the quantity imported by our own ships over and above that originally estimated to make good the 80,000 tons required to supplement present stocks and permit of the delivery of flour and bread to the extent of 80 per cent. of normal requirements until the next harvest.  If circumstances should be favourable, we will be able to do better than that.</P>
    <P>I do not need to tell Deputies that it is a difficult matter in present circumstances to calculate with any accuracy the quantity of goods that can be carried on our ships.  There are so many circumstances which can impede or delay the transportation of goods by sea in war conditions that no reliable estimate is possible.  The estimate which I have mentioned, while not unduly optimistic, is not conservative either.  We hope to be able to realise it.  If all the cards run in our favour, if we have no misfortunes, and no unexpected delays through a breakdown of the machinery or other causes, we may be able to do better. If we can do better, then the delivery of flour and bread towards the end of the cereal year may be increased beyond the 80 per cent.  But I think it would be unwise to calculate on doing better than I have indicated.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these calculations, or, shall I say, these expectations, of imports from abroad, we can maintain the 80 per cent. delivery of flour and bread until the end of the harvest.  We can do that because we started the restrictions in February.  If we had delayed imposing restrictions on the delivery of flour from the mills until we had a formal rationing scheme ready, or until some other precautions had been taken, we could not have been in that position.  The earlier we started imposing these restrictions, the smaller the restrictions would have to be.  A delay in restricting deliveries from the mills would have involved a much greater cut in supplies later in the year and might, if circumstances were adverse, have left us without flour or bread at all for a portion of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2181" /> We have heard many suggestions in this House and from people outside this House concerning the introduction of a formal rationing scheme for bread. Some Deputies who spoke this evening seemed to convey the impression that they thought it was a new idea.  Surely they are aware of the fact that a national register was compiled and that the necessary census was taken last November?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with that interruption before I go further.  The suggestion has frequently been made that an advantage would have been secured if the national register had been taken at the beginning of the war, or some other date long before any use could be made of it.  That is an entirely mistaken idea.  The whole problem of the utilisation of a national register for rationing purposes is that it begins to get out of date the day after the census is taken.  An estimate prepared by the Statistics Branch would indicate that there are not less than 100,000 changes in population in the course of a year, and, if we had taken a national register a year ago with the intention of utilising it now, there would be 100,000 errors in the register.  It would involve almost as much trouble in rectifying it as the taking of a new census at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am going to bring in the English comparison in a moment. We decided in the month of October that circumstances would arise in which a formal rationing scheme by means of coupons would be necessary or might become necessary in respect of a number of commodities.  Arrangements were made to take a census at the earliest possible date.  A very large number of forms had to be printed, enumerators had to be instructed, and the census was taken in November. Following the taking of the census, the compilation of a national register began.  It is now nearly completed. Arrangements were made for the printing of ration books.  It was a <Col N="2182" /> matter of considerable difficulty to organise both the materials and the equipment for the printing in this country of the ration books.</P>
      <P>It was some time before production got under way, and at present the ration books are being delivered from the printing organisations of the city at the rate of 80,000 per day.  At that rate of delivery, it will be early in April before delivery is completed.  The printing of ration books is not the same thing as printing a number of leaflets.  The distribution of them is not the same thing as distributing a number of leaflets.  Each book, if it is to be of any value at all in connection with the rationing scheme, must bear on the cover and upon every page of the book the identification number of the person to whom it is to be issued, and arrangements must be made to ensure that each person receives the ration book with his number on it and no other and that that book goes to no other person. That involves a very great deal of organisation, and I can hold out no hope that we will have in the hands of every person in this country the ration book appropriate to him and printed specially for him before the end of April.  That will mean that it will be the end of April or early in May before these books can be utilised for a rationing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I do not think Deputies who speak about rationing, or members of the public who lightly urge the adoption of formal rationing in relation to bread or other commodities, fully appreciate all the administrative problems in our circumstances in inaugurating it.  Nevertheless, I think I can say that, despite the limited organisation at our disposal, the limited industrial equipment upon which we can call, the problem of supplies that arises in connection with the introduction of a rationing scheme, supplies of paper and of printing materials, we have done reasonably well in getting ourselves into a position in which we can distribute these ration books to the individual consumers of the country within six months after the beginning of the operation of the process.  In Great Britain they did not <Col N="2183" /> do it in 12 months, and although they were, it is true, operating their system before the war and in a more leisurely fashion than they might have adopted during the war and for, perhaps, a different purpose from what we have in mind, because their main use of the national register has been to enforce military and industrial conscription; nevertheless, that comparison does not redound to the discredit of the organisation which was established here for the purpose.</P>
    <P>It is, however, necessary to get rid of the false idea that the utilisation of rationing books, and the inauguration of a formal rationing scheme to control deliveries of flour and bread will improve the position of the poorer classes of the community.  I think that is an entirely false conception.  I have no doubt if we could make the present voluntary system of rationing work&mdash; and I have no illusions about the difficulty of making it work&mdash;it would be much better for the poorer classes of the community.  Deputies who say here that their main concern is for the poorer classes of the community because of the problems that bread rationing will cause them should be as much concerned as I am to try to avoid the necessity for the control of bread distribution by formal rationing and should be as much concerned as I am to work the present system if we can, because it is the poorer sections who are going to be the main gainers by it.  I believe that much of the difficulty that arose in Dublin and in other parts of the country during last week was due very largely to an unfounded feeling of panic amongst certain members of the community, in the belief that if they did not rush at once to the bakers' shops, they would not be able to get supplies.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I want to say a few words which I think are appropriate to this discussion concerning the duties of Deputies and of the Press in relation to matters of this kind.  I do not like making a comparison of this nature, but I ask Deputies to note the attitude of English public men and English newspapers whenever <Col N="2184" /> the Government of that country appeals specifically to them to take some course of action that is necessary in the public interest.  The newspapers, for a time at any rate, endeavour to conform to the Government's plans, and uniformly report a willingness on the part of everybody to co-operate in those plans.  Whether it is true or not, they succeed in getting into the minds of the people an attitude of acceptance and a willingness to co-operate.  For various reasons, that is not the situation in this country.  When the Government here appeals to members of the public to take a certain course of action in order to ease some national difficulty, our papers are disposed to go out to investigate the extent to which the Government scheme is not working; to report that people find difficulty in conforming to it; that people are refusing to conform to it, and generally to try to create an attitude of discontent and non-co-operation.</P>

      <P>I am asking Deputies, when the Government considers that a course of action by the public is desirable in the public interest, to endeavour for a time, at least, to ensure that the public will act in that way and not to be going around seeking evidence of non-co-operation or difficulties in order to promote public discontent, but to endeavour, for the time at any rate, to give the Government plan an opportunity of working. A very large part of the difficulty that <Col N="2185" /> arose in Dublin in relation to bread supplies was due to the fact that we did not get that atmosphere of acceptance and co-operation created through the co-operation of public representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on the question of rationing and I was expressing the view that the present voluntary system, if we could make it work, will prove to be a much better system than we could operate by means of rationing cards.  Let me say this, that we have got to operate this system until May, and if it is not working by May then, as soon as a ration card is in the hands of everyone, formal rationing will begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements for formal rationing are being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.  They will be brought into operation, if necessary, but if we can utilise the interval to get the other system working, and to avoid the necessity of rationing, I think it will be the better course&mdash;better for the poorer people.  We have in the case of flour and bread a very different problem to deal with from that which arises in relation to tea and sugar.  There is only one class of commodity in each of <Col N="2186" /> these cases, but, in the case of flour and bread, you have three commodities: bread, flour and the other products of flour which are classified under the general name of &ldquo;confectionery&rdquo;.  I considered the desirability of prohibiting the manufacture of confectionery, and I have seen that suggestion made in some newspapers.  I did not take that course, because the quantity of flour used in the manufacture of confectionery is not very considerable, on the one hand, and the amount of employment given in the manufacture of confectionery is comparatively very considerable.  I felt it was undesirable that we should throw several thousand people out of employment unless it was obvious that the prohibition of the manufacture of confectionery was going to be necessary.  We may face that situation yet, and if there is a strong opinion in this House that the manufacture of confectionery should be prohibited, then I am prepared to reconsider the question.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to understand that the term &ldquo;confectionery&rdquo; covers practically everything but batch bread.  All our orders relating to price, weight and control of bread are related only to batch bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot make batch bread out of 100 per cent. flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>People are succeeding in doing it.  If we were to operate a formal rationing scheme, we would have to have a standard ration, and that standard ration would have to be fixed so low that people whose families use a large quantity of bread in comparison with other foods will not get nearly enough, or it will be fixed so high that people who use comparatively little bread will be entitled to get more than they would normally purchase, and there will be waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, any system of rationing bread must involve a basic ration, with probably a supplementary ration in thousands of individual cases.  I mention that as one of the problems which must arise, and one problem which may prove to be insoluble in the case of bread rationing.  Furthermore, we <Col N="2187" /> know that there are persons in the city, at any rate, who have not access to alternative food, and many who have not got adequate cooking facilities. The great advantage bread has over all other food is that it is ready cooked, and consequently the need of people in these areas or of families who possess no cooking facilities is obviously greater than people in other areas with access to other food and adequate arrangements for cooking.  It is going to be a matter of considerable difficulty to relate the needs of one individual family to the needs of another and to allocate the bread ration accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is the problem created by farmers who grow wheat, some of which they retain for family use.  It is clear that any system of distribution of bread should be such as to encourage them to utilise their own products, whether wheaten products or otherwise, rather than that they should go to the shops to buy flour and bread required by other members of the community.  All these factors make the rationing of bread something to be avoided, if we can, but we will have to face it.  If we could avoid it by a voluntary reduction of consumption on the part of those who can afford to do without bread, and by a very slight reduction in the supply of bread to other sections of the community, then I think we would get a better system.  We may be able to avoid the necessity of rationing if we have some lucky break in the matter of supplies from abroad, but I think there is not much likelihood of that. In the two months that remain between now and the time that formal rationing could be adopted I ask Deputies, the Press and everybody who can influence public opinion to endeavour to get this system to work.  It is the better system, and it is all the more desirable to get it to work, because we can hope that the need for rationing at all will disappear in September, and that with the new harvest, we will have sufficient to maintain the full supplies of bread and flour of the community for the next 12 months.  It is possible that there are farmers in the <Col N="2188" /> country who have got more wheat than they need for their own households, or for seed purposes, though Deputy Morrissey thinks it an insult to farmers to suggest that any of them hold more than the barest minimum of their requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. The Minister knows that I did not.  The Minister stated that the sole reason for the shortage was that the farmers were withholding supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These farmers will reach a stage at the end of sowing operations when they will know whether they have more wheat than they require.  When they reach that stage, if they have more than they require for their own households I ask them to sell that wheat to the nearest merchant or mill, so that it may become available for the manufacture and supply of bread for the rest of the community. There may be a temptation amongst some farmers not to do that, but I ask everybody who can influence farmers to endeavour to get them to do it, so that it will become available for the flour mills.</P>

      <P>We have had reports about the difficulties Dublin families experienced last week in obtaining bread.  I am going to speak with knowledge of the facts.  Deputy Linehan suggested that I did not know what was happening.  I will deal with the facts, because my information comes from reports from reliable <Col N="2189" /> officials of the Government.  I am not depending on rumours.  I am talking about official reports that I can depend on.  I know that a number of rumours were circulating in Dublin last week, some of them of a most alarming nature, and I think it is desirable that these rumours should be scotched at once.  I heard about bread-vans being attacked and overturned, and shops looted.  Nothing of the kind happened. I should like that fact to be known. It is undesirable that a campaign of rumours should be going on, and the public mind disturbed in consequence. I have asked the police authorities for full reports.  I asked for full reports of such instances, and there was only one which came within that category in a shop in Crumlin, where some people waiting to be served went behind the counter and helped themselves, but paid for the bread, so that rumours circulating in the city had no foundation in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy try to behave himself and not interrupt?  It is true that difficulties arose in Dublin last week, but they were practically confined to the bakers' own shops. Deputy Byrne mistakenly accused me of blaming the grocers' shops.  I did nothing of the kind.  On the contrary, from the reports I received it was obvious that very little if any difficulty arose at ordinary grocers' shops at all.  The problem was almost entirely confined to shops operated by bakery concerns, and these difficulties were attributable, in a number of cases, to people being anxious to get supplies early, and they thought the surest way was to get them at the bakers' shops.  If they were refused full supplies by grocers, they thought they could supplement them at bakers' shops.  The general feeling of uneasiness created in the minds of certain members of the public led to that rush to the bakers' shops which resulted in queues.  I had the position carefully examined. There is a number of outdoor inspectors continuously in touch with the position and, as a result of information that came to me, I felt we <Col N="2190" /> would solve the difficulty if we could arrange for deliveries of bread to the bakers' shops to take place more frequently. In the normal course, every baker delivers bread to these shops twice a day.  I have seen small queues outside these shops in normal times waiting for the fresh bread at 4 o'clock.  The infrequent delivery to the bakers' shops led to the formation of queues.  With the more frequent delivery of bread to these shops, that situation began to ease, and to-day I received reports from the outdoor officers that the queues had disappeared from the bakers' shops, because the steps taken to make sufficient bread available had restored a feeling of confidence amongst the class of people served by these shops.  At several shops this morning, a number of customers refused to take bread that was carried over from last evening, as they wanted bread that was made this morning.  That indicates that there is no shortage.</P>

While I have no desire to cast any reflection at all on the way in which the bakers tried to discharge their responsibilities, in practice their efforts had to be co-ordinated with those of my Department to get rid of the difficulty.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary to impose further restrictions on hotels, restaurants, and similar establishments. At present these consumers of bread are restricted upon the same basis as everybody else, that is, to 80 per cent. of their normal supplies; but in order to ease the position in certain districts, it will be necessary to secure additional supplies by reducing deliveries to hotels and restaurants.  I think in all the circumstances that is not unreasonable.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the fact in one of his questions <Col N="2193" /> that many people do not buy bread, but flour.  That is true.  The bakers, for the purpose of increasing the quantity of bread available, had been reducing their deliveries of shop flour to their customers over and above the 80 per cent. required by the instructions.  I have arranged with the bakers that they will resume the delivery of shop flour to persons who normally purchased flour from them in order to provide them with 80 per cent. of their normal requirements.  I think that the problem which Deputy O'Higgins had in mind will be very much eased in consequence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked under what authority these regulations were being enforced.  They are being enforced under the authority of an officer from my Department, the Controller of Flour.  That is not a recent appointment, as one of the newspapers seemed to assume, but an appointment which dates from the commencement of the war, 1939. He was appointed by the Government; he has full control over all supplies of bread and flour in the country, and is entitled to direct their allocation in any way he thinks necessary.</P>

      <P>That is all I am going to say at the moment on the matter. I should like to point out also that bread and flour traders are required, as from Monday last, to operate under licence only.  No trader, who is not in possession of a licence, will be entitled to engage in the sale of bread or flour.  These licences will be continued, in the case of every trader, only if such traders are found to be carrying out the general intentions of the rationing scheme and the specific instructions they may receive from time to time.  In the case of any trader who is found to be flagrantly disobeying instructions or acting in a partial manner in the allocation of supplies amongst his customers, the licence will be withdrawn apart from any other penalties to which the trader may become liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2194" /> Deputy Byrne referred to a report which appeared in this evening's newspapers concerning a trader who refused to cash bread vouchers.  I saw that report myself and it was the first intimation I had received that any such problem had arisen.  Speaking from recollection, I think that trader has already broken the law.  The regulations relating to the distribution of food vouchers do not give him the discretion which he appears to claim for himself.  In any event, I want to make it clear that persons, to whom food vouchers are issued, are entitled to receive bread against vouchers from any trader who is a bread retailer.  If it be reported to me, and I find that the report is true, that any trader refused to give bread in exchange for a food voucher, his licence to deal in bread will be withdrawn for the duration of the war.  It is necessary that these stringent regulations should be imposed on traders who are the necessary channels of distribution for this essential commodity.</P>
    <P>I disagree entirely with the suggestion frequently made by some public speakers and sometimes in the Press that many of the difficulties of distribution and excessive prices are due to traders.  In my opinion, the majority of traders are conscientiously trying to do the best they can under very difficult circumstances.  It is only a small number who take the opportunity of getting rich quick by disobeying the law or charging excessive prices.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to notice that one district justice has, at long last, risen to the point of sending to jail a person convicted of the offence of charging over and above the fixed price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree.  I think I have dealt with all the problems that have been raised.  I should like to say, in conclusion, that even if we had ration books in the hands of consumers and had been in a position to control the distribution of bread on the basis of these books from the 23rd February, the same difficulties <Col N="2195" /> would almost inevitably have arisen during the first week.  The opinion which some people hold that all problems disappear with rationing is altogether false.  People who make that contention cannot be familiar with the reports which frequently appear in the English newspapers.  From these reports it would appear that people are frequently unable to obtain supplies for which they hold the necessary coupons.  To a far greater extent than anything yet experienced in this country black-market activities have developed, to such an extent indeed that in some countries it is stated to be almost impossible to get supplies outside the black market, judging by the reports that appear in their newspapers. None of these problems of distribution is going to be solved completely, no matter how elaborate the system of rationing introduced may be. They will persist as long as human nature persists.  In fact, I think it is true to say, judging by the reports which appear in various papers as to conditions in Europe, these defects of control whether they relate to the prices charged or to illegal sales, are less pronounced in this country than in most European countries.  I have seen reports to the effect that in certain towns on the Continent of Europe, shops were closed because nobody would sell at the controlled price or in the controlled quantities and the whole supplies go through illegal channels at exorbitant prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now ten minutes past nine and I am not going to take up the time of the House at any great length.  I listened to the Minister's speech and I regarded it as a very fair survey of the supply situation, but I think the Minister erred more than any other speaker in ignoring the specific terms of the motion.  Earlier in the debate, the Chair called attention to the fact that the motion was specifically confined to the question of distribution of bread.  The Minister&mdash;and I rather welcome it&mdash;went more fully than any other speaker into what goes to make bread, namely, wheat, flour, etc., and into the results which might be secured under a system of rationing. He did not deal at any length with the specific question put, namely, how he proposed more equitably to distribute the 80 per cent. that is available, pending a rationing scheme.</P>
      <P>Everyone of us saw the very deplorable and pathetic scenes in this city for the ten or eleven days up to yesterday. According to the Minister&mdash;and I believe him&mdash;it was not because the bread was not there, not because the flour was not there, and not because the shopkeepers were not agreeable and willing to serve their customers. Why had we that panic, that chaotic and lamentable state of affairs here? The answer, in all fairness, is because of the Minister's radio broadcast.  I am not blaming the Minister.  He says: &ldquo;I am entitled to get in touch with the people and to appeal to them directly.&rdquo;  Of course he is, but he is not entitled to ignore this Assembly as the starting point.  If the Minister, 24 hours before his radio broadcast, when this Dáil was rising with nothing to do, had devoted 20 minutes of his time and of the time of the Dáil to telling us, and the people through us, that he found that the situation was such that it would be necessary to restrict the consumption of bread and flour to four-fifths, questions would have been put and questions would have been answered by him, as they were to-night, and there would have been no panic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's statement, <Col N="2197" /> and it was my own view of the situation for the last week and a half, that the whole pathetic situation arose from the fact that the alarm spread, that people thought they would not get bread and that every woman wanted to be ahead of the other in order to provide for her children, and quite rightly.  I drove through the Minister's constituency every morning of that period, as I do every morning except Sunday.  I drove by a big bread place at the end of the Coombe &mdash;one of Kennedy's shops&mdash;and every morning up to this morning, at 9.30 or 9.45, there was a long, weary, pathetic queue, four or six deep, of scantily-dressed women and quarter-dressed children, with policemen keeping them in order, and every one of us in our big coats, our mufflers and our motor cars remembers what the weather was like for the last fortnight. There was a wind that would cut through steel and that, multiplied over every bread shop in Dublin, was the appalling condition in which people lived for the past fortnight.</P>
    <P>There is no good in saying to people retrospectively: &ldquo;There was enough bread in the country; there was enough flour in the country,&rdquo; if, either owing to the panic stampede created by a radio broadcast, or for any other reason, that bread was not within reach of the customer and could not be procured by the customer.  There are many people who had to queue up, but there are many people who were too busy, or too old, or too feeble to queue up, and these people had to go without. There were thousands of people who, as I said, relied on flour and were not bread customers in any shop and for the past ten or eleven days they had to go absolutely without bread.  There was no good in talking of a reduction to four-fifths in their cases.  They had not been buying bread and four-fifths of nothing is nothing.  They had no business going anywhere for bread. They were the people who had changed residence, the newly weds, the people who were not customers anywhere. Whether a shopkeeper was to give four-fifths or not, they were entitled to exactly four-fifths of nothing.  All that proportion of the people of the city <Col N="2198" /> went entirely without up to about last Saturday.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to people yesterday morning refusing stale bread. On Thursday or Friday of last week, in my own house, I and every other member of my family would have been very pleased to see stale bread.  We were in the position of people who did not deal with a bread-van since last June. We were buying flour and baking. When this panic arose, no flour would be sold.  We did not buy in bags or half bags like country people&mdash;we bought in half stones.  And there was definitely none.  That is a situation out of which good or evil may arise.  Good may arise out of the deplorable situation of the last week and a half if we all learn lessons from it.  In war time, people's nerves are frayed.  There is a tension in the atmosphere and it is the easiest thing in the world to create a panic.  The right way to create a panic, in my opinion, is to talk right into the homesteads of the people without any preliminary warning.  The right way to stop a panic is to do your first talking here, where there can be reasonable discussion by question and answer, and where the whole situation will be brought out, if not in a Minister's statement, then in a Minister's statement followed by question, discussion and supplementary question.</P>
    <P>I should be inclined to say that if, a fortnight ago, we had had the discussion that we have had here this evening, and if you cut down the bread and flour by even more than you have found it necessary to cut it down, there would have been no stampede and no panic whatever.  It is the method by which it was done that caused the panic.</P>
    <P>I am not condemning the Minister for that.  He cannot know all the people; he cannot know how the people will take everything.  It was a road which he was perfectly entitled to go, but it is a road which I would advise him not to go so directly in future.  A little discussion here, and then there can be all the radio talking he wants on top of it.  I accept the Minister's statement that 80 per cent. is available, <Col N="2199" /> that it was available to the shopkeepers and that it was given periodically, but the Minister has to accept that at least 10 per cent.&mdash;I will not and never do stand pat on a figure, but I can say a considerable percentage&mdash;of the people &mdash;not, as Deputy Norton seemed to imply, the poor only&mdash;of poor and rich went without bread and flour since last Monday week.</P>
    <P>Definitely, as far as one person can see it, the situation is normal to-day. Now, that is not because it was not there.  It was purely because a panic was created.  The panic arose out of the Minister's well-intentioned broadcast. That is clear.  If, instead of barking at people who are anxious enough to help, if not the Minister, certainly the State as a whole, and through it the people, the Minister and his colleagues would examine their own actions and their results, and not be so critical and sensitive when they are dealing with others, it would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>I think it was definitely unfair and uncalled for, in view of the support this Government has got from strong political opponents, for any Minister to get up in this, the third year of the war, and say that it would be better if, in future, Deputies developed a more helpful spirit, instead of going around promoting discontent.  We could promote discontent just as effectively as the Minister did over a period of ten years if we set about it, and we could reap the harvest of votes resulting from the dimensions of that discontent. There were plenty of opportunities for doing it.</P>
    <P>We have not done it and the Minister knows it.  In every serious situation, not always in public but more frequently in private when there were no kudos or publicity to be got out of it, the Minister and the officers behind him were told of difficulties which, as far as we could see, were there and warned them of them.  We were there to help, so that to get up and accuse Deputies in this Parliament was, I repeat, uncalled for.  We have here a Party Government, a Parliament made up of warring Parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> While we have national Governments over the greater part of the world to-day, there is no Government&mdash;no national Government anywhere&mdash;that has got the same amount of support that a Party Government in this country has got.  That remark was uncalled for, and it might do more harm than the Minister reckons if we are to take it that it was meant seriously as representing the mind of the Government.</P>
    <P>What were the activities of the Deputies?  Deputy Mulcahy, one of the Deputies for the City of Dublin, a Front Bench member of this Party, and a vice-president of this organisation, went privately and, without any publicity, saw the master bakers.  He also saw the big retailers and people whom he regarded as reliable and responsible consumers.  He saw them in private and took down their statements of the position.  Did he go out and hold a meeting to create and to promote discontent?  No.  He sat down and wrote to the Minister and to the Geann Comhairle asking to have the position discussed here.  When a Deputy is interested in the food supply of the people, when there are queues which, added together, are miles long in the City of Dublin, and when he asks to have that discussed here in the people's Parliament, is it the Minister's suggestion that the Deputy is then promoting discontent?</P>

      <P>There were three Deputies moving amongst the people to get a picture of the situation&mdash; Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Norton, and then they came here to discuss it.  We are not elected to represent the Minister, the Department of Supplies or the Government. We are elected to voice, in this Assembly, the grievances and the difficulties of the public, and we would not be doing our duty if we did not look for an opportunity to give expression to those difficulties and those grievances here.  It ill-becomes a member of the Government to point to the activities described by the Minister for Supplies as conduct calculated to promote discontent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of rationing as if none of us saw the difficulties of it, or the objections to it, except himself. Any person that thinks out a rationing system, and the results of it, can see certain difficulties in it and many objections to it.  The only time when any Government or any country will decide on a rationing system is when they see the alternative, namely, some getting and some going without.  It may be many getting and some going without, or some getting and many going without, but whatever it be, it is only when they see the alternative&mdash;the lesser of two evils&mdash;that any people will agree to accept a rationing system.  The second point is the understanding that whatever the allowance is, be it large or little, everybody, irrespective of influence, wealth, class or residence, will get the same entitlement.  The experiences of people here and in certain <Col N="2202" /> towns outside the city during the past fortnight would certainly make any person who was opposed to rationing plump for it.</P>
    <P>It may have been a very wise move on the Minister's part, if a rationing jump has to be taken sometime in the near future, to discover that there is no easier road to take than to have the people yelling for what you are going to give them.  If that was the idea behind the radio broadcast, with its sequel, then I congratulate the Minister on his judgment and on his knowledge of the people because, unquestionably, if you had a referendum in the City of Dublin any time last week for or against rationing, there would be no odds as to what the result would be.</P>
    <P>
      <i>It being the time appointed for the interruption of business, the motion lapsed.</i>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If he had it a month or two earlier, the result would be very questionable.  By the stampede and the panic and the scramble for bread everyone in this city is convinced that there is no way out but that of rationing.  That attitude will make rationing easier when it comes. If we have the Department of Supplies operating this very big Government machine, I cannot understand why there is not some broader basis and some more comprehensive scheme to feed the people of this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hold&mdash;and I think very few members of my profession hold&mdash;that bread is the very essential that it is popular to regard it as.  Bread, or a reasonably sound substitute, is necessary. Unfortunately, we had a comparatively poor harvest last year: the old people tell me, however, that for a very considerable number of years there never was a better potato harvest. Here we have the extraordinary position of people in the capital city of this tiny island&mdash;where we are responsible for the administration and direction of only four-fifths&mdash;going <Col N="2203" /> either without food or without the main article of food or having it drastically reduced, while at the same time potato pits of dimensions never before seen in the month of March are in every second tillage field of the country and farmers are telling you they are worth half nothing.  I was told that as late as Saturday last in my own constituency, while I myself in the City of Dublin am paying 1/4 a stone&mdash;the highest price I ever paid.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an Executive armed with emergency powers, and such Government machinery that it is only necessary for an individual within the machine to make up his mind that a thing should be done and an order can be brought out to make it the law immediately, then, is the Government to be congratulated on the manner in which it has been looking after the food supplies of the immense population here in this capital city?  One would imagine that, if we could not have wheat we could not have bread at all, that we were living in a country where the natural food of the people never was oaten bread, in a country where, if wheaten porridge could not be got there was no such thing as oaten porridge.  One would imagine we were living in a country that did not enjoy the distinction of having its emigrants referred to as &ldquo;spuds.&rdquo;  We are in the greatest potato-producing country in Europe and the potatoes are there, according to the farmers, worth half nothing, buried in the ground during the months of greatest frost while the people here in the City of Dublin are either starving or confronted with the fear of starvation.</P>
    <P>It is a psychological fact that, if we had unlimited exhibits of comparatively cheap potatoes here for the last fortnight, it would mean that many people would not worry a bit if they were told there would be no bread for the next 100 days.  When the ordinary individual, however, is harnessed and bossed and bullied as a private soldier, with the fuel for his transport doled out, with the machinery of Government telling people what they can and cannot carry in their lorries, with <Col N="2204" /> their trains restricted and cut down, it is necessary for the Government to bring the people and the food together. Normally it is the businessman, the farmer and the consumer who would deal with that, but when you break down the bridges connecting the consumer with the food it is the business of the Government to bring the consumer and food together.</P>
    <P>All this alarm and uneasiness with regard to the bread situation would be considerably reduced if the Government would give some evidence of considering this matter, not in the very narrow field of wheat at 75 per cent., 85 per cent. or 100 per cent., from the Irish acre, or of wheat from America. They should give evidence that they are thinking along alternative lines of food supply of some kind.  More potatoes have been fed to stock here since the first week of January than both stock and humans would normally consume in this country in four or five months. That will go on to-morrow, the day after to-morrow, and the week after next week, as the potatoes cannot be relied on to keep.  If the Minister is to do anything with regard to the food supplies for this city, I would ask him to do it quickly, to do it without panicky radio announcements, and, if the situation is at any time worse than it is now, to remember what happened last week and the week before, and to come and make his announcements here in moderate terms, so that there may be a moderate discussion, and after that he can go to the radio and tell the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A new technique has grown up in this country whereby the Government that makes a mess of matters can say that it is not its fault.  The Taoiseach can get up at Ennis and say it is not his fault.  The Minister can say here to-day that there is no bread, but it is not his fault; there is no wheat, but it is not his fault; there is panic, but it is not his fault.  I put it to the Minister, in no destructive sense, that in cases where we find ourselves at fault we must correct those faults in order to be better in the future.  The reason there is no wheat is perfectly simple. <Col N="2205" /> In 1931, if you put 500,000 acres of Irish land under wheat, you would have got 4,000 barrels of wheat.  The grow more wheat policy has reduced the yield per acre of wheat.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that last year's was a bad crop.  Last year's was an excellent harvest except for wheat.  The yield of wheat went down to five barrels an acre, and this year, without artificial manures, the yield of wheat will go down to four and a half barrels an acre for all the land that is being used for wheat.  The Minister says: &ldquo;We have no bread, but it is not my fault.&rdquo; Was not the Minister asked in this House to establish a rationing system nine months ago?  Did he not reject a motion by Senator Hayes in the Seanad 12 months ago, asking for a national register to be established?  There is not the least use getting up and telling this Government that all these disasters are not their fault, because it is their fault, and if they will not correct these faults now, we are going to have a very much worse situation next winter.</P>
      <P>I am telling the House now you cannot get wheat.  I believe you will get 600,000 acres sown under wheat this year, because the people are prepared to do all they can to help the Government; but 600,000 acres will not produce the wheat required for our people.  Now is the time to face that fact.  We have got to support the bread supply for next year not exclusively with wheat, but by seeing that we have sufficient oats and barley to back up the wheat supply, in order to secure that there will be an adequate supply of bread.  Why are there no oats and barley available at the present time? I will tell you.  It is because the Government of Eire has fixed a price in this country of 37/- for malting barley, when the same barley is being sold in Great Britain for 130/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>What we have been discussing for the last hour is the reason for the scaricity and how to spread our scarce supplies over the people equitably.  I am telling the House now, and there is no escape from it, that unless we take energetic measures to get supplies which will make it possible to spread the supply of bread over the people in reasonably ample quantity next winter, no administrative measures will meet the situation.  You cannot get it in home-grown wheat because the land is so exhausted without artificial manures it will not produce the wheat but you can get it if you will take steps now to add to the millers' grist sufficient quantities of barley and to make available to certain sections of the community alternative supplies of oats.  There is no other way of securing equitable distribution of bread feeding-stuffs or the substitutes referred to.  If you want to get adequate supplies of barley and oats wherewith to prop up the wheat supply, the only way you can get it is to take the price control off oats and barley now and tell the people to go out and sow all the oats and barley they can and, if possible, produce a surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;Give us constructive suggestions to overcome this difficulty.&rdquo;  His difficulty is that he has not got enough bread to give the people.  I beg of him to get it out of his head that that is not his fault.  It is his fault, but that does not matter so much if he will put himself right in the future.  I am telling him that no administrative measure <Col N="2207" /> will spread the prospective wheat supply of this country next year over the people in such a way as to preserve the public peace.  The only hope we have is to get a food supply sufficient to give the people either bread or an adequate substitute.  The only means of getting that is to ensure that the people will grow sufficient barley and oats so that it will be available to the Government to ration with the wheat, and the only conceivable way they will get that is to take the price control off oats and barley now.  Some people say that if we do that we ought to have a minimum price fixed for these two cereals.  I say no.  Encourage the farmer to grow oats and barley and to get the best price he can for them. It is quite possible that inducement will be sufficient to produce a surplus of oats and barley next September. If there is a surplus, God be praised, because at once the primary food problem of our people is over.  The primary food problem is the problem of bread or bread substitute.  With sufficient barley and oats, that problem is solved, and it is so easy to get it if people will open their eyes.</P>
      <P>Why is it that at the present moment you cannot get oatmeal in this country? The reason is that no farmer will sell oats to a registered buyer at the Government price.  Oats are being sold in abundance at any market to-day at 23/- per cwt.  Why should the men who can get that price sell to an oatmeal buyer at the fixed price of 18/- for seed and 10/8 for ordinary oats?  Because the Government have perpetrated that egregious folly of fixing the idiotic price of 10/8, there is no oatmeal.  If we had oatmeal in the country at the present time we could do without 20 per cent. of the flour and that flour could be diverted to feed the city population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a grain of oatmeal to be got in any country shop in Ireland, with the result that people who have lived largely on oatmeal porridge are clamouring for flour and bread which they normally would not consume and would not require.  What is the use of pretending we can separate all these <Col N="2208" /> things and put them in air-tight compartments? If there is a scarcity of oatmeal in Killorglin, it may affect the scarcity of bread in Gloucester Street. If there is abundance of flour in Connaught, it may be drawn upon to meet the emergency of the city; but you cannot draw on Connaught to relieve Dublin if there is just as great a shortage in Connaught as in Dublin.  My submission is that part of the shortage in rural Ireland, which in turn affects the City of Dublin, is created by the fact that, through the folly of the Government, they have robbed the rural population of the oatmeal on which it largely depended.  Now is the time to mend your hand.</P>
    <P>We hear that Messrs. Guinness are to be deprived of their right to export porter, and the Minister tells us&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister said it in so many words&mdash;that he would seek to negotiate a swop with Great Britain of wheat for porter; that he would be obliged to say to the British: &ldquo;If you cannot fill up the gap, we have got to use the barley for bread manufacture in Ireland, and so we cannot export porter.&rdquo;  Would this House believe that 12 months ago I went to the Taoiseach myself with a memorandum urging him to offer barley in exchange for wheat? I went to the Minister for Supplies.  I went to the Minister for Agriculture.  I pointed out to them that they could go with their heads erect to the British and say: &ldquo;We are not asking for any concession.  We are offering you 25 cwt. of barley for every ton of wheat you will give us.&rdquo;  We could have got from the British 130/- per barrel for that barley and pay them the market price for wheat, and we would have conferred on the British a benefit of nearly 200,000 tons of shipping.  They would have brought across wheat or barley from abroad.  We were prepared to give them one and a quarter times as much barley as we got wheat from them, so that every time they executed that transfer with us, they saved 5 cwt. in each ton of shipping space on the Atlantic.  It could not be done then.  It was not worth looking into.  It could not be operated.  The administrative difficulties were impossible.  But now they are trying to swop porter for <Col N="2209" /> wheat.  What is porter but barley?  Is that not true?  Will either of the Ministers deny this?</P>

      <P>Who said so?  Did not the Minister say so?  Was not the Minister lamenting to-day that he could not send porter to the public-houses in Northern Ireland and Great Britain because we wanted the barley to make bread?  Do not try to pull any more wool over the eyes of this House. If the Minister would be frank and honest with us, we would get somewhere. Again he is trying to make the bargain too late.  Very well then.  Let us forget the egregious follies of this Minister for the moment and pray to God they will not be perpetrated again.  You have got a chance now to provide that in the coming year the chaos which has obtained in this year will not recur.  Get the wheat and barley and oats grown.  Bargain with Great Britain for an exchange of wheat for any surplus of barley.  Use part of your barley to prop up the available wheat.  Make up your minds to this: if you get 600,000 acres of wheat you will not get sufficient wheat from them to provide our people with 100 per cent. or 90 per cent. extraction in the coming year.  Open your eyes to that now, because if you do open your eyes now you can take effective measures to make up the deficit with barley and oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this. Deputy O'Higgins expressed amazement, as indeed he might, that potatoes are allowed to rot in the <Col N="2210" /> fields while 1/4 a stone is being charged for them here.  Does Deputy O'Higgins know that potatoes are being converted into industrial alcohol in four factories in this country at the present time, and that potatoes are being exported from this country at the present time?  Am I not right?  I put it to the Minister that we suggested to him two years ago that he should take his infernal industrial alcohol factories and convert them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy's point?  Is it that we have not got enough potatoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins says that potatoes are costing 1/4 a stone in Dublin.  Why are not the potatoes being brought into Dublin instead of being converted into industrial alcohol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it suggested that there is a scarcity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We asked the Minister two years ago to convert his absurd alcohol factories into factories for the conversion of potatoes into flour.  If he had done that we should now have supplies of potato flour, and potato flour represented about 40 per cent. of the German diet in the last war.  I do not know whether machinery for the conversion of potatoes into flour can now be got.  It it cannot, that is not the Minister's fault, but at least he ought to realise that it was his fault that it was not done before, and faults of that kind have landed us where we are.  He should now accept Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion about consulting this House, so that he will not be plunged into any further folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advice to him now, even assuming that all the wheat which it is possible to sow is sown this year&mdash;and I think everybody is doing his best to persuade the farmers to do that&mdash;is that he should make up his mind to the fact that he is not going to get sufficient wheat to keep us going.  The only effective solution is to take the price control off.  Let the brewers of this country pay the Irish farmer the same <Col N="2211" /> price for barley that is being paid to the farmers in Great Britain.  Let the surplus of the barley produced as a result of that extra attraction in price be used for human consumption.  Take the control off oats, and let oats find its natural level.  If the farmers get 18/- a cwt. in the markets of the country, that will become a crop which every farmer will desire to grow, and will be able to grow in abundance.  With those two subsidiaries we are perfectly safe, and there is no further need for anxiety.  The problem in the next eight weeks may be difficult, but we will get through it if we have the assurance that it will not recur.  We can get through anything provided we have an assurance that appropriate measures will be taken to provide against a recurrence; but it is enough to break the heart of anyone to be led from one disaster into another.  This country is involved in no military enterprise at the present time. Those countries that are have the crushing experience of going from one military disaster to another.  We have an economic crisis here, but we will get through it provided the people's confidence in their leaders' capacity to bring them safely through similar difficulties in the future is maintained intact. I believe there is enough courage and prudence in this House to meet any dangers that lie ahead, but all Parties in the House require to lend a hand.</P>
    <P>My experience of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party is that they were always glad and willing to lend a hand where the national interest demanded it, and I am quite confident that they still are.  Every member of the Independent Party and every member of the Labour Party in this House is prepared to lend a hand if the Government is ready to make some effort to avoid the miseries into which we have been plunged in the past.  Oats and barley are the solution of your present problem, and, if you take the measures requisite to secure adequate supplies of those, you need have no fears for the future, on the bread front at any rate.  If you do not take those steps, you will be confronted next year with a crisis far more acute than the present one.</P>

      <P>At the end of the Minister's speech I asked him whether he was going to deal with bread and flour distribution as affecting the country, and he told me that if I knew the motion I would know he was not expected to deal with it.  As far as I know the terms of the motion, and as far as the mover is concerned, there is no restriction in the motion confining the discussion to Dublin.  The Minister, in his speech, attempted to justify what is being done to solve the problem of the distribution of bread and flour by referring to a meeting that was held to-day between officials of the Department of Supplies and representatives of the Dublin master bakers. There has been a situation in many places in the country that was equally bad as the situation in Dublin.  I wonder did the people who sent the Minister all the accurate information he possesses tell him about the villages in this country that were completely without bread for two or three days after his broadcast, villages that have no bakeries of their own, villages that are entirely dependent on van supplies from towns 20 or 30 miles away.  There was no possibility of getting bread supplies by van because those towns had not enough to supply themselves.  I wonder has the Minister his inspectors walking around the country as he has them walking around Dublin, and if he has, did they give him information about that sort of thing?</P>
      <P>The Minister knows nothing about the situation in regard to flour and bread in the country.  If he did, he would not make the extraordinary statement he did make in his broadcast that he was going to reduce the flour supply to 80 per cent. of our supplies in 1940.  There was not a retail shopkeeper in this country who got, in 1941, 80 per cent. or even 60 per cent. of what he got in 1940.  There was not a labourer or a farmer in this country who got from a retailer, in 1941, 80 per cent. of what he got in 1940.  The people who were in the habit of coming into a shop once a fortnight and buying a half-sack of flour would have been lucky from September of last year if they got two or three stone.</P>

Has the Minister any idea of how the small country shopkeeper operates his flour supply at the moment?  People come in and get a stone and a half or two stone weekly&mdash; people who used to get a half-cwt. or a cwt. before.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (1) the names of the several companies, corporations and concerns in which civil servants hold office as (a) directors, (b) managers or officials; (c) advisers; (2) the names of the civil servants holding such posts, and (3) the remuneration and/or allowances, if any, paid to each such civil servant in respect of each such post.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated with the Official Report.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be contrary to public policy to give the names of individual civil servants, but particulars of the rank of the civil servants in question and of the Departments in which they are serving have been given in the statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands, since the coming into operation of the Land Act, 1933, how many applications have been received for the reduction of annuities under Section 37 of that Act; in how many of these cases has relief been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of cases in which relief has been granted by way of reduction of annuities under the provisions of Section 37 of the Land Act, 1933, is 35.  The total number of applications made to the Land Commission for relief under this section is not available, as no general record of such applications has been kept by the Land Commission, each case being treated separately on its merits by reference to the various branches dealing with tenanted land, untenanted land, Congested Districts Board estates, estates commissioner's estates and holdings vested under the older Land Acts.  Section 37, Land Act, 1933. does not provide for the making of applications or petitions, but simply empowers the Land Commission to apportion the annuities on submerged lands.  In order to ascertain the figure which the Deputy desires, it would be necessary to examine a large number of files scattered among the various branches of the Land Commission, and in present circumstances no staff is available for such special work.</P>
