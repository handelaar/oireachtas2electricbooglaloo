    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the extension of unemployment, the continuous exodus of our citizens in search of work elsewhere, and the rapid deterioration of the economic condition of the country, he is now prepared to set up an economic council to formulate plans for the reintegration of our economy and to advise the Government in regard to their implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 11th March, 1941, the Deputy moved a motion in terms somewhat similar to those of his question requesting the Government to set up an economic council.  That motion was opposed by the Government for reasons stated by Ministers who took part in the debate, and was defeated on a vote of the House. The reasons so stated still hold good and the attitude of the Government to the proposal remains unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there has been a very serious and very rapid deterioration in the economic position since that period, and that the assurances then given that Ministers were dealing with the economic problems which at that time called for consideration, and that their efforts have not, in fact, eased the economic difficulties referred to, will the Taoiseach now reconsider the Government's attitude towards the proposal that was then submitted and <Col N="1818" /> endeavour to create some type of organisation which will make an effort to stem the still more serious deterioration which threatens in the immediate future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as any deterioration that can be stemmed by an organisation is concerned, we have that organisation in our present Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What then is causing thousands of young, healthy, able-bodied Irishmen to go to Britain to search for work which, apparently, is not available for them here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions which caused these things will not be altered by setting up an economic council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is prepared to consider the establishment of a department of social welfare to take over and co-ordinate the functions relating to social welfare now carried out by a variety of Government Departments and Ministers; and, if so, whether it is his intention to introduce proposals at an early date for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the setting up of a Department of State in which the administration of a number of social services would be concentrated was considered more than once by the Government.  Such a step would be attended by many difficulties and it is not clear that it would result in any economy or increased efficiency in the administration of the services commensurate with the disturbance of existing arrangements that would be involved. The Government did not, accordingly, proceed with a detailed investigation of the matter, and the present circumstances <Col N="1819" /> are not favourable for the prosecution of such an investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say, in view of the fact that most other countries have co-ordinated these social services under one Department, what set of circumstances prevents a similar co-ordination of these activities under one Department here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These services can very naturally be administered by the Departments that are at present administering them, and any co-ordination that has to be effected will be effected by the Government as a whole.  In other countries they have different organisations.  If we knew in greater detail what is done in other countries, it is possible we would find that all these services are not concentrated in the one Department either. For my own information I had compiled lists of services of a social character that are administered by several Departments and they fall in the main very naturally to be administered by these Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what similarity there is in services such as the control of sewerage, which is undertaken by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and widows' and orphans' pensions, which is also controlled by his Department? Where is the similarity there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that in one form or another it would be a question of Governmental activities of a social character.  It is fundamentally a question of activities of a social character. I have a list here but I think, Sir, that if I were to go into this matter it would become a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say which, if any, of the Departments dealing with the matters to which he has referred has gone into the matter of a careful estimate of maintaining families, say, of varying sizes, under ordinary conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I did not catch what the Deputy said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach speaks of social welfare, I take it that the position with regard to the family, and the maintenance of the family up to a particular state of well-being, is contemplated, and I would ask him whether any one of the Departments to which he referred had made an estimate of what was, say, the minimum amount required to maintain a family or families of different sizes in a fair state of wellbeing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that has been examined by any Department in exactly the form in which the Deputy has asked me, but I do know that the whole question of the minimum amount necessary for the maintenance of families, and so on, has come up in another connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that at the present time, and for some time past, individuals in the State have to go to two Departments in the one week in order to get benefits from two social services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that all the more reason for bringing about some method of co-ordination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Each of us, every day of our lives, has to go to different Departments for the different things we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is for one thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not for one thing.  You will find that there are two different aspects.  In the Dáil, on another occasion, we had a debate on this matter also, and I can tell you that it has been examined to a certain extent, and the preliminary examination led us to the conclusion that there would not be greater economy or greater efficiency if these were combined. They fall, as I can show from the list I have here, so naturally under the heading to be administered by the Departments that are administering them at present that, in the main&mdash; there may be a few to which this does <Col N="1821" /> not quite apply&mdash;they are related to the activities of the Department which is administering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider setting up a commission to examine that matter more thoroughly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, the present is hardly the time for doing that.  The main thing at the present time, I suggest, is to try to meet the very urgent necessity there is for taking action in various directions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that in a recent appointment to the post of junior resident medical officer, Cork County Home and Hospital, a Selection Board of which two well-known Cork surgeons were members, sat for a whole day to select a suitable candidate for the post; that they unanimously made a list in their considered opinion placing a young man who had just won the Bursary in surgery open to all final year medical students of the National University, first on that list, and placing second and third two candidates who had done very distinguished Honours Courses in University College, Cork, while they placed fourth a candidate who had secured a Pass degree in the Medical Course, but who was recommended by the Local Appointments Commission for the post; and whether he has considered the undesirability of asking medical men to interview candidates, examine into their qualifications and make recommendations when their recommendations are set aside by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the Local Appointments Commission has received protests from the members of the Selection Board which sat recently at the Cork County Home to select a candidate for the post of junior resident medical officer, Cork County Home and Hospital, and also from the secretary of South Cork Board of Public Assistance on the manner in which the candidate placed first on <Col N="1822" /> the list was turned down in favour of the candidate placed fourth, and considering that the latter board suggests a change in the method of selection of such candidates for future appointments, if he will indicate his intention of implementing the requests of those boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that in a recent appointment to the post of junior resident medical officer, Cork County Home and Hospital, Regulation 3 of the qualifications prescribed by the Local Appointments Commission resulted in the candidate who was placed first by the Selection Board not being appointed but in the appointment of the candidate placed fourth on the list; further, if he will state the reason for so weighting the Irish qualification against university qualifications in medicine in a purely Galltacht area as that in which the Cork County Home and Hospital is situated, and if he will consider the desirability of altering these regulations, so that while giving a specific percentage of marks for Irish, they will secure that due weight will be given to university qualifications in medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together. The statements as to matters of fact included in the questions contain a number of inaccuracies, with which, however, I do not propose to deal directly.  The position regarding the appointment referred to is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The area served by the Cork County Home and Hospital includes districts in the Gaeltacht, such as Béal Atha an Ghaorthaidh, Inse Geimhleach and Baile Mhúirne, and the regulations made by the Local Appointments Commissioners for the competition were, therefore, so worded as to ensure that a candidate without a good knowledge of Irish would not be appointed unless it was clear that no suitable qualified candidate with such knowledge was available.  This is the invariable practice in such cases and it is not proposed to alter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The candidate recommended by the Local Appointments Commissioners had been found to have a competent <Col N="1823" /> knowledge of Irish and, being otherwise suitable and qualified, was, in accordance with the regulations, given an absolute preference over candidates who did not possess such knowledge. The suggestion that the recommendations of the Interview Board were set aside by the Commissioners conveys a misleading picture of the position. The duty and function of selecting and recommending a candidate must under statute be performed and exercised by the Commissioners themselves. Members of Interview Boards are asked to report to the Commissioners as to the professional qualifications and relative merits of the candidates interviewed, and to place those who are considered to be qualified professionally in order of merit from that point of view.  The members of boards are furnished with copies of the regulations and can see therein the extent of the preference to be given for knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in competitions of this kind there may be more than one candidate with the desired knowledge of Irish, or there may be no such candidate or, again, it may happen that the candidate selected may fail under the head of age, health or character, or may withdraw from the competition after the interview.  In any of these eventualities it would be necessary to select the next candidate in order, the aim being always to secure the candidate who has the highest professional qualifications with the desired knowledge of Irish.  Notwithstanding the weight given to Irish, it is, therefore, necessary to have a board who will assess and report to the Commissioners on the relative merits of the candidates from the professional point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Taoiseach stands over this appointment? Assuming that he does, may I ask does Regulation 3, whereby preference was accorded to the person appointed in this particular case, apply to all medical and surgical appointments in non-Irish-speaking areas, or was it peculiar to the appointment in the case of the Cork County Home?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy and other Deputies in the Dáil know exactly what my function is in regard to this particular matter. There is a Commission with statutory powers set up to administer the particular Act, and when I am asked, do I stand over, or do I not stand over, an appointment, all I have got to do is to satisfy myself, when the question arises, that the competition has been carried out fairly and in accordance with general rules.  Now, I have satisfied myself that this competition was carried out fairly, that the Commissioners acted within their rights, and in that respect I stand over it.  I know nothing about the candidates and had nothing to do with the examining of them.  The only thing is, as stated here, that an Interview Board was set up in accordance with the general practice, that that board forwarded, in order of merit, from a professional point of view, the names of the various candidates who applied, and that, in accordance with their established practice, there being here a Gaeltacht area in question, they appointed, having found one such candidate, a person who had a competent knowledge of Irish and who, at the same time, was qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that he has not answered my question, and that the answer he has given consists merely of a number of general statements?  I have asked him whether Regulation 3 applies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation 3 says that the best qualified candidate from amongst those possessing a competent knowledge of Irish will, if otherwise suitable, be recommended.  Is that a general regulation?  Does it apply generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In this connection I have made inquiries in regard to a particular case, and I gave in my answer&mdash; a very full answer&mdash;the facts that were supplied to me and that I asked for in this case.  In regard to each particular post, as I understand it, there is an advertisement and there are also regulations which are sent to the candidates when they ask for them and they are also given to the examining board.  This particular Regulation 3 was, so far as I know, simply applied directly to the post of junior resident medical officer of the Cork County Home and Hospital.  I am satisfied that that is in accordance with the practice of the Commissioners in similar cases.  I do not know what their practice might be in cases which are not similar.  If I am asked with regard to any other particular cases I can give an answer, but I cannot give an answer covering the whole scale of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the application of a regulation of that kind to occasional appointments creates the grave suspicion that the condition is only applied to certain appointments to suit particular candidates?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not occasional. The whole misunderstanding is in the suggestion that this is occasional.  It is done in accordance with a class where it is essential to secure a person with a competent knowledge of Irish, particularly where there is any question of Gaeltacht services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put this to the Taoiseach?  In his reply he said that patients come there from the Gaeltacht areas of Ballingeary, Inchigeela and Ballyvourney.  Is he aware that <Col N="1826" /> there is a cottage hospital in Macroom which deals with the people from that area and that when there was a vacancy some time ago for a medical officer there this rule was not enforced? I also want to put it to the Taoiseach that 99 per cent. of the persons in the Cork County Home come from the City of Cork and the surrounding districts.  I also want to put it to him that in that case when they were appointing a junior house surgeon the candidate who was placed first had secured first place in the three colleges in surgery and that the candidate who got the other appointment simply passed.  Is there not to be any consideration for medical qualifications as against a knowledge of Irish?  I suggested in my question that a specific percentage of marks should be given for Irish and that medical qualifications for a medical appointment should be the main consideration. I am not concerned with this appointment particularly, because the person concerned has gone to England, but I am concerned about future appointments so that such a thing will not happen again.  I am suggesting to the Taoiseach that the proper thing in the best interests of the language would be to give a certain percentage of marks for Irish&mdash;I do not care what the percentage is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not been allowed to answer other questions put to me already.  Everybody knows what the difficulty is in a case of this sort. As the Ceann Comhairle has indicated, the question of policy is involved.  It is not true to say that medical qualifications do not count.  They do.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It did happen in that case.  The person with the highest medical qualifications who had, at the same time, a competent knowledge of Irish was appointed. Young people to-day, if they want to go up for public positions in this country have every opportunity given to them to get a decent knowledge of Irish.  If there are young people going in for public positions at this hour of the day they ought to be able to have such a knowledge of Irish as would enable them to get these positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

As the Deputy is aware, however, a number of private companies were established at the instance of the Department of Supplies and for the purposes of the emergency to secure, so far as practicable, the continuance of essential supplies.  In the case of some of these companies it has been found necessary for me to give guarantees to the banks providing overdraft accommodation.

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state why he refused to accord his sanction to the order of the Joint Committee of Grangegorman and Portrane Mental Hospitals made in November, 1941, authorising the Resident Medical Superintendent to exercise a discretion when appointing Protestant nurses, so far as the requirements in regard to age and height limits are concerned, until a sufficient number of Protestant nurses is recruited; whether he is aware that of the 320 nurses employed in Grangegorman and Portrane only five are Protestants, and that as one or more of these nurses must be absent from time to time on annual leave, night duty and sick leave, there is not a sufficient number in either Grangegorman or Portrane to accompany patients and remain with them at Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist services; whether he is further aware that advertisements recently inserted in three North of Ireland newspapers and in four Church magazines inviting applications from Protestant candidates elicited but few applications and those from applicants some of whom were under height or under age; and, whether, in view of the great inconvenience and injustice caused to patients of the aforesaid denominations in the matter of attending to their religious duties, he will reconsider his decision and accord his sanction to the joint committee's order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity which this question presents to refer to certain misstatements which were made in the public Press in regard to the employment of Protestant nurses in Grangegorman and Portrane. One of the Dublin daily papers of the 19th December last, in a report of a meeting of the joint committee of management of the mental hospital held on the previous day, at which the recruitment of Protestant nurses was considered, published a statement which was purported to have been made at that meeting that there was a shortage of about a dozen Protestant nurses.  In a Dublin evening newspaper of the same date it was stated editorially that at the moment there are vacancies for a dozen nurses, and that the vacancies can be filled at once if the age and height clauses are eliminated. In a communication dated the 3rd instant, received from the chief clerk of the mental hospital, it was pointed out that it was never stated at a meeting of the committee that there were a dozen vacancies on the nursing staff.  The latest information obtained in my Department shows there are no vacancies on the nursing staff at present, but that there will be five vacancies before the end of this month. It was further stated in a communication dated the 5th instant that it was never the intention of the joint committee to place additional expenditure on the rates by the appointment of supernumerary nurses on the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 25th November last the joint committee did request the Minister's consent to the chief resident medical superintendent being granted temporary permission to waive the usual age and height limits in the case of otherwise eligible candidates until the services of a sufficient number of Protestant nurses have been secured. Regulation 116 of the regulations for the management of the mental hospital appeared to have a bearing on the qualifications in regard to age and height of nurses.  The proposal submitted to the Department made no reference to that regulation, nor was it sufficiently detailed to justify the course that was proposed to be taken. Moreover, there was nothing in the <Col N="1848" /> information supplied to the Department in November last which would indicate that the difficulty in regard to the employment of Protestant nurses had only recently arisen.  The proposal of the committee was not agreed to.</P>
    <P>On the 6th instant there were 333 nurses in the Mental Hospital, and of these nine were Protestants.  Two of these nurses, who are temporary, were then under notice to leave, and one is on leave of absence.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the joint committee have taken all steps possible to secure Protestant candidates.  The information recently received in my Department indicates that the difficulty experienced by the joint committees in obtaining the service of Protestant nurses is not solely a question of age and height limits.  Of 16 applications recently received from females of that denomination, five did not attend for examination, four failed the educational examination, two who were eligible were appointed, but one subsequently left, one was not available for duty immediately, one has been notified for employment, while three were to be considered by the visiting committee at their meeting on the 12th instant.  Since that meeting there has been received an application for sanction to the employment of two Protestant applicants who passed the educational and medical tests but are over the prescribed age limits.  Provisional approval to their employment has been conveyed to the committee.  I am not satisfied, however, as to the propriety of adopting the course proposed by the joint committee which is to adhere to the present regulations regarding height and age, but to waive them only in the case of candidates belonging to the Protestant religion until a sufficient number is recruited.  This matter is still the subject of correspondence with the joint committee.</P>

Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that vacancies arise almost every month on the nursing staffs in Grangegorman and Portrane hospitals by reason of resignations of nurses from the staffs for one reason or another?  Is he also aware that his failure to accord sanction for the waiving of the height and age regulation implies his endorsement of the practice of Catholic nurses having to attend Protestant services with Protestant patients, that this practice is not only disagreeable to the nurses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No arrangements are being made to set up fish curing stations for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy.  The production of preserved fish of the kind extensively used in the rural parts of the country up to a year or so ago could not be carried on without plentiful supplies of suitable fish at a cheap price.  Such supplies have not been available for some time past, and it is not likely that they will be, so long as present conditions continue.

We are now in the Lenten period, with two days of abstinence in the week, and the men working hard on the land have not got any fish.  In my constituency, the fish has been caught, and had to be dumped into the sea because of lack of curing facilities.  Would the Department not take steps to ensure that any fish caught will be cured locally?  It was done formerly in Baltimore and Kinsale, and it could be done again, and a supply of fish made available to the hard-working people of the country.</P>

It is proposed to retain this regulation, subject to the following modification, viz., that the full bonus marks be awarded to candidates obtaining 75 per cent. or less in the particular subject, and that after 75 per cent. the bonus will be subjected to a uniform reduction until the candidate who scores 100 per cent. gets no bonus.  The purpose of these bonus marks is to encourage the use of Irish, and to offset any handicap which it might impose upon candidates.  It is not considered desirable, however, that the bonus marks should enable a candidate to obtain more marks in a subject than the total number of marks assigned to that subject in the programme, and the purpose of the present change is to prevent this.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state if the Forestry Division last year had a surplus of forest tree transplants, and <Col N="1859" /> if they were destroyed; and, if so, if he will state the reason for such destruction; and whether there is a similar surplus this year, and whether it is intended to destroy it; and, if so, if he will state the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, as a result of the curtailment of the planting programme, due to lack of fencing materials, the Forestry Division had a surplus of certain varieties of transplants, all three years old or over.  With the exception of Sitka Spruce, which was too large to retain and was accordingly destroyed, the balance was lined out for another year.</P>
      <P>This year again there will be a surplus of transplants, all three years old or over, in the Department's nurseries, and it will be necessary to get rid of those which will be too large for retention.</P>
      <P>The process of lining out (or transplanting) cannot be continued indefinitely, and unless the plants can ultimately be utilised the cost of relining would be a loss.  All this is ordinary nursery practice, but surpluses are greater this year and last than has hitherto happened, due to the circumstances of the time.  Transplants are normally three years old when planted out, so that nursery programmes have to be planned three years ahead of the planting programme.  Apart from seasonal variations in yield, etc., any alteration in the anticipated programme of planting must result in an excess or a deficit of plants.  The present position could not have been foreseen three years ago; but to cut down the nursery programme for the current year, for instance, would affect the planting programme three years hence, when conditions may be entirely altered and a normal or even an extended planting programme may be desired.</P>
      <P>It may be added that the Department have been willing to dispose of their surplus plants to the wholesale trade at prices covering costs of production, but an important section of the trade is opposed to this, and, consequently, the suggestion has had to be abandoned.</P>

    <P>I am also aware that marriage allowance <Col N="1867" /> at the rate of £2 2s. per fortnight was paid to Mrs. Osborne up to the date of her husband's death, and £1 8s. per fortnight during the period from the date of death to the date of the grant of the allowance under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>

      <P>I have inspected the factory buildings, which are constructed of wood and are about 25 years old.  Apart from some defects in the roof glazing, which are receiving the attention of the Commissioners of <Col N="1868" /> Public Works who are responsible for maintenance, the condition of the premises appears to be generally satisfactory and I do not consider that there is any ground for material complaint. The heating arrangements are adequate. Lead is not treated in the main building; melting down takes place in a separate concrete structure erected specially for the purpose some three years ago, and, as the roof of this structure is in perfect condition, there is no question of danger from the dripping of rain water into molten lead. The canteens are in separate wooden structures and appear to serve their purpose quite well.  I see no cause for dissatisfaction with them.  In relation to the heating and the floors of the canteen for female workers, I propose, however, to have some slight improvements made for their better comfort. On the whole I find nothing in the general condition of the factory premises to justify the strictures implied in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing much, having regard to the size of the sums which we are accustomed to dealing with in this House.  The £75,000 is for extra fuel.  Due to the increasing difficulties of getting fuel we decided to accumulate emergency stores which can be used for public purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £60 is in relation to the Lough and River Erne drainage scheme.  The necessity for the provision of £60 as a contribution towards the cost of gauge reading and the operation of sluices on the Lough and River Erne drainage district arises from the fact that the drainage board which was responsible <Col N="1880" /> for looking after the maintenance of this district resigned, and there was consequently no authority to attend to the sluices at Belleek or to pay the sluicekeeper.  The maintenance and operation of these sluices are essential for the protection of various important interests, including water power and fisheries, and the arrangement whereby the Commissioners of Public Works and the Northern authorities are providing the requisite funds for this purpose is a stop-gap arrangement pending future development.  That, I think, is all that need be said at the moment.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, now that we are advancing into February, whether any test has been made of the quality of the turf in the stores that are under his control, and if, having made a test, he finds that the turf is satisfactory and can reasonably be expected to burn in the ordinary workingman's grate, will the Parliamentary Secretary take steps to see that those stores are distributed in the city?  It is nothing short of shocking to watch what the people have to go through trying to utilise turf in the ordinary domestic way in ordinary homes; I might say even in offices. It is only when you get experience of using turf in an office that you realise what the hardship is when the mother of the house has to use turf when she gets up in the mornings to get an early breakfast for the father and members of the family who are going out to work.  In the first place, you have to see what it is like in an office to be driven to go and see it in the <Col N="1881" /> home, and then you feel that not only is it a shocking thing to see this additional hardship imposed on the mother of the house but that there is also an appalling lack of comfort and heat, not to mention the delay attached to the cooking of food in those circumstances in nearly every part of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it impossible to answer for the discharge of my responsibilities here if I were to agree to a vote of £75,000 that is to come out of the pockets of the people of the City of Dublin for storing what is supposed to be first-class turf in the Park or down at the butter testing station, at the canal, or in any of the barracks here, when the people who will have to provide, in their own small measure through taxation, that £75,000, are trying to handle turf for domestic use in the circumstances I have described, in the depth of winter, although the weather is, fortunately, pretty mild.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if this turf which has been stored here is any good at all, if he will release it now, as now is the time that it is wanted, and let the rubbish there is at the present moment, if it has to be burned&mdash;if it has to be got rid of by anybody&mdash;to be got rid of in the summer.  Let him give us something at the present time, if we have it in the City of Dublin, that will burn and that will heat.  Apart altogether <Col N="1882" /> from discomfort, there is an enormous economic drain on the resources of ordinary people in the city by reason of the fact that they are carrying on their domestic work and cooking under most impossible conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to drainage.  I would like to know if he has made any arrangement with the Northern Government with regard to this.  There was a committee some time ago representing Counties Cavan and Fermanagh, but it has been dissolved&mdash;or at least they resigned.  I would like to know who is in charge of that now or what he proposes to do, as there is flooding in this end of that river, owing to Lough Gowna and the River Erne coming down and causing considerable flooding, and there is nothing being done in Lough Erne to relieve that.  I would like to know if he has set up any new committee or made any other arrangements to deal with that since the committee resigned?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Lough Erne Drainage District Committee had resigned there would be no one to look after those weirs and sluices.  The whole object of it is to regulate those sluices.  The defects which were due to the fact that they were not being regulated, have disappeared.  On this question I am not in a position to go into the general question of Lough Erne drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question raised by Deputy Mulcahy, while I do not think it comes within the scope of the Vote, I am quite prepared to accept it as put forward for the purpose of getting information; and to that extent I would like to be able to help by answering him.  As far as this £75,000 for turf is concerned, this turf is of good quality.  In relation to stores of turf in the country at the present moment, in the national possession&mdash; that is, national turf&mdash;an examination is being made of the quality of the turf, not merely from the point of view of its intrinsic quality, but to see what is <Col N="1883" /> going on in it from the point of view of the possibility of heat, and whether it is improving or disimproving in the stacks or otherwise.  A careful technical examination of that is being made. As far as the turf going to consumers at the present moment is concerned, the Department of Supplies and myself have independently made an examination of the turf in the possession of all those who are authorised to distribute national turf to the consumer.  There is no reason why any turf which is not of good merchantable quality should be going out to consumers at present. The turf is being examined coming in, it is being examined going into the stores, and there is a very rigid attempt being made to ensure that, to the extent to which it is possible, turf is of a good merchantable quality.</P>
    <P>Again, while I very definitely do not desire a general discussion now on the subject of turf, there was a period in December and January, when, due to the extremely wet weather in the west, turf which we knew to be in perfectly good condition in the ricks on the bogs and on the side of the road could not be broken up, transferred into lorries and then transferred into wagons, without being in a certain intrinsically bad condition; and for that reason the export of that turf was stopped altogether.  At the present moment, the most rigid examination is taking place of the turf that is coming in, and I am satisfied that there is no reason at the present time why turf other than good merchantable turf should come in.  I know that Deputy Mulcahy is quite clearly and genuinely interested in this and if he would like to make such an inspection I would be prepared to facilitate him.  I am not putting this up to him in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual position is that the Turf Controller is responsible for turf only up to the point at which he delivers it in bulk at the present moment into the non-turf areas.  The responsibility for its sale and the condition in which it is retailed, and so <Col N="1884" /> on, is a matter for the Minister for Supplies.  We have responsibility for the reputation of national turf and for the work which was done, and we have tried independently to fulfil that; but, over and above that, the Minister for Supplies has satisfied himself that the turf which is going into a merchant's yard at the present moment and available there for distribution is of good merchantable quality.  That attitude of mind definitely will be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 3, line 9, to delete the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My object in putting down the amendment is to get from the Minister his view on the appointment that will fall shortly to be made.  This is a post where the occupant will require very considerable experience as a conveyancer. But that will not be all.  He will also require to be a person who will have some enthusiasm in trying to bring the register to what it was originally intended to be, conclusive evidence of title.  That, in fact, is the aim of any amendments I have put down; they are directed towards that end, towards making the register as far as possible conclusive evidence of title.  That was obviously the intention when the 1891 Act was made law.</P>
      <P>Section 34 of the 1891 Act sets out that the register shall be conclusive evidence of the title of the owner of the land as appearing thereon, and several other sections of that Act go to show that the intention at the time was that, as the years went by, when a man went in and inspected a folio in the land registry, he would find there practically everything that was to be found in regard to the land.  As the years passed, through judicial decisions and otherwise, it has been found that no purchaser can rely entirely on what he finds in the folio because judicial decisions have brought about a situation where there are various rights that there is no necessity to register, floating about in the air, as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first two amendments are with a view to securing that whoever will be appointed will, within the next five or six years, bring in a comprehensive amendment of the Act of 1891 so as to meet as far as possible the decisions that have been given since the passing of that Act, more especially recent decisions.  Perhaps the Minister may not be quite familiar with these decisions, but there was one in a recent case in <i>re</i> Strong which sets out that even though a person has not registered the contract or the transfer <Col N="1887" /> until after a judgment mortgage has been registered, that person comes in before the judgment mortgage and the judgment mortgage has no effect.  That is the effect of the decision in <i>re</i> Strong.</P>
    <P>I think something ought to be done to repair the effectiveness of the register. It will have to be done some time, unless the original object of the registration of land is to be lost.  That is why I would like to have a person of very great experience in this position. I have put down &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;eight&rdquo; without any particular conviction that the person who has been 12 years practising will be any better than certain persons who may have been only eight years practising.  I might speak in the same way of the second amendment, which seeks to confine the position to persons engaged in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  What I have in mind is a person engaged in legal work in the Civil Service.  It would be absurd to appoint a person who has been away from legal work for a number of years. This position is a highly technical one and, unless a person was doing legal work, and especially title work, in his job in the Civil Service, he would be utterly unsuitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason eight years was put into the section is that that period is usually laid down for a person who is appointed a county registrar. Six years' experience is sufficient for a district justice and 12 years for a High Court judge.  I think, in the circumstances, a solicitor or barrister practising for not less than eight years should be suitable.  When it is good enough for the others, it ought to be good enough for a position of this kind.  It does not follow that he will have only eight years' service, but if he has practised for eight years that should be a satisfactory minimum.  It is hardly necessary for this man to have the same period of years of practice as a High Court judge.  There is a precedent already established in regard to county registrars and district justices and I do not think, in view of that, that the Deputy will press his amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one matter, but I am not quite sure if it is quite relevant to this section of the Bill.  That is the question of whether the Minister would consider, between now and Report Stage, the insertion of an additional sub-section, sub-section (9), that would enable the registrar, at his discretion, or by rules made by him, to provide that the use of parchment or vellum might be dispensed with.  As the Minister is aware, vellum is hard to get at the present time and the position may get worse.  In other Departments, <Col N="1889" /> such as the Land Registry and the Land Commission, parchment is dispensed with; it is not being used. I recognise that it is hardly relevant to this Bill, but this is the only place where I conceive one can get it in, and as the Minister has a sub-section there repealing Section 8, chapter II, of a previous Statute, I thought we might go so far as to repeal Section 6 of the same Statute.  If this were done, it would enable these things to be done properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13, page 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 44 of the Principal Act is hereby amended as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion in sub-section (2)  of the said Section 44 after the words &ldquo;valuable consideration&rdquo; where they last appear in that sub-section the words &ldquo;or of a burden registered against the lands&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion after paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;or</P>
      <P>(c)  is protected by such cautions or inhibitions as are in this Act provided for.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>(c)  by the deletion of sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is, again, to try to keep the register as conclusive as possible.  This particularly refers to the case of persons who enter into a contract for the purchase of registered land, and either the contract may not be completed for some time or the transfer may be completed but may not be registered for several months.  In the meantime, the register shows nothing of this transfer, and a person who may in good faith get, for instance, a judgment mortgage against the registered owner goes along and inspects the register and sees that the registered owner against whom he has the judgment mortgage is still the registered owner.  Now, he goes to that trouble and then finds himself ousted by the transferee when the transferee registers his land.  That has been the position, and I think there should be insistence on making persons, who enter into these contracts for purchase, enter what they call an inhibition or caution on the register.  Section 69 provides for that in the old Act, and there should be insistence that this would be done in the case where a contract has been entered into, or, at any rate, certainly when the transfer has been completed and prior to registration. If there is any delay for one reason or another in registering the <Col N="1892" /> transfer, the purchaser should be compelled to enter an inhibition on the register so as to safeguard other persons who are dealing with the former registered owner.  It is unfortunate that at the present time an inspection of the register is no safeguard whatever either to a purchaser or any person who has any charge on the land, and if that continues the time will come when persons will look on an inspection of the certified folio as being utterly useless.  This particular amendment, if accepted, would go some way towards preventing these rights floating about in the air with regard to registered land when there is absolutely no reason whatever why they should not be registered.  In the case that I mentioned the proposed transferee would take the necessary precaution that an ordinary person should take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on the Second Reading, the principal reason for bringing in this Bill was to make provision for a successor to the present Registrar of Title, and we took advantage of that to bring in these other sections here dealing with the registration of land that were recommended by the Rules Committee.  I have had this amendment examined, and I am advised that its effect would be to give a person who gets a judgment against, say, a farmer, priority over somebody, such as a bank which might have had a prior unregistered right.  A man might have gone in and left his land certificate with a bank but, apparently, such transactions are not usually registered.  Subsequent to that, a shopkeeper or somebody else may get a decree against the farmer and go and register it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment, I am advised, would be to give the shopkeeper priority over the other person, who might have been a friend of the farmer&mdash;or it might have been a bank&mdash;and who took the land certificate as security, advanced the money, and did not register the transaction.  I am advised that the effect of one part of the amendment would be to give priority to the shopkeeper in a case like that over the other legitimate claim <Col N="1893" /> that was there already, although it was not registered.  I do not see why that should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if that person has such a right, why not enter it on the register by inhibition?  That is my object.  The judgment mortgagee has rights as well.  If he is entitled to register this charge, and he finds no inhibition on the register, why should he not have the benefit of his prudence? Why should the other person be allowed to continue to have rights floating about in this way when he could so easily safeguard the rights by having the thing entered on the folio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point about the inhibition, the person who owned the land might object to certain things being put on his folio.  I do not think it would be fair to ask the officials in the Land Registry to decide that question. That is a question for a court. There are two points in this amendment. One is the point about the person who has registered his mortgage having priority over a person who had advanced money in the way I stated, such as a bank, on the deposit of the land certificate.  When it comes to the inhibitions or cautions, the Deputy proposes there to put in a new clause and to delete sub-section (3).  The effect of that would be really to put the officials in the position of coming to a decision on a matter which really a court ought to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken advice on this and, so far as I can see myself, that is so.  When a person makes a caution, if the officials think there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for it, they will accept it.  But how are they to go into the merits of the matter?  How are they to know whether it is genuine or not, whether the people are entitled to make that caution?  The court ought to decide that, if the owner objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They take the same precautions now.  Cautions and inhibitions are not new things on holdings. Surely they have plenty of experience of dealing with them.  Let them take <Col N="1894" /> whatever precautions they take now in dealing with cautions and inhibitions with which they have to deal.  I cannot see that there is any justification for saying that they are acting in any way judicially in entering a caution or an inhibition on a folio in order that other persons dealing with the land may be able to see what the position is in regard to the land and not be led astray by an incomplete register.  I ask the Minister to consider that again before the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that, but I assure the Deputy that I have gone into the matter very carefully.  He is aware that it is a rather involved matter.  I have gone into it very carefully and I have got advice on it and it seems to me to be perfectly sound. If a farmer leaves his certificate in a bank as security against a loan, the practice always has been, I understand, not to register that against the land.  But it is a debt that ought to be honoured.  If, subsequently, a creditor gets a court order for the payment of a shop debt, or something like that, and registers that, I do not think it would be fair to the person who had given the first advance to deprive him of his rights.  If the Deputy wishes, I will look into the matter again and also the other point.  I am not a legal man, but I have got advice on this, and I think that the Deputy is asking that the officials should take decisions which really ought to be taken by the court.  That would be the effect of it.  If he looks into that, he will find I am correct there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see it.  The Minister, if he inquires, will find that the entering of cautions and inhibitions is an ordinary practice.  There is provision in the 1891 Act for the entry of these on the register.  Therefore, one can assume that that is the common practice in regard to these inhibitions and cautions which are entered under Section 69 of the old Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I know, but I am scrapping that and providing for compulsory entry of those inhibitions in order to safeguard those rights, rather than have those rights floating about in the air and nobody knowing anything about them.  Why there should be any difficulty created in the Land Registry about entering those inhibitions I cannot understand because it must be a common practice.  I hope the Minister will have this reconsidered between this and the Report Stage before he turns it down.  I shall withdraw the amendment if he assures me that he will have the matter examined again between this and the Report Stage.  I think there is a great deal to be said for this amendment in order to ensure that there will be some safeguard for persons who make an inspection of the register.</P>

      <P>Before Section 13, page 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 45 of the Principal Act is hereby amended as follows: By the deletion in sub-section (2) of the said section of all the words after the words &ldquo;interested in the burden&rdquo; in line 3 of the said sub-section to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any reason for keeping portion of Section 45 of the old Act there.  Section 45 (2) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A burden may be registered under this section on the application of the registered owner of the land, or of any person entitled to or interested in the burden, but if the application is made without the concurrence of the registered owner of the land or such other concurrence as may be prescribed, the burden shall not be registered except in pursuance of an order of the court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot see any reason for the second portion of that provision, and I propose to delete all the words after the words &ldquo;interested in the burden&rdquo;; that is to remove these words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" />&ldquo;...but if the application is made without the concurrence of the registered owner of the land or such other concurrence as may be prescribed, the burden shall not be registered except in pursuance of an order of the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These burdens are all, or nearly all, created by deed and, therefore, the registered owner is estopped from contesting the contents of the deed.  When there is that position, why should there be any necessity to ask the leave of the registered owner for the entry of that on the title?  Suppose a registered owner of land grants a building lease, that is a lease under (c), why must the lessee get the permission of the registered owner in order to have that entered in the folio?  I think that is an absurd position.  Of course the practice would continue that a registered owner could always be notified of any entry being put on the register. But that he should have to get his permission, after he has executed the deed under (c), seems to me to be asking too much from the lessee in the case of a lease.</P>

      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) As from a day to be appointed by the Minister not being later than twelve months after the passing of this Act, the registration in the Land Registry of the following burdens shall be compulsory:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) succession duty, Crown rents, quit rents, tithe rent charges, and payments in lieu of tithe or tithe rent charge;</P>

      <Col N="1898" /> (b) land improvement charges and drainage charges;</P>

    <P>(d) annuities charged under the provisions of Section 27 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870;</P>
    <P>(e) rights of the public or of any class of the public;</P>
    <P>(f) customary rights, franchises, seigniorial rights, and liabilities arising from tenure;</P>
    <P>(g) easements and profits a <i>prendre;</i></P>
    <P>(h) tenancies created for any term;</P>
    <P>(i) statutory tenancies;</P>
    <P>(j) perpetual yearly rents (in this section referred to as superior rents) which are superior to other such rents (in this section referred to as the registered rents) registered as a burden on registered land, and which, as between the said registered land and the registered rents, are primarily payable out of the registered rents in exoneration of such land;</P>
    <P>(k) the covenants and conditions contained in the deeds or other documents creating the superior rents referred to in the last preceding paragraph in so far as such covenants and conditions affect such land.</P>
    <P>(2) The registration of the burdens referred to in sub-section (1) of this section shall be done free of any registration charges.</P>
    <P>(3) Section 47 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is merely to draw attention to the fact that all the burdens which do not require registration under the old Section 47 are continued under this Bill.  I have added to those the two <Col N="1899" /> new burdens the Minister intends to add to Section 47 and I propose to make registration of these burdens compulsory.  It is a rather discouraging state of affairs that, after 50 years, instead of reducing the number of burdens which affect registered land without registration, we are adding a pair to them.  We are departing very much from the original intention of the Registration Act, as set out in Section 34&mdash;that the register should be conclusive evidence of the matters appearing thereon.  Several other sections of the 1891 Act, undoubtedly, show that the object was that the folio should be conclusive evidence of the title and that, as time went on, no burdens should affect registered land which did not appear on the register.  Instead of reducing the number of burdens which affect registered land without registration, the Minister is adding two by this Bill.  When we come to them, I shall have something to say of one of these.  It is a sad commentary on our advance in the past 50 years that we are about to add to the burdens which affect registered land without registration. I suggest that when this new man is appointed he should take out that Section 34, to which I have referred, and paste it on the wall before him, keeping it there until he brings in a Bill which will clear up the position created by these judicial decisions and clear off all these burdens under Section 47 which affect registered land without registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The Minister and the Government should be very careful before they allow any unregistered burden to be placed upon registered land which was not the case previously because, to the farmer, the folio out of the Land Registry has been conclusive proof of his ownership of the land and the burdens imposed upon it, as provided by the 1891 Act.  It would be a terrible state of affairs if burdens which would not appear on the folio could be imposed on the title and the Minister should be very careful in that respect.  This Government has done many things to injure the farmer's title to his land, and I appeal to them not <Col N="1900" /> to do anything which will make the situation worse.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we are doing anything to make the situation worse.  These new sections were suggested by the rule-making committee, which was representative of the Bar, the Incorporated Law Society and included the Registrar of Title. This was their considered opinion. What the Deputy seeks to do, in his amendment, is the reverse of what I am proposing to do.  There are certain burdens which do not require to be registered, such as succession duties, Crown rents, quit rents, tithe rent charges, payments in lieu of tithe or tithe rent charge and so forth. Ordinarily, many of these charges would be known to the people concerned. There was never any necessity to register these charges under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891.  I am advised by those who have experience that it would be very difficult to work the Act if all these charges had to be registered.  I shall have this matter examined also&mdash;if possible by the rule-making committee&mdash;and get further advice.  There seems to be some case for what the Deputy argues but, on the other hand, there is a case for not burdening the register with charges which are well known.  Some of these charges will pass out soon.  I shall have the whole matter re-examined and we can debate it on the Report Stage.</P>

It is about time that that particular condition of sale was made void.  I entirely agree with the proposal as the next best thing.</P>

      <P>This section adds to the number of burdens affecting registered land without registration.  I think that it is retrograde that we should add burdens to that section rather than deduct burdens from it.  With regard to the burdens which the Minister proposes to add, there is something to be said for (a) which affects only the superior rent.  That can hardly be said to affect the land.  Paragraph (b), however, refers to</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the covenants and conditions contained in the deed or other document creating the superior rent, in so far as such covenants and conditions affect such land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is, the superior deed.  If you take a grant superior to a fee farm grant in which that superior rent was created, the superior deed may contain covenants restrictive of the users of the lands&mdash;prohibiting the use of the land, for instance, for certain purposes.  If there are such covenants in the deed creating that superior rent and if they affect the lands in any way, why should they not be registered in the Land Registry rather than in the Registry of Deeds?  I think it is absurd that that should be a burden affecting registered land without registration.  It is apparent that that is a burden which should appear on the folio in the Land Registry.  I should like the Minister to refer that provision back for further consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not know why it is considered desirable to confine paragraph (a) to perpetual yearly rents.  It might be desirable to have a number of other rents registered&mdash;leasehold rents, for instance.  I think that paragraph (b) might be usefully omitted. <Col N="1902" /> It will cause considerable trouble.  One may not be able to get the deed creating the superior rent and how is one to know what covenants or conditions are contained in it?  One might find oneself in the middle of a sale which would be held up by that sub-section. I do not think that the Bill would lead to any fraud on the title if paragraph (b) were left out.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. This is a Bill to amend the National Health Insurance Acts 1911 to 1936. While it is a short Bill, containing no more than 16 clauses, the amendments which it proposes to the existing code of National Health Insurance are of far-reaching importance.  Its object is to modify the financial system on which the scheme as at present operated is based in such a manner as to permit the release for expenditure on additional benefits of part of the income <Col N="1904" /> of the National Health Insurance Society which at present is carried to reserve.  In order to explain to the Dáil the changes which are proposed it will be necessary for me to describe as clearly and as simply as is possible the rather complex and technical method of finance which was adopted in the first National Health Insurance Act and which, with some minor modifications, is still in operation.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1911, which is the principal Act, provided that the scheme of national health insurance, so far as the payment of sickness, disablement and maternity benefits are concerned, was to be operated through the medium of bodies known as approved societies. The Act applied to what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the particular form of administration which was adopted was largely determined by the conditions existing in Great Britain in relation to the development of the friendly society system.  There was already in existence in Great Britain a long tradition of voluntary effort to secure by means of mutual insurance protection against loss of earnings through ill-health or unemployment and to provide for old age and death.  A large number of friendly societies had come into existence, often associated with particular vocations or trades or with particular geographical areas such as villages and towns or sometimes with particular forms of religious, political or temperance affiliations.  These were self-governing bodies, many of them carrying on their functions under a limited type of supervision exercised by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Their existence naturally suggested to the persons responsible for the introduction of the National Health Insurance Act a method of administration which was not only convenient but well understood and eminently suited, so far at least as Great Britain was concerned, to the classes of persons to be covered by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act, accordingly, provided for administration by approved societies and permitted those friendly societies already in being to be approved for the purposes of national health insurance. So far as Ireland was concerned, <Col N="1905" /> the friendly society system had not achieved a state of development at all approaching that in Great Britain. The system of approved societies, based largely on the friendly society model, was, however, also applied to Ireland, and many new bodies had to be brought into existence to operate the scheme. This is now only a matter of history because, as will be remembered, the National Health Insurance Act of 1933 abolished the system of separate societies and unified all societies then existing into one national society. It is necessary, however, to make this short historical survey, because the particular type of finance adopted in the National Health Insurance Act was largely determined by the method of operation through approved societies.</P>
    <P>Each approved society was a separate entity and had its own separate benefit fund, represented by its own invested assets.  While all persons coming within the scope of the Act were required compulsorily to be insured, there was no compulsion to join a particular approved society.  There was complete freedom of choice in this respect, and accordingly a considerable degree of competition existed between many of the societies to secure new members.  Societies with a policy of expansion could secure such expansion by intensive canvassing for new members. Societies confined to a particular trade might remain in a comparatively stable condition, while other societies, either through lack of efficiency or other causes, might suffer steady diminution in membership.  No society had any guarantee whatever of continuity, and the method of finance had, therefore, to have regard to that fact. Their finances had to be arranged in such a way that the principles of actuarial valuation would apply to them as they apply in the case of private insurance bodies relying altogether on the voluntary payment of contributions by their members.</P>
    <P>An actuarial valuation of this kind is a method of applying at regular intervals, usually not exceeding five years, a test of the sufficiency of the existing assets of the society to provide in the future for the society's liabilities towards all persons in the <Col N="1906" /> society on the valuation date.  To describe the operation in its broadest outline, the procedure is to assess, as at the valuation date, on the one hand, the present value of the contributions which the society may expect to receive in future from these members, and on the other the present value of all the benefits (including the cost of administration) which the society may expect in the future to pay to these members. The excess of the present value of the future benefits (including administration) over the present value of the future contributions is the measure in present money of the society's liabilities to its members in the future.  If this exceeds the amount of the society's assets, the society is in deficiency.  If, on the other hand, it is less than the amount of the society's assets, the society has a surplus.  It is important to note that account is taken only of persons in the society on the valuation date.</P>
    <P>The valuation is thus, in effect, a measure of the funds which the society should have so that, if it never recruited another member, these funds, together with future contributions, would be sufficient to provide all the benefits to which members of the society would be entitled until, in the course of time, through death, transfer or lapse of members, the society had ceased to exist.  This is a very simplified account of the meaning of an actuarial valuation, and leaves out of consideration methods of assessing appropriate rates of contributions and of determining the factors which have to be taken into account, not only in calculating rates of contribution, but in making the valuation; as, for instance, the probable future course of rates of sickness, mortality, marriage, widowhood, unemployment and lapse and of the probable future rate of interest governing the investment of funds.</P>
    <P>When the scheme of health insurance was set up and the payment of weekly contributions was made compulsory in respect of all employed persons coming within its scope, the rate of contribution fixed was a flat rate.  Although the contribution payable in respect of men differed from that payable in respect <Col N="1907" /> of women, principally on account of the different rates of benefit, the rate of contribution did not vary with the age at which insurance began.  Since the incidence of sickness increases with age, it will be readily understood that the fixed weekly contribution required in respect of a boy of 16 should be less than that required from a man of, say, 30, and still less than from a man of 40 or 50.  Though this is so, the scheme provided that the rate of contribution payable by all persons entering into insurance should be the same, distinguishing only between men and women, and this rate was fixed at the lowest rate, that is, the rate appropriate in the case of males to a boy of 16 and in the case of females to a girl of 16, which is the youngest age to which compulsory insurance applies.  The original approved societies accordingly accepted all members at a rate of contribution which was sufficient to provide for the benefits of members who were aged 16 years at entry but was insufficient in the case of all older members and these were, of course, greatly in the majority. If an actuarial valuation were made of each society immediately after it was set up, a large deficiency would be shown.  The societies had no invested assets and the commitments for the payment of benefit were considerably greater than the value of the contributions to be received in the future, because in the case of all members over the age of 16 the rate of contribution was too low.  These deficiencies, therefore, would represent the capitalised value of the future liabilities assumed by societies in admitting members of all ages.  It is not possible to state accurately the amount of these deficiencies which applied to the area now served by the National Health Insurance Society, because the system then applied to the whole area known as the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It can, however, be said that, so far as Ireland was concerned, the amount was approximately £4,000,000 and that the increases of benefits and contributions made in the Act of 1920 had the effect of raising it to over £6,000,000. In order to deal with these initial deficiencies it was arranged that approved <Col N="1908" /> societies should be given book credits called reserve values, representing the capital value of the liabilities assumed by the societies in accepting as members persons over the age of 16.  At the same time the Act provided that a proportion of the contributions paid to societies should be put aside to form a sinking fund, to provide firstly for interest at the rate of 3 per cent. on the reserve values and secondly for their redemption.  This sinking fund was thus designed to convert the reserve values, which were in effect notional investments, into actual cash investments, over a period of years. The retention of a proportion of the weekly contributions to form this sinking fund was made possible by the assumption by the State of liability to pay a corresponding proportion, which is at present two-ninths, of the actual disbursements of societies in benefits and administration, until such time as the reserve values were redeemed and the income of the sinking fund became available for benefits.</P>
    <P>The National Health Insurance Act of 1918 effected some modifications in the financial arrangements to which it is now necessary to refer, as certain funds set up by that Act are dealt with in the Bill.  Experience of the working of the scheme had shown that the finances of societies required strengthening and this was achieved partly by the provision of additional State aid and partly by reducing the sums retained out of contributions for the service of the sinking fund to redeem reserve values and thus postponing the date of final redemption.  The sums diverted from the sinking fund moneys were used to establish a contingencies fund for each society and a central fund for all societies.  The object of the contingencies fund of a society was to provide a first line of defence against a deficiency on a valuation made on the principles to which I have already referred.  During the five-yearly intervals between valuations, the contributions to the contingencies fund were carried to that fund and accumulated there.  When the benefit fund of the society came to be valued, the amount of the contingencies fund was left out <Col N="1909" /> of account in the valuation, as it was in the nature of a contingencies reserve.  If the society was in deficiency, the contingencies fund was used as far as available to make good the deficiency.  In the case of a society which had a surplus on valuation, or whose contingencies fund was more than sufficient to make good a deficiency, the amount of the contingencies fund or any balance remaining after making good a deficiency was credited to the benefit fund and was thus available in that fund at the next valuation.  For the ensuing five years a new contingencies fund was built up.  In effect, the result of this operation was that a proportion of current income was temporarily reserved over succeeding periods of five years.</P>
    <P>The object of the central fund was to come to the aid of societies which on valuation showed a deficiency greater than could be covered by their own contingencies funds.  It was a single fund for all societies in the United Kingdom and assistance was only given where it was clear that the deficiency was due to an abnormal rate of sickness arising from risks of occupation or unhealthy environment or resulting from small membership or other circumstances over which the society had no control.  Its income was derived from a proportion of the moneys diverted from the service of reserve values, a fixed State grant of £150,000 and also certain moneys made available from the proceeds of sales of unclaimed stamps.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1918, which set up the contingencies funds and the central fund, provided that of the money taken from the sinking fund for the redemption of reserve values at least seven-eighths should go to the contingencies fund and one-eighth to the central fund. It also enacted that regulations might provide that the proportion to be carried to the contingencies fund could be increased and the proportion to be carried to the central fund correspondingly decreased.  The Act of 1921 provided that if such regulations reduced the proportion to be carried to the central fund, the State grant of £150,000 should be correspondingly reduced.  Such regulations were in fact <Col N="1910" /> made in 1921 and provided that the whole moneys diverted from the sinking fund should go to the contingencies funds and accordingly the State grant of £150,000 ceased to be payable from that year.  The position then was, and is now, that the central fund was supported solely by moneys credited to it out of the annual proceeds of unclaimed stamps.</P>
    <P>In addition to the contingencies fund and central fund, the Act of 1918 also established a fund known as the reserve suspense fund, the purpose of which was to serve as a kind of clearing house for dealing with the reserve values of persons whose insurance was transferred from one society to another, or of persons lapsing from insurance, or of women who married and either ceased to be insured or continued after marriage to be insured, and required to be provided with a special reserve value.  During the period following the 1911 Act, reserve values were gradually being redeemed, that is, if the reserve value of a particular person is considered, part of it had been converted into cash, and part of it still remained as an unredeemed book credit.  When a person transferred from one society to another, the old society which held a reserve value for that person as part of its assets, ceased to have any liability for benefits in respect of him, and this liability was assumed by the new society.  Similarly, when a person ceased to be insured, otherwise than by death or the attainment of age 70, part of his reserve value became available for the general purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Act provided, accordingly, that where a society lost a member by transfer or lapse, the value of the society's liability thus cancelled&mdash;and called in the Act a transfer value&mdash;should be debited to the society and credited to the reserve suspense fund.  On the other hand, when a society gained a member by transfer, or where a member who was over age 16 when he became insured, joined a society, the appropriate transfer value or reserve value, as the case may be, was provided out of the reserve suspense fund. Any cash balances remaining in the reserve suspense fund at the end of a <Col N="1911" /> year, so far as not required to provide reserve or transfer values from the membership changes occurring in that year, were made available to the sinking fund for the redemption of outstanding reserve values.  That was the position at the time when societies were unified, and is still the position, with the difference that transfers of insurance are now practically confined to transfers between this country and Great Britain under reciprocal arrangements made with that country.</P>
    <P>I have now given some account of these rather technical and complicated financial arrangements which are embodied in the existing National Health Insurance Acts, and which were necessitated mainly by a method of administration through a large number of approved societies.  Some ten or 12 years ago, the financial position of many of these societies was giving cause for anxiety in my Department, and an examination of the question in relation to the system of separate societies was made.  The conclusions arrived at were that a continuation of that system would result in further growth of the inequalities, anomalies and inequities as between different groups of insured persons which had already become apparent, and that no reconstruction or improvement of the scheme of health insurance on national lines would be possible until that system was changed.</P>
    <P>These considerations resulted in the Act of 1933, under which all approved societies then in existence were unified into one national health insurance society.  At the present moment, therefore, the position is that national health insurance in this country is administered by one society catering for all insured persons&mdash;with a few exceptions who are members of a special fund known as the military forces fund &mdash;but the financial arrangements under which the system is worked are still substantially in the form set up to provide for administration through a number of separate societies.</P>
    <P>While the unification Bill was being considered, and after it had been passed, Departmental consideration and discussion with the Department's <Col N="1912" /> actuarial adviser was directed towards the question of what changes in the financial system were possible and desirable. It was recognised that the reserve value system was no longer appropriate, and that the principles of actuarial valuation hitherto applied should be capable of considerable modification.  One of the first obstacles to progress in this direction was the absence of a reliable standard applicable to this country for the measurement of the fundamental factors affecting the actuarial basis of any scheme of health insurance. All successive valuations made since 1918 had been based (with some minor changes) on the rates of sickness, mortality, marriage and widowhood which had formed the actuarial groundwork of the scheme as originally adopted for the whole United Kingdom.  These rates had been determined from British experience.  No material was available from which rates applicable to this country could be determined although it had long been known that as a measure of the contingencies on which the finances of the scheme in Ireland should be determined, they were obsolete.</P>
    <P>The first task following unification was to collect information on which a reliable standard of measurement of sickness liabilities of the scheme could be based.  This was an undertaking of some magnitude which was readily undertaken by the new society, with the result that very full data covering the three years 1935-1937 were supplied from the society's records to the Departmental actuarial adviser and a report thereon was furnished by him in June, 1939.  That report disclosed some unusual and disturbing results, which I will deal with later on.  While this investigation was proceeding, consideration continued to be given to the financial position generally.  A valuation of the society on the same principles as previous valuations, had been made as at 31st December, 1933.  This valuation showed the result which would follow from combining into one valuation all the surpluses and deficiencies which would have been brought out from separate valuations <Col N="1913" /> of all the separate societies as at 31st December, 1933.  It disclosed a deficiency of £46,700.  There was, however, available in the contingencies fund a sum of £183,000, which was accordingly applied to cancel this deficiency and the balance, which was small in relation to the society's liabilities, was carried forward.  It should be stated that this valuation not only followed in principle the methods of previous valuations, but also used in its measurement of future benefits and contributions the rates of sickness and mortality which had been used in previous valuations.  The result of the investigation into the sickness experience of the Unified Society confirmed that the rates which had previously been used could not, in fact, provide a proper measure of the society's liabilities.  The experience rates were considerably higher than the valuation standard, and it was clear that a valuation made on the basis of the society's own experience would produce a very large deficiency indeed which under the provision of the Acts would call for a substantial increase in contributions or reduction in benefits or both. This, however, was on the assumption that the principles underlying the valuations made of separate societies were also appropriate in the case of one national society, and this assumption was open to question.  Instead of having some 85 different societies and branches of societies, ranging in membership from 100 to 90,000 competing amongst themselves in the recruitment of new members and with no one of them having any guarantee of permanency, there was one national society.  Every person engaged in or taking up insurable employment in the country was compulsorily insurable, and the only body through which the benefits of the Acts could be obtained was the National Health Insurance Society.  The society was, in effect, in the position that so long as insurance was compulsory it had a guarantee of the regular addition to its membership each year of persons entering into insurable employment.</P>
    <P>The invested assets of the society as at 31st December, 1938, amounted to some £4,000,000.  Each year its income from contributions, State grant and interest <Col N="1914" /> exceeded its expenditure on benefits and administration by amounts varying in recent years from £150,000 to over £200,000 and these sums were being applied to add to the reserves. Nevertheless, a valuation of the society made on the principles hitherto applicable showed that, even though this apparent surplus income existed and was being used to increase reserves, not only were these reserves insufficient but the rate at which they were being increased was also insufficient.  On the surface, such a position invited adverse criticism, but in matters of this sort there is considerable danger that much of this criticism would be facile and ill-informed.  The size of the invested assets of an insurance body is of itself no indication of its solvency, nor is the fact that income may exceed expenditure over a number of years any proof whatever that its finances are in a flourishing condition.  It appeared, however, that in a national scheme operated through one society as distinct from a commercial scheme or a national scheme operated through a multiplicity of societies new considerations might probably be taken into account subject, of course, to the best expert opinion on the question that was available.</P>
    <P>The Department's actuarial advisers were referred to on the matter and the result of that reference is contained in the very full and very informative report dated 28th March, 1941, which has been presented to the Oireachtas. That report is worthy of the most careful study and I will refer to it again later.  For the moment, it is only necessary to say that broadly it confirmed the Departmental opinion that fundamental alterations were possible in the financial structure of the scheme and that an appreciable proportion of current income, instead of being placed to reserve, might be regarded as available for the provision of additional benefits.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the Dáil provides for the repeal of all those sections of the National Health Insurance Acts which deal with the crediting and debiting of reserve values and transfer values and with the provision of a sinking fund for the redemption of reserve <Col N="1915" /> values by means of a deduction from contributions.  It also repeals the provisions relating to the contingencies fund, which, as already explained, is formed by placing to temporary reserve a proportion of the contribution income.</P>
    <P>The result of these repeals will be that the whole contribution income of the society, which hitherto has been apportioned between the benefit fund (including the administration account) of the society, the contingencies fund and the sinking fund for redemption of reserve values, will be credited to the benefit fund and administration account of the society.  The Bill also provides for the repeal of those sections of the existing Acts governing valuation and the manner of dealing with a surplus or deficiency arising on valuation.  Instead of these provisions, the Bill proposes that, as at the dates on which a valuation under the existing Acts would normally be made, there shall be made a comprehensive actuarial review by an actuary appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In his review, the actuary is to have regard to the amount by which the income of the society, other than that available for administration expenses, exceeded the expenditure on benefits, medical certification and the provision of transfer values during the preceding five years, and he is required by the Bill to report as to the amount of such excess that may be made available for additional benefits in the next succeeding additional benefit period. The type of report contemplated would correspond to the report to which I have already referred, and which governs the amounts which will be made available for additional benefits in the five years beginning 1st April, 1942.  The Minister, after considering any such report, is to determine the amount which may be made available for additional benefits, and the society may submit for his sanction a scheme for the provision of such additional benefits.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make no change in the list of additional benefits contained <Col N="1916" /> in the existing Acts.  Under Section 3 of the Act of 1911, two-ninths of the cost of the provision of additional benefits, including the cost of their administration, is borne by the Exchequer.  It is contemplated that the amount to be made available for additional benefits in each of the next five years will be £175,000, of which, therefore, about £39,000 will be borne by the Exchequer.  The central fund is to be reconstituted as the national health insurance reserve fund, and will in future be the only resources of the scheme held in reserve to meet adverse experience.  It is of the highest importance that the existing capital assets of the society, which represent the investments of its benefit fund, should be maintained intact, and should not be encroached upon.  They are under no circumstances available for distribution.  They perform the function of producing by way of interest an income which is a supplement to contributions.  If this interest income were to fail, then it would be necessary to replace it by an increase of contributions.  If adverse circumstances were experienced in which the income of the society fell to a level lower than that necessary to provide ordinary benefits, or if the claim rate so increased that the income was no longer sufficient to meet it, then the proper procedure would be not to encroach on capital assets, but to increase contributions or reduce benefits in order to restore equilibrium.  For this reason the new reserve fund is of importance.  Its purpose is to perform the functions of a contingencies reserve fund, and it is proposed that it should be allowed to accumulate by its own interest and by the addition from year to year of certain moneys made available from the proceeds of unclaimed stamps, until, in the opinion of the actuary, it has reached a figure which will constitute a reasonable reserve. He will consider its position at each quinquennial review, and will advise as to the amount, if any, which may be transferred from it to the benefit fund of the society.  Any amount so transferred will be taken into account in deciding the amount made available for additional benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> The Bill also deals with the disposal of moneys representing unclaimed stamps, and proposes that an amount not exceeding £15,000 of these moneys be paid each year to the Exchequer as an appropriation-in-aid of the cost of central administration, the balance being credited to the new reserve fund. Under the existing Acts, the State bears two-ninths of the expenditure on benefits and administration by the National Health Insurance Society.  It contributes a substantial amount by way of State grant on contributions, provides the cost of the district medical referee scheme, and in addition the whole cost of central administration, including the cost of printing contribution cards, and of the printing and sale of insurance stamps.  The present Bill will add to that expenditure by the State two-ninths of the cost of the additional benefits to be provided.  In these circumstances it is not unreasonable that the State should seek some mitigation of a burden of cost which is already considerable, and the Bill proposes to do this to an extent not exceeding £15,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are rather technical in nature.  They deal with the winding-up of the contingencies fund, the sinking fund and the reserve suspense fund; with the cancellation of reserve value; with the provision of transfer values in cases of transfers of insurance to or from Great Britain or to or from the military forces fund; and with the allocation of interest income amongst the various funds and accounts on which interest is earned.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I think it well to say that this Bill is to some extent experimental in character.  The changes made in the finances of the scheme are fundamental, but it must not be taken that they permit of any loosening of supervision and control over the existing financial resources.  Because the income of the scheme has regularly exceeded the expenditure, it must not be assumed that a satisfactory position exists, allowing of large extensions of the benefits, limited only by the amount of that excess.  On the contrary there are indications that the position <Col N="1918" /> is far from satisfactory in certain respects, and the actuary in his report of 1939 dealing with the sickness experience and also his report of last year dealing with the general financial position has drawn particular attention to these.</P>
    <P>It is clear from his reports that the rates of incapacity for which payment to members is being made by the society are exceedingly heavy, particularly in regard to disablement benefit, which are two or three times the corresponding British rates, and far exceed the amount of incapacity for which provision was made in the financial basis of the scheme in this country.  He states that unless drastic administrative measures are taken successfully to eradicate the &ldquo;claim habit&rdquo; the incapacity experienced will have to determine the actuarial basis of the scheme.  This is a question which is actively engaging the attention of the society and the Department.</P>
    <P>The actuary also draws attention to the comparatively low proportion of persons of insurable age who are insurably employed in this country, while pointing out that in recent years a considerable increase in members has occurred particularly at the later ages and concludes that the insured population, both as regards numbers and age distribution, is not in a stable position.  He adds that since changes in numbers and age constitution may have a marked effect not only on the capital liabilities of the scheme but also on the average cost of benefits, it must be remembered always that this instability in the insured population is a factor of fundamental importance in considering the effect of far-reaching amendments of the financial arrangements and enlargements of the scope of benefits.  The need for extreme caution is evident.  It must not, therefore, be assumed that because recent experience allows of a temporary enlargement of benefits there is a certainty of continuing these additional benefits indefinitely. Apart from the very important considerations advanced by the actuary, it may well be that an increase in the incidence of unemployment, due to present economic conditions, might <Col N="1919" /> have the effect of so seriously reducing the contribution income of the society, that expenditure on additional benefits might have to be curtailed.</P>

      <P>I think it is about eight years since the unified society was formed, and, in regard to what might be said to be the first constructive proposal coming before the House after that, I think the Parliamentary Secretary must bear with us if we say we are disappointed.  The Parliamentary Secretary introduced his measure as being far-reaching in a certain way, and he wound up by saying it was experimental.  As far as I can see, the experiment that is being carried out is that it is proposed to expend about £175,000 in additional benefits every year, if I understood the Parliamentary Secretary properly, for a period of five years.  That is a small financial experiment in times when our ordinary budget has risen to such enormous size and when so much financial experimentation is being carried out by other countries for various other purposes. What the Parliamentary Secretary's speech on the Bill brings to my mind is this, that really we have no national health policy at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the report of the actuaries and the report on the health situation generally was such that he feared that the additional benefits which were now going to be paid could not be continued, as it were, inside the present financial framework. When I come to think of the benefits provided by the national health insurance system here, I am forced to say that there is as little connection between the finances of the national health insurance system here and national health as there is, say, between the Post Office Savings Bank and national health.  At the present moment, if a man with a family goes sick he gets 15/- a week from a scheme that calls itself a scheme set up for the purpose of improving national health. It brings us really up against the question as to what the national health scheme, as we are running it at the present time, is for at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occassion the other day to discuss <Col N="1920" /> some aspects of poverty and the relief question here in the city.  I had a particular case before me.  It was that of a man who was in good work and had been able to save a certain amount of money, so that when he went out of work he had a small sum of money as a kind of standby.  He had seven children.  Under the unemployment insurance scheme he was entitled to £17s. 6d., and he had about 13/- coming in from the earnings of one of his family.  After six months' unemployment he found that he had eaten into his savings to the extent of something like 16/- a week, after he had cut off certain expenditure that he had to cut off because of the circumstances. If that man went sick, instead of his £1 17s. 6d. he would have 15/-.  If he were a man who had a wife and seven children, none of whom was able to earn, and if he had no money put by, his position would be that he would have to maintain himself and his family on 15/- a week or go and look for outdoor relief.  When we consider all the great financial bases, all the actuarial work, all the figuring out that has to be done, and the amount spent in the total administration of the scheme say in the year 1939, £201,000, and when we consider that inside a scheme which is so perfectly thought out on the financial side, and on the administration of which so much money is spent, a man with a wife and six or seven children or even with three children will get only 15/- a week out of it in present circumstances, or under this particular kind of scheme 15/- a week and some additional benefit of one kind or another, it emphasises the fact that this is simply handling a certain amount of money in a kind of savings bank way without any direction or application to the general question of national health at all.  I am quite sure that the unified society have had their minds directed to the health side of things, but not at all to the same extent, apparently, as they have had their minds directed to their responsibility for guarding the finances of the society.  I quite agree that one of the most important things that anybody in charge of any society has to do is to look after the finances of the society, but outside the society <Col N="1921" /> and helped by the society I think we here in the Dáil have to look at what is the real object of all this work and what is the real object of all this expenditure. It is to have a position here in which our people can be healthy, and we can not only avoid wastage of money but can have increased energy and increased production by our people because their health has been safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I propose, on the Committee Stage of this Bill, to put down an amendment to the effect that the increased benefits will be applied to married members of the society, and that they be applied in cash payments, because I think that if we are going to safeguard the health of the nation at all we have to direct as much effort as we can to the family side of it.  If a man who has been in reasonable employment, and has been able to maintain his family reasonably well, is laid up for two or three months and is driven to exist on 15/- a week from national health insurance, in addition to whatever relief he gets, during that two or three months are sown seeds of ill-health and seeds of problems for future years for the national health society.  Those seeds are sown during the months when the family are ill-fed and badly cared for, and will be a great source of additional expenditure and additional wastage of money in the years afterwards.  I feel that the whole of our health position from the schools onward has to be considered. I feel that the members of the unified society, who are standing over the experience of the society, have a contribution to make by way of suggestion and by way of exposure of fact that we should have the benefit of, and that we will not have the benefit of unless we here declare in some way that we want a policy which will reach out in every way to improve the general national health position.  You have a system in the schools under which there is dental treatment for the children, and under which they have their tonsils removed, but on the other hand nothing has been done about the recommendation of the primary programme conference that there should be a systematic system of physical training introduced throughout the whole country to set up the children <Col N="1922" /> and keep them set up.  It is much more important I think to set up the children physically than it is to do some of the medical work that has been done in the schools.  That is important, but, having gone to the extent of setting up the great organisation that we now have for dealing with the medical side of the schools, why the really important side of setting up the children has not been attended to I do not know.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure a lot of the troubles that are causing heavy expenditure here, as viewed through the National Health Insurance Society, come from the fact that a little training and a little attention is not given in schools to the proper physical training of the children.  There is a thing that has to be borne in mind, when we consider what the financial side of the national health insurance scheme does for the people.  As I say, it gives a man, whether he is married or single, 15/- a week.  There has been a very considerable amount of examination recently regarding family budgets on the one hand, and what it costs or would normally cost to maintain a family above the poverty line, on the other hand. The most recent and exhaustive report is based on 1936, when Mr. Rowntree, in investigating the position in York, indicated that, from his examination there, it would require 43/6 a week at the price level of 1936, to maintain a man and his wife and three children. The cost of living has gone up in such a way here that the average in, say, 1941, has increased price level, it would require £3 a week to keep a family of that size on the basis that Mr. Rowntree laid down for York.  I have given a case where a man, his wife and seven children here in Dublin, cutting things down almost to the bone, found it took them £3 a week over six months' unemployment to maintain that family.  Their savings were eaten into to do that, but the figure worked out at that.  Where you have these facts so readily available, there is a definite challenge to our minds, as to what the national health insurance financial scheme&mdash;if we consider <Col N="1923" /> its cash benefits&mdash;is really doing for the health problem here.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in order to draw attention to the fact that we are really handling a financial problem and we are handling it as a financial problem under our present scheme; so far away from really effective treatment is the treatment we are giving that the challenge is very definitely there, and is particulary definite under present circumstances. When financial matters and national matters are being handled in such a gigantic way for purposes that are not less important and not less clamant to our attention here than the general purposes of national health, I propose to introduce an amendment that will be along those particular lines, because I think that medical attention can be organised without giving additional benefits.  We have throughout the whole country the dispensary system in every country and there is not a single county which has not an ophthalmic organisation under the board of health perfectly capable of looking after eye treatment.  In the same way there is provision for dental treatment under every county council in the country.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a very grave mistake to utilise additional moneys for duplicating any services of this particular kind.  The ophthalmic and dental services and the general county services should be raised to real public services, and the dispensary system should be brought much more definitely into the general medical scheme for national health.  We are not able to provide money enough to have a separate scheme set up, so that if we can bring ourselves to look on national health in a really objective way, we will see that the real thing we want to do in all these Acts is to get a system by which our people will be secured in their health and will have good machinery for cure when they fall ill.  If we could get our minds properly directed at this, we would look differently at the finances and the national health insurance scheme and look differently at, and get a lot more from, the medical services that we have in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain directions I welcome this Bill as an advance; but my complaint against the Bill is that it is an advance of a crab-like variety. If the Minister's mentality is reflected in this Bill, I am afraid we are going to wait a very long time before getting a Minister of this Government to face up to the obvious necessity for a drastic overhaul of that thing that is masquerading as national health insurance in this country.  It is neither a health scheme nor an insurance scheme in any sense of the term.  I am particularly glad about one feature of this Bill, that we have at last abandoned the old method of valuation. That method of valuation was conceived in Britain and may have suited a scheme of organisation such as you had in Britain, with 2,500 separate societies, as against possibly 80 societies here, but it seemed to me never to be suitable to a scheme of organisation where you had one society to which every person was obliged by law to belong.</P>
      <P>The old system of valuation gave us most amazing results.  It was designed to provide for a theoretical &ldquo;last man&rdquo; who may join a particular sectional or territorial society.  While you may have a theoretical last man&mdash; though the proposition would not be such as to disturb anybody's slumbers &mdash;there was no case whatever for the maintenance of a scheme of valuation of that kind once you got rid of the separate societies and created one single organisation, as every insured person was obliged to be a member of that organisation.  If you assumed the continuance of the Irish race, then you were brought face to face with the position in which the insurable section of that race had to filter itself through a single national health society, and on the assumption of the continuance of the race there was no theoretical last man to be dealt with. The abandonment of that scheme of valuation, of an anachronism of that kind, is something that I welcome; but my complaint is that, while the Minister has abandoned that method of valuation, he is still trying to cling to the evils which flowed from that method of valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> When the old system of valuation was applied to the valuation of the assets of the national health insurance societies and to the assets of the new unified society, we had a periodic screech about the insolvency of the societies&mdash;a screech which was quite undeserved and quite unjustified on the financial facts and which was only possible because of the application to their valuation of a scheme of valuation which had no relationship to the facts of life in this country and which had no relationship whatever to the scheme of organisation of national health insurance here.  While we had these periodic screeches about insolvency of the national health insurance society, the outstanding fact was that, during the quinquennial periods when this insolvency was accumulating, the society was in fact giving away over £200,000 a year.  If any business firms in the country were making a surplus of over £200,000 in the year, one would regard them in these circumstances as doing extremely well; but when the National Health Insurance Society made a surplus of ever £200,000 the actuary apparently felt obliged to issue a solemn warning that the society was heading straight for bankruptcy and its future was such as to cause grave alarm to those responsible for its administration and supervision.</P>
    <P>I never had any use for these valuations based on the scheme applied to our unified society here.  Any society which could show a surplus of over £200,000, and has assets to the extent of £4,500,000, obviously is in a very flourishing position, notwithstanding the cautious advice one can get from actuaries from time to time on the necessity of making provision for the distant future.  I always felt the society's position was such that it could afford to spend much more money in benefits, and that the departure from the old method of valuation would enable a substantial sum to be released for the provision of new additional benefits.  But I am not sure that the departure from the old method of valuation has, in fact, produced any great change in respect to the benefits to be made available under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The actuary, in his recent report, in <Col N="1926" /> timates that a sum of £500,000 might be released for expenditure on the enlargement of existing benefits or the provision of new benefits.  He recommended that that sum should be spread over five years, and it would provide an annual sum of £150,000, allowing for interest and State grant in the provision of such benefits.  The Parliamentary Secretary now intimates that the additional sum available will be approximately £175,000.  Even if we take it at £150,000 or £175,000, it works out roughly at 5/- per insured person per year.  That is, in effect, what this Bill is doing&mdash;it is going to make available for insured persons a sum of approximately 5/- per year, or little more than a penny per week.  That sum will be aggregated in such a way that perhaps one person may get a substantial amount of benefit, but, when you want to ascertain to what extent benefits will be spread over insured contributors, that is the national average. And the Bill does not do more than that, apart from breaking away from the old system of valuation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that we have really no scheme of national health insurance in this country.  What masquerades as a scheme is neither a scheme for the preservation of health nor the provision of insurance.  It is a purely anæmic system, and those charged with its administration will have to recognise that it bears none of the features of national health insurance in operation in progressive countries in Europe; that it is a long way behind the scheme operating in Great Britain, and far behind the schemes in operation in certain European countries.  In fact, the present scheme makes no effort to treat a sick person or to provide adequately for the sustenance of that person if he is afflicted with infirmity.  There is no medical service whatever under our scheme.  A person goes to a doctor and, as most people are perfectly well aware, all that person gets is a medical certificate.  Some of these certificates are signed and left on the doctor's hall table, and the insured person, the disabled receipient, is expected to call round on certain days.</P>
    <P>There is no hospital treatment for <Col N="1927" /> insured persons.  It is harder to get into the hospitals to-day than ever it was, notwithstanding the bed bureau and the other types of propaganda so prevalent.  It is harder for a poor person to get into hospital to-day than ever it was before.  There is no dental treatment provided under our insurance scheme, no optical treatment, no treatment for tuberculosis in the incipient or the advanced stage, and no surgical or convalescent treatment. What simply happens under this so-called code of national health insurance is that when a person gets sick he goes to a doctor, gets a certificate, which is given to him very hurriedly because of the bulk of cases; he sends that in to the society, loses the first three days and, after another seven days, he gets a cheque for 15/-, with the best wishes of the architects of national health insurance that he will get well as quickly as he can or, if he cannot get well, that he will die as soon as he can. The longer he lives and draws benefit, the greater the liability of the society.</P>
    <P>I do not want to charge the society with desiring any man's premature death, but every responsible person knows that the scheme now in operation simply empowers the society to give a man 15/- a week as the maximum. After that, the society has no more concern about the application of curative treatment.  They have no means of providing any type of treatment, and they are simply confined to the expenditure of 15/- a week for six months, while the man is drawing sickness benefit.  On that miserable sum of 15/- a week a man is expected, while ill, to maintain himself in a debilitated condition and also maintain a wife and perhaps three, four or six children.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man living in a corporation house at Drimnagh, Whitehall or Kimmage.  His rent is approximately 15/- and, therefore, his whole benefit goes in paying rent.  There is no other income for the family.  He might tell the corporation that he could not pay the rent for certain weeks, but, if he wanted to pay the rent and be a solvent tenant, then his whole income by way of insurance benefit goes to pay the landlord and there is not <Col N="1928" /> one halfpenny left for the maintenance of his family, not to speak of providing himself, as a sick man, with nourishment.  Yet we call this scheme of ours a scheme of national health insurance.</P>
    <P>What do we insure for?  Obviously, we do not insure for the purpose of preserving health.  The society cannot be concerned with the preservation of health, because there is no money to spend on that.  The society has no function in that matter because it has no money.  The structure of the society did not in the past permit it to be concerned, according to its rules, whatever it may have been concerned about in conscience, with curative treatment.  Any tontine society would provide the same benefit as we are providing in our national health insurance scheme.  In tontine societies, which function in a rather small way, persons contribute a weekly sum and they get certain benefits.  Those societies adopt modest titles; they do not arrogate to themselves the title of national health insurance, but they do just the same kind of things as our national health insurance society.</P>
    <P>While we know that to be the position, apparently we are quite content to let that unsatisfactory state of affairs drift.  To-day, when we endeavoured to have the social activities of the different Departments coordinated in such a way that they would be administered by one Department, we were told by the Taoiseach that, in fact, the existing social services ran very smoothly in connection with the Departments that administered them, that there was no lack of co-ordination and, apparently, no incongruities in the administration of the different social services.  Now, let us examine that position for a moment in relation to this Bill.  Under the National Health Insurance Acts the maximum benefit that a man will get is 15/- a week, and he is required to pay a weekly contribution towards that.  Supposing that a man were idle and lived in the city, he would get, under the unemployment assistance scheme, if he had a wife and five children, 23/- a week, although he is <Col N="1929" /> not required to insure for national health insurance benefit.  A man in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit would get 23/- a week from the labour exchange.  If, on the other hand, he has been working all the time, if he has been a hard-working, industrious and conscientious man, and is suddenly struck down by illness, and if he has a wife and five children, all he will get from the National Health Insurance Society is 15/-, and he only gets that because he has paid for it, whereas, under the Unemployment Assistance Act he will get 23/-.  I do not know on what grounds you can justify the payment of 15/- to a sick man with a wife and children to maintain, while at the same time an idle man, with probably less children, will get 23/-.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the blemishes associated with this whole Bill is its complete failure to make some provision for the payment of an allowance to dependents of sick persons.  If, for instance, a man in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit can get an allowance for his wife and children, or if a man in receipt of unemployment insurance contribution benefit can get an allowance for his wife and children, why is it not possible to provide a similar allowance for the wife and children of persons who are unfortunately afflicted with illness?  I think that that is one of the serious blemishes in our scheme of national health insurance, and I wish the Parliamentary Secretary had been removed definitely. But there is no indication that it is being removed, unless it should happen to get accidentally into the scheme which the society is to submit to the Minister for his approval.</P>
    <P>The actuary, in his recent report, is again worried about the high expenditure on national health insurance. Well, the actuary can be absolutely certain of one thing, and that is that nobody in this country will get rich through drawing either sickness or disablement benefit from the national health insurance fund.  Nobody will become a millionaire on that income, and most people would prefer to get work at <Col N="1930" /> decent wages rather than be dependent on the miserable pittance that they get from that fund.  One of the direct causes of the high expenditure in this case is our complete inability, apparently, to provide medical treatment and to look after the health of the insured persons.  So long as we fail to do that, then we are going to have persons in a state of health which will make them a continuous drain on the society and will ultimately transfer them to the books of the society as, virtually, pensioners dependent for the rest of their lives on disablement benefit because they are unable to resume duty.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted by those administering the affairs of the National Health Insurance Society that, probably, rheumatism is one of the most frequent causes of absence from work.  In fact, rheumatism in this country has become a national disease and its effect upon the finances of any National Health Insurance Society in this country must be very serious indeed.  Bearing that fact in mind, and also bearing in mind the ravages of that disease on the limited man-power we have available, one would imagine that some effort would be made, either through the existing society or on a national basis, to establish clinics for dealing with that disease which exacts such an enormous toll in inactivity and idleness from our people.  No effort whatever is made to deal with that problem at all.  I should like to see statistics from the National Health Insurance Society testifying as to the number of persons who are absent from work, and the number of days they are absent, as a result of certificates that they are suffering from some kind of rheumatic disease.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that this whole Bill has such a limited scope and that it does not deal with this question of national health and national health insurance in the only way in which it can be dealt with in this country, and that is by the inauguration of a comprehensive scheme which will provide adequate cash benefits, medical, surgical, convalescent home, optical, dental, T.B. treatment, and every other type of <Col N="1931" /> medical attention which is necessary to keep the insured person in a state of good health.  If you can create a scheme or organisation which will do that, then you solve for all time the periodic screech about the insolvency of national health insurance in this country, and you will enable money to be devoted in increasing measure to those few people who would still fall ill notwithstanding the most perfect scheme of health services that we can devise.</P>
    <P>This whole question of national health insurance has been huckstered ever since the first National Health Insurance Act was introduced in this country.  There has been practically no advance in national health insurance legislation in this country since the first Act was introduced.  There have been cash adjustments in expenditure due to the fact that living costs are much higher now than they were then.  But on the whole that particular type of legislation has been more stodgy than any other type of legislation that has been introduced in or applied to this country in the last 25 years.  There is a good deal of thoughtless moaning indulged in by some persons who talk about the loss of days by strikes.  These persons are all worried if the workers, as a result of economic injustice, are compelled to withdraw their labour, and they talk about the loss of days due to strikes of that kind.  If one were to take the trouble to ascertain, again from official statistics, the number of days lost through strikes and the number of days lost through sickness, one would get a very staggering comparison and it would be shown quite clearly that the loss of days through sickness is probably 200 times greater than the loss of days through strikes, even if you took a year in which there was an abnormal number of strikes and of a prolonged character.  That ought to set us thinking and it ought to induce us to realise the necessity for dealing with this whole problem of national health insurance in a much more thorough and comprehensive way than we have so far dealt with it.  Even as it is, we do not know <Col N="1932" /> from the Parliamentary Secretary what type of benefits will be provided under this Bill.  We do not know whether the benefits will be in cash or in the form of an additional service. The only one thing that we do know is that the expenditure under this Bill will be, approximately, 5/- per insured person per year, and that limited additional benefit, I suggest, will not make any great difference in the state of health in this country, nor will it contribute in any substantial way to the mitigation of the ills of insured persons who are obliged to exist on the small allowance that they at present receive under our national health insurance legislation.</P>
    <P>Since there was so much delay in introducing this Bill, I thought that its introduction would be accompanied by a manifestation of the Government's determination to deal with this whole question of national health insurance in a big and comprehensive way, but instead of that we get this Bill.  It makes an advance, a very small advance, and apparently we will have to leave it to some other Government to deal with this problem in a much more comprehensive way if we are ever going to see a solution or to see any improvement of our puny health services in the lifetime of anybody now living.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has tried to add to this piece of deception that we have been trying on ourselves and on the insured population of this country over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is described as a National Health Insurance Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary might have described it more correctly as a very small amendment to the National Health Insurance Act.  It is nearly nine years since we set up the unified society and I am rather sorry that a former Minister for Local Government, who was responsible for putting that measure through the House, is not here now.  I know that he is a very busy man in his present position but I should like him to read some of the speeches he then made and consider the rosy future he held out <Col N="1933" /> for the society and the benefits which were to accrue to insured members. Some of us are not disappointed at what has happened.  The bringing in of this Bill now seems to me like taking a nine-year-old motor car into a garage and getting it tightened up here and there.  A few new parts will be supplied but it will go out of the garage with as many rattles and as many weaknesses as it had when it came in. The fact is, as has been so well stressed by previous speakers, that there is no such thing as insurance or national health covered by these Acts at all. Deputy Norton said that we had made no advance so far as national health insurance was concerned.  Of course, we have not.  From the point of view of the city man, the position is far worse than it was at any time since national health insurance was introduced when one has regard to the purchasing value of the cash benefit which he is paid.  So far as a large number of insured persons are concerned, it would be far better if we had no so-called national health insurance at all because then they would get far more benefit from other sources.  Many of them were assisted by their employers, particularly during short illnesses, before the Act was introduced.  Nowadays, one of the benefits supposed to be enjoyed by workers is State insurances when sick.  Many employers, and many of the workers' neighbours, think they are far better off when they are ill than when they are working.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton have painted a picture for the House of what a payment of 15/- a week means to a person in the City of Dublin.  What does it mean to a man in any part of the country&mdash;a man who has been in fairly constant employment in a small country town and who has kept his family together on a wage of from 30/- to £3 a week?  He has barely been able to make ends meet and has been unable to save anything.  He has no money in the Post Office or thrift association.  Suddenly, he is stricken down and he is given 15/- a week.  He may have four or five young children. Rents of workmen's houses in country towns are far lower than in the city. Let us assume that that man is living in a house at the low rent of 5/- a <Col N="1934" /> week.  That is the first charge on his 15/-.  At the very lowest fuel will cost him 5/- more.  I shall not speak of the cost of milk, butter, or any other item.  Is it any wonder that, as year succeeds year and as each five-yearly period comes round, the actuaries become more nervous of this national health insurance system?  Is it not quite evident that, when a man is thrown back on 15/- a week during illness, when the outlay should be greater than when he was well, the children in the house will be undernourished during that period?  Their health is undermined to such an extent that it is easily impaired throughout their lives.</P>
    <P>National health insurance and not one word about medical benefits or curative or preventive treatment!  A dole of 15/- a week is handed out as a maximum.  Why do we want this expensive system to hand out 15/- a week?  Why do we not deal with it through the Post Office, as we deal with old age pensions, or through the labour exchanges?  The sole function of the unified society to-day&mdash;I know very well it is not the wish of those responsible for administering the society &mdash;is to dole out 7/6 a week or 15/- a week.  That is the beginning and end of their work.  Nothing the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else can say can get away from that.  This Bill should not be called a National Health Insurance Bill.  This is a deception practised on the insured population for a great number of years, and it is time to put an end to it.  Nine years after the setting up of the unified society, with all the investigations, and the reports made to the Minister and the section of his Department concerned, something more comprehensive and far-reaching than this measure should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to additional benefits.  We do not know exactly what the benefits are to be.  As Deputy Norton said, we have some idea of their limited nature by the amount of money mentioned.  It was very popular 14 or 15 years ago to abuse and throw scorn at the approved societies.  The actuaries sent in reports somewhat similar to the reports <Col N="1935" /> they have sent in regarding this unified society.</P>
    <P>The fact is that many of the approved societies were paying benefits to their members which apparently the members will never enjoy again.  That was not confined to societies dealing with members living in sheltered occupations, and who were favoured with continual employment.  I myself was associated for a number of years with an approved society in an agricultural area whose members were drawn very largely, if not altogether, from agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and town workers, and I am glad to say that that society was so well managed that we paid at least amongst the highest and most varied additional benefits in Ireland.  Prior to this unification, our members were getting 18/- per week cash benefit; the maternity benefit was considerably more than the statutory benefit, and the disablement benefit slightly higher.  We could have paid still higher cash benefits, but, having regard to the rate of wages being paid to the bulk of our members at the time, we did not think it was desirable to do so.  We had a system of dental benefits whereby we paid five-sixths of the cost of dentures.  We paid for full dental and optical treatment. We paid the full price of optical appliances, and for full hospital treatment for members, whether in a local or Dublin hospital.  All that was wiped out, and they now get 15/- per week as a maximum.</P>
    <P>I do not expect miracles from the unified society; I did not expect them before it was set up, because I knew the unified society would not get a fair chance.  It never did get a fair chance, and the Parliamentary Secretary is not giving it a fair chance under this Bill. So far as the insured person is concerned, this Bill practically makes no difference to him.  I believe it will make certain aspects of the administrative system easier.  Like Deputy Norton, I do not think it is any harm to have the old system of valuation done away with.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing this Bill, has not faced up to the main factors affecting the financial <Col N="1936" /> structure of the national health insurance scheme as it has been in operation or as amended by this Bill.  There are three big outstanding factors. The Parliamentary Secretary stressed them, and said that the actuary had dealt with them in his report in 1939, as if it were the first time we had heard of them, namely, compliance, malingering and loose certification.  Anybody who knows anything about the administration of national health insurance in this country knows that the two main things that affected the whole financial structure of the unified society, as in former years they affected the financial structure of the approved societies, were malingering and loose certification. One went, I might say, hand in hand with the other.</P>
    <P>Then the old question of disablement benefit comes up again, and again the Parliamentary Secretary refers to the actuary's report in 1939, as if it were the first time we had heard of it. Is it not that that was responsible for the grey hairs in the head of the secretary of every approved society in Ireland, and that is turning the hair of the administrators of the present unified society grey?  Is there anything in this Bill which will deal with loose certification or malingering or the disablement position?  Nothing whatever.  The Minister would get far better results, both from the financial point of view and every other point of view, if he would get those in his Department to devote half their time to those three points of loose certification, disablement benefit and malingering.  As a matter of fact, they all hang together; they are just as united as the shamrock. If he could deal with these and have them put right, he would have gone a long way, a far longer way than this Bill will take him, towards setting the finances of the society at rest.  There is nothing in this Bill or in the Government's mind that will make the system a national health insurance system.  It has not been, and, so far as we can see, it will never be a national health insurance system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With other speakers, I wish to express my keen disappointment at this Bill.  It would remind you of a great big fat hen cackling a lot <Col N="1937" /> and laying a bantam egg.  After nine years, I cannot see that this Bill will effect any great improvement.  I had expected to see outlined in the Bill that dental benefit, hospital treatment, optical benefit and convalescent treatment would be provided; that sick persons, whom convalescent treatment would help to improve, would be paid for in a convalescent home. Rheumatism has been referred to. The failure to provide adequate treatment for rheumatism is nearly as bad as the failure of the Government to provide adequate treatment, equipment and accommodation for tubercular patients.  The lack of adequate provision for the treatment of tuberculosis and the indifference of those in authority to the suffering of people afflicted with that disease is a scandal. Unfortunate persons suffering from that disease are waiting for treatment and appealing for treatment and cannot get it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Norton have referred to the fact that before the setting up of the unified society some societies provided the benefits I have mentioned, namely, dental and optical treatment and in some cases hospital treatment.  Until these benefits are provided we cannot call the system in vogue at the moment a national health insurance system.  It is just a method of collecting moneys and paying out small doles.  The maximum amount at present, I believe, is 15/- per week.  With the maximum allowance these unfortunate people, in most cases, are receiving outdoor relief from local authorities.  That is a new sort of way of covering up our difficulties from a national point of view, to throw the burden on the local authorities.  I was under the belief from what I heard that this Bill was going to be a vast improvement on the existing legislation, but I cannot see anything in it which anyone could enthuse about even for a few minutes. I hope that the Minister and the Government will go further towards what is required.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take an earnest part in facing this big problem, especially in Dublin, of providing for the proper treatment of T.B. cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> As I understand, the National Health Society have substantial reserves.  I wonder if it would not be advisable for the society to contribute, not meanly, but on a large, scale, to some institution that would deal with those already drawing benefit, who would pay if they got treatment, as that would take them off the pay roll of the society at an earlier date, and at the same time safeguard their health for the future.  I must say that I am keenly disappointed at the Bill that has been introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill indicate the conservative mind of the Government when dealing with the social services.  After waiting so long some of us had hopes that we would have a better Bill than the one now before the House.  In my opinion this is an enabling Bill for the expenditure of a small sum of money on national health services.  At Question Time to-day the Taoiseach was asked if he could state when there would be a recasting of the whole social services, and he expressed the opinion that the time had not arrived for such a measure.  The social services concern national health, home assistance, unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, old age and blind pensions, free meals for children of the unemployed, free school meals, and last, but by no means least, workmen's compensation. All these social services are operating under different Departments.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to the Taoiseach that workmen who are looking for compensation are thrown back on the national health benefit.  A man, drawing unemployment assistance, who goes to the labour exchange on a Friday morning to draw 14/- or in some cases where there is a family 23/-, has to go the following day to the home assistance office for vouchers, or maybe 4/6 in cash.  In other words a man has to deal with two Departments in the one week in order to get a maximum of 30/- to maintain the health of himself and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Government dealing with national health in another way than what is proposed in the so-called <Col N="1939" /> National Health Insurance Bill before the House.  I listened to Deputy Mulcahy talking about the necessity for physical training, but surely we could not talk about that until children going to school have been properly fed. We read in the newspapers that teachers have urged the drinking of more milk.  Parents are prepared to give their children more milk but where is the money to come from to buy it?  We are dealing always with effects rather than with causes.  If a workman who earned £3 5s. or £3 12s. every week is idle he will only get 15/- while he is sick, so that his wife has to go to the home assistance officer to supplement that sum.  I know a person who returned from a sanatorium, whose allowance was reduced to 7/6 weekly.  Boards of health estimate that they will require a certain sum to meet their requirements for the year, and when allowances of 15/- weekly are reduced to 7/6, the difference has to be made up by grants of home assistance. I could mention another case, that of a man drawing a pension from the English Government, who has been in this country since 1915, and after spending nine months in a sanatorium he had the weekly allowance for the support of himself, his wife and four children reduced to 7/6.  Nobody can estimate the cost of poverty and malnutrition that falls on the social services with which we are dealing.  I agree that there has been some step forward, but I look upon this as being an enabling Bill for the purpose of spending a certain sum of money.</P>
    <P>When we consider how easy Governments spend millions upon war and that here we propose to spend £8,000,000 on the Army, how is it that when we come to deal with public health we are told that we cannot spend millions to improve it?  The report of the medical officer of health in Cork was a most depressing document for anyone to read, all due to poverty and malnutrition amongst the people.  The death rate of infants amounted to 16 per thousand more than in 1919.  Comparative figures for the two previous years were 96 as against 73.  Tuberculosis cases have increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> I appeal to the Government to take another step forward and to bring in a really unified social scheme to be operated by one State Department&mdash;if you wish by a Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I think it is waste of money to send people to santaoria, as when they return home after six months they find that their income, instead of being increased in order that they may improve their health, is reduced.  I know one sad case in Cork where a man spent a couple of months in a sanatorium and when he came out found that owing to the war his occupation was gone.  He has been residing for 29 years in the same house, and now he has been served with notice to leave it.  How could that family live on 7/6 weekly?  Every one of the social services is concerned with national health.  I am aware of another case where a man who was drawing unemployment assistance injured himself while breaking wood, and as he had no stamps on his cards for two-and-a-half years he is now compelled to rely on home assistance.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government as a whole that they should cease trifling with national health by schemes such as have been put forward here and try to formulate a scheme under which all these services will be operated from one definite source.  On the question of malingering, I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey that it prevails to any serious extent although I agree that the present social system induces men and women to malinger.  We know that when a man who has reached the age of 45 or 50 finds that he has no chance of procuring work, his inclination will be to try to obtain a certificate that he is unfit for work.  It is well known that firms in this country are not prepared to employ men except they are under 30 years of age.  What then do you except from a man of 45, 50 or 55 except to malinger so as to get money somehow?  The fact that such attempts at malingering are made, merely emphasises the necessity for having a unified social insurance scheme, covering all these various forms of insurance&mdash;unemployment insurance, national health insurance, <Col N="1941" /> workmen's compensation, widows' and orphans' insurance, etc.  I believe that if all these various forms of insurance were centralised and were covered by one common contribution, instead of its being necessary to look for increased contributions from workers and from the unemployed, it is likely that there would be a big saving and that the scheme would be operated with some sort of humanity.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise again the need for this change because I repeat that the drawbacks of the present system are largely due to the fact that it is bound up with the money question and that national health takes second place to monetary considerations. There is no use in talking about what the insurance society and the committee of management can do.  They are simply there to dole out whatever money is at their disposal.  No matter what they may feel on questions of national health, the fact is that they are bound down by the money system and they cannot go beyond a certain limit.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government that one of the lessons they should have learned from the present war is that money should not take precedence of national health.  I hope that they will give effect to that lesson in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that I have very much sympathy with the unified society because of the position in which they are placed under this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that the purpose of the Bill is to release part of the income at present carried to reserve.  That I think gives point to the criticism offered to this measure by Deputies who have spoken, that the object of the Bill is not so much to extend the society's scope to deal adequately with the health of people who are insured as to deal with money.  The society has been, as I say, unfairly treated.  The Bill allows a certain sum, £175,000 each year for five years, to be set aside, and the society are asked to draft a scheme to absorb that.  I have followed very closely the work of the society, limited as it is, and I have read some of their reports.  They are reports which deal with the question of national health <Col N="1942" /> from the real standpoint of the health of the people concerned, but the society are handicapped by financial limitations. I could never understand why it is that, although the society has made for some years a profit of £250,000 and has a reserve of £4,500,000, even the Minister cannot touch that money to bring about the necessary reforms that the society has suggested.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as has been rightly said, does not deal with the question of national health at all.  If it dealt with the question of national health, the case that has been made surely should strike the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a medical man himself, and should strike the members of the Government generally.  It should surely strike them as ridiculous that a man with family responsibilities, when he becomes ill, has to try to exist, to get nourishment and improve his health on 15/- a week.  The amount that is provided in this Bill will certainly not give any kind of additional benefit to that man.  It will not in any way relieve his position when he falls ill again because the amount is not sufficient to finance a comprehensive scheme to deal with national health, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary himself realises, and as numerous speakers already pointed out.  There is no provision under the national health insurance scheme for the dependents of a person who falls ill.  Surely if you have a comprehensive scheme of national health insurance, it should deal with the needs and the health of the dependents of the person who has the misfortune to fall ill.</P>
      <P>In other words, is it not as necessary to guard the health of the rising generation as it is to give the miserable amount that is provided for under the principal Act, 15/- a week to the person who falls ill?  No provision whatever of that kind is made in any of the Acts from 1911 to 1936.  The insurance code takes no cognisance of the position of the dependents, the wife and children of the man who is ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I shall be told that the money is not available, that it cannot be got and that it is not possible under the present system to provide such money.  That is the rather peculiar <Col N="1943" /> mentality of peace-time finance.  That point was very well exemplified in a lecture which I attended at the Mansion House recently at which a member of the audience pointed out that an unemployed man gets 1/- per head per week for his children now but if bombs were dropped on Dublin he would get 5/- per week.  He asked where was all this money to come from and wondered if it would come down in the bombs.  The fact remains that when there is anything like a serious disturbance, things will be done that would not be attempted in peace time. The same remarks apply to this legislation. We are now asking the society to provide a scheme but we are limiting the expenditure to not more than £175,000 per year.  I think it was Deputy Norton pointed out that that represented only about 5/- per year per insured person.  Surely that will not be a very great contribution to the present scheme of national health insurance. As I stated in opening, I have sympathy with the society which has to try within those limits to provide a scheme that will in any way bring any amelioration to insured persons. Deputy Hickey has made the point, and I think it is a point worthy of consideration by the Government, that the proper way to deal with this question is to formulate a comprehensive scheme of social insurance.  There are so many different services associated with national health that the provision of insurance or any kind of financial help should be dealt with comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The only pleasing feature of this Bill is that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have got away from what I would term this antiquated actuarial investigating system. That system which has been in operation since the Act was passed should surely also change with changing world conditions and the fact that we are getting away from that system is the only hopeful feature in the Bill. As for the benefits that can be provided, I am afraid they cannot be very great.  That work will be left to the society and I repeat that I have sympathy with the society in that task, in view of the limitations imposed <Col N="1944" /> on them.  While the Bill makes an advance in the direction of breaking the manacles of the actuarial investigation, and does something which will probably be of use in the future, as it stands, it does not mark any great advance so far as national health insurance is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned, there is no criticism to answer, inasmuch as the debate has been confined, not to what the Bill proposes to do, not to the terms of the Bill, but to the various desirable things which different Deputies consider should be incorporated in a national health insurance Bill.  So far as the principle of the Bill, that is, the principle of changing from the capitalisation system of valuation to the assessmentism system, is concerned, it appears to meet with the unanimous approval of the House, so that, as I say, I have to make no defence of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hurley says there is nothing in it.  Many other Deputies have conveyed the same kind of thought: that there is nothing in the Bill.  In fact, it is almost suggested that it is a waste of time to discuss the terms of the Bill&mdash;so much so that they did not discuss the terms of the Bill at all&mdash;but surely in a matter like this we ought to be reasonable?  Is it nothing to the insured population of the country that, by the terms of this Bill, we make available for additional benefits a sum between £150,000 and £200,000 per annum?  Of course, it is not enough.  I have never introduced a measure of social reform into this House which carried with it an additional burden on the finances of the State that I have not been told, in terms which could not be mistaken or misunderstood, that we were not going far enough.  We never spend enough on our social services and our critics are never satisfied, but, yet, these very critics will attack us outside the House and will make political capital of the fact that, because of the increase in the cost of our social services, taxation is being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> In these matters of social legislation, it would be far better for all concerned if Deputies on the opposite benches did not play politics at all, but faced the realities of the situation.  The realities of the situation in this particular regard are that if we are to evolve the comprehensive health insurance scheme about which Deputies on the opposite benches talk&mdash;I am including the Labour Party, of course&mdash; additional money must be found, and a very large sum at that.  If additional money has to be found, we have to ask ourselves straight away: Where are we going to get it?  Increased taxation? If there is unanimous support in the House for increasing taxation for the purpose of extending and amending the National Health Insurance Acts, and all members will defend the Government for such expenditure, the Government might be found in a receptive frame of mind, but do not ask us to keep on expanding our social services, if, at the same time, we are attacked from Press and platform for the consequential increase in taxation which that brings about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy says that there is little connection between the health insurance scheme and national health. I will not pretend to be satisfied with the health insurance scheme from the national health point of view, but I do say that the provisions of this Bill are a very considerable advance, in so far as £175,000 will go to provide additional benefits, whether dental, medical, hospital, optical, etc.</P>

      <P>The list of benefits from which a selection must be made by the society is set out.  The society will prepare a scheme and that scheme will embody the additional benefits which this sum of £175,000 is calculated to provide.  Discussions will take place between the society and the Ministry as to whether the society's proposals show the best possible expenditure of the moneys available.  Additional benefits must be selected from the following: <Col N="1946" /> (1) medical benefit; (2) medical treatment for dependents; (3) dental benefit; (4) increase of sickness and disablement benefit for all members or for such as have dependent children; (5) payment of sickness benefit for first, second and third day of incapacity; (6) disablement allowances for members not totally incapacitated; (7) increase in maternity benefits; (8) allowances during convalescence; (9) building or leasing of premises and their maintenance as convalescent homes; (10) superannuation allowances; (11) payment of contributions to superannuation funds; (12) payments to members in want or distress, including remission of arrears; (13) payment to a member who, being in an institution, is not in receipt of benefit; (14) payment to members not allowed to attend work on account of infection; (15) reduction of contributions.  The following are prescribed under the Act of 1920: hospital treatment; cost of medical and surgical appliances; optical treatment; cost of nursing; hospital treatment for dependents; specialist services; increase of marriage benefit.  That is the entire list of possible additional benefits, and, within the scope of that list, the society will prepare their scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The last seven mentioned benefits are prescribed by regulation under the Act of 1920.  Up to &ldquo;hospital treatment&rdquo;, the benefits are set out in the Act of 1911.  Deputy Mulcahy has stressed the inadequacy of benefits of 15/- per week. Personally, I have a good deal of sympathy with that point of view, but, at the same time, if I had a limited amount of money at my disposal tomorrow for the purpose of national health insurance, I would prefer to expend it on treatment: on trying to make people fit to work rather than on increasing cash benefits which might, in certain cases, be an inducement to people to remain idle.  The real fundamental defect, in my judgment anyhow, in our national health insurance system, is in the lack of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> Deputy Mulcahy has suggested the possibility of co-relating the medical charities services with our national health insurance scheme.  When we talk here, as many Deputies have this afternoon, about the lack of treatment, and the absence of treatment we ought to bear in mind that our insured population get treatment under the Medical Charities Acts.  I do not think any Deputy will suggest that our dispensary system is not, on the whole, a good and efficient system.  If we are to provide medical benefits for the insured population, we are going to superimpose another form of medical treatment on the provision that already exists for medical treatment. In the larger centres of population it is quite possible that the insured person may have a different doctor under a medical benefit scheme, but certainly, in the rural areas, the only difference that an insured person will experience when ill, is that he will not have to go to a guardian or warden for the issue of a dispensary ticket.  It is the same doctor that will be available because, in most rural areas there is only one doctor available for the treatment of such classes of people.  But, apart from that, it seems to me that medical benefits for an insured person will get us nowhere unless we can provide medical benefits for his family as well.  The bread-winner, the insured person, when he became ill would, under the medical benefit system, call in his insurance doctor who would, I suppose, be in much the same position towards him as the panel doctor is in England, but when his wife or children became ill he would have to avail of the Medical Charities Acts and call in the dispensary doctor.  Such a system has not any attractions for me.  If we found ourselves in a position to finance a medical treatment scheme, I should like to see it applied not only to the insured person but to his family and dependents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the ravages of rheumatism in the insurance population.  The sickness experience of the National Health Insurance Society has established this fact: that rheumatism is a greater cause of sickness than any other two or three illnesses taken <Col N="1948" /> together.  Deputy Norton says we are doing nothing about it.  Well, we are. Deputy Alfred Byrne mentioned the same point.  The Deputy may or may not have heard that we have in fact acquired premises and are at present engaged in equipping them for the establishment of a rheumatism clinic in Dublin.  It is true that it may not, just at the very outset, contribute very largely to the solution of the problem, as the National Health Insurance Society see it, but, like the provision of the additional benefits to which I have referred, it can, I think, be claimed as an advance, and an advance in the right direction.  Perhaps, from the rheumatism clinic that we establish in Dublin, we may be able to develop out into the provinces and provide a more extensive system of clinics for its treatment. We feel conscious of the ravages that are being made by rheumatism, and, in so far as we are able to deal with that position, we are providing a clinic in Dublin as a start off.  As I have said, if we meet with an encouraging measure of success in the Dublin area, we may extend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred, amongst other things, to loose certification and lack of compliance as being the main causes of the financial drain on the funds of the society.  That is an old complaint with the Deputy.  All I can say is that the position would appear to have substantially improved in regard to compliance and certification. As regards loose certification, many substantial fines have been imposed by the Minister on certifiers who were guilty of what appeared to be gross carelessness.  I do not think loose certification is as extensive as it is represented to be.  I do not think there is any other point that calls for reply. As I have said, most of the discussion has centred round matters that are not in the Bill rather than on what it contains.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Distribution of Paraffin&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name, and the names of Deputies D. Morrissey and MacEoin:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the present method of allocating and distributing for domestic and agricultural purposes the available supplies of paraffin is causing unnecessary hardships and demands that a better method be brought into operation without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to say that I personally am chiefly concerned with the allocation of kerosene for agricultural purposes and I have experienced a good deal of trouble through representations <Col N="1950" /> from various farmers complaining of shortage of supplies.  At the time the motion was put the whole system of distribution was, to my mind, chaotic in the Department. Since that time the situation has improved to a considerable extent and I think it is fair to say that the officials in the Department who are responsible for the administration of the scheme as it now stands are prepared, on representations by Deputies and others, to do all they can to speed up the distribution of kerosene for agricultural purposes.  Where a shortage exists or where tractors are standing idle, they try to send out a permit without delay.  To that extent at all events, I think the situation has definitely improved.</P>
    <P>There is, however, this aspect, that the Minister insists on users of agricultural kerosene completing forms giving a monthly return of the work done and the amount of work proposed to be done in the coming month.  I suppose that has undoubtedly helped to tighten up any leakage of kerosene there might be through the illicit use of kerosene but, at the same time, it has caused some delay.  I think the Minister should appreciate that the one thing the agricultural community hate above anything else is the necessity to take a pen to write a letter or complete forms.  Some of them may be able to do it pretty well, but quite a number of the ordinary type of hardworking farmer find it a most irritating job to have to complete forms and to keep records of their work.  For that reason, it has caused loss of time and has resulted in some tractors standing idle.  In the last few weeks I invariably found where a farmer complained that he had not got his permit that it was because he had not completed the forms which the Minister's Department insisted on his completing or that he had failed to complete them properly, that he had made some mistake which was being chased by the officers of the Minister's Department and until that mistake could be accounted for the man simply had to let his tractors stand idle.</P>
    <P>That is a thing that, to my mind, ought not to occur or, at least, the <Col N="1951" /> Minister should try to avoid it as far as possible.  I suggested on occasions before and I again suggest&mdash;I do not suppose the Minister is prepared to consider this&mdash;the possibility of decentralising this service.  There are agents of the distributing company in the different distributing stations all over the country.  We have not so many distributing stations in the country. Those agents are a store of information in themselves.  They have been distributing kerosene to the agricultural community for a good many years. They know their customers.  They know the type of farmers they are. They have a good idea of the size of their holdings and of the amount of work that has to be performed by their tractors.</P>
    <P>That information was there all the time and no attempt has been made by the Minister to make use of it.  The biggest distributing station in the country so far as agricultural oil is concerned is at Carlow, which serves an intensive tillage district there.  I have no doubt that if it was possible for the Minister to send down one or two representatives of his Department to each distributing station, to set up a small office at the distributing station, with the assistance of the agents of the petrol distributing company, they would be able to solve all their difficulties on the spot.  The farmer looking for his supply of kerosene would go into the local office of the Department of Supplies there and, with the co-operation of the distributing company's agent, you would have the three interests served right on the spot and any difficulty that might arise could be straightened out there and then.  In that way you would ensure that on a fine day or a fine week, such as we have at the present time, when it is so necessary to have our people all out on the job of cultivating the land and getting in the crop, no tillage implement would be standing idle.</P>
    <P>With the very best intentions and the very best effort on the part of the Minister's officials who are dealing with this matter at the present time, it is my experience that tractors, even at present, and I admit that the things has <Col N="1952" /> been considerably improved, are occasionally standing idle, for some reason or other, through some error in the completing of the monthly returns, for instance, that the amount shown as consumed does not tally with the amount issued.  That has to be accounted for before there is any further issue.  With the slow postal service at the present time, while the farmer is accounting for that and satisfying the officers of the Department that the kerosene has been used to good purpose, he may have his tractor standing idle for a few days.  That is a thing that, to my mind, ought to be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to consider the question of decentralisation, I would suggest to him that he might consider this aspect of the matter at all events: the delay occurs at the end of the month; a man must make his returns at the end of the month, and before the new permit comes along for the succeeding month it is quite possible that he will not have sufficient to carry on.  It struck me that that situation might be helped if the Minister would consider giving a basic monthly allowance for each tractor, that basic allowance, irrespective of what returns were made by the farmer or tractor owner, to arrive at the beginning of each month, just as a lorry owner gets his basic allowance at the beginning of the month and afterwards gets his supplementary allowance on representations being made by him as to the amount of work he has to do.  I think the adoption of that system might help to avoid the unnecessary and irritating loss of time which does occur at the end of each month.  If the Minister is not prepared&mdash;and I do not think that he is, judging from his attitude in the past&mdash; to consider the question of decentralising this whole service of kerosene distribution, he might consider, as an improvement on the present method, giving a basic allowance for every tractor, that allowance to be given to the owner on the 1st of each month, so that he can carry on with that amount until he makes the necessary representations and completes the necessary forms for his requirements during the month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> As I have said, I am mainly concerned with the requirements for agricultural purposes.  The Minister, in replying to a Parliamentary question of mine to-day, informed the House that up to the present no arrangements have been made with regard to supplies of motor oil or motor fuels of any sort for the coming 12 months.  I think it was about this time 12 months that an arrangement was made for the supply of 20,000,000 gallons of petrol and 10,000,000 gallons of kerosene.  That agreement expires some time this month&mdash;I do not know the exact date &mdash;and I think the people are anxious to know what the position is.  A substantial amount of kerosene will be required for agricultural purposes, to get in the crops for the spring, and an increased amount will be required next harvest for threshing operations, and if there is any doubt at all about our future supplies for those purposes I think there should be a reduction in the amount allowed for domestic use. At all costs, we must secure sufficient to do our ploughing and cultivation, and try to build up a reserve for the harvest.</P>
    <P>On the question of oil for domestic use, I must say that I have not heard very many complaints, except that again in this case you have a flat rate for domestic use irrespective of individual requirements.  In other words, you have the man living in a cottage, who simply wants light for his house and has no work to do outside, getting the same amount of paraffin oil as the farmer who has outside work to do, and sometimes the dairy farmer who has to milk early.  From now on that problem will not arise to the same extent, because the days are stretching out a good bit, but farmers have found it very difficult up to now to do their work in the dark, and no effort appears to have been made by the Minister and his Department to meet their requirements. Evidently, the Department took the line of least resistance and decided that there should be a flat rate for domestic use.  I appreciate the difficulty of having differentiation between one section of the community and another.  Of course, it is objectionable to have differentiation, but, while a gallon of paraffin oil might be ample <Col N="1954" /> for domestic use in a very small house, the same amount would not be nearly sufficient to meet the requirements of an agricultural holding.  As I have said, if there is only a very limited quantity of kerosene available, we must ensure that there will be sufficient to do the agricultural work during the spring, and if possible to build up a reserve for threshing operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion proposed by Deputy Hughes. I have very little to add to what he has said, because, when this motion was tabled, conditions were not anything like as favourable as they are to-day.  Still, there is room for further improvement because I think the arrangements made at that time were hastily considered, due to the crisis, and that there is now need for a revision of the whole kerosene situation. I think it would serve a very useful purpose, and perhaps ensure a more equitable distribution of kerosene than we have at the moment.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the matter that I would ask the Minister to consider. When the issue of permits was notified through the Press&mdash;I think it was last June&mdash;numbers of people who for years back had always kept a good supply of kerosene in their houses did not think it necessary to fill up their permits.  They had a full year's supply and did not fill in the permits at the time.  They find themselves now in the position that they are left practically without oil.  There is one case of a proprietor of a hotel who has a little oil engine for electric light in his hotel, which is at a very important railway junction in West Cork.  He used to use a certain quantity of kerosene for working his engine for charging batteries.  He had a supply of kerosene and when that supply was exhausted he applied to the Department and found that he was cut out completely.  That has been remedied to a certain extent, but he is not getting anything like sufficient to light his hotel.  A case of that kind needs further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the case of people who have incubators and hovers.  Numbers of these also had their supply of oil in. <Col N="1955" /> These cases should be examined on their merits one by one, and where there is a genuine application by a person who, through absolute ignorance of the regulations at the time and having a sufficient supply in, did not apply for a permit at the time, I suggest to the Minister that an inquiry is very necessary. These people are serving a very useful purpose, and have been accustomed for years and years to rear chickens.  They are deprived of oil now simply because they had a sufficient supply and did not apply for oil last year.  They thought they did what was right, but they should have kept their reserves and would be getting a supply all the time.  They thought that, in a time of crisis, they were good and useful citizens, and served a useful purpose in not applying for oil when there was a scarcity.  Their cases certainly should be considered.</P>
    <P>There is also a case I would like to put to the Minister with regard to paraffin for tractors.  Deputy Hughes referred to ploughs being idle.  I have experience of that, too.  I also had experience, at the time this motion was put down, of threshing sets being idle. I myself had to ring up the Department of Supplies more than once, and more than twice, from Clonakilty, at a cost of 5/3 each time, and the owners of tractors had to ring up, and it cost them a lot and held them up for days. In one case, a man was held up for ten days through some little mistake in filling up his form&mdash;held up for ten days in the middle of the threshing season.  We had the same experience in regard to a tractor ploughman the other day.  He rang up the Department of Supplies immediately.  Whether it is the fault of the Department of Supplies or the fault of the distributor, I do not know, but there may be some blame on both sides.  This is further strengthening my case for a revision of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the small millers in the country.  One man in an isolated country mill, grinding wheat and crushing a little share of oats to keep the life in his family and the families of other people around him <Col N="1956" /> and having oat threshing for animal feeding, is held up for nine or ten days. In one case the stuff in his mill was taken to a water mill ten or 12 miles away to be ground.  Whether it is the fault of the distributor or the Department I do not know, but I rather think it is the fault of the distributor in this case, as he got a permit later on.  In any case, this should not occur, and I am again making a case for a revision of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>Another case I want to make for more equitable distribution is in regard to the importance along our seaboard of the sand dredgers. They are worked on little oil engines and could work the 24 hours of the day if they had paraffin.  There would be a demand for work 24 hours of the day, having three relays, and there would be a demand for this dredged sand, which could be carried by rail or in lorries inland for 30 or 40 miles.  In one particular case, where I applied on a man's behalf to the Department of Supplies, and where he was getting 30 gallons of oil for the month, which would not meet one-third of his requirements, there was no increase.  A man of that kind was serving a useful national purpose in providing the wherewithal to enable the farmer to produce wheat and beet and other things that the country wants.  There is no reason why kerosene should be held up, if it is available anywhere, where a man is performing useful service to the State.  The Minister should have in his own Department my recommendation on this man's behalf, and I could give him the name again if he wants it.</P>
    <P>He is only one.  There are several others like him along the seaboard who require kerosene at this particular time, when there is extraordinary demand for this form of coral sand.  I hope that the Minister will give consideration to cases of that sort.</P>
    <P>With regard to the domestic side of it, Deputy Hughes has dealt with that It is very hard to make a distinction between one house and another, but the Minister has made a distinction between them, as he gave an extra supply to the dairy farmer.  Who are not dairy farmers?  Who are dairy and <Col N="1957" /> tillage farmers?  We are not supplying milk to the cities and towns, but our work is as important as that of dairy farmers.  In fact, we are more useful, as we are working, and anxious to work, the full hours from daylight to dark on the land, and we would get up in the morning if we had the oil to let us do it and attend to the milking of cattle and feeding and so on, and we would do the same at night if we had oil.  But we are stopped and have to do this in the hours from daylight to dark.  It is holding up the whole work of the country.  It would give us and all our men an extra hour in the morning and evening&mdash;two hours extra on the land&mdash;and surely that holds up the work.  When a case was made for Deputy Corry, who was supplying milk to Cork City, surely a case could be made for giving a supply to Deputy O'Donovan doing his work in Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes mentioned the man in the cottage.  Nobody would like to deprive him of his light, but he has nothing to do, he has no cows to milk and nothing to do when he comes home from work but to light his small lamp, which will do in his nice comfortable little house.  We, however, want it around from the pigs to the cattle, from the cattle to the fowl and from the fowl to something else, and we want it going around in the morning and at night.  Of course, we are finished with that now, because under the law there is plenty of daylight; but when the time comes around again, I hope that the situation will be considered favourably by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible to deal with all the aspects of this situation. There is the domestic side of it.  I know from my own experience and from what I have heard from fathers like myself who have children going to school, that children come home with a heavy load of books and a lot of home lessons to do at night, and they have to learn all these and study these things and they are burning, not the midnight oil but the midnight dirty old candle.  Then they have to get up in the morning with a headache and try to go to school.  In a case of that sort, where there are children <Col N="1958" /> with home lessons to learn, consideration should be given, and I think that is the strongest case to be made for a full inquiry and a revision of a situation in the whole countryside.  I know children who, as a result of studying through the winter with candle-light, have had to attend the oculist, who recommended them to get glasses.  They are normal, strong, healthy children but because they had to work under such difficulties their sight failed and they complained of headaches.</P>
    <P>There are some of the many aspects of the situation.  I have drawn attention to a few important points and I hope that the Minister will give them serious consideration.  He should, at least, let us have the revision that we ask for.  Let us hope that before very long we will have a more equitable distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that end.  That is the Department I have most experience of, and I can honestly say it has been well run.  I admit there were difficulties at the start owing to the trouble in getting civil servants to understand that other people worked nine or ten hours a day, and even 12 or 14 hours a day.  Once that difficulty was got over, there was no tractor idle for the want of kerosene.  If the owner of the tractor filled in the necessary forms, there was no difficulty.  I am speaking as one who comes from a tillage area where tractors were working the full 24 hours.  The moment one man got off the tractor, another man got on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with headlamps. They got full supplies of kerosene and there was not one bit of difficulty in getting the Department to sanction the supplies.  I admit that since we have given way to the city people in regard to the new hours, there is a case to be made for the farmer requiring paraffin oil for his work.  Until recently it was dark at 9.30 or 10 o'clock every day and while, in Deputy O'Donovan's area, they could adjust themselves to that position, still we were faced with a condition of affairs when the farmers were obliged to work with lamplight.</P>
      <P>I admit that the dairy farmers got sufficient, but no more than that, for their work.  If the dairy farmer has to supply new milk for the town dweller's breakfast before he goes to work at 10 o'clock, then the dairy farmer has to get up early.  I do not think from what I saw during last harvest that there was any great difficulty in getting supplies.  On a few occasions I had to ring up the Department, but the difficulty at first was to get the officials to understand that the tractor owner was accustomed to work for seven or eight hours a day.  Once that difficulty was over, full supplies were forthcoming. There was no occasion when I rang up the Department that there was not kerosene in the tractor-owner's hands the morning following.  I would like to praise every bridge as I pass it.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan would say that considering the mess-up that he made of that Department for years. He has had long experience of it but apparently the officials got a bit of drilling since Deputy McGilligan left. They woke up.  Some inquiries are needed with regard to the manner in which paraffin permits are being issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> I heard of people in Cork City who have residences at Ballycotton and at other places along the sea coast which they visit during the summer months and I understand they have faithfully drawn their gallon of oil each month for the past three or four months.  A little inquiry along that line would do no harm.  It is our duty to stop wastage.  I have heard of gentlemen living in Cork, which has its electric light supplies, and who have houses in Ballycotton or Garryvoe or other resorts where they go for their summer holidays obtaining paraffin supplies, and I think the Minister should make inquiries into that matter.</P>
    <P>I admit there are serious administrative difficulties, but I do say that 20 per cent. of the kerosene is being drawn for purposes other than those intended.  We can see many motor cars along the roads and there is black smoke coming from them; I am sure they are not all driven on petrol.  A few inquiries in that direction would do no harm.  There should be tightening up in regard to those supplies.  I should like to refer to the dairy farmers sending milk to the city in motor vans.  Their basic allowance is not at all sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt the Department have improved things lately, but there was a time last harvest when they held up a lot of farm machinery.  I think they are not treating the farmers in my county fairly. Deputy Corry seems to have got plenty of paraffin oil for dairy people, but the farmers in the Midlands got only their gallon of paraffin.  In the winter months the farmers were trying to feed their cattle and they had to go around in the dark.  In many houses in the country there was no light and that was not treating the people fairly.  In the towns the people have the electric light, but in many parts of the country <Col N="1961" /> farmers and their families were obliged to go to bed at 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock.</P>
      <P>There should be better provision of paraffin oil than one gallon a month. The farmers have to work until 10 o'clock every night and there are numerous occasions around a farm when paraffin oil is very necessary. For example, when ewes are having their lambs they cannot be properly looked after unless the farmer has paraffin oil to light the lamp.  Probably that is a point the Minister has not considered.  Another custom in my part of the country is to leave a lamp burning in the field during the night in order to keep the foxes away.  That cannot be done on one gallon a month. If you go out with the lamp at night to watch the sheep you may get back in half an hour or you may not get back until morning and your oil supply is gone in that way.  Anyone who needs paraffin oil to look after lambing ewes should get it.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer in connection with a few cases in my county where there is a number of stud farms for thoroughbred horses.  The custom is that when these mares are going to foal a lamp is left with them at night for two or three weeks or even a month.  That lamp is there all the time until the foal is two or three weeks old.  Also, in the case of sows having their bonhams lamps have to be left with them. These are things concerning the needs of farmers which were not thought about, and they are points that I want to bring up.  I also found in a few cases of villages in my county that the shops find it impossible to carry on with a gallon of paraffin oil.  In one case, unless there was an improvement lately, they will not be allowed more than a gallon although I asked for it. The Minister should consider the position of farmers in connection with sheep in the lambing season, stall feeding, stud farms for brood mares, sows, and so on.  Paraffin oil is required in connection with all these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan also mentioned the children.  At the present time we see our people going to England and everywhere else, and the children are being left behind and are left lacking <Col N="1962" /> in religion and a lot of things.  I put that down to the bad system of education. To put it in a nutshell, whether Deputies will agree with me or not, no matter what they have to study, the position is at the present time that the children cannot study at night unless they have light.  In the country all you can do with your gallon of paraffin oil is just to use it to give light while you make tea for the people coming back from work in the evenings, or when they are going out in the mornings. It is impossible for the children to study their home lessons in the present circumstances, and that is all tending to deteriorate education in this country further than it has deteriorated in the past.  That is all I have to say, except that I must admit that whenever I went to the branch of the Department dealing with kerosene I found them very obliging and always willing to do what they could, but they could not meet me on those points that I have mentioned in regard to the farmers, and there is no provision for them in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, undoubtedly, within the right of Deputies to point out here the difficulties and even the hardships that are caused by a scarcity of paraffin oil.  A number of Deputies who have spoken already referred to the urgency of ensuring that a full supply of paraffin oil should be available for those who operate agricultural tractors or threshing engines.  Others spoke about the need for paraffin oil for incubators and dairy farmers and other classes of farmers.  Two Deputies spoke of the hardship imposed on certain households, particularly on the children there, because of the insufficient supply for household purposes.  We could have these examples multiplied, and I am sure that if the debate went on we would get many references to the difficulties created for fishermen, for industrial users and owners of stationary engines, and many other classes of persons whose livelihood or convenience depends upon the supply of paraffin oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that it is within the right of Deputies to raise these matters here, but I do not think they should ignore <Col N="1963" /> the fact that these problems are due to the fact that there is not enough paraffin oil in the country and that there will not be enough to give everybody the supply they require.  The problem that faces us is not that of ensuring that everybody gets enough. Our problem is to ensure how the limited supplies available, which are much less than enough for everybody, can best be utilised in our present circumstances. Last year we got in something less than one half the quantity of paraffin oil that we would normally import, and that in a year in which the need for paraffin oil, for agricultural purposes in particular, was greatly increased because of the extra tillage operations and, consequently, the extra harvesting operations, and the demand for paraffin oil for agricultural purposes, for tractors and threshing engines, was much above the normal, and much above the normal in a year in which the supply was less than half the normal.</P>
    <P>Clearly, somebody had to go without. It is not possible to give paraffin oil for all the purposes that Deputies might refer to, because it just is not there.  I and other members of the Government are fully aware of the hardships and the difficulties which its absence is bound to cause, but we cannot remove these hardships or end these difficulties.  It is not in our power.  If we could increase the supply of paraffin oil so as to give a reasonable quantity to satisfy all needs, we should be only too glad, but we cannot do it.  We were not able to do it last year and we certainly will not be able to do it this year.  We faced the problem of distributing, amongst the various classes of users, the limited supply of last year in the knowledge that we had to give the best part of the total quantity available to the essential users of it, the farmers and the industrial users, and that, consequently, the domestic users and other persons who required paraffin oil as a convenience or as a means to facilitate the operations in which they are engaged, had to be left very short, indeed. That is going to be our problem this year also.  Whether, in fact, we will get even the same proportion of <Col N="1964" /> our needs in this year as we got last year, no one can say.</P>

      <P>A guarantee given by anybody would be of no value whatever. Circumstances alone will determine what the supply will be.  Every Deputy who reads the papers must have noted the continued reports of the destruction of oil wells and oil refining machinery, and the sinkings of oil tankers.  Almost every day in the newspapers these things are reported and they are a warning signal to us that the problems that have restricted our supply of petroleum products last year and the previous year are going to be accentuated this year.  Up to the present we have no reason to anticipate that we will not got a sufficient supply in this year to maintain all the essential industries and keep them going, but as Deputy O'Donovan rightly said there can be no guarantee of it, and we can only hope that circumstances will not prove so adverse that our optimistic anticipations will not be realised.</P>
      <P>Now, the principles upon which paraffin oil is allocated for domestic, agricultural and other purposes, are very simple, indeed.  We decided, and the Dáil was aware of our decision, that food production should get priority over everything else.  I am sure that the wisdom of that decision will not be contested here.  The very great expansion in the production of food, which our circumstances required, necessitated the utilisation of all the available equipment to the utmost extent, and we tried to ensure as best we could that food production would not be hampered in any way by a limitation in fuel supplies.  We, therefore, decided to give to the owners of agricultural tractors and agricultural threshing sets all the kerosene that they required to enable them to operate fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> I must admit at once that in many cases there was a dispute between us and the persons concerned as to the amount they required.  Those who made claims for a supply to the Department of Supplies did not underestimate their requirements.  The tendency everywhere was to overestimate them, and it was necessary to have a number of checks upon their claims in order to ensure that they did not get more than they required, because Deputies will appreciate that every gallon in excess of actual need that went out to farmers for the operation of tractors or threshing sets meant a gallon less for somebody else.  So drastically did we curtail other users that there were many months of last year in which domestic users of kerosene got no supplies at all, and only towards the end of the year did they get a ration of half a gallon per month, a ration which was increased during the depth of the winter to one gallon. It is a very small ration, and I know it must cause difficulty in a very large number of homes in this country where there is no other means of illumination. The problem of school children doing their home-work, the injury that may be done to their eyesight by inadequate lighting, the problem of certain classes of farmers who are not getting an additional ration and who have work to do during the hours of darkness, were all pressing on our minds when we decided that we had to have in existence such checks upon the use of kerosene by agriculturists and industrialists as to ensure that there would be no wastage, no tendency to exaggerate the claims, no abuses of the system in order to get supplies to which the individual was not entitled.  Those checks were all designed to prevent hardship arising at the other end of the scale where the domestic user is to be found.</P>
    <P>In addition to the agriculturists there are industrial users.  Deputy O'Donovan referred to one class, namely, the grist mills throughout the country, which require a substantial quantity of paraffin oil to work the engines.  There are other industrial users who require supplies of kerosene. <Col N="1966" /> Most of the fishing boats operating around our coasts are driven by the same fuel, and many industries depend on kerosene as raw material for their operation.  I can refer also to painters, plumbers and workers of that kind who require supplies of kerosene. All those essential users of kerosene from the farmer downwards were listed, an effort was made to ascertain their requirements, a decision was made as to the relative importance of each class, and the available supplies of kerosene were distributed amongst them, keeping in reserve in each month as best we could some small proportion of the total supply to enable a ration of kerosene to be given to the domestic user for lighting purposes during the winter months.  That issue of one gallon of kerosene per month to domestic users is being continued for the present, and I think it should be continued for the present.  I know there is a risk that our supplies may be reduced in the summer and if they are reduced there is going to be a big problem for agriculturists.  But I think that we should take the chance that supplies will come in, rather than immediately reduce the allocation to domestic users.  As soon as the days grow longer that allocation to domestic users will be reduced and during the summer months it will again have to cease altogether, so that the requirements of the other essential users will be kept up and so that we can accumulate some little reserve to meet the greater need of next winter.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 4,000 agricultural tractor owners, and the aim is to give to each of these tractor owners all the kerosene he <i>bona fide</i> requires. That involves the filling up of certain forms and the making of certain returns which are used to check the claim of each individual owner.  I know it is a hardship on many farmers to take their pens in hand and fill in forms, but without that essential check upon the amount of work they have done in the past month, or propose to do in the next month, it is clear that abuses could creep in.  There is naturally a temptation to every tractor owner to try to get more kerosene if he can. <Col N="1967" /> Either he will use it in his domestic establishment, or his neighbours will require it, and in certain cases it is possible to sell it at a substantial profit.  In dealing with a wide variety of people, it was necessary to erect safeguards against all these possible abuses.  It is for that reason that these forms are necessary, and I do not think that it is an undue hardship to impose on farmers, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, that they should fill them in, realising as they must do the need for eliminating abuses in their own interest, because if abuses became widespread the supply available to them for their essential requirements might have to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>We rationed paraffin oil as from the middle of April last year, and, between that date and the end of the year, out of a total distribution of 5,400,000 gallons, the tractor owners got 2,500,000.  The total quantity used by them during the year was much larger, but that was the quantity they got from the end of April to the end of December.  Therefore, Deputies will appreciate that practically one-half of the total supply goes to that essential purpose of the production of food by means of tractors.  The allocation for stationary engines in connection with threshing sets was less, but nevertheless an additional appropriation had to be made available for that purpose, and the total allocation for industrial purposes of all kinds&mdash;and I include under that heading those stationary engines, fishing boats and the operations of Government Departments and local authorities, plumbers, painters, and the like&mdash;was approximately 1,000,000 gallons.  The allocation of 2,500,000 gallons to tractors and 1,000,000 gallons to industrial users meant that only 2,000,000 gallons were available for all other users, and that was a substantial reduction in the quantity normally required by those other users or for domestic purposes during the corresponding period in other years.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, some misunderstanding concerning the position of <Col N="1968" /> householders in the matter of registering for household supplies.  It is not true that a householder who failed to register at the proper time is now debarred indefinitely from registering.  A customer can register with a trader for kerosene supplies at any time; when the Departmental inspector is satisfied that there is a <i>bona fide</i> registration that trader will get supplies for that customer, whatever the supplies may be, whether a ration, as it is this month, or a half ration, as it may be in future months, or none at all in the summer months.  We are dealing, of course, with 18,000 traders in kerosene. Kerosene is a commodity which is sold in a very large number of shops and the supervision of 18,000 traders in that commodity is a matter of some difficulty with a very limited staff.  I have no doubt that here and there people are getting kerosene, as Deputy Corry suggested, who are not entitled to it. In due course they will probably be detected and brought before a district justice and charged with that offence. But it is almost a certainty that, having regard to the fact that there are 600,000 registered customers with 18,000 traders, the supervisory arrangements of the Departmental staffs have not yet succeeded in detecting all those who are getting kerosene without being properly entitled to it.</P>
    <P>In addition to the one gallon given each registered domestic user supplies have also to be given to other users, and for the lighting of churches in districts where there is no other form of lighting.  We also give it for various kinds of social halls where entertainments are available to members of the public residing in rural areas, for the lighting of nursing homes and hospitals where there is no other form of lighting, or where emergency lighting has to be maintained; for vocational and technical schools as well as dairy farms.  Roughly, we are allocating about 13,000 gallons a month in the form of supplementary rations to specially designated domestic users.  I think it is true to say, as the Deputy stated, that the administration of the rationing of kerosene is now working very smoothly.  It is always possible to <Col N="1969" /> judge whether any section of my Department is working smoothly by the volume of correspondence I get.  It may have been a hardship sometimes that the Deputy's constituents were making representations to him about kerosene, but it is no less a hardship to me than it is to him, and I am sure, like myself, he is glad that the volume of representations shows signs of slackening.  Experience teaches in this matter.  In the course of operating a form of rationing various improvements in the system were devised as members of the public became familiar with what was required, and were able to co-operate more fully with the Department in meeting necessary requirements before supplies could be made available.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to be able to decentralise control of kerosene distribution but, unfortunately, it is not possible, having regard to the very limited staff I have available, and more particularly the precarious nature of these supplies.  Deliveries are made periodically. There is no certainty any time that any further supplies are coming until they actually arrive.  It is necessary to keep central control over the quantity used.  It would not be possible to have officers distributed through the country at each kerosene distributing centre with any considerable element of discretion, and if they had not a considerable element of personal discretion left them then their utility would be greatly reduced.  If we were to give them a great deal of discretion it would not be possible to control at any particular time the quantity of kerosene for which permits were issued.  Apart from that difficulty, there is the staff problem, affecting the Department of Supplies in particular. It is, of course, possible to recruit temporary staff from members of the public, but that kind of staff takes a long time before it can be made an efficient part of the administrative machine.  In dealing with matters of this kind they require a considerable amount of training, not merely in Civil Service administrative methods but also in the procedure which must necessarily be imposed on public officers. There is a problem of staff which is <Col N="1970" /> becoming more acute as a larger number of commodities have to be brought under control.  On that account it is not possible to operate the elaborate system of local control which is conceivably feasible, and which might be operated if the number of commodities dealt with was very much less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.  While on the question of distributing stations, I want Deputies to appreciate another difficulty which is sometimes the cause of complaint. The petrol companies get supplies of kerosene and send them to distributing centres so that tank lorries can go around the districts with supplies of kerosene and petrol.  They cannot simultaneously put kerosene into every distributor's tank.  The process of delivery takes a period of days, sometimes a week, for distribution and consequently there are times when persons who got permits to purchase kerosene over some specific period may not be able to get it, because the supplies of the local trader have run out and the new supplies have not yet gone round.  I do not think it is possible to prevent these difficulties arising.  In my Department we have discussed with the petrol companies the question of reducing the possibility of delay occurring. Nevertheless there will be a period in particular parts of the country where the possession of a permit will not be sufficient to get a supply of kerosene.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The companies were anxious to remove that reflection on the efficiency of their delivery services.  Apart from that fact, there is no central store of petrol in the country which could be called upon at any time.  Kerosene, like petroleum products, is distributed as it arrives.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that in this matter we should endeavour to ensure as far as possible a full supply of kerosene for agricultural <Col N="1971" /> production purposes during this year, and I assure him that while we do not at present intend to curtail supplies to domestic users, if at any time it should appear likely that a new danger to our position arises, and that supplies during the summer months were likely to be further curtailed, an immediate reduction in the distribution allocation to other users will be enforced.  The most important thing we have to do this year is to ensure that our food problems are finally solved by home production to meet our full needs, and to the maximum extent in our power we must facilitate agriculturists in that task, even to the extent of imposing hardships upon other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan referred to hotel keepers not getting a sufficient supply to light their premises.  It is almost certainly true to say that no hotel keeper depending on paraffin oil for lighting purposes can get sufficient.  If hotel keepers of that kind are operating engines and entitled to kerosene, they will get a supply.  It may not be a full supply, but there can be no question about securing a supply for such hotel keepers.  As far as persons operating incubators are concerned, my Department acts on the advice of the Department of Agriculture. The agricultural instructors and inspectors report to their Department concerning people operating incubators, who require a supply of kerosene, and we issue kerosene to those whose names are on the list supplied by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are any persons entitled who did not get a supply, that can be rectified if the Department of Agriculture is notified of the fact.  These, I think, were the main points raised.  I do not want to appear unduly pessimistic as to the future, but so far as the first two months of this year are concerned, supplies came along on much the same basis as last year.  There is, however, no definite arrangement as to what the total quantity we will get will be. During last year a statement was made by the petroleum importing companies <Col N="1972" /> as to the quantities of petrol, kerosene and other products they expected to be able to deliver during the year and generally speaking, these expectations were realised.  I think they were slightly below the anticipated figures in the matter of petrol, but in relation to other petroleum products they were in or about or slightly above the quantity which they said they would deliver at the time during the 12-months period.</P>
    <P>I have not got a statement as to their expectations this year.  I think they have considerable difficulty in deciding what they expect supplies will be.  It may prove to be the case that they will not be able to tell us definitely. The matter is under active consideration with a view to ensuring, if possible, that we will get the allocation of paraffin oil increased, even if it has to be at the expense of other petroleum products, because real hardship arose last year owing to the fact that we did not get more paraffin.  If we can make any arrangement to increase the delivery of paraffin this year we will do so because I should like to see that difficulty removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy who took part in this debate, including the Minister, agrees that since the motion was first put down an improvement has been effected in the distribution of kerosene.  As the Minister pointed out the problem was one of acute shortage owing to the fact that we were getting only 50 per cent. of our requirements, and it was the responsibility of the Department to see that that 50 per cent. was used in the best interests of the country.  As the Minister mentioned, nobody can dispute the fact that food production should get prior consideration.  A number of people <Col N="1974" /> are, however, worried about the future. As the Minister informed the House, it is impossible to forecast what may happen as circumstances will have to determine what our supplies are likely to be.  One of the reasons why I stress the necessity of getting a fairly substantial reserve of kerosene, even by curtailing the quantity distributed for domestic purposes, is because I live in the middle of an intensive tillage district, where mechanical farming is the order.  If there is any breakdown in the supply, as far as cereal and agricultural production is concerned, we will not have horses to deal with such a situation.  It would be impossible to provide sufficient horses in a situation where there are 4,000 tractors, coupled with the fact that on the farms they have turned to mechanical farming and to mechanical implements suitable for haulage by tractors.  These implements are absolutely unsuitable for operation by horses.  The Minister should bear that in mind and, if at any time he sees any danger of a falling off in supplies, I suggest that practically all domestic supplies should be &ldquo;cut&rdquo;.  It would be utterly impossible in intensive tillage districts in which there is a big production of wheat and cereals to get crops harvested without tractors.  On many large farms in my constituency, and also in Wexford and Dublin where there is intensive tillage, the tractors are the big power units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that a large number of permits cannot be dealt with immediately by the distributing companies as their problem is one of transport.  I wish to point out to the Minister that that matter is dealt with on a monthly basis, and that the issue of permits from his Department takes place during the first week. That means that permits for kerosene have to be dealt with within a few days after they are issued.  Undoubtedly a hardship does occur at a certain period when there is a heavy issue during the first few days of a month.  That is the reason I suggested that the Minister should consider the possibility of introducing a basic allowance and then issuing supplementary allowances.  A basic allowance would save the delay <Col N="1975" /> which I assure the Minister is occurring.  There may be a good reason for delay at the beginning of a month if forms are returned uncompleted and if the officials are not satisfied that the information supplied is sufficient.  In the meantime the farmers are without fuel and they have to wait until they satisfy the Department that their supply was used for legitimate purposes.  Where I received complaints, my personal experience is that, when I assured the responsible officers that the applications were genuine, that I was satisfied the applicants were anxious to preserve the kerosene for tillage operations, and that there was no question of an illicit traffic, permits were issued immediately.</P>
    <P>I think it is due to the official responsible to say that, but nevertheless that sort of delay does occur.  Again, the fact that there is a big issue of permits at the commencement of the month accentuates the difficulty referred to by the Minister, that the distributing companies are unable to execute the big number of orders that come in to them at the beginning of each month.  The Minister must appreciate the fact that the big consideration in this vital year, when we are relying absolutely on the farmers' efforts to produce the nation's requirements in food, is that we cannot risk the possibility of any tractor standing idle on a fine day.  Take this present week. The loss of one day in a week like this would be greater than perhaps the loss of a fortnight during a wet period at another part of the year, when no cultivation could be carried on.  During the present dry weather, which is suitable for cultivation, the possibility of any tractor standing idle should be eliminated as far as is possible.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter, that the big issue of permits from his Department occurs in the first week of the month, and that because of that fact it is impossible for the distributing companies to execute all the orders immediately. For that reason delay is sometimes inevitable. Delays in the issue of permits will sometimes occur for one reason or another, but I think many of <Col N="1976" /> these delays could be avoided if there were a normal basic issue for each tractor at the commencement of the month.  In other words, it could be arranged that the farmer would receive, say, 50 gallons or whatever quantity the Department might determine as the basic issue, on the first day of the month.  That would give him breathing space to prepare his application for his full requirements for the month and then a supplementary allowance could be issued to him.  That would ease the position from the distributing companies' point of view also.  On the first of the month they could release the basic issue and then a week or ten days later they could issue the supplementary allowance for the remainder of the month.  I would ask the Minister to give that suggestion his consideration.  I beg leave to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>That in view of the chaotic condition of the transportation system this House requests the Government immediately to introduce proposals for the purpose of acquiring the public transport undertakings of the country and operating them as a public utility service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last 60 or 70 years the question of the public ownership and control of Irish railways and other essential transport undertakings has been the subject of innumerable discussions both in the British Parliament and here in this House since this State was established.  We have had six or seven commissions or tribunals, set up by the British Parliament and by our own two Governments here, the previous Government and the present Government.  These commissions were set up as the result of public agitation carried on by influential individuals, representatives of the Irish people in the British Parliament when the Irish people were represented there, and later by the representatives of the people in this House, as well as by <Col N="1977" /> agricultural and industrial organisations. We have had the Devin Commission, the Allport Commission and the British Royal Commission set up in 1906, which commission made its report in 1910.  The Devin and the Allport Commissions set up by the British House of Commons, although recognising the demand of the Irish people for the public ownership of Irish railways, reported against such proposals.  But the British Royal Commission set up in 1906 reported in 1910, by a majority, in favour of the State purchase of Irish railways.  The late Mr. Thomas Sexton, who was a financial expert, was a member of the British Royal Commission in 1906.  In making its report that body said that: &ldquo;Irish development will not be fully served by the railways until they cease to be commercial undertakings.&rdquo;  It goes on to recommend that the railways after State purchase be administered by an Irish elected authority.  The detailed method of administration was also indicated in that majority report which, as I say, definitely reported in favour of the State purchase of Irish railways.</P>
    <P>We come again to the commission which was set up by the Provisional Government in 1922.  That commission was presided over by the late Lord Justice O'Connor, and its other members were Mr. E. McLysaght, Mr. Thomas Johnson and the late Senator Michael O'Dea.  In a majority report the O'Connor Commission said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Looking at the matter in the abstract it is difficult to see an answer to the argument that a railway service should be, not only owned, but controlled by the State. The railway system of a country is a public service just as the postal, telephone and telegraph services are public services.  Every person in the community derives benefit, more or less, from it.  It is a monopoly owing its existence and maintenance to powers conferred by the State. Mere theory furnishes no reason why a monopoly of the kind should be run as a private concern in the interests of a very small section of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> The late Senator Michael O'Dea, who signed a minority report, said that he was in agreement with his colleagues in their general findings, but in view of the then existing conditions he could not endorse the recommendation in favour of State purchase.  &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is not the time to ask the Government to undertake such a heavy financial burden, independent of the fact that the conditions in the country are against such a course.  It is impossible to say what the Irish railways are worth to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We come to the time when our present Minister for Industry and Commerce sat on this side of the House and was recognised as shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Speaking here in this House on 9th December, 1931, as reported in columns 2645-6 of the Official Debates, Mr. Lemass, as he then was&mdash;I think he was merely supporting what other people had said and what, in fact, was said in the majority report of the O'Connor Commission&mdash; said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think there are no Deputies who will deny that preservation of the railways is essential to the industrial development of the country... If we are seeking to attain that aim I think we must also make up our minds that public ownership of these services is desirable, if not essential. Unified control and public ownership are necessary for a number of other reasons as well....  I think that as strong a case, if not a much stronger case can be made out for the public ownership of transport services as can be made out for the public ownership of an electricity supply.  The position here is that the case is also strengthened by the fact that there does not exist amongst the people of this country any feeling of confidence in the existing railway management...  We are strongly in favour of public ownership of transport services with unified control outside the boundaries of the municipalities.  Inside the boundaries of municipalities, we are in favour of municipal ownership and control of these services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> These are very strong words used by a very influential spokesman in this House on the 9th December, 1931.  I move the adjournment of the Debate.</P>
    <P>Debate accordingly adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise certain questions relating to the censorship, arising out of a group of questions I put to the appropriate Minister and which were replied to on 4th February, 1942. Some of those questions I can hastily refer to in order to get to the important one which I consider is in the forefront of the series.  With regard to some of these smaller ones, two or three points arise.  I had previously raised a question as to an editorial published by a Dundalk newspaper, and, in reply to it, the Minister told me that the same treatment was being meted out to that newspaper as to other newspapers which had fallen foul of the censorship.  I raised a question as to whether that was a fact or not, and I was more or less told that it was.  I assert now that it is not a fact that the same treatment was given.</P>
      <P>The <i>Kilkenny People</i> in January, 1941, ran across the Censor, and the wire which the editor got was that his whole issue thereafter was to be submitted to the Censor before publication. So far as the Dundalk paper was concerned, it made a much more defiant attempt to bring this country into dispute with a certain friendly country which was then neutral.  That paper was asked to submit editorial matter before there was any publication. How anybody can say that the same treatment was accorded to the two newspapers when one is asked to send the whole issue and the other only the editorial comment passes my comprehension, having regard to the fact that the Dundalk newspaper had tried to get this country at loggerheads with America by a very abusive and scurrilous type of editorial comment on certain things President Roosevelt had said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The reason why the <i>Kilkenny People</i> was held up by the Censor on this occasion was that the issue complained of published a Pastoral Letter sent by a Bishop of the Catholic Church of Ireland to a priest in County Carlow, in which, referring to a certain bombing episode which occurred here, the question was asked: &ldquo;What do these accursed bombers mean by bombing our poor country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no reference to the country from which the bombers came. I do not know whether the peccant word was &ldquo;accursed&rdquo;, but simply because the words: &ldquo;What do these accursed bombers mean by bombing our poor country?&rdquo;  were used, that editorial is not merely suppressed but the editor is told that all future issues of the newspaper will have to be submitted to the Censor.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy in that connection to find that, within a very short period of the attempted publication of that letter from a Bishop to a member of his community, the Department of External Affairs charged German air craft with violation of Irish territory. It appears to be an odd performance that a Bishop cannot complain of bombing being carried out on this country without stating where the bombers came from and that in a few days the Department of External Affairs can accuse Germans of violating territory here and of being responsible for the bombing.  I think that was admitted at the time.  Nevertheless, the editor is told that he must submit the whole issue before publication. The contrast is that the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> is told to submit editorial comment.  I say that equal treatment was not given, and the statement made in the Dáil that equal treatment was given was, to my mind, a falsehood.</P>
    <P>The second question related to an alteration in a communication sent by a Press agency for publication here from which the Censor struck out the word &ldquo;not.&rdquo;  I was told in reply to my question in that connection that the blocking out of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; changed what was a false statement, deliberately offensive to a particular nation, into a true statement which <Col N="1981" /> could be offensive to nobody.  It is peculiar that, in this situation, the fact that there was an intermediate course and that part of the sentence could have been left out was never thought of.  If people want to say that in a certain area troops when fighting will meet Germans and not Italians, it seems to be odd that they must say that they will meet Germans and Italians, instead of being allowed to say that they will meet Germans. That intermediate situation, however, was not recognised as one that could be passed.  It was a true statement &mdash;that they would meet Germans. That is one of the smaller matters.</P>
    <P>The third matter related to an official statement issued by the United States State Department as to the removal of General Weygand from office.  That statement was held up, and, when I queried it, I was told that the reason was that the censorship staff had stopped the publication of various rumours and unofficial surmises to the same effect, and when the official announcement came in, the staff went on in their own quiet way and decided that it was surmise.  It turned out to be an official report which had to be, and was, published eventually.  It was held up, although it was a United States Department publication.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I called attention related to four meetings attended by members of the Local Defence Force.  At each of them, memorials were unveiled to people who had taken part in the struggle against the British here.  News as to three of these was published, but news as to the fourth was stopped.  I could see no distinction between the four. The memorials were to men who fought for the same purpose and they were unveiled at meetings attended by Local Defence Force members. The reason given for withholding one publication was &ldquo;in order to give co-operation to the military authorities in keeping control on the functions to be attended by the Local Defence Force.&rdquo;  I cannot believe, nor is it a fact, that members of the Local Defence Force were forbidden to <Col N="1982" /> attend the meeting publication in regard to which was suppressed, and I do not see the purpose of suppressing publication of the fact that the meeting did take place.  If the military want to ensure co-operation, I am sure they have ways and means of doing it.  One way would be to prohibit members of the Defence Forces attending any or all of these celebrations. I cannot see how they distinguish between the three cases in which permission was given for members of the forces to attend and the one where some doubt is raised, but if that had to be done, it is surely a matter for the military authority to say that no member of the Defence Force should go to the meeting.  When the meeting, however, is held, it seems to be an absurd use of censorship to say: &ldquo;We will publish three but not the fourth.&rdquo;  These, however, are minor matters.</P>
    <P>The matter with which I am chiefly concerned is a matter in relation to which the Censor finally said that, in the interests of national unity, he took it on himself to stop controversy of a political nature in this country.  The way in which that arose was that a book, to which very widespread publicity, and very proper publicity, has been given, was published in this country.  It is written by a distinguished member of the National University and the title of it is <i>The Church and State in Fascist Italy.</i> The book was sent to the reviewers for review.  It was reviewed in England, and I think two papers published reviews here.  Amongst other newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> decided to publish a review.  In talking of Fascism, the author of that book said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. de Valera, so often accused of dictatorial ambitions by his opponents, has in fact stood four-square for Parliamentary democracy and popular government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That phrase was not censored and I am glad it was not.  I think it would have been a tragedy if that book had been forbidden publication or circulation in this country.  The book was allowed in.  That is a very small comment in the whole book and it is made <Col N="1983" /> as an aside.  I personally think it was not appropriate for the reviewer to advert to it at all, if he recognised the significance of the work, which was the relationship of the Church and the State in Italy.  However, the comment having been made, the reviewer thought fit to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. de Valera was not always standing four-square for democracy and popular government,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and he referred to the fact that he had fought a civil war against popular government and had denied the right of this House to its sovereignty, even at a time when he was a member of this Assembly.  That was suppressed by the Censor and, in fact, the review, when it came back, was so scored that it was decided not to publish it; but a little later the Censor bethought himself that cutting out any reference to that particular period might have logical conclusions which he did not want to stand over, and there was a certain amount of retreat hastily beaten on the point.</P>
    <P>There was a second point referred to.  There was a statement with regard to flirtation with Fascism which had been gone on with by Mr. Cosgrave and that was properly taken to be a reference to the Blueshirt movement.  The statement made in the review was that, so far from there being any flirtation with Fascism, the Blueshirt movement stood here for freedom of speech against blackguardly interference by people who, as I would put it, were favoured by the Government even in their blackguardly attempts upon public meetings. The statement by the reviewer that the Blueshirt movement stood for freedom of speech in the country was, the Censor decided, not a fit thing to be published, and the reason given was this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That at a time when the unity of our own people was more than ever called for, it would be contrary to the public interest to allow a fresh controversy to break out in the Press regarding either the Civil War or the Blueshirt movement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> Remember the book was not censored. The comment that Mr. de Valera had stood four square for certain things, was not suppressed. People knew that he did not stand that way always, and when the reviewer decided to point that out, then, if you please the interests of national unity come along and must be put on a pedestal.  It would be contrary to the public interest, we are told, to allow a fresh controversy to break out in the Press.  In a second letter the Censor beat something of a hasty retreat, and wrote this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Naturally the weight to be given to the last-mentioned consideration &mdash;which could be urged in support of the suppression of all political controversy&mdash;must depend a good deal on the circumstances of each particular case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The result was that certain alterations in the review were suggested, but if these were made in part of the text they would take away completely the point of the review.  For instance, the reviewer had said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The author is never at pains to conceal his rooted dislike for the Fascist system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The suggested alteration there was that the reviewer should cut out the words &ldquo;For the Fascist system&rdquo;, and leave the sentence: &ldquo;The author is never at pains to conceal his rooted dislike.&rdquo;  Later in the article, the reviewer wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Occasionally, indeed, one feels that he travels rather far afield in search of a weapon or two with which to lambast it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The end of that sentence was cut out so that it was made to read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Occasionally, indeed, one feels that he travels rather far afield in search of a weapon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must say that, when I asked this question, I thought the Minister would have said that he would have that particular statement of the Censor's reviewed, especially when taken in conjunction with the promises that were made in this House when we gave <Col N="1985" /> leave to have censorship in the country. On that occasion, when we asked that there would be no censorship of the political point of view we were told very definitely that that was the situation.  The phrase that went round was that the censorship was to attend to news but not views: that the political point of view would still be allowed, that people could have their views and have their controversies over them.  The point was that news might be censored, only such news as might give offence to either of the belligerents, or that might give away information of some type that it would be wrong to give away.  The position was that news, not views, was to be the subject of censorship.  I felt, when I raised this question, that I would not have got the reply the Minister gave.  Instead of the Minister saying that he thought the Censor had gone too far, he said in the course of his reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to the guarantees with respect to the censorship which were given to the Dáil in September, 1939, all I need say is this: that there was never any guarantee, express or implied, that in allowing full freedom for political discussion the censorship would allow any section of the community or the Press to undermine public morale or the authority of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, to say that Mr. de Valera had not always stood for Parliamentary government in this country is, according to this, going to undermine public morale or the authority of the State.  The reply went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And, in my opinion, any attempt to revive, at the present time, the animosities and bitterness of the Civil War would be disastrous to public morale and national security.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who wants to revive the bitterness of the Civil War?  If the author of a book says that Mr. de Valera stands in a particular way, is a reviewer not entitled to say: &ldquo;Well, he did not always stand that way&rdquo;?  Is a reference of that kind going to revive the bitterness of the Civil War and undermine <Col N="1986" /> public morale or the authority of the State?</P>
    <P>We know that this matter has a wider fling.  The criterion&mdash;the standard&mdash;that is to guide the Censor in future is his view of public morale or the authority of the State.  On the day that I had these questions down my colleague, Deputy Dillon, had a question down regarding the price of wheat.  We know what happened with regard to that.  A Pastoral Letter was issued by one of the Bishops in answer to the appeal made by members of the Government that the pastors of the Church should urge their flocks to carry out the Government's desire for an increase in the acreage under tillage. That was accepted by a particular Bishop who wrote what amounted to a Pastoral Letter in which he asked the priests to encourage the people in that direction.</P>
    <P>There was one paragraph in his letter to the effect that it might be well worth while considering whether something more could not be paid for the wheat grown in this country instead of spending vast sums of money on trying to bring in wheat from outside. That paragraph in the Pastoral was allowed to be read in the churches, but it was not allowed to be published. An editorial in the <i>Independent</i>, which was written for the 11th December of last year and which backed the wheat movement, at the end raised the question whether the imports of wheat might not be brought in here at an inordinately high cost, and asked whether, on that basis, it would not be better to reconsider the question of the State price for wheat, and find out what was the economic price to be offered for wheat so as to induce the farmers of the country to grow it.  The references to wheat-growing in that article were ruled out.</P>
    <P>The statement was made here that once a thing is decided in accordance with the powers given by the Dáil, the policy in regard to it can only be changed in the ordinary Constitutional manner.  When the Minister was heckled about that, his answer was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is the Deputy trying to argue <Col N="1987" /> that every galoot in the country should have the power to try to advocate starving our people or to disrupt the economic life of the country by refusing?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very easy to talk about what galoots in the country try to do, but we all know what was happening&mdash;that the people were pleading for a better price for wheat, and that that price has since been guaranteed to them.</P>
    <P>An editorial in the <i>Independent</i> dealing with the number of civil servants was held up for two or three days.  Contrast that with a speech made recently which got a certain amount of publicity.  It was a speech that might have a very serious effect on the neutrality of this country. Anyone can see that it was not the sort of thing the Censor would ordinarily let pass, but in the case of that speech the newspapers were told to publish every line and comma of it. That was making a Party use of a power that was given for a national purpose, and was allowed at a time when we had this call for national unity: at a time when as the Censor says&mdash;and the Minister stands over him&mdash;the unity of our people is more than ever called for.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about this unity of the people.  There is no such thing as unity of the people.  There is a pretence of unity.  As far as this Dáil has decided, two representatives of this Party and two representatives of the Labour Party, joined by members of the Government Party, meet in conference to discuss certain matters of defence.  Outside that there is no such thing as unity.  This conference has been used through the country as a means of pretending to the people that there is something like a National Government in the country.  We know that is not so.  We know it is the other way, and that the same old Party policy is being pursued.  We know that every appointment to be given is at the mercy of the Fianna Fáil Clubs, and that every appointment is filled by a Fianna Fáil partisan. Even though we have the Council of Defence, matters are still <Col N="1988" /> going on in the same old way.  As far as I am concerned, if the censorship is now going to be devoted to upholding this farce of national unity, I would feel bound to suggest to my colleagues that the time has come when that particular farce should be ended and that we should definitely get rid of that pretence of national unity now being made an excuse for an outrageously partisan type of censorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have said that he thought the Censor went rather far in that and that we would get back to the position in which political controversy was definitely going to be free.  That fact has led to a worse point than the point to which the letter to the <i>Independent</i> would lead us.  We have got the position now in which the Minister stands over the Censor in that and under the plea that there might be undermining of public morale, we are going to have a ruthless suppression of political controversy.  If that is the case, the other matter should be adverted to.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, of course, has gone very much beyond the questions which he was supposed to have raised here to-night and of which he gave notice.  He dealt with some questions of which he gave no notice whatsoever.  He dealt with an editorial of the <i>Independent</i> which was held over for a few days because it contained in it a statement that was rather contemptuous of the Army and would have a very bad effect on recruiting.  The editorial was released and it was published.  The principal indictment here to-night was about the review of this book.  The review was, in fact, released and was not published by the editor.  It was held up for some time, as I explained in my reply to a question here the last time, because it was bringing up controversies which this country cannot afford to be going into at the moment.  If we are going to survive this war, which, with <Col N="1989" /> the help of God, we shall, we have got to concentrate our energies on preparations, both military and economic, to defend the country effectively.  If we get down to controversy as to the rights and wrongs of the Civil War and of the Blueshirt movement and all the rest of it, we are certainly going to express our feelings and views upon those situations, each side of them, in a way that is not going to be conducive to national unity.  I do not think there is any good purpose to be served, as I said in my reply, by raking up all the past in regard to those movements.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the <i>Independent</i> held that in this book it was wrongly accused of supporting a Fascist movement here and, on reconsideration, when they put forward this point, it was said: &ldquo;We do not like this thing, but if you feel that it is necessary in your own interests to repudiate this and that this review does it, go ahead and publish it.&rdquo;  They did not publish it, and if the review was not published in the <i>Independent</i>, it was entirely its own fault.</P>
      <P>The <i>Kilkenny People</i> was treated better than the <i>Dundalk Examiner.</i> The <i>Kilkenny People</i> was not suppressed because of a Bishop's letter. It was suppressed because of a leading article which was a bad day's work for our neutrality and they were so informed.  The editor in his acknowledgment knew what he was being suppressed for and promised that he would not offend again.  When he gave the promise that he would not offend again and pleaded to be let off under the First Offenders Act, he was let off and he had not even to submit a line of his paper.  The <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> is actually submitting its editorial matter from the day it offended until to-day.  So that, if there was any discrimination, it was discrimination in favour of the <i>Kilkenny People</i> rather than against it. Deputy McGilligan knows the facts for himself and, even from the point of view of showing that he is disunited with Fianna Fáil on political matters, I do not think it is fair to exaggerate the case in the way he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> The alteration of &ldquo;not&rdquo; in the story which said that General Auchinleck was facing the Germans and &ldquo;not&rdquo; Italians, has been borne out to be completely and absolutely false.  Everybody knew it was a false statement at the time, and even the British Prime Minister the other day claimed that out of 60,000 casualties and prisoners in Northern Libya 40,000 of them were Italians.  If General Auchinleck was not facing Italians in the Libyan front, where did he get the Italian prisoners and casualties?  It was quite an offensive statement and unnecessarily offensive to a friendly power, and we cut it out in the interests of truth and in the interests of friendly relations with other peoples.</P>
    <P>The story about General Weygand, as I explained in the answer to my question, was this way: They are accustomed in the Censorship Department to get nightly and daily from all sorts of sources stories that say that somebody heard somewhere that somebody said somewhere else that such and such a thing happened.  There was a story about General Weygand which was altogether in the realm of rumour.  It was stopped during the daytime.  The night staff coming on looked at the matter that was stopped during the day and then when the story came in that the accusation was made by the State Department of America they did not recognise that it was an official statement and they cut out portion of the accusation.  I explained that in answer to my question.  I think that the answer was fair and comprehensive and that any reasonable man would see that the censorship staff, with millions of words, sentences and phrases being poured in on them, could quite easily make a mistake.  That is what happened in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan says that we want to stop controversy.  The people of this country have only to read the daily papers from day to day to see that controversies as to the ways and means by which this country is to carry on politically and economically and every other way are being debated from day to day with full <Col N="1991" /> freedom.  They are being debated with an extravagance from one section of the community that is altogether uncalled for.  There are a lot of Deputies who in this House and elsewhere should censor their own tongues. As far as the ordinary controversy in this country is concerned&mdash;you have the ordinary day-to-day attack on the Government, and so on&mdash;that is going on and nobody is interfering with it but where it does interfere with our defence policy, the policy of bringing this country through, of seeing that the national policy decided upon in this House is going to get a fair chance, the censorship comes down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, made a burst out at the Fine Gael Party meeting. I am not responsible for Deputy Dillon.  Over a number of years we tried our best to teach him sense, but when certain foreign journalists were waiting on every word to fall from his mouth there was no use in trying to stop his long outburst at the Fine Gael Party meeting.  If we had endeavoured to stop that particular speech, as we had stopped sentences from time to time of his in the past, in the particular circumstances of the time in which he made the speech, it would have got out in spite of us.  All the people of the world would have known that he was going gunning on his own and our own people would not have known.</P>

I say that what is true in regard to Deputy Dillon's speech, I will say generally with regard to the administration of the Censorship Department.  I am prepared to put the names of any six or 12 Deputies into a hat, or any half-dozen or dozen you may meet on the street and I will prove to their satisfaction that the censorship in this country since it was first operated has been operated honestly, in an honest effort to support the policy that this Assembly agreed upon.</P>
