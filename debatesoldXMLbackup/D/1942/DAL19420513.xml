      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that six sub-tenants of the house, 31 Nelson Street, Dublin, were evicted from their apartments on Tuesday, 28th April, and that they all had clear rent books in respect of their sub-tenancies, and whether, in view of the hold up in the building of dwellings by local authorities because of shortage of materials, and the difficulty experienced by evicted persons in finding suitable alternative accommodation, he will take steps, under the Emergency Powers Act or otherwise, to protect from eviction sub-tenants who are not in arrears with their rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to my information, the facts of this case appear to be that the premises, 31 Nelson Street, were let to a tenant on a contract of tenancy which included a clause against sub-letting without the landlord's consent in writing. In breach of the contract, the tenant did sub-let without seeking the landlord's consent.  The tenant committed a further breach of the terms of the contract by falling into arrears with her rent and, eventually, the landlord determined the tenancy by serving notice to quit and instituted proceedings for recovery of possession of the premises.  The court gave a decree for possession with a stay of execution for a considerable period on certain terms. These terms not being complied with, an execution order was issued and enforced by eviction of the sub-tenants on the 29th April, 1942.  I understand that the sub-tenants had already secured alternative accommodation and that, in fact, the actual eviction had been postponed more than once in order to enable them to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the facts disclosed in this case furnish any ground on which to base a case for interfering with the present state of the law in the direction suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the ordinary countryman's point of view, it is very difficult to agree to the Budget.  He must just accept it as a fact, without knowing the reason for this awful burden. Nobody can understand why it is that the poor man cannot find the ordinary necessaries of life while it is quite apparent that there are plenty of potatoes, oats and wheat in the country.  In the mills, licensed or unlicensed, I can find plenty of foodstuffs of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On making inquiry, it appears that the scarcity is due to want of administration by some Department or other. We hear of people being prosecuted and dealt with harshly for selling an ounce of tea but we never hear of anybody being prosecuted for storing wheat or oats, sending it to the mills and even using it as food for animals or for fowl.  The Minister for Finance, when introducing this Budget, should have had regard for the ordinary man who was badly off or who might become badly off as a result of the emergency.  There seems to be no provision whatever made for him.  It is a kind of haphazard Budget to carry us on from this year to next year, without any thought for the people who are the worst off in the country.  It is impossible to understand.  I do not want to reiterate what I said last night about borrowing a few millions.  Why does not the Minister for Finance, or the Taoiseach, take a bold stand and decide that, even if we had to borrow £5,000,000 more, we will place the people who are affected by the emergency in a position of some security? <Col N="2046" /> Why not try to create a situation in which production would be worth while?  Production has been to a great extent rendered unprofitable.  The small farmer has been driven into a position that he does not feel production is worth while.  With the exception of those commodities for which he has a guaranteed price, production does not pay.  It is only when you guarantee a price, when you guarantee practically a profit, that you encourage production.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that even though this Budget is so terribly high, he might have said to himself: &ldquo;I will borrow a couple more millions; it does not matter where it comes from.&rdquo;  I am not a financier, but a man in the position of the Minister should, at least, place the agricultural community on their feet and give them a chance of paying a decent wage to their labouring men.  There should not be all the bickering about paying people for cutting turf.  We are continually having strikes and bickerings week after week.  In my county there have been two strikes and I think that is general throughout the country.  The farmers&mdash;even Deputies on the opposite side&mdash;if they employ a man for cutting turf, pay him as a kind of skilled hard worker, but the people who were administering the £45,000,000 say: &ldquo;We will not pay such wages; we will stabilise wages,&rdquo; but they insist on the small farmer paying higher wages than the Board of Works or the Land Commission or anybody else pays.  I think that ought to stop.  If there is to be any consistency whatever, I think the Government ought to lead the way in the matter of wages.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to think that the small farmer who is badly off, who is perhaps rearing a number of children, has to pay one or two men a higher wage than is paid to men who receive their wages directly from Government funds.  The Government may say: &ldquo;We cannot deprive the farmers of men; if we paid more the farmers would not get men.&rdquo;  That is the theory evidently held by the Departments responsible but the farmers are not interested in that theory.  The farmers are interested only in seeing that they will get means to pay their <Col N="2047" /> men a decent wage.  The Government should give some kind of a good example in this matter.  They evidently cannot differentiate between good workers and bad workers; they have established the precedent that all men are paid the one wage.  Let the Government give a good example, even though it may cost a little more taxation or may involve further borrowing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that, no matter what the cost, the dairying industry will have to be kept in existence.  A fair price must be given for milk.  The price paid in the creameries must be relative to that paid to registered dairies whether in Dublin or outside Dublin.  If that is not done, the very foundation of the whole industry is going to crumble. Every month and every year, people formerly engaged in dairying are going out of production.  Farmers supplying milk to creameries find themselves in the position that they are not able to pay the wages claimed by the people milking the cows.  When they look at the price for which milk is delivered by the so-called registered dairies&mdash;so-called because there is no supervision&mdash;they say: &ldquo;Why should we produce milk at 7d. per gallon while somebody else gets 1/4?&rdquo; If not in this Budget, in future Budgets, some provision will have to be made for putting dairying on a proper foundation, as the production of milk and butter is one of the main industries of this country.  It is the foundation of our whole agricultural economy, because if the people producing milk go out of production, we shall have no calves, no cattle, and very little to export. I would draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to this matter, as it seems that the Minister for Agriculture cannot be brought to realise the position.  Even if it involved the expenditure of another £1,000,000, I say that dairying should be made profitable in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On hearing the Budget statement last week a prominent member of the Seanad exclaimed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What has posterity done to the Minister for Finance?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> It is clear that this question must keep cropping up in the minds of members of this House and of the people generally. What has posterity done to deserve the penalties which are being imposed upon it by this Budget?  Replying to a question of mine yesterday, the Minister stated that the total indebtedness of this State has now passed the sum of £90,000,000.  Added to that we have the indebtedness of the local authorities which I believe at the moment exceeds £35,000,000.  It is something in the region of £36,000,000. There you have a public debt of £126,000,000 placed on the shoulders of the people.  On that debt there is an annual charge for interest of £5,000,000 or perhaps something more.  Now the question naturally arises if it is sound policy to borrow money to balance this Budget, or to balance budgets in general; is it sound policy to compel the working people of this country to pay £5,000,000 a year in interest charges upon this huge borrowed sum?  We know, and it is now publicly admitted, that this money is created out of nothing. If the banks can create money out of nothing on the security of the State, there is no reason why the State itself should not create that money on its own security and thus save this £5,000,000 for the people.  That £126,000,000 represents a debt of more than £40 on the head of each citizen in this State so that every child that comes into the world in this country has to carry a debt of £40 and to bear an interest charge of 30/- per year. How long is that policy going to continue?</P>
    <P>We have been told that sound finance demands that Budgets should be balanced.  That had been the teaching up to the period of the emergency. It had been the teaching on the other side of the Irish Sea, but it has ceased to be considered policy at the other side of the Irish Sea.  The balancing of Budgets has gone out of fashion, and in this respect the Minister for Finance is very fortunate.  When war was declared, when the Germans went crashing across the frontiers of Poland, we had a somewhat similar commotion in the Department of Finance.  It was caused by the Minister's predecessor trying to get out of that Department <Col N="2049" /> as quickly as he could, because he realised, and realised very clearly, that it would not be possible, in the conditions of emergency, to make income balance national expenditure, and therefore he made his escape.  Now, however, he must rather envy the present Minister, because it is not necessary now to balance Budgets. The balancing of Budgets has gone out of fashion and, as far as any ordinary observer can see, it is not likely to come back into fashion for a very long time in Great Britain and, therefore, it is not likely to come back into fashion here for a very long time either.  All progressive thinkers in Great Britain declare that the high rate of expenditure which is in vogue at present must be continued after the war.  They declare that they will never allow a condition of affairs to develop in which expenditure will be contracted and great numbers of workers thrown out of work as they were after the last war.  We must face the fact, therefore, that for a long period the balancing of Budgets will be out of fashion, and we must ask ourselves what policy or what principles must guide the Minister for Finance, must guide the Government, must guide this House, and must guide the nation in regard to public finance.</P>
    <P>If, as I say, it is not necessary to make revenue or income balance expenditure and if, as I say, it will be found possible in the very near future to raise the necessary money to balance the national account without having to incur an interest charge, the question then will arise: what are the guiding principles of sound finance?  I believe that that is a question to which the Minister should devote his attention at the present moment.  I do not think that he has got much enlightenment on that question from this House during the last three days' debate, and I would suggest that in order to solve this question, as in the case of any other question of the kind, the easiest way to solve it is to reduce the problem down to its simplest proportions.  The main need of this nation is to continue to exist.  We, 3,000,000 people, are, I might say, marooned in this small <Col N="2050" /> State.  No matter what happens as a result of the present international upheaval, the people in this small State will have to fend for themselves. I do not agree for one moment with Deputy Dillon when he says that the liberties of this country are being fought out in the Coral Sea or in Madagascar or places like that.  I believe that the big nations that are engaged in war at the present time are not going to bother in any way about this little country, and the best we can hope for is that after the war we will be completely ignored.  If we are ignored in the future, as we are at present, what should our policy be? We have simply got to preserve the existence of this State and this nation.  Now, what are the fundamentals of existence?  If you want to find that out, let one man&mdash;let the Minister himself for example&mdash;place himself alone on a small island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I suppose it would not help us much, but let us assume that he was in that position; what would be his main consideration, if he wished to remain alive?  His main consideration would be to provide himself with the necessaries of life.  In other words, two main functions would occupy his attention: production and consumption, or, rather, I should put consumption first&mdash;consumption and production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but the purpose of production is simply for consumption, and if we take that as the guiding principle for this nation, we cannot go far wrong.  The Minister should consider, not how expenditure balances income, or not even how our external payments or our external trade balance, but whether production and consumption within this State are being maintained.  Now, you cannot consume without producing.  Neither would it be of any advantage to go on producing if consumption were retarded.  If, for example, an individual marooned on a small island were <Col N="2051" /> to go on consuming, as Deputy Hickey has suggested, without producing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would find himself in a very short time without anything to consume.  If, on the other hand, he were to go on producing goods, but for some reason or another &mdash;because he was too busy in production or because of some physical disability&mdash;he were unable to consume, he would very soon reach the end of his life.  The same applies to the nation, and if we examine our history over the past 20 years, and if we weigh up our economic and financial policy according to those two standards of whether production and consumption are being maintained at the normal level, we will find the real reason why this nation has been decaying for the past 20 years. We will find that production has not been maintained at the maximum at which it is possible to carry on production within this country.  We will find, on the other hand, that the people, the plain people, have not been permitted to consume the normal amount of goods and necessaries which is absolutely essential in order to preserve the life of the community.  It may be asked, why has not consumption of goods been maintained at a normal level?  The answer is, simply, because a very large section of the community have not been permitted to earn a sufficient income to provide themselves with the necessaries of life, and, because of that, we have been exporting large quantities of goods which, very properly, could have been consumed within this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, who has now become a favourite of the <i>Irish Times</i>, stated last week that the standard of living will have to be lowered in this country.  I do not agree with that statement for one moment.  There are some commodities which are in short supply but, on the other hand, there is at the moment a fair supply of all essential commodities.  If the Minister for <Col N="2052" /> Supplies had said that the standard of living will have to be readjusted or altered, I would agree with him.  We may have to change our standard of living to a certain extent. We may have to change from what was an international standard to an Irish standard.  In other words, we may have to rely more upon goods which are produced entirely within this country, instead of upon goods which are imported from abroad, but that does not mean a lowering of the standard of living.  For example, if a person has to drink slightly less tea with somewhat more milk and has to do with brown bread instead of white, or if a person has to wear clothing manufactured entirely from Irish wool or Irish-grown flax, that does not mean a lowering of the standard of living, but simply a change over to an Irish standard of living, which, I think, would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>There is no justification, therefore, for the Minister for Supplies telling us that we must lower the standard of living because by re-adjusting or distributing income more equitably over the poorer sections of the community it is possible to raise the standard of living considerably for a very large section of the community.  If, by reason of that change, other sections of the people have to do without certain goods hitherto imported, I do not think they will suffer any great disadvantage. The <i>Irish Times</i>, which cannot be regarded as being an extremist or a radical organ, but rather, for the most part, very conservative in its views, in an editorial in its issue of the 8th May last, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For most practical purposes the people of Ireland to-day must depend, in the first instance, on themselves. The only source of supply of which they can be sure is the productive capacity of their own soil and the skilful industry of their own producers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have outlined an economic policy which must be pursued if this country is to survive.  The question is: are we doing everything possible to secure the utmost production of the goods which are capable of being produced <Col N="2053" /> here?  Have we given fair encouragement to the producers of the various essential goods?  Some time ago Deputy Corry was, I think, accused of giving way to buffoonery in this House, but in the debate on this Budget he seems to me to have stressed a very important point: the fact that the total acreage under tillage last year is not in any way comparable to the needs of the country in the matter of tillage produce.  I think it is correct to say that the last normal year in which we imported tillage produce was 1937. In that year we produced ourselves 926,000 acres of grain and imported 14,000,000 cwts. of cereal produce.  The imports would be equivalent to 1,000,000 acres of grain crops, so that if you add these 1,000,000 acres to the 926,000 acres, you get, roughly, 2,000,000 acres, which means that in 1937 we consumed 2,000,000 acres of cereal produce, both man and beast. Last year we got only 1,400,000 acres of grain, leaving a shortage of 600,000 acres.  I do not think that the increase in the minimum acreage of tillage required and the inducements offered for the growing of grain crops have been sufficient to provide that additional 600,000 acres, nor do I think there is the least likelihood that we will get the 2,000,000 acres of grain which are still so urgently required.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Government have not faced up to the fact that it is necessary to have 2,000,000 acres under tillage and have been placing the requirements of tillage produce on too low a scale altogether.  Because of that they have been reluctant to offer the farmer fair remuneration for his labour to produce grain.  In addition, there was a complete failure last year to distribute the grain which was produced. At the present time we have a serious shortage of bread and flour for which the farmers are being blamed.  I think the blame attaches entirely to the man who has been described by the <i>Irish Times</i> as &ldquo;A bonny fechter,&rdquo; whatever that may mean, and to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  Last year the farmers in addition to growing 80 per cent. of our requirements in wheat, provided an enormous increase in the acreage under oats and barley.  A very <Col N="2054" /> large quantity of that oats and barley was put on the market although statements to the contrary have been made. Those statements may be true of some counties, but, as regards the main tillage counties, it is true to say that the oats and barley grown in them were put on the market.  When the grain was delivered to the merchants it was, so to speak, delivered into the hands of the Minister for Supplies because every merchant who purchased oats or barley did so under licence and had to keep a record of his purchases.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hold that the oats and barley produced here last year were in the hands of the Minister for Supplies last October.  The Minister for Supplies should have known that at least a certain quantity of the oats would be required for human consumption. He should have known that, even if there were wheat enough, there would be a very large percentage of oats required for oatmeal.  But he should certainly not have estimated that there would be wheat enough to supply our flour needs.  He failed to reserve a sufficient quantity of the oats which was in his hands at that time to supply human needs and, because he failed, we have a complete shortage of bread and flour at present, because there is no doubt that the oats could have supplemented our supplies of wheat and would have eliminated any possibility of a real shortage of bread.  In addition, if this considerable quantity of oats had been reserved for human consumption, it would be available for oatmeal and we would have ample quantities of oatmeal at present which would have, to a great extent, offset whatever shortage of bread might exist.  There you have had a complete failure on the part of the Government to provide for the essential needs of the people and, after that complete failure, an attempt to throw the entire responsibility for the failure upon the shoulders of the farmers who did make an heroic attempt to deliver the requirements of the nation last year.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that now, at the beginning of another financial year, steps will be taken to ensure that production will be brought up to the point <Col N="2055" /> necessary to supply the needs of the community.  That can only be done by making a thorough estimate of the amount of arable land which we have and of the exact acreage of each crop which will require to be sown.  It may seem late to speak of this when the 1942 cropping has been finished, but the next cereal year will begin in September and the three months which will intervene are only too short, considering the progress which Government Departments make, to work out a comprehensive plan of production which will enable the complete food requirements of the nation to be produced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated last week that the last 100 years of this country's history have been 100 years of progress.  That is the most extraordinary statement which has ever been made in this House, and a lot of extraordinary statements have been made here.  One hundred years ago the population of this country was twice what it is at present and we had 3,500,000 acres under tillage.  Yet we are told that the 100 years in which our tillage acreage has been brought down to little more than half that figure and our population has fallen to less than half what it was, have been 100 years of progress.  If we have another 100 years of that kind of progress, I do not know what kind of Budget the Minister for Finance at that time will bring in or what kind of country he will have to budget for.</P>
    <P>I have put as briefly and as plainly as possible to the Minister the principles that should guide him.  He should ensure that every citizen of this State is in a position to consume the essential foods which are produced.  A man with a family who has got 10/- or 15/- per week by way of dole or 15/- by way of health insurance, if he is sick, or even the minimum wage of 33/- paid for agricultural work, if he has a large family to support, cannot be in a position, nor can his family, to consume the essential amount of food that is necessary to maintain health. Therefore it is clear that one of the results of Governmental activity has been and is at present to compel a large section of our people to exist in <Col N="2056" /> a condition of semi-starvation.  No Government can stand over that policy.  In the same way, no Government can stand over the policy which has the effect of curbing and restricting production in almost every sphere of activity.</P>
    <P>If we look back over the last normal year of imports into this country, we will notice the enormous quantities of unessential goods which have been permitted to pour into this country from abroad.  In 1937, we imported £44,000,000 worth of goods.  At the same time we exported something like £22,000,000 worth.  The question which naturally arises is: if we raise the standard of living in this country by giving the poorer sections of our people the opportunity of using essential foods, will we not further reduce our exportable surplus of produce, thereby increasing, when normal times return, our adverse trade balance?  I do not think that is a consideration which should weigh heavily with the Minister.  We do not know what conditions may prevail in future. It is very unlikely that we will ever get back to the position in which we were importing £44,000,000 worth of goods.  Even if it were possible to import that amount, I do not think any reasonable person will seriously suggest we should return to that position.</P>
    <P>If we go over the list of goods imported, we will find that at least half of the total imports were of a luxury nature, and in order to import those luxuries our unfortunate farmers and agricultural workers were worked to death to provide the exportable surplus to exchange for those goods.  Our unfortunate agricultural community were compelled to produce food for our external market at prices which were altogether below the cost of production in order that the better-off and more wealthy sections of the community might be able to have imported motor cars, imported fabrics for various kinds of wearing apparel, imported drink, etc I think I have some figures here showing the value of the goods which were imported, and very many of those items <Col N="2057" /> could be eliminated or at any rate drastically reduced.  Here are the figures: textile goods, £4,500,000; wearing apparel, £1,250,000; maize products, £4,500,000; drink, £75,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The drink exports amounted to something like £3,000,000 at that time.  I do not see why we should have those large imports into this country, having regard to the fact that we have never got an adequate price, and are not likely in future to get an adequate price, for our agricultural exports.  The policy, therefore, should be to rely as much as possible upon our home-produced goods, to expand and increase the home market to the utmost of its capacity, while at the same time we would be compelled, in order to maintain our economic stability, very drastically to reduce imports. One of the smallest items on our import list is fertilisers.  Only, about £500,000 worth of fertilisers were imported.  If there is anything that we should import in large quantities it is artificial fertilisers.  In this country no matter how we aim at self-reliance we will at all times have to import a fair quantity of fertilisers, but there are other directions in which we must drastically cut down imports.  Therefore, I hold that the statement of the Minister for Supplies that we must lower our standard of living cannot be justified.  We must not lower our standard of living; we must alter it from a foreign standard to an Irish standard. I believe that can be done, and in doing it lies the only real hope of national progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious attention to those considerations. Comparing our national expenditure with national income is not always a safe guide, even in regard to taxation.  That is a guide which is frequently suggested to Ministers for Finance.  I think I have often heard it suggested by the Leader of the Opposition Party.  The national expenditure should not exceed a certain percentage of our national income, but I think a moment's consideration <Col N="2058" /> would show that national expenditure can have the effect of increasing or expanding national income, and that national income can be varied according to the amount of public expenditure.  Therefore, there is no safe guide for the Minister or for this House in a comparison between national income and public expenditure.  Neither is it a safe guide for the Minister for Finance to compare the management of the nation's affairs with the management of the private individual's own farm or business.  We know that if a farmer spends more than he earns, or if a worker spends more than he earns, he is heading straight for bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>There is not, however, an analogy between the nation or the community and the private individual, because the private individual has to depend for his money income upon some source outside of himself.  He has no money except what he gets from someone else.  The community or the State is not in the same position, because the community or the State can expand its money income from year to year.  As a matter of fact, every nation in the world is expanding its money income from year to year.  We are told that the amount of money on deposit in Great Britain has almost doubled within the last 25 years.  If that is so, there is no comparison between a private individual and the State which can guide the Minister in his difficult task.  The only safe guide he has is to ensure, firstly, that the community produces enough goods and commodities to supply its own needs; and, secondly, that every section of the community has a sufficient income to enable the people to use those goods when so produced. It is by watching those tendencies&mdash;the tendency of production to increase or decline, and the tendency of the consumption of essential goods to increase or decline&mdash;that the Minister for Finance can judge whether or not the nation is making progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Cogan speaking on the Budget made me feel that he was rather a lonely soul in this present world, because the view that, for any reason, one should deliberately contract imports <Col N="2059" /> is one that is no longer held by any Party in this State, nor in any country in the world.  In fact, one of the principal reasons for the war seems to be the decided belief of the two largest belligerents that they must have export trade no matter how much they might develop their internal production.  The conception that we would derive increased employment from a deliberate restriction of our imports seems to have no foundation whatever.  In fact, the distributors of imported goods, and the producers of luxury goods made from imported materials, might well like to interview the Deputy on the subject as to the effect on employment. The only possible reason for restricting our imports would be a desire on our part to use the money for some other purpose, and it could only be a temporary one, as in the case of the war, or alternatively because similar goods were made here.  I think all of us in this House would agree that we want the largest possible amount both of external and internal trade, both of external and internal production, and that each has to be reconciled with the other.</P>
      <P>Getting to the questions which have arisen in connection with this Budget, it is unnecessary for me at this point of the debate to comment on the Budget figures in general.  We have heard a detailed statement with regard to the effect of taxation on the community, and the burdens thrown upon different sections of the population. I wish to return to the theory that I have developed on previous occasions, and to ask the Minister for Finance whether, between this Budget and the last, he has considered the question of planning for our future. I notice a very desirable unity on both sides of the House with regard to this matter.  None of us, however, has any very definite ideas about it, but all of us must think of what the position is likely to be in the postwar era.  We have asked the Minister, not in too critical a spirit, in many cases, whether he has considered this matter, whether the Government have in mind some plan for our future position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> I should like to remind the House, what has been stressed here so often, that the national income has remained relatively the same for many years. We have had a relatively stagnant economy.  Both Governments have, in their different ways, contributed to an improvement in agricultural production. Both Governments have asked the State to bear many sacrifices for the sake of a particular political trend which they wished to follow in relation to our position in the world and in relation to Great Britain.  We have developed our social services, and various schemes have been initiated for the well-being of the people.  We have planned new industries and given security to our people in a time of war as a result of those industries and we have also given employment.  We have contracted a very considerable volume of debt, local and national, but the individual income of the people has not been enriched very largely.</P>
    <P>There has not been any notable increase in our animal population, or in the output of the agricultural community. We have already found it necessary to subsidise various exports. It is admitted on both sides that our grasslands are in need of very drastic treatment, in need of refurbishing.  Our agricultural machine needs reconstruction on a very extensive scale as a result of the political trend and turmoil of the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>I really believe that we have been living for many years in a fool's paradise, based on a belief that the purchasing power of the English people was a relatively changeless factor, so far as our economy is concerned, that whether it increases or decreases, we would be able, with a particular farm technique and a particular economic system to stand the decreases in prices offered to us and benefit by the increases and that there was little more we need do about it.  It never occurred to us in recent years that at some date the British Government, whether victorious or otherwise in the world war, would be compelled to check and control its purchasing price to a degree far beyond that made evident in the last four or five years. <Col N="2061" /> True, there has been a certain check on English agricultural imports, both a quantitative check and a price check, to some extent due to the economic war and later to English agricultural policy.  We have not altered our economy to suit those circumstances. We should face hard facts.</P>
    <P>We have had a peculiar economy in this country.  We have had a fearful land history, which has resulted in a tremendous volume of land resettlement. We have seen half our population emigrate and the incomes of those left at home have been very largely increased in consequence.  We have seen our store cattle and sheep taken away in large numbers at prices which we could accept without ever having to make a revolutionary effort at increasing output or reducing costs, excepting the period of the economic war, which was really an abnormal time.  We started to subsidise exports without realising that sooner or later the position would have to be examined as to whether we could afford to pay the huge amount involved and as to whether it was not an uneconomic proceeding. We have heard the Minister for Agriculture speaking on the matter in connection with the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>We have the colossal advantage of saving over £250,000,000, which we have invested in British securities.  That represents very nearly the capital value of our farms, with their machinery and buildings.  These were valued recently by a famous economist at something like £360,000,000.  That has provided a most useful cushion to our whole economic development.  Whenever we felt any pressure, there was always that mass of savings to rely upon.  When we were faced with the economic war, there was always the possibility of liquidating a small part of those savings. When taxation rose above a certain level, it was always possible to rely upon the savings to take us out of temporary difficulty.</P>
    <P>Naturally, those advantages are considerable, but I think that for the future we must consider that we are likely to face a change in circumstances. <Col N="2062" /> We have been for a quarter of a century, relatively speaking, in a state of economic peace.  We have never had to fight for trade, fight for it with our bared teeth. We have had to struggle here and there, farmers with small incomes have had to struggle, but we have never had to fight for trade as other countries have had to fight.  Our standard of living has been relatively high.  Other countries have had to fight for their very existence.  The Germans, at the close of the last war, began a drive for external trade.  It was one of the most tremendous factors in the post-war development. Their advertising technique, their currency manipulation and their propaganda in search of trade were among the marvels of the modern world.  They were forced by circumstances to do that.</P>
    <P>A great part of the rest of the world had to fight for trade, because they had contracted debts and they had to devise some means of paying them. As examples in that respect you had New Zealand and Denmark.  They were forced to dump their produce on the British market at very low prices. In other countries where they had no savings they were compelled to sell one pound of goods for every pound of goods they bought.  It was not possible for them to go to the Argentine and buy maize and pay for it with the money sent home by relatives in the United States.  That is a thing that we have been doing literally for many years.</P>
    <P>All these circumstances have created an attitude of mind towards output which has no relation to the future. We have seen the English agriculturist faced with the difficulty of competing with Argentine produce.  They first instructed their Government to engage in a series of marketing experiments, but these failed and then they adopted a scheme, in the stress of the war years, for an intensified refurbishing of the land and an increase of tillage on a scale never before deemed possible by British agriculturists. They were forced to do it because they had no other alternative. We have never been forced to take <Col N="2063" /> steps of that kind.  As a result, our standards of costs and technique have changed radically in relation to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>As I have said already on the Agricultural Estimate, it is rather terrifying for us to watch another agricultural country close to our own doing the work of 50 years in five years; to watch farmers receiving instruction in modern technique in the course of a few years which in normal circumstances would require half a century. We had a country whose agriculture had become the laughingstock of the world suddenly carrying out enormous schemes of development under the stress of war conditions, schemes that normally would require generations to perfect.</P>
    <P>Agricultural development has arrived at a new stage.  Modern machinery and the use of electricity are going to alter our standards of costs in this country in relation to the standards of costs which obtain in the country to which we send most of our exports&mdash;Great Britain.  The sands are running out very quickly.  We have not got much time left in which to plan our future.  We are rather like an island in which the people were accustomed to collect every year a volume of produce for sale to the mainland and were accustomed to have ships in the harbour to take the goods away.  One day there were no ships, the ships did not call, and then they wondered why they did not plan to have ships of their own&mdash;but, they were too late.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, after this war there is going to be a new order.  It may not be an ideal new order.  Human nature may assert itself again, but that we cannot tell.  It is not an idle prophecy to state that if three States are going to dominate the future common wealth of Europe, for the first time, we may not have the same freedom of exchange that we had before in our own small nation.  The first challenge of the economic war here may be the last challenge by any small State in our lifetime to a great nation in matters of trade.  We may have far greater regimentation <Col N="2064" /> than we have been accustomed to.  It is not an idle prophecy to suggest that the only method of maintaining trade will be by the quality of the goods and the price at which we can sell them.  These will enter largely into how much we can sell and to whom.  I would like to present these facts to the Minister for Finance.  I am quite sure he has considered them already, but I would like to ask him, particularly in relation to agriculture, whether he has any intention of preparing for the future.</P>
    <P>There will be elaborate reconstruction in Great Britain, which will limit her purchasing power very considerably. Her prosperity is based on export trade and the export trade will depend on what can be imported and her exports may diminish or increase according to circumstances.  We have to bear in mind that half our raw materials and half the raw materials used in industry in this country up to now have been imported.  Our future industrial development&mdash;according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a statement here&mdash;will be chiefly in electric power development and in the development of minerals. In any event, it is quite obvious, studying production figures in industry, that we cannot expect any great increase in prosperity from further industrial expansion.  It may aid us, but it can not make a great difference to the fundamental employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that the Central Bank Bill in itself is not going to be, in any sense, something that will automatically produce prosperity.  The only hope left is to attempt to conserve whatever export trade we had before the war and to stimulate it if possible. At the same time we must try to increase the consumption of foodstuffs by our own people, by reducing costs and purchasing prices.  There is no difference between the two Parties as far as that is concerned.  There may be differences in detail, but not in principle.</P>
    <P>All our history goes to show that we are inclined to take a fatalistic attitude to wars and a pessimistic <Col N="2065" /> attitude towards the future.  If we put it to the people that they have to indulge in a terrific struggle for their very existence after the war, I believe that they will be prepared for it.  We have all the brains and capital necessary to complete with any country in the world, even including New Zealand, and I refuse&mdash;having made a deep study of our agricultural conditions&mdash;to think that we should bow the head to New Zealand in agricultural production.  We may not reach their level, we may not ever be able to produce butter at the price at which she exported it when forced to pay her debt to England at any cost.  But there is no need for us to start thinking in terms of reducing our dairying industry, which gives the highest degree of employment in any agricultural district in Ireland.  We need not reduce our dairying industry, at least without further consideration.</P>
    <P>If our farmers were given the information which the House regarded as sound as a whole, as to what they would have to do in order to preserve the dairying industry, even if that information included very drastic proposals, and even if they were told there was no chance that the dairying industry could survive in its present form unless the whole system of production were changed, unless even, for example, there was a combination of individual and co-operative farming, unless part of each area were carved out and put into a large co-operative farm, with undivided land and smaller divided farms, what would they say?  If they were told there was no alternative, and that they would never become more prosperous, but probably less prosperous, unless they made a change, would they make the change, or would they accept fatalistically the prospect of never receiving one penny more income per acre of land for the rest of their lives and the lives of their children?  If they really faced that fact, would they not be prepared to face the changes, as long as they were related to the fundamental beliefs underlying the economic interests of the country and of family life?  As long as the conception of individual family life was <Col N="2066" /> preserved, would they not be prepared to make drastic changes to better themselves?</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that we have never told the people what they may have to face.  It is quite true to say that we do not know ourselves, but we do know that it will be a far more difficult life If we were told by the British Government that, absolutely and for certain, we would lose half of our English investments, that they were gone for ever, and that without any doubt we would never receive more than 75 per cent. of our prewar price for agricultural produce, would we not plan ahead?  Would we not start preparing the people to face an entirely new system of economy? Would we not start preparing to face that, to modernise our whole agriculture, to produce more grass, more crops and more cattle per acre?  We do not know exactly what will happen.</P>
    <P>I believe that by planning and by hard work, and by asking still greater sacrifices from the community, we can maintain our economy after the war&mdash;if we can maintain neutrality and still be a free nation so far as our Government is concerned, as, please God, we shall be.  I believe it will require planning ahead, and that we shall have to give far more encouragement to genius in this country.  All our history shows that we have granted many social services to the people, which were necessary, but we have not done enough to encourage genius.  It is only by encouraging genius that we can attract capital to new production. The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, says he does not believe in inflationary measures to bring prosperity.  The only other way of attracting capital is by encouraging genius, which exists in our people as a latent factor and which never has been allowed to reveal itself properly. This may seem an absurd example: if a man discovers a disease-free strawberry plant, he might never exist so far as the State is concerned, and nothing is done to encourage him.  We have to give a certain amount of encouragement by way of grants to the breeding industry and agricultural grants, but never yet have we gone in <Col N="2067" /> for the planned policy of intensive encouragement of genius to obtain better production.  I see no way, in our present economic circumstances, of encouraging prosperity and increasing it in the future other than by doing that.</P>
    <P>It looks to the average person that, no matter what may happen after the war, we can only sell our produce by two principles&mdash;by producing goods on the Ford motor car principle on a standardised basis, goods in large quantities at low prices, and produce manufactures on the Rolls Royce principle. This would mean better pedigree cattle, sheep and seed potatoes, for export to all parts of the world, new forms of plants, and handicraft industries.  We cannot live in the present atmosphere of half-way between the two&mdash;having a certain amount of standardised products and having a certain amount of half good and half inferior quality and a very small number of high-class goods for export.  We have to develop both types intensively as far as we can.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the very first essential would be an agricultural planning committee.  I do not care whether it is five or six persons or a dozen, as long as it consists of people who are practical men and who are experts.</P>
    <P>This committee will examine the question of how to increase our output, and, if any pessimist gets up and says that we may have no trade after the war, then I say that that requires more planning.  If we have to grow all our own wheat because we have no currency left, or if we have to kill off our cattle and live on veal, that still requires twice the amount of planning. That also will require an agricultural revolution, and maximum production encouraged by the State.  It is not for me to say which it will be.  I am absolutely aware that if we are to develop our industries further, and if we are to develop our minerals, our people in future will want to buy more goods and raw materials which somehow must be imported.  The men who will become mineral workers in any industry will want to buy goods many of <Col N="2068" /> which must be imported.  All of us agree that our trade is triangular, and must consist of planning for internal production and for exports.  There is no reason to have any quarrel or difference of opinion on the subject.</P>
    <P>The stress of war, it seems to me, has made us cynical.  I think if the Government started planning or had a commission on agriculture that commission could make notable proposals which could be carried out when peace arrives, some of them perhaps before peace arrives.  I ask the Minister once more whether he has considered that matter.  I believe the whole people of this country will respond to any demands made upon it.  I deprecate the cynicism we hear all round us as to the conservatism and stupidity of the farmer.  The farmer has never yet received leadership from a united Government, or a united Dáil.  The farmer has never yet been shocked into a sense of what may lie in the future for him.  He has never been placed in the position of having no alternative, but to make a great effort to increase output.  The day that the farmers of this country are informed of a proper plan that is accepted in a general way by all Parties, on that day we will see more prosperity, no matter what the result of the war will be, provided that no disaster occurs to make it impossible to maintain our trade, even if we have to accept lower prices.</P>

      <P>I understand it has a peculiar effect to be lifted up, particularly when 20,000 or 25,000 feet have been reached, and that it affects different people in different ways.  I should like to be able to describe my feelings after being lifted up by Deputy Cogan and by Deputy Childers.  I feel bad enough, but I am in a difficulty to know where I am after hearing Deputy Cogan's remarks.  It is certainly a sign of the times.  One of the signs of the times is that the Budget that has been presented to us is accepted in the way it has been, with a kind of relief.  It is a sign of the times if we get a Deputy who holds himself out as being, perhaps, the farmers' prime representative in the <Col N="2069" /> Dáil, proposing that farmers' exports ought, as it were, be cut off; that the poor farmers in the past have killed themselves for a trade representing £13,000,000 yearly in producing for Great Britain, and that they were not going to do it any more.  That is probably a sign of the times but, if it is, I am not as well able to judge what the times are going to be as I hoped I would be.  Deputy Cogan suggests that the Government should not be at all squeamish about taking or spending the national income.  The only interpretation that I could put on that is that Deputy Cogan thinks the Government could take a little more, or as much as they liked, of the farmer's income and do the spending for them. That, again, suggests that times are so changed that I have not been able to recognise the type of change.  I heard Deputy Childers telling us that we have to accept the situation; that what we want is imports and more imports.</P>
      <P>A friend of mine told me that on arriving in Jerusalem on buses with a tourist party they were met by what appeared to be an Oriental guide who greeted them with the words: &ldquo;Change here for Mullingar, Mullinahone and Tandragee.&rdquo;  As it transpired that the gentlemen who looked so Oriental had seen a particular kind of active service in Ireland my friend took very little interest in the gentleman, and did not relish being taken around to the Holy Places by him, believing that he had not such a long or intimate connection with them as he would have liked a guide to have.  I must say that while I followed Deputy Childers in his discourse, and in his painting of a new world, and of certain things that were going to happen, I could not but remember the things that he, as a Deputy, in supporting his colleagues on the Front Bench, has been responsible for inflicting on this country in the line of economic restrictions.</P>

      <P>If the results to Irish farmers, of ten years of Fianna Fáil economic policy, have been valuable to them I do not know what to say.  If we are to take Deputy Childers' remarks about the prosperity of the Irish farmers, and what the future means to the rest of the country, I should like to have an explanation as to the particular way the economic experiments carried out by Fianna Fáil on Irish farmers during the last ten years have been of any use.  Judging by what we heard from Deputy Cogan some of the representatives of the farmers have not learned anything at all from them. The two speeches have had a very bad effect on me.  They may be signs of the times, but I do not recognise these times.  Whatever about going into the more promising times that Deputy Childers spoke of, I hope we are not going into that kind of world that Deputy Cogan painted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the remarks of Deputy Childers that, for some time past, he, perhaps alone in his Party in this House, had been putting questions to the Minister as to what its plans were and as to what the Government plans were for the future, or even as to the present.  Deputy Childers wants an agricultural planning body set up.  It was only ten days after the emergency began in September, 1939, that we went to the Government without any consultation&mdash;the Army having been mobilised&mdash;and pointed to the importance of the agricultural situation, even as a base for any military strength that our people might have We went into considerable details as to the reasons why we thought it important to ask them to have a group of say, three experts holding watching briefs, not necessarily with the responsibility of interfering in any way with the administration of Government, or any aspect of administration, but watching things outside and watching things here so that we would have an appreciation of the trend of things in the world and so that such steps as we would have to take here to keep a grip on our economic administration would tend to strengthen us for the future as well as safeguard us in the <Col N="2071" /> present.  We were told that that was not necessary, that the Government did all that.  The Agricultural Commission, which was sitting at the time, went out of existence for the period of the emergency.</P>
    <P>When the Government started out on their compulsory tillage campaign, we asked them to run it through the agricultural county committees and to give the farmers the job of looking in a responsible way after the work of agricultural production, with whatever assistance the Government could give them, somewhat on the lines of what is being done in Great Britain.  But they would not do that.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture knew all about the matter. They were going to hold the whiphand and give the direction.  We have had the spectacle of 27 county committees of agriculture accepting, during the greatest period of emergency this country has ever seen, the bottle-necking of their work and the claim that the Department and the Minister for Agriculture could stand over the whole agricultural situation and give guidance and direction.  That only shows how the spirit of personal responsibility, the spirit of enterprise, energy and manhood has been, as it were, bludgeoned out of the country by the type of government it has had under Fianna Fáil.  The county committees, when things have gone from bad to worse, are brought together to be lectured by either the Minister for Agriculture or an official of his Department. If we felt that the farmers sensed their own responsibilities, realised that they are the people who know their job and that they have to co-operate with one another in controlling and directing both productive work and the policy to which it is directed, then we might have a better Department of Agriculture, a Minister with a better outlook and this Parliament might be better able to assist the farmers by the work done here.  So long as we accept the bludgeoning of enterprise and responsibility, as we have apparently accepted it, we shall lack the amount of production we need for our own people during the emergency <Col N="2072" /> and we shall lack preparation for the future as regards either catering for our own people or securing our place in a competitive market outside.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers has said that he asked for particulars of the Government's plans.  We have systematically asked for their plans.  From the beginning of financial business last year, we set out from this side to inquire what work exactly was being carried out by the Government to safeguard the people and secure their future and on what basis the security of that future was to be built.  We had in mind amongst other things the education of our people and the relief of our people who were unable to find employment during the emergency.  I do not know that Deputy Childers got a single answer to any question he ever put with regard to plans for the future or any aspect of those plans.  I cannot recall that we ever got an answer to any question we put on that matter.  Indeed, on the Central Bank Bill the other day, I had to reiterate questions I put more than 12 months ago.  In nothing that any Minister has said since then, have we got any indication of the Government's plans.  One of the weapons of modern welfare is noise. The Minister for Supplies came in here the other day to contribute, as it were, to this debate.  He made noise.  The general policy of the Government is to make noise and to try to browbeat the people into the belief that they had better keep out of things, that the Government is going to settle everything and that if they get into the Government's way it will be worse for them.  If there is one thing important at present, it is that the ordinary people should be encouraged and inspired to do their work.  Deputy Childers pleads for the encouragement of genius.  What we want more urgently than anything else is encouragement for the ordinary man and the ordinary woman to do his or her work.</P>

      <P>That is not happening. If we are to have any discipline, any courage or any energy in the people, we must have some kind of order coming from the top.  How <Col N="2073" /> can we have any sense of order coming down to our people when we have Ministers behaving in such a way in this House and in their administration that we cannot believe the things they say to us, while we know that their administration is creating more confusion and irritation than anything else?  The situation becomes shocking when we have back benchers of the Government Party getting up and jibing, as it were, at the people in the same terms as Ministers do.  Since last year, I have repeatedly appealed to back benchers of the Government Party to speak out in this House, to say what the facts are, what the remedies should be, and to show, what Deputy Childers suggests, that there is not much difference between the people of different sides of this House in their approach to the facts of the situation and to the real remedies. We have not heard much from the members of the Government Party. When we hear members like Deputy O'Reilly speaking, as he did yesterday, on the bread situation in the City of Dublin, we are inclined to wish that members of the Government Party would not speak at all, rather than that they should speak like that.  We have had occasion for some weeks past to draw the attention of the Minister for Supplies and of this House as a whole to the shocking circumstances created in the City of Dublin by the manner in which the Department of Supplies have been acting in regard to the bread situation.  We were asked to leave the situation alone for a while. We left it alone for a while.  It did not improve.  It is some weeks now since we discussed the matter here, but Deputy O'Reilly stated here yesterday that there is too much grousing and too much grumbling.  He repeated, as his opinion, the statement of the Minister for Supplies, that much of the trouble in the City of Dublin with regard to bread was caused by the people wanting hot bread.  I got this letter yesterday morning from a friend of mine who lives in Fairview:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I wonder if, by placing a few facts before you, you could get anything done to relieve the situation in Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien's Marino branch.  I am a registered <Col N="2074" /> customer there, one of over 600, I believe.  I never get bread except I queue for a couple of hours at lease.  On Saturday week&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Saturday was the 2nd May&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I sent my little girl down at 8 a.m. and she got my bread at 12.30 p.m. On Monday I went down at 2.30 and I stood until 5. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I sent down one of my children at 7.45 a.m. and I went down myself and relieved them at 9.30, as they had to go to school. I got my bread about 10 o'clock. My little girl was not too well on Saturday morning so I went down at 6.40 a.m., thinking I would be first, but some 30 people were before me, some arriving before 6 a.m.  I was served exactly at 9.35.  To-day, Monday,&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Monday was the 11th&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the bread I use, fancies, does not arrive until about 3.30 so I sent my little girl down at 1 o'clock, after her dinner.  I relieved her at 1.30 as she had to be back in school by 2 o'clock and then I had to stand for over two hours in the bitter cold. After the long wait, I was only given 3 lbs. for a family of six, including a man on night work.  They did not even give me their own allotted ration&mdash;29 lbs. per week.  If one does not queue you are left without any bread, as happens some 30 or 40 people every other day.  I was left without once myself after forming the queue for 1½ hours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a letter written on the 11th May and it deals with this woman's experiences on Saturday 2nd, when it took 4½ hours to get bread; Monday 4th, when it took 2½ hours; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, on each of which days it took 2¼ hours, and Saturday, when it took 3 hours, when a person had to be up at 6.40 outside the shop to get bread, and Monday 11th, when it took 3 hours again, and she received an insufficiency of bread at that time.  Deputy O'Reilly can come into this House and say that these people, who have to queue outside the shop at 6, 6.40, 7.45, 8 o'clock <Col N="2075" /> in the morning, stand for hours and send their children for part of the time and believe them when the children have to go to school, are looking for hot bread.</P>
    <P>There is as serious an emergency in the world as there ever was.  We have had speeches for the last two or three years from Ministers of the Government as to the terrors and difficulties into which this country is likely to run. Appeals have gone out for men and women, people of every rank and walk of life, to join the voluntary organisations of one kind or another, to prepare for these emergencies.  The whole strength of our people relies on the existence of ordered conditions in their homes and on the distribution of such resources as this country has in such a way as to avoid unnecessary hardship, unnecessary misery, in the people's homes.  Yet, we cannot distribute a few loaves in the City of Dublin without men and women and children in the working parts of the city parading at these unearthly hours.</P>
    <P>When we raise these matters here, about bread, coal, and other things, we are told we are grousing, we are stirring-up trouble, that these are fastidious people, they want their bread not.  How can we carry on any kind of organisation in a country in which the Government conducts itself in this manner?  It is not for want of money to get the machinery into operation.  It is not for want of assurance on the part of the Minister that he knows what requires to be done and that he is able to do it.  That is the manner in which the ordinary people find themselves helped to be disciplined, orderly, energetic, to stand shoulder to shoulder behind their institutions of State, institutions of State for which they are paying £41,000,000.  The very first necessary of life, bread, cannot be brought to the people's tables without such hardship, such unnecessary, degrading and soul-destroying hardship as is indicated in that letter.</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to our people.  Take our business community. A notice appears in this morning's paper that certain restrictions <Col N="2076" /> that were imposed by the Minister for Supplies on the importation of cotton, silk and woollen fabrics have been removed until the 30th June. Everybody knows that the commercial community in this country who have had to depend either on home supplies or imported supplies have had a very tough time of it in trying to serve the needs of the people.  One would imagine, in the first place, that their difficulties would be recognised by the Government and, in the second place, that their capacity to overcome their difficulties would be recognised for what it is worth.  One would imagine that Government Departments would realise that people who have been in the various trades, who have travelled, who have made contacts abroad, would know better how to gather in their supplies than any Minister or any Civil Service, even an old Civil Service accustomed to that particular class of work.  The Minister for Supplies knows everything, or his Department does and, on 13th March, 1942, without consultation with any people in the trade in this country who knew anything about it, they issued an Order that a licence would be required for any cotton, woollen, artificial silk or knitted fabrics of a particular kind imported into this country after the 28th April.  Following the issue of that Order, maximum prices per square yard were announced in a circular issued, I think, about the 28th March.  These prices were so fantastic to those who knew the business that they were the subject of criticism.  They were particularly the subject of criticism by Senator Douglas in the Seanad on the 25th March.  The result was that before the 28th April arrived a new set of prices was issued and the maximum prices were increased, in some cases from 20, 30, 50 to 90 per cent. The maximum prices were substantially increased.</P>
    <P>Firms who had placed orders in Great Britain for goods that were required for various purposes here, including dress-making, shirt-making, and tailoring, had to cancel their orders when they found that the price of the material they ware importing <Col N="2077" /> was above the price which the Minister for Supplies had fixed.  I put certain questions to the Minister on the subject. I asked him whether there was any restriction imposed by the British Government on the export of artificial silk to this country.  He said there was. I said there was not.  He said again there was but there was not and there is not.  He stated what was absolutely untrue and, if he had been in touch with the amount of material coming into the country, he would have known that there was no restriction imposed by Great Britain on artificial silk coming in here.  He fixed a maximum price for certain stuffs that were coming in here, in the way of, say, tailoring cloth, of 6/- per square yard.  Tailoring cloth cannot be got on the other side at 6/- per square yard or less.  The cloth that had been ordered at the higher price, on the cotton side and artificial side, cannot be substituted by cheaper priced fabrics and there is not such an enormous amount of stuff available in Great Britain that the suppliers over there are going to be bothered meeting people here who have entered into contracts with them to supply certain types of cloth, if the people here find that when it comes to delivering these cloths that they cannot take them. There is a limited amount of material available under quota for people who have made a contract up to 4th October, and if we want material here, we have to take it as quickly as it is offered because we will not get an opportunity of taking it later.</P>
    <P>The Minister's jibe in regard to criticisms that have been made here on the Order is that he wants to get material that will suit the poorer people and not the exclusive classes.  I asked him did he realise that by keeping out certain cloths he was creating unemployment here.  He replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am quite certain that the curtailment of these cloths will stop employment in many trades.  That is not the issue involved here.  We cannot avoid that but we can ensure that the minimum quantities available to us will be taken in the form of cloths that will be available to the masses of the people, not to the exclusive few.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> When we complain of the price of coal, we are starting red revolution; when we complain of the hardship imposed on the poor by the price of bread we are simply &ldquo;grousing,&rdquo; and stirring up disorder and disaffection amongst the people: when we complain of the keeping out of various fabrics that are required to keep some of our manufacturing industries going, to keep some of our dressmakers going and that are required to clothe our people, true to tradition and the kind of trickery he usually employs, the Minister for Supplies suggests that we are thinking of the exclusive few.  On the 30th April we were thinking of the exclusive few but this morning we read the Orders have been cancelled.  Why?  Because in the first place the Minister could not continue to tell us untruths with regard to matters that we could not let lie because the employment of our people and the clothing of our people were at stake.  He could not allow the Orders to stand because he could not allow himself ultimately to be found out when it was discovered that these cloths were not available at the prices he had fixed and that any other substitutes could not be found for them. Now he says to the unfortunate commercial community who are struggling as best they can to keep their staffs employed and to serve their customers: &ldquo;You can bring these in now up to the 30th June.&rdquo;  Why the 30th June?  The very fact that the Minister fixed the 30th June, for no reason in the world that he can state in intelligible words, will further prevent people getting stuff in here that is required to maintain employment and to clothe our people.</P>
    <P>In the case of any fairly substantial order it normally takes four, five or six weeks to get the articles prepared, finished and delivered here.  There is one large firm in the City of Dublin which has already been advised in regard to a fairly substantial order that it has placed with an individual firm, that that firm will not hold itself to carry out that contract unless it can get a guarantee now that, on whatever day the order is completed for the firm here, the goods will be allowed in.  I <Col N="2079" /> say that the manner in which these Orders have been issued reveals ignorance, trickery, face-saving, and utterly incompetent administration.  That is the way some of our commercial people are being treated at this moment, but it is only a sample of the manner in which various classes of people upon whom many sections of the community are dependent for the ordering of their industry and their employment, have been suffering for, I might say, the full three years of this emergency.</P>
    <P>It is in circumstances like these, where the people on whom we are depending for the carrying on of our commercial and industrial life are suffering not only these irritations but obstacles and difficulties created by the Ministers and their actions, that we are expected to carry on through the greatest crisis that our people have ever been up against, economically at any rate, and to prepare for a future that is practically unknown.  It is essential that every one of our people whom we can possibly reach by an inspiring word and a helping hand will be reached, and when we provide this Government here with every possible power that can be given by Parliament over the resources of this country, over the machinary of administration, over the administration of this country&mdash;when we provide them with £42,000,000 to carry on over the 12 months, we expect them to be an inspiration and to be a help to our people, and, if they cannot be, then they should, in all honesty and honourableness, clear out, because our people will have to make their way through the present difficulties and will have to prepare for the future or else suffer very much both in the present and in the future because of the lack of preparation.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister: what aspect of the expenditure of this money is strengthening our people's unity or strengthening their economic position so as to enable them to go through the present emergency or to prepare them for the future?  In June, 1937, when my constituency failed to return me in the general election of that time, the Minister for Defence, at the declaration of the poll, stated in my presence, <Col N="2080" /> to his listeners and to the country at large, that if I had not been so interested in Great Britain and had been a little more interested in my own country I would not have been rejected by the constituents of NorthEast Dublin.  I thought it was simply a piece of political impertinence at the time, but I am almost beginning to feel now that it was a prophecy, because if there is reaching me any spark of inspiration that would either quicken my courage or quicken the courage of our people here, any spark that would inspire me with hope, that would show me how things should be approached, how men's energies can be loosed, how their minds can be directed, how they can be brought into co-operative movement to work for their country, it is reaching me from Great Britain.  When I look for these things to-day, I have to look to Great Britain for them.  Can anyone in this House recall any day since the emergency started when we got an inspiring lead from the Government Front Benches?  Can anyone recall any of their public pronouncements in the country from which we got an inspiring lead on any aspect of the work being carried on by Government administration at present, that is quickening the pulse of our people, strengthening their minds, or enabling them to work better together?</P>
    <P>The International Labour Office met in New York in October last.  One of the principal matters that they met to discuss there was the report of the acting-director of the International Labour Office, a very distinguished Irishman, Mr. Edward J. Phelan.  That is an organisation where representatives of Governments&mdash;both the Government and Opposition sides of Governments&mdash;representatives of employers, and representatives of workers, meet to discuss general social improvement, and they have had a very considerable record of planning and achievement to their credit.  I wanted to know whether any representatives were being sent from Ireland to New York, and I was told that we were being represented at the International Labour Office Conference in New York by two of our officials in that city.  One <Col N="2081" /> of the most stimulating things that have been issued in any report of a director of the International Labour Office has been that part of Mr. Phelan's report on future policy.  As I indicated before, he placed before the conference an outline of a social mandate that might be made the basis, in all the countries associated with the International Labour Office, for a further betterment of the peoples' conditions, for their economic security, and their general economic and spiritual well-being.</P>
    <P>The report of that conference, attended by representatives of various nations throughout the world&mdash;some, happily, not engaged in this war, and some who have felt the ravages of the war&mdash;has been placed in the Library to-day, and while men, representing Governments, representing employers, and representing workers, have raised their voices there and expressed their hopes and their determination to work along planned and definite lines for the betterment of their peoples, and have exchanged words of hope and of courage with one another to inspire them to struggle through their present difficulties&mdash;even the difficulties of the war-ravaged countries&mdash;to better times, not one single word in that assembly, lasting for several days and covering much ground: not one single word of hope, not one single word of determination to plan, not one single word of appreciation of what the International Labour Office was trying to do, was expressed by either of the two representatives from Ireland.</P>
    <P>We claim that we are blessed by Providence that we have been able to remain free from any of the ravages of war.  We accept the difficulties that the war has brought us.  We call to our past to range our men in military organisations of one kind or another in order to show that we are going to defend this country against anyone.  But we malign our past when we put our national heroes and our national prototypes into uniform and hold them there as soldiers.  The men who most distinguished themselves as soldiers in this country in <Col N="2082" /> the past, the men who most distinguished themselves in the achievement of the liberties of this country, were in uniform simply because there were things that they wanted to defend.  They turned aside from their major work to do what soldiering was required of them.  If you go back to Pearse, MacSwiney, MacDermott, Connolly, Collins&mdash;any of those whose names we reverence to-day&mdash;you will find that they were soldiers last, and constructive workers for Ireland first, with ideals that they painted in their words and showed in their deeds, but all the constructive, strenuous, planning work of the people to whom we are supposed to look back as our leaders and inspirers is forgotten, and we think that we are following their tradition to-day when we organise an Army and say that we are going to fight whomsoever comes our way.</P>
    <P>We are blessed with peace in this country and should accept the responsibility that it puts on our shoulders to show by what we are doing here that the peoples who are struggling under war, and under the difficulties of war, can have faith in the hopes that are burning in them for a better future, and that it can be realised. There is no country in the world that, at the moment, can create that happy picture for the future if this country cannot do it.  The position, however, in this country is that we still find thousands of our young people leaving the primary schools of our city every day at the age of 14, thus becoming almost wasted human material by the time there is any chance of their getting work.  Nothing is being done at the present time to strengthen our educational foundations or to systematise throughout the country the work that is necessary to be done.  There is no concentration, in a systematic way. on any kind of a social plan.  On page 98 of the acting-director's report to the International Labour Conference in New York, Mr. Phelan sets out a number of headings which he considers would constitute a general declaration on international social policy and would give the international labour organisation a programme to implement, completing <Col N="2083" /> it with any necessary detail. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not difficult to outline in a certain logical order the main points and principles which such a mandate should cover.  They are: (1) the elimination of unemployment; (2) the establishment of machinery for placing, vocational training, and retraining; (3) the improvement of social insurance in all its fields and in particular its extension to all classes of workers; (4) the institution of a wage policy aimed at securing a just share of the fruits of progress for the worker; (5) a minimum living wage for those too weak to secure it for themselves; (6) measures to promote better nutrition, and to provide adequate housing and facilities for recreation and culture; (7) greater equality of occupational opportunity; (8) improved conditions of work; (9) an international public works policy for the development of the world's resources; (10) the organisation of migration for employment and settlement under adequate guarantees for all concerned; (11) collaboration of employers and workers in the initiation and application of economic and social measures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can we take anyone of these and say around which one of them is any serious work being concentrated at the present time, work that would strengthen both our social fabric on the one hand and the capacity to employ our people on the other?  We have only to look outside to see how far other people are progressing. Deputy Dillon spoke yesterday about family allowances.  The <i>London Times</i> the day before&mdash;on May 11th&mdash;dealing with the report on family allowances which had been published a few days before in Great Britain said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principle of raising the economic status of the family and of mitigating poverty due to the insufficiency of earnings to meet the responsibilities of parenthood has already won general, if not universal, acceptance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> Again, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Political circles, following the lead of enlightened opinion throughout the country in every class and every occupation, appear now to have reached the point of agreement to extend this principle to include the wage and salary earning population as a whole.  The principle has been virtually accepted....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And again:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wise as well as the courageous policy will be to apply this scheme from the outset to all children, whatever the size of the family, and not to restrict it to children in excess of one or two.  It will be recognised that this expenditure would impose no additional burden on the national income or the national resources.  What it involves is the transfer of a fraction of the resources of those who have no dependent children to those who have such responsibilities.  Equity and national interest combined to justify this transfer.  This is an issue where progress towards building the healthier society of the future need not await the end of hostilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the issue of <i>The Economist</i> for the 9th May, the general position is subscribed to also.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the ultimate aim is to ensure that no family shall fall below a minimum standard of subsistence, by reason of its size or of its breadwinner's low-earning capacity, or of his or her sickness or disability.  The object, therefore, should be to lay down a minimum family income below which no household in the land should fall; and, although allowances for children are an indispensable step towards this end, more is needed to bring above the same lower line the sum of all the various kinds of income through wages, insurance, pensions and allowances which make up the revenue of the working-class household.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The time is opportune to work out an immediate programme which, leaving the industrial bargain <Col N="2085" /> unfettered except by the widest laws against sweating, will make certain that no families fall into destitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems which people, burdened by the biggest burdens that war can impose upon a people, are thinking of.  They are approaching some fundamental aspects of their social problem in that way. They maintain that they can only get through that work, and other more urgent work, by the full and complete use of the democratic machinery.  They do not appeal for special consideration and respect for genius.  They realise that they cannot maintain themselves or do their national work unless the ordinary men and women and children are safeguarded economically.</P>
    <P>Sir Stafford Cripps, speaking on the 8th May, as reported in the <i>Times</i> of the 9th, of the importance of the part played by Parliament and the members in maintaining the democratic institutions, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Democracy would live or die by the way we conducted our Parliamentary institutions in these difficult times and through the interpretation of that conduct, whether it might be good or bad, by the Press Gallery to the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How are we, with our better opportunities but, you might say, with the same problems, using our democratic institutions for the solution of these things?  We have Ministers whose word we cannot believe, who brazen out their administrative mistakes even when their administrative mistakes inflict losses on the commercial community and suffering, through lack of employment, on our workers.  We have Ministers who jibe at the people with such jibes as that of the Minister for Supplies about their hot bread, when people have to stand in bread queues at 6, 7, 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning and for three or four hours in the day to get bread for their families. We appealed week after week and month after month to Minister, on the one hand, and to their Party, who control the votes of this House, on the other hand, to discuss our national <Col N="2086" /> problems and their solution intelligently and with a full exposure of the facts here in this House, but we have looked in vain, I might say from the very beginning of this emergency, for any facing up to their responsibilities either by the Ministry or by the Party which sits behind them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan advised the Minister the other day to go on to an island. Everything he said indicates that we can no longer hide ourselves on this island, even when people in the world outside want to ignore us, from the impact of political and economic affairs outside, and those who accept responsibility for mastering and controlling Parliamentary institutions in the interests of the people should stand up to these responsibilities and make the Parliament a Parliament, or clear out and give the people a chance of seeing whether they cannot send somebody else in to use the Parliamentary machinery that so many generations of our people have struggled to get and to build up so that it may serve the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel in a way that I owe a certain apology to the Government, because I used to think that greater inefficiency could not be displayed by any persons than was displayed by the Government in this emergency, and especially by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies.  But I have found that I am a little wrong in that, because I have discovered another place in which greater inefficiency can be found.  I had the pleasure of spending 19 hours in a train yesterday and of arriving in Dublin at 4 o'clock in the morning 12 hours late, and I have come to the conclusion that, under its dictatorship, the Great Southern Railways Company has fallen a great deal away from the efficiency which it had under its representative government, and that it has shown an amount of inefficiency in the management of this detail that even the Government have not shown in the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the result of that was that I was unable to be here to listen to yesterday's debate and, especially, I was <Col N="2087" /> unable to listen to a very remarkable speech which I read this morning at very considerable length which was made by Deputy Dillon last night.  I also read the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day, and reading that leading article I came to a very definite and very specific conclusion.  Granted that it be true, as Deputy Dillon stated, that the <i>Irish Times</i> has absorbed some of the views of the <i>Irish Press,</i> it is not impossible that the <i>Irish Times</i>, too, might take up some of the mannerisms of the <i>Irish Press</i>, because evil communications do corrupt good manners.  But, at the same time, I consider that the habits acquired during many years cannot easily be departed from, and when I consider how that extremely suave and urbane writer who edits the <i>Irish Times</i>, or, if I might drop into what the late Kevin O'Higgins once described as the compulsory Latin of the <i>Irish Times</i>, and consider how that man <i>ad unguem factus homo</i> suddenly indulges in personal abuse, and when I think of the French proverb, &ldquo;<i>Ce n'est que la verité qui blesse</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is only the truth that wounds&rdquo;&mdash; I must come to the conclusion, though I had not the pleasure, as I say, of listening to that speech, that round No. 1 has ended in a very great triumph for Deputy Dillon, and that it is only Deputy Dillon's inability for the moment to reply to the <i>Irish Times</i> that has prevented a knock-out in that first round; in other words, that the bell has saved the <i>Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>But, if I lost the advantage of listening to Deputy Dillon last night, I did gain the advantage of listening to a very remarkable speech made by Deputy Childers this afternoon upon which I should like to make just a few comments.  I am always interested in listening to Deputy Childers.  Deputy Childers always thinks; he does not always think rightly, but it is something at any rate to find a person in the Fianna Fáil Party who does not blindly re-echo what is said from the Front Bench, but has the courage to think for himself.  Deputy Childers talked about trying to find a man of genius.  I think Deputy Childers, <Col N="2088" /> talking about agriculture and in the same breath crying for a man of genius, had something very much in the back of his mind.  I think, if he could have put the matter into plain and simple English, Deputy Childers would have said: &ldquo;For God's sake let us get rid of Dr. Ryan, and for God's sake let us get genius in his place, because we want it, and want it wretchedly badly.&rdquo;  For that reason, I was tremendously interested in Deputy Childers' speech.  It showed that, when Fianna Fáil Deputies do venture to think, they can see the faults and the follies and the failings of their own Ministers just as well as we on this side of the House can see them.  But they lack one thing; they lack the courage&mdash;they lack more; they lack the patriotism&mdash; which would make them speak out their minds.  Even Deputy Childers has not quite reached that stage.  He talks rather by innuendo now, but he is coming on; he is learning; he is gathering courage; he will speak out more freely, I hope, in times to come.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which he did say. He expressed his hope about co-operative farming, and about the Irish farmers handing up their land and joining in a co-operative society, each man giving up his own individual ownership.  When Deputy Childers talked like that, I said to myself: &ldquo;What an awful pity it is that people will confine themselves to books and will never think of realities.&rdquo;  Anybody who knows the Irish farmer, anybody who knows how deep down in the Irish farmer's heart lies the love of the land which is his, and how proud he is of his ownership, will realise that to talk of even the possibility of that man surrendering his land to a co-operative society is to display a complete ignorance not merely of the Irish character but, I think, of human nature itself.  I do think that Deputy Childers, coming on as he is, would come on a great deal faster if he would bear in mind that there is a certain amount of truth in Pope's adage: &ldquo;The proper study of mankind is man.&rdquo;  If Deputy Childers regarded a little less the theory and a little more the human element on <Col N="2089" /> which he must work, then I think Deputy Childers' education would proceed even faster than it is proceeding at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Budget itself, I do not think that anybody could reasonably say that it is anything else except a Budget of despair.  This Budget, if it is to be justified at all, is a Budget which must be based on the assumption that at the present moment this country is taxed up to saturation point. In no other way can this Budget be justified.  If there was a reasonable possibility of raising more money fairly by taxation, this is the very time at which extra taxation ought to be imposed if we are to look to the future. It is one of the accepted views, I think, of every political economist that the true explanation of how countries ravaged by war recover so quickly is that goods are being rapidly consumed and rapidly reproduced.  The whole process of the world in peace time or in war time consists of the consumption of the entire wealth of the world&mdash;I am speaking of wealth now in the true sense of the word&mdash;and its reproduction in a very short period.  For that reason the wealth of a country, consumed in war, can be very easily reproduced in a few years.</P>
    <P>Having gone through some years of suffering, a country at the end of a comparatively short period is just as rich again as if that suffering had never happened.  That is the view, I think, which is taken by every political economist&mdash;certainly every political economist of standing whose works I have read.  It is taken by more than political economists; writers on political science&mdash;certainly Sir Henry Mayne&mdash;have borrowed it also.  Applying that to the present situation, it shows that some of those extra charges which could be fairly borne out of taxation, ought to be borne out of taxation, because if money is borrowed for them, it is making far more difficult the task of reproducing after the war a condition like our pre-war condition. If you pay as you go along, you suffer, but you have a chance of recovering. If you do not pay as you go along, or do not pay as much as <Col N="2090" /> you could, you are making your task of recovery after the war far and away more difficult, and it is a staggering thought.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago this was a country without 1d. of national debt.  What is it now, at the end of 20 years?  It is a country which, I believe, when this financial year is over, will owe something like £100,000,000.  Is that not correct?  That is a staggering thought. I am granting that some of that money has not gone into mere air.  Some of it has been very well and very wisely invested.  It has not all been spent.  I remember the tremendous attacks which were made upon Deputy McGilligan when he was carrying the Shannon scheme through; he was told how he was wasting the money of the country, how he was wasting the farmers' money especially.  That has turned out to be a very wise and a paying investment of public money, as well as a scheme that has done more service to the State than any other scheme which has been started since we obtained our national freedom.</P>
    <P>Very little, comparatively, of that immense sum which we owe has been invested.  The bulk of it has been spent.  The £5,000,000 which the Minister will have to borrow before this financial year is over does not represent borrowing for investment.  It is borrowing for expenditure.  How long can the country keep up a process of that nature?  How long can a country that in 20 years has borrowed practically £100,000,000 keep up that rate of retrogression?  It is a thought that should occur to every person in this country.  We must look to the future. We have seen Minister for Finance after Minister for Finance informing the House that he feels justified in borrowing for certain purposes because it was not recurrent expenditure.  If I am permitted to use a bull, I would say that the most recurrent item in the Budget is non-recurring expenditure. Every year there is something fresh.  &ldquo;This is not recurrent expenditure and we will borrow for it&rdquo;&mdash; that is what we hear.  But if you borrow for non-recurring expenditure this year and non-recurring expenditure <Col N="2091" /> next year and so on, you will have that non-recurring item the whole time.</P>
    <P>It is the greatest fallacy to say that you are entitled to borrow for non-recurring expenditure when non-recurring expenditure has become the normal thing.  You should budget for every year.  Every year will bring its own particular items and these should be met in that year.  There is no justification whatever for borrowing. During the last ten years, nearly all of them peace years, there have been abundant harvests.  If the finances and the general policy of this country have been so mismanaged that extra taxation cannot now in fairness be put upon the people, because it is a time of emergency, and therefore borrowing must be resorted to then I say that the Minister's Budget is the most terrible criticism that could be passed upon any Government.  It is the most deadly and damning criticism of Fianna Fáil administration for the last ten years that could possibly be made.</P>
    <P>I know it is said that this is a popular Budget.  Of course, it is a very popular thing not to increase taxation and I know that at certain periods, especially when elections are not very far off, it is a very good thing to provide what the people like.  But what the people like and what is the right thing to do in times of emergency are very often entirely different things.  It was pointed out by a well known writer on representative government that one of the great difficulties about such government is that representatives are elected by the people to do what the people think is best for them, but that the people in bulk do not always know what is best.  As a matter of fact, some writers think that the people very often do not know what is the best thing for them, and very often in representative government it is necessary for the individuals whom the people have elected to be their Government to do the thing which temporarily, in the eyes of the people, is unpopular but which ultimately will make for the prosperity of the nation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might put it in this way. <Col N="2092" /> The Minister for Finance, in dealing with the people, is very much in the position of a father dealing with his son.  In one sphere of life a son may go to his father and ask him for a shilling to enable him to go to a cinema, and the father, looking at the state of the family finances, says he cannot give it.  In another sphere of life a son may go to his father and ask for a motor car, and the father, considering the state of the family finances, tells him he cannot give him one.  In the first case, the boy anxious to go to the cinema would be very pleased with his father if he gave him the shilling.  The second boy, possibly a university graduate, would be very pleased with his father if he got the motor car.  The fathers, considering their family finances, found that they could not do what would please their sons.</P>
    <P>Very often in popular government the Minister for Finance must put himself much in the position, with reference to the people, of the father with the son.  Taxation is always unpopular. Not increasing the amount of taxation and adopting the idea of borrowing is always popular and it will always be liked.  The son in the instance I have given would like his father very much better if he gave him the motor car, but the father would be very wrong to give it if it was going to lead to bankruptcy or create trouble in the family finances.  The same thing would apply to the Minister for Finance in relation to the people.  He must not do everything that the people might like.  The people consider that it is his duty to look after their finances, just as the son thinks it is his father's duty to look after his finances.  If the Minister refuses to look after the national finances, then that Minister is not doing what is right.</P>
    <P>When you discover that a Budget is framed on the basis that it will just please the people, and when it is framed on no other ground, you may think that policy very facile, very easy, the easiest thing in the world so long as the credit lasts.  It is the easiest thing in the world to borrow.  There are two things that are very easy&mdash;<Col N="2093" /> increasing income-tax and borrowing. They do not require one moment's thought.  Certainly, as far as borrowing is concerned, it is considered very dangerous, by anybody who is looking to the future.  Therefore, if taxation could be imposed honestly and without danger to the future, it would be the duty of the Government and of the Minister to impose it.  He has not done so.  I accept that the Minister is endeavouring to do his duty and, therefore, by this Budget he has brought in the most damning accusation against himself and his predecessor in office.</P>
    <P>Turning from the general proposition to one particular detail&mdash;the tax I mentioned a moment ago, income-tax, and its incidence upon agricultural land, there is a matter which I never have been able to understand and which I would ask the Minister in his reply to deal with very specifically. If a farmer has land and farms it, and sends in his profit and loss account at the end of the year showing that, on the land&mdash;say, with a poor law valuation of £100&mdash;he has made £100 profit in the year, that is his income and he pays income-tax on it.  One would think the tax ought to stop there, but it does not; the Revenue Commissioners come along and say: &ldquo;Ah, yes, you paid on all the income you made, but remember Schedule A&mdash;you have to pay for the ownership of land.&rdquo;  In the instance I have given, he has to pay on his profit of £100 and also for the ownership of the land.  It is quite true that, if he loses in his farming, he can reduce the assessment under Schedule A., but if he makes a profit he has to pay under both, thus paying double. I cannot understand why one must pay under Schedule B on the actual profit out of land and then pay under Schedule A as well, and I would like the Minister to explain that.</P>
    <P>Income-tax is a very heavy burden on the farming community, especially now, when farmers want all the capital they have; and if they are paying income-tax on more than they are really making out of the land, it is <Col N="2094" /> very far from just.  Of course, income-tax is no indication at all of the wealth of the country.  The same income occasionally pays tax many times over.  A farmer may sell a cow at £20, and that £20 may pay tax to the State many more times than one.  He pays 7/6 in the £ on it now, leaving him about £13 10s.; if he pays £13 10s. to a doctor who has been attending him, the doctor must pay 7/6 in the £ on it; then the doctor may buy from a shop and pay for goods, and income-tax must be paid on that, and so on. The real wealth of the country pays income-tax on some occasions many times over, so it is not a real guide to the income of the country, and must always be larger than the actual amount of wealth in the amount assessed, as the same item is recurring in the income-tax of different persons. Regarding the farmer's income-tax case I have mentioned, I would very much like the Minister to explain it to me, and if there is no explanation I would press upon him that, in simple justice, when a farmer has been assessed on his farming profits, Schedule A should be wiped out altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Supplies delivered a speech on this motion last week which was more remarkable for its abuse and vulgarities than for any sound contribution to the problems with which that Minister should be more vitally concerned than any other Minister.  Of course, misrepresentation is the stock and trade of the Minister for Supplies.  If there is any possibility of anybody being misrepresented, nobody is more capable of getting over the misrepresentation than the Minister for Supplies.  If anybody's statement is to be distorted, the Minister for Supplies is the expert for the job, and in the creation of Aunt Sallys there is no one able to manufacture them with such lightning rapidity as the Minister for Supplies. But that is about the only thing the Minister can produce in these days, and they are very intangible assets, so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that, in my earlier speech on the Budget, I stated <Col N="2095" /> taxation had reached the limit and that borrowing was unsound.  I did not say that taxation had reached the limit, nor did I say that borrowing was unsound.  What I did say was that this Budget was imposing very heavy taxation on the people.  I made no reference whatever to the unsoundness of borrowing money.  What I did say was that, at a time when taxation was extremely heavy, we had to consider the ability of people to pay taxes, when national productivity was rapidly decreasing, and that taxation at all times must be related to production. If we have reached a stage when productivity has declined, obviously that is not the time at which to burden the people with heavy taxation.  Taxation is only a relative thing.  A Budget of £43,000,000 might mean very little if it were imposed on a people whose national productivity was at a high level, but when imposed at a time when national productivity is at a low level, it can impose on the people a burden which, if productivity were greater, they would be better equipped to bear.  The Minister was compelled to admit that the national income was stagnant, that, in fact, there was no increase in the national income.</P>
    <P>I very much suspect that figures would show, in terms of real goods, that the national income had substantially decreased during the past two years.  We may be told that it has increased by inflating prices but, in terms of real goods and productivity, it will be found that the national income has seriously declined.  That is the situation at a time when we are imposing on the people a burden of £43,000,000 by way of taxation.  The total taken in taxation is increased, while there is declining productivity, so that what is left for family needs is considerably diminished.  What we are doing in this Budget is this: we are taking from the people taxation to the extent of £43,000,000 at a time when they were never so badly equipped to meet an imposition of that kind.  That is the characteristic of this Budget. There has been no increase in national <Col N="2096" /> income, but there is a very heavy inroad made on their income by asking them to pay heavy taxation when the national income is dangerously low.</P>
    <P>While we have the position in which the national income is stagnant, we get at the same time a most extraordinary statement from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, to the effect that there is such an abundance of credit available that it makes the control of interest rates of a central bank almost impossible to regulate. We were told on the Central Bank Bill that there was an abundance of money for worth-while schemes, but when you come to policy, where is the abundance of money so far as the ordinary income of the people is concerned? When you come to ascertain where the abundance of credit is, so far as the ordinary people are concerned, you find that far from there being an abundance of credit to finance essential schemes, and so far from there being available to the people liquid assets in the form of cash or credit to purchase the necessaries of life, the struggle for life to-day is harder and sterner than ever during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>This Budget takes from the people £43,000,000 for State purposes alone. The demand of local authorities for rates reaches a total of another £7,000,000, so that, as far as the people are concerned, approximately £50,000,000 is taken in the way of State revenue and local authorities' revenue during the coming year.  That represents, roughly, one-third of our national income.  That seems to me to be a position which is highly unsound and uneconomic, a position that should cause grave concern to those concerned with the raising of taxation, and grave concern to those who should be interested in increasing productivity and national wealth.  I am inclined to doubt very much whether this Budget is based on sound estimates.  For instance, we were told that customs duties will realise £10,250,000 in the Budget.  If we assume that <i>ad valorem</i> duties would be an average of 25 per cent., then, in order to raise £10,250,000 in the form of customs duties, it will be necessary to import <Col N="2097" /> £45,000,000 worth of customed goods, bearing an average <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 25 per cent.  I think he would be a very cheerful man who imagines that during this financial year we are likely to be able to import, with present indications, anything like £45,000,000 worth of goods bearing in the average 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duties.</P>
    <P>There is one disgraceful aspect of this Budget that reflects our economic laziness, and that is that in the Estimates which are financed by the Budget, we are making provision for the expenditure of approximately £8,000,000 on poverty which is due solely to our incompetent and wasteful economic policy.  If the election promises of the Government to find work for all had been accomplished, vast sums of money need not be at present spent on home assistance, on unemployment assistance, and on similar types of pittances which are doled out by the State, as an excuse for its incompetence in the economic field.  If the Government had only attempted to plan to develop our economic resources, planned to the fullest our agricultural possibilities, and generally had accepted as a basic principle in the economic field, the urgent necessity to utilise every unemployed man and woman we might to-day not be obliged to make provision for an expenditure of £8,000,000 on what is mainly avoidable poverty.  That money might be made available for much better services, and in giving our people a different mode of life to that which they are compelled to tolerate to-day, because we are too lazy to plan in the economic field, too indolent to plan in the agricultural field.  Apparently we prefer to give the people miserable pittances to keep them alive while allowing our economic, industrial and agricultural development to drift along as if it was nobody's business to arrest such a policy.  In this State to-day we have 100,000 men idle who, if put to work in expanding the national wealth, and consequently the national income, could create a huge pile of wealth for all the people.  As far as the State is concerned such reserves would be available for revenue-raising purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2098" /> But we adopt an economic policy which apparently blinds us to the existence of that criminal waste. There can be no more criminal waste in the economic field than to see 100,000 men and women idle, willing to work and willing to create national assets, and yet not organised so that they might contribute to national productivity their quota of what good citizenship demands.  Apparently this Budget indicates to all and sundry that we must continue to make provision for poverty on the present miserable scale, because we simply refuse to face up to the need for economic planning. Instead of planning we prefer to indulge in a riot of muddling, and one would imagine that our responsibility to these workless citizens was then discharged. If you take a look at the economic picture the whole position is truly disturbing.  There are 100,000 registered unemployed after 40,000 have emigrated to Britain and the Six Counties, and after another 30,000 have joined the Army.  Even then that sea of poverty does not adequately portray the economic position, because we have also 100,000 persons in receipt of home assistance, and a substantial number drawing national health insurance benefit for diseases definitely attributable to malnutrition.  Any State that starts with an employment problem of these dimensions, and a small State such as ours with less than 3,000,000 of people is under-populated and under-developed, surely must view with horror a continuance of an economic state of affairs which is represented by that ocean of poverty.</P>
    <P>That is not the only danger or the only evidence of the weakness of our whole economic position.  We have to consider the low wages which obtain for very large sections of our people. We have to relate that to the low incomes upon which many of our people, who are not wage earners, are compelled to exist.  Although we have land which is the envy of many other countries in Europe, we can only pay our agricultural workers, for the production of a vital commodity for the people, 33/- a week.  A man is expected to be able to keep himself, his wife and four or six children on a wage of 33/- in 1942.  Has anybody ever attempted <Col N="2099" /> to work out the standard of living which is that man's lot?  It only needs to be attempted to realise the appallingly low standard of living we are forcing on a very large section of our people by the payment of a wage of 33/- a week to agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>We pass on from agriculture to turf production, which is a new and widespread activity in the State.  We find that the most we are able to pay our turf workers is 32/- and 33/- a week. One might ask what standard of living is possible on the part of those engaged in the production of fuel supplies on a wage as low as 32/- and 33/- a week.  If we pass from our internal economic position and take a look at our external activities, we find that we are developing, with the utmost complacency and with a smoothness that would be charming if it were not so tragic, a one-way foreign trade.  We are not satisfied with giving away our man-power for nothing.  We must give away a substantial portion of our produce to another country in exchange for bills of credit which, after this war, may not be cashable&mdash;which may be worthless from the point of view of producing goods.  We are giving these goods to a nation which may not sell us goods for those assets which she is now chalking up to our credit.  The Government seem to be quite unconcerned with that development and with the fact that we are giving away our food for vouchers which may be of doubtful value.  That food our own people ought to be encouraged to consume, and they should be put in an economic position to consume.  Apparently, it is nothing to the Government that good beef and agricultural produce&mdash;goods that our own people need &mdash;are being exported in exchange for credits which may be of very doubtful value when this war is over.</P>
    <P>If we look at the rural areas, we find a most unhealthy symptom developing.  There are fewer people in the rural areas than there were at any time during the past 40 years. There are fewer marriages there and our population is declining.  The economic position of our people is <Col N="2100" /> such that marriage is regarded as a thing which cannot be contracted in the present economic conditions in many of those areas.  What is happening in many of those areas is that the young and virile men are leaving the country.  Where they are not drifting into the city, they are going off as emigrants and a very disturbing picture would be portrayed by an examination of the number of young people and the number of elderly people in the country.  That examination would, I think, show that, in respect of old people <i>vis-a-vis</i> young persons, we have a most unhealthy position which is not equalled by any other country.</P>
    <P>Advertence to these factors&mdash;I think they are incontrovertible and rightly cause concern to everybody interested in the welfare of the country&mdash;reveals at once a very bleak and disturbing picture.  The worst aspect of the picture is that nothing whatever is being done to grapple with the problems which have brought about the condition of affairs which I have described. It does not seem to me that we can continue for many more years providing a sum of £43,000,000 for Government services&mdash;for the services of a Government who have refused to put idle men to work and who prefer a policy of economic drift and trying to keep people on miserable pittances under various types of social services, so called.  During the past 12 months, the Government have been endeavouring to whistle to the tune of &ldquo;equality of sacrifice&rdquo;, that rich and poor must suffer and that there has got to be a sharing of the burdens. So far as the workers are concerned, Emergency Order No. 83, which has been enforced by the Government with wicked efficiency, has compelled workers to make a very substantial contribution&mdash;one which they ought not be expected to make&mdash;to whatever economic difficulties may be encountered. I am not so satisfied, nor are the workers satisfied, that the wealthy classes are bearing anything like the sacrifices they ought to be compelled to bear in a situation such as that through which we are passing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies was quite <Col N="2101" /> enthusiastic regarding the £2,500,000 in excess corporation profits tax which are to be raised by the Budget.  That only refers to excess corporation profits, or war profits, and not to normal profits.  Apparently, industrial undertakings, and undertakings generally, will be permitted to make excess profits out of the people's necessities so long as they are prepared to share their excess profits with the Government. The Government is raking off £2,500,000 from industrialists under this Budget.  It would be interesting to learn what sum in excess profits&mdash;in other words, war profits&mdash;the industrialists are themselves pocketing.  I venture to say they will profit another sum of £2,500,000, because I think the level of taxation will probably show there is only a 50 per cent. rake-off on the average.  The industrialists are to be allowed to get away with millions in the form of war profits, and the Government appear to be quite content with that development so long as they get £2,500,000 for themselves.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Supplies endeavoured to show that industrialists were being made pay. This Budget has been welcomed by industrialists, generally, because, in it, the Minister has shown quite a tender regard for people who, at least, are in a substantially better position to bear burdens than those upon whom they have been imposed in heavier degree&mdash; the workers.</P>
    <P>A prominent business man who is associated with many industrial activities in this country recently stated that the minimum rate of profit to attract capital to industry was generally accepted to be 15 per cent.  In the Budget of last year the Minister imposed a 6 per cent. standard profit. That brought a howl from all the industrialists, the bankers, the financiers. The Minister was compelled, apparently, to listen to deputations from these people, and it was not long before we realised that these people were apparently going to get away with a substantial modification of the taxation which was imposed upon them in last year's Budget.  Under this Budget they are going to get a present of £150,000.  Not only are they going to get £150,000 back, but they are now <Col N="2102" /> going to have substituted a standard of 9 per cent. profit, not merely on the ordinary capital of the companies but on the whole resources employed in the development and in the conduct of these companies and corporations.  Up to the present, the 6 per cent. was allowed on ordinary capital.  Now, these firms are to be allowed to make a profit of 9 per cent. on all the capital employed in the industry, which means that they can make a profit of 9 per cent. on their ordinary shares, on their preference shares and on their debentures.  This, I think, is the first time that debentures have ever been regarded as stock or capital for the purpose of ascertaining the capitalisation of any particular company, but it is interesting to examine what will be the likely effect of a revision of the standard profit from 6 per cent. to 9 per cent. and treating the preference and debenture stock as ordinary stock for the purpose of profits.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble to look up one particular case.  It is not an isolated case; it represents many firms in industry to-day.  This particular firm has a capital of £200,000 6½ per cent. cumulative preference stock; it has £400,000 ordinary stock, making its total capital, therefore, £600,000.  It also has £450,000 in 5½ per cent. debentures, making its total employed resources in this particular industry £1,050,000. This firm, under this Budget, is entitled to calculate the 9 per cent. exemption on the whole £1,050,000.  In other words, it is entitled to get away with, as an exemption standard, £94,500 as profits, but they pay only 6½ per cent. on the preference shares, that is, £13,000; and 5½ per cent. on the debentures, which amounts to £24,750.  If we deduct these two sums, which total £37,750, from the £94,500, the balance is £56,750, and this balance is the sum left with the company for payment of profits on its ordinary capital.  That balance of £56,750 may be paid on the ordinary capital of the company, which has an ordinary stock of £400,000.  The position is that that company can get away not with the 9 per cent. exemption limit, but with 15 per cent. exemption limit because, apparently, under this Budget, it is being allowed to make a <Col N="2103" /> profit of 9 per cent. on preference shares and on debentures when, in fact, its own Articles of Association require it to pay substantially less than 9 per cent. to the owners and holders of those shares.  The profits thus made, by giving them a 9 per cent. exemption limit in respect of debenture shares and in respect of preference shares, will enable them to distribute that profit, it seems to me, on their ordinary stocks.</P>
    <P>Under the Finance Act, that firm was allowed to make only a profit of £61,750.  When the Budget is given effect to by means of the Finance Bill, that firm will be entitled to make a profit of £94,500.  So that, so far as this Budget is concerned in respect of that particular firm, it represents a present to the firm of £32,750.  Can the Minister tell us what condition of affairs in respect of industrial development in this country permits him, in these circumstances, to hand back to that firm a nest egg of £32,000 and permits that firm, by utilising its preference stock and its debentures as capital employed in the development of the company, to net a profit of approximately 15 per cent. on its ordinary capital, and that at a time when the ordinary workers throughout the country are not able to get a decent wage, and when very large sections of the workers are compelled to tolerate a condition of affairs in which no increase on the 1941 wage levels is permitted.</P>
    <P>The Government talk about equality of sacrifice, but it is extremely difficult to say where the equality of sacrifice is as between workers and industrialists, taking the case which I have quoted as an example, and it is by no means an isolated case.</P>

      <P>I can imagine this firm cheering the Minister on that basis.  I want to pass from that remarkable generosity on the part of the Minister to deal with some of the statements made by the Minister for Supplies in the course of his speech last week. The Minister treated the House to a display of kindergarten economics on the last day.  He was obviously more concerned with displaying his temper than he was with displaying his knowledge. He told us that price control did not mean stopping prices from rising.  Everybody knows that the Minister never believed that such a thing was possible because, of course, he has permitted prices to be increased with the most complete impunity.  He does not appear to have any power of control, or any willingness to exercise any type of rigid control, over the rise of prices during the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that, because of the increase in the price of raw materials and certain other types of costs, the position now was that the price of certain types of goods had to be increased.  One could understand that.  One can understand a position in which certain commodities will increase in price because of an increase <Col N="2106" /> in the price of the ingredients, but what one cannot understand is the Minister pretending to keep prices at a certain level and failing to do that while being remarkably efficient in keeping wages at a low level.  Must it not be obvious to everybody that if prices have risen as between 1939 and 1942, as they have risen by about 37 per cent., even taking the general average&mdash;and it is a low average&mdash;revealed by the cost-of-living index figure, working people cannot buy the same quantity of goods when their wages are pegged down to the 1939 level?  The Minister admitted the other day that prices had risen to a war-time level, and when I asked him to explain how workers were expected to buy commodities at a war-time level on pre-war rates of wages, the Minister undertook to explain that at a later stage, but although he spoke for an hour and a half he never once did attempt to explain it.</P>
    <P>My criticism of the Government in respect to its economic policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> wage earners is that it has permitted prices to rise by 37 per cent. in the last two years, and that notwithstanding the fact that large sections of workers have secured no increase whatever on the pre-war level of wages, and that the Government will not, in fact, permit them to get any increase over the pre-war rates, the Government still expects these people to be able to purchase commodities which are now beyond their purchasing power.  It requires only a moment's reflection to realise that an ordinary wage earner with £3 a week&mdash;and, taking the average, that is a high figure&mdash;cannot buy the same quantity of goods as he bought in 1939.  What is he to do?  He has got to do without goods which were considered necessaries in 1939.  He might, if given an increase in wages, be able to buy the same quantity of goods which he bought then, assuming the goods were available.  But if you peg down his wages to the pre-war level, as has been done by Emergency Powers Order No. 83, then in effect you say to that worker: &ldquo;Buy very much less, eat very much less and wear very much less than you did in 1939, no matter how inadequate your standard of living in 1939 was.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> When the Minister made his speech on the Supplementary Budget in November, 1940, we had a declaration that prices were going to be controlled and wages pegged down to a certain level.  Nobody was going to get any compensation for the increase in prices as a result of the war.  We see now that industrialists are getting away with it.  They may not be able to distribute their profits but they will be able to make profits and to store up profits in the hope that some other twist of the wheel may come, that some other ill-wind that does somebody good will blow, which will enable them to distribute the profits later, if indeed, commercial machinations being what they are, they have to wait for that ill-wind.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Supplementary Budget as I say indicated that the Government would endeavour to keep prices and wages at a certain level, to maintain the then existing relative stability of wages to prices and prices to wages.  The Government must realise by now that it has failed hopelessly to do that, that the price of commodities has risen and risen with Governmental approbation. The Government is perfectly satisfied to allow prices to rise.  While permitting prices to rise, the Government has shown no inclination whatever to appreciate the difficulties which workers experience in trying to purchase goods at the present war-time level.  They have shown no inclination to appreciate the difficulties of workers on a low standard of living being compelled to deny themselves commodities which enabled them to enjoy perhaps a tolerable standard of living in pre-war days.  I think the Government's whole policy in respect of that vicious spiral, as it is described, is based on an economic fallacy.  It was not an increase in wages that drove prices up, and if you permit a rise in prices while you compel wages to remain static, then inevitably you force down the standard of living of workers generally. That has been the result of the Government's policy here.  Their whole economic policy has been: &ldquo;Let prices <Col N="2108" /> rise: let the ceiling for prices be as high as possible but keep wages low&rdquo;.  The consequence of that policy is that the workers have less money to spend which means that there is less demand for goods and a lesser demand for goods means a lesser production of goods and consequent unemployment. That is just one of the evils which have flown directly from the operation of Emergency Powers Order No. 83.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies was quite indignant the other day about the black market.  He called a whole variety of people criminals because they were compelled to buy in the black market, but the black market exists, in a very large measure, because of the Government's failure adequately to control the whole supply position, and because of the disorganisation which has arisen out of the muddling of the Department of Supplies. I quoted a case the other day&mdash; I sent the letter to the Minister&mdash;of a man in my constituency who went to work in a certain place and could not get any trader to take his tea ration card.  That was that man's position for four months.  He still could not get a trader to take his card, nor could he get the Department of Supplies to tell him where he could find a trader to take it.  The result was, as he said in his letter and as he authenticated, that he was compelled to buy tea in the black market at 18/- a pound.  The Minister, however, woke up recently to the fact that there is such a thing as a black market in existence and that the public will not stand too long for the operations of the racketeers in the black market.  The Minister is just beginning to bestir himself about that matter, and he makes threats as to what he will do with the manipulators of the black market, but, of course, nobody minds the frothy utterances of the Minister as to what he will do with the black market racketeers.  They can always be perfectly satisfied that the Department of Supplies will move with the greatest possible ease and caution in respect of those who exploit the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have a case here where a Deputy of this House complained to the Minister <Col N="2109" /> for Supplies that a sum of 1/2 was charged for a 2-lb. packet of oatmeal. He reported the matter to the Department on the 16th February, and it took them until 1st May to come to a decision on it.  The Department then informed the Deputy that they considered 11½d. to be a reasonable price and that the firm concerned had reduced their price to that level.  Then, with a great, generous gesture, the Department said to the Deputy: &ldquo;I am to say that Messrs. Blank are prepared to refund the over-charge of 2½d. to the purchaser, and in order that application may be made to them, the receipts accompanying your letter are returned herewith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After three months of investigating a case of over-charging, the Department find that a firm is guilty of over-charging by 2½d. on a 2-lb. packet of oatmeal and, instead of taking some punitive action against the firm, no less a person than the Controller of Prices is put down to write this kind of silly letter to a Deputy and tell the Deputy that nothing at all is going to happen to the firm, but &ldquo;Here are your receipts; go back to the firm and get the 2½d. that you were over-charged.&rdquo; Does anybody believe that that kind of nonsense is the proper way to control prices, or does anybody believe that you can ever get effective price control by methods of that kind?  If that firm was in the dock and its ramifications exposed, and if it were made clear that there was over-charging, you might then get a very much healthier public opinion with regard to price levels in this country, and you might get very much more co-operation from the public in respect of prices.  But when a person goes to the trouble of reporting a glaring case of an over-charge, such as in this particular case. and is merely told, after three months' investigation by the Controller of Prices: &ldquo;Take back the bills to the firm and you will get back the 2½d. you were over-charged,&rdquo; there is certainly no inducement to the public to cooperate. There is a premium on over-charging so long as matters are dealt with in that lazy kind of fashion; there is no encouragement to anybody.  As a matter of fact, the person concerned is out of pocket on a transaction of <Col N="2110" /> this kind, because what really happens is that the person makes the complaint to a Deputy, and that costs him 2½d. for the purchase of a postage stamp, as the person who wrote to the Deputy did in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  He wrote to the Deputy, and the Deputy wrote to the Department.  Then the Department wrote to the Deputy and the Deputy sent it back to the complainant.  Of course, there is no inducement there to make complaints, and I am sure that that person will not waste time or money in doing that again.  If, however, that person were able to see, with some satisfaction, that he had rendered a public service by bringing about the prosecution of that firm, I think he would be encouraged to cooperate more effectively with the Department in exposing the exploitation of consumers in that way.  The Minister has every reason to feel concerned about the black markets, and notwithstanding the Minister's declarations about the black markets and his threats to deal with black market racketeers, I venture to say that the Minister will continue to find himself confronted with the black markets unless he is prepared to take drastic action against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, even then, they may still exist, but you will get a much greater public co-operation and much greater public support if you will put those who are manipulating the black markets into jail, and, for once, I find myself in sympathy and agreement with Deputy Dillon in saying that they should be left there for a substantial period, and until such time as they learned that this nation will not tolerate the exploitation of its poor people in a time of crisis such as this.  We are asking young fellows to join the Army.  We are asking them to become soldiers at 14/- a week.  We are asking them to leave their homes, perhaps to leave aged parents behind them and <Col N="2111" /> to serve in the Army for 14/- a week. We are asking these young men to put up with all the rigours of Army life and to accept that low standard of remuneration for assisting the nation in this time of crisis, while at the same time we are letting another bunch of people operate in the black markets and make profits that were formerly undreamt of.  Unless the Minister can come to this House and take wide powers of inspection and wide powers of arrest, and unless he can make provision for summary jurisdiction in respect of those people who are operating in the black markets, then I venture to say that the black markets will go on, and the Minister had better realise that, unless he is prepared to take powers of that kind, he is likely to have a continuance of the black markets with all the undermining of public confidence that goes hand in hand with the operations of a market of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in the names of Deputy Mulcahy and myself:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that Emergency Powers (Mechanically-propelled <Col N="2112" /> Vehicles) Order, 1942, made by the Minister for Supplies on the 24th April, 1942, should be revoked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to say, at the start, that I rather regret the position in which a Deputy is put by reason of the fact that he has no possible way, through the medium of Parliament, of making representations with regard to alterations in an Order, or making suggestions with regard to the carrying out of an Order, in a more reasonable manner than that of putting down a motion that the whole Order be revoked. That is the outstanding drawback of the present tendency to do things by taking the easiest road, namely, through the medium of regulations rather than of legislation.  Powers were given to the Government, in the first 24 hours of the world war, to do business through the medium of emergency regulations.</P>
    <P>The Parliament at that time felt itself faced with the danger of immediately terrible war and gave those powers to the Government to be used with reason for and in a grave emergency. They have since been used or, rather, freely abused so as to replace practically <i>in toto</i> the kind of business that should be done through the medium of legislation that would give the representatives of the people an opportunity of making suggestions, Parliament an opportunity to point out to Ministers where the legislation appeared to be unduly harsh and Ministers the opportunity of considering those suggestions.  Here, however, we find ourselves in the position that an Emergency Order comes out from goodness knows where and devised by whom I do not know.  The only way one can get consideration given to any of the ramifications of that Order is by putting down a motion to revoke the whole Order.  That is unwise and discourteous.</P>
    <P>We are left to presume, through reading the newspapers, that the reason for the Order is shortage of petrol.  I do not know whether that is the case for the Order or not.  In fact, I do not know what the case for the Order is, but semi-official pronouncements <Col N="2113" /> appearing in the newspapers indicate that the justification and reason for it is that there is very little petrol in the country and very little coming in.  Any information that I can get indicates that more petrol came in during the first three months of this year than in the first three months of last year, that whatever arrangements existed last year between the petrol companies of this country and the British Petroleum Board were re-enacted for this year, and that the risks of petrol supplies being interrupted were equally as grave last year as this year.  On the assumption that that information was correct, I consider that the general public here got very little consideration, and that at least an opportunity should have been given to the representatives of the people to make representations on their behalf before they were branded as criminals for using a vehicle on the road for which they had a licence from another Government Department.  It may be that some other case will be made to justify this Order than a shortage of petrol.  The country and the owners of cars will be interested to hear that case, and the sooner it is made the better.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that the reason for this Order is shortage of petrol, then I could not visualise an Order being carried out in a more asinine manner than this particular Order has been.  Assuming that the Order is framed in order to economise petrol, and because there is a serious danger of a petrol shortage, then every encouragement should be given to every user of the road to economise petrol.  Road users should be applauded for making use of any and every device that would make petrol go further, and help thereby to economise the supply.  If there was anyone in this country who could design and patent a gadget to attach to the carburetter of his car so that the petrol in it would do 100 miles to the gallon instead of 30 miles, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Supplies and every other member of the Government would applaud him as an individual who had done his bit towards bringing this country through a great emergency by extending the scope of <Col N="2114" /> the available petrol supply.  Now, without providing any extraordinary gadget the man authorised to use a motor car, a member of the essential services, who is prepared to put up with the hardship of using a light motor bicycle instead of a luxurious car is making every gallon of petrol do 100 miles instead of 30, but any member of the essential services attempting to do that since this Order came out is regarded as a criminal. He will not be allowed to economise petrol even by inflicting hardship on himself.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to the Minister and to his advisers before the Order came out that provided a person classed as a member of the essential services had a motor car registered in his name, that he kept it registered and insured and, in addition, registered a motor bicycle, he should be authorised to use the motor bicycle in fine weather in order to make the petrol go further.  The first answer to that was: &ldquo;Well, one person could use the car and the other could use the motor bicycle.&rdquo;  That was a perfectly reasonable answer.  It was suggested, however, that that could not take place if the registered owner was given a single transferable disc that he would use on the car to-day, if it was a wet day, and on the motor bicycle to-morrow if it was a fine day, and that, seeing there was only one disc, there could be no abuse and no loophole.  Finally, the only reason for refusing that demand was that it placed one person in a position of advantage over another.</P>
    <P>I would venture to say that is not the function of the Minister for Supplies. His function is to safeguard, and equitably distribute, whatever supplies of petrol are available.  In the newspapers&mdash;we have to go to them for our information&mdash;I have seen the members of essential services classed as doctors, midwives, veterinary surgeons and clergymen.  It may be news for the Minister&mdash;but I can tell him it is so&mdash;to learn that there is not that cut-throat competition for business between the members of any of those professions. The mind of the huxter would be the mentality behind the suggestion that, <Col N="2115" /> because one man had a car and a motor bicycle and was allowed to use one or the other, he could sometimes best his neighbour.</P>
    <P>The only reason why anybody would do it is that the allowance of petrol is so inadequate that the only way a man could put a face on half doing his job is by using a vehicle that will consume less petrol in fine weather and conserving a little petrol for the car in bad weather.  What difference does it make if a man gets only one-fifth of the petrol to do his job?</P>
    <P>Take the case of a doctor.  What does it mean in his case?  That patients are visited once when heretofore they were visited five times, and for four days they will be left to carry on in a state of mental anxiety, possibly excruciating pain, because the doctor cannot reach them.  If, on the other hand, he can use a motor bicycle, and he makes the petrol go three times as far, it means that he can visit these unfortunate patients three times when heretofore he used to visit them five times.  Is that a thing which, in the opinion of Parliament, should be discouraged?  Is there anything unworthy in that?  Is the man to be condemned only to be able to reach on one-fifth of his patients because somebody says it would give him a position of advantage over rival competitors?  How can you get equality?  One man may have a horse; another man may be young enough to ride a bicycle; another man may have producer-gas fitted to his car.  But in all these cases an equal grant of petrol will be made.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would look into this question from any but a Party point of view, he would see that it is the function of the Minister for Supplies beyond anyone else to encourage everybody to use any and every possible expedient in order to do as much of their job of work as heretofore with very considerably less petrol.  I would say to the Minister in all seriousness that we are living in a time when it is necessary to economise not only in petrol, but in petrol and tyres, and the obvious way to economise in both is to encourage people when possible to use the very <Col N="2116" /> lightest type of motor vehicle.  The present Order, as carried out, makes that impossible.  You are told you can have a disc for your car and not for a motor bicycle, or you can have a disc for the motor bicycle and not for the car, and that that disc is not transferable.  The allowance of petrol in either case is mathematically worked out, so that, whether you opt for the car or opt for the motor bicycle, the petrol will only carry you exactly the same distance.  Being human beings, what will people do if the petrol is only going to carry them the same distance?  They will opt for the luxury vehicle; they will opt for the car.  They will cover less ground, they will use more rubber, and the life of the tyres will be shorter.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that the disc given to such people should be transferable from one vehicle to the other, so that fine weather and good roads will tempt the disc holder to use the more economical vehicle as frequently as possible, and thereby do more work and use less rubber.  Surely that is a point of view with which any sensible man outside the Civil Service will readily agree?  Why is it not done? What is against it?  That one man might do more work by that means than his neighbour; that one man might be able to bring relief to more suffering human beings by that means than his neighbour; that one clergyman would bring spiritual consolation to more people through that means than another.  Are these worthy reasons for turning down the suggestion?  If there are better reasons, then I am anxious to hear them.  If there are not better reasons, it is not a sufficient answer to the suggestion to say that it is made from the Opposition Front Bench.  It is not a sufficient reason for refusing the suggestion to say that the Order was in draft before the suggestion was made.</P>
    <P>Nearly 18 months ago I urged on the Minister and his advisers the absurdity of giving a flat-rate allowance to clergymen, doctors and others that had no connection with their work. They were given an allowance of petrol on their diplomas and not on their work.  The man who had not to travel <Col N="2117" /> a mile in the year to do his duty got the same amount of petrol as the man with the biggest rural district, with the greatest population in the whole country.  When I put up that nearly 18 months ago, and when I pointed out the absurdity of it and asked to have it justified, the answer I got was that the Order was in print.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who gave that answer.  I did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give that answer.  That was the answer given to me, and it took 18 months to get a little common sense to replace the lunacy of that particular Order. Are we going to have the same thing in connection with this Order: that simply because an Order was in print or in draft before the suggestion was made, it will take another 18 months to get a little common sense and intelligence into the scheme?</P>
      <P>I do not know with what authority, whether official or semi-official, articles are appearing in the newspapers with regard to how, when and where an authorised disc holder may use his vehicle.  I saw a rather absurd thing yesterday to the effect that a member of an essential service could not use his disc vehicle to get to and from his place of residence; that he could only use it on his business and to get to his place of business.  I wonder what genius was responsible for such an utterance.  Take a clergyman.  Where is a clergyman's place of business?  Is it not at the bedside of the dying, wherever they may be?  Is it not at his home where he keeps the instruments of his sacred office?  Must he not move from the bedside to his home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the place of business of the doctor&mdash;the average general practitioner?  It is at the bedside of the patient, and in his home where he keeps his records, his equipment, where he writes up his case sheets, and where he has his reference books.  It is an absurdity in connection with an Emergency Order to say that members of essential services cannot use a disc vehicle for the purpose of getting from their place of business to their residence. Would it not be a nice state of affairs if a doctor had to leave his <Col N="2118" /> car five or six miles away at the hospital or at the dispensary, and to walk home, and, on getting a call that night, to walk to the hospital to get out his car before getting around to where the patient lived, merely because some genius sitting at the back of a desk would not enter into consultation with anybody who knew the job before those pronouncements were made?  On glancing at the announcement, there is not a single Deputy in this House who could not see the absurdity of it in application to members of essential services. Where is a midwife's place of business? Her place of business is, naturally, her residence.  Her official place of business may be the dispensary, but her actual place of business is her residence, where she keeps her equipment, where she keeps her records, where she keeps her case sheets, where she keeps and files temperature charts, and where she is on call at any time she is required.</P>
    <P>The result of those ill-considered and irresponsible pronouncements is that officers and officials act on them, and there is any amount of irritation being experienced by people at the present moment who, under a serious handicap and with every possible interference, official and semi-official, are only able in part to respond to a very high calling.  I do not know who decides what persons or classes of persons will get discs, and who will not get discs.  One would imagine, with the Department of Supplies dealing with cases of this kind, that there would be the closest co-operation and the fullest consultation between the Department of Supplies and the Department of Local Government and between the Department of Supplies and the various organisations affected. On an occasion last January, the Minister&mdash;12 months after a great interference with the work of doctors &mdash;communicated with the Medical Union to the effect that, if they sent forward a list of 100 rural dispensary doctors, extra petrol would be given to them.  The Medical Union issued an advertisement, giving a very short time to reply, because they knew they would be inundated with replies.  They appointed a committee, and conscientiously night <Col N="2119" /> after night that committee waded through all the answers to the advertisement. They drafted a list of 100 doctors, including five or six county tuberculosis medical doctors.  When that list reached the Department of Supplies, every tuberculosis officer was blue-pencilled without any consultation with the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In a position of this gravity, seeing that outside the city 90 per cent. of the doctors and the nurses and the veterinary surgeons are in the employment, directly or indirectly, of the Local Government Department, surely the fact that one Department happens to be at Ballsbridge and the other at the Custom House is no justification for the lack of adequate discussion between the two Departments.  If the matter were discussed with the Local Government Department, the issue of petrol would be according to the requirements of the district, according to the area, the population, and the number of red tickets, and not just according to the qualifications or diplomas which anyone happened to get years ago.  There in black and white you have the area of each district, the population, and the average number of sick, and an allowance should be made somewhat in accordance with the work to be done.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of midwives, surely there must be a direct relationship between the work of a midwife and the birth rate in her district.  The birth rate in different dispensary districts varies from less than two a month to 20 or 30 a month, and the absurdity of a flat rate allowance of petrol is there evident on the very surface.  All that information is in the Department of Local Government. I remember when the British&mdash;whom we all strove to get rid of in this country&mdash;had to face a similar situation here, the forerunner of our Department of Local Government and Public Health provided a scheme for all such persons, and the scheme in its application was reasonable and sound. Everyone was reduced more or less in proportion, but the amount given, if you took one man's district against another, was based on the work to be <Col N="2120" /> done in the district, and not on all those calculations about the horsepower of cars, and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that there is a definite link between the matter which we are discussing and dangers to health.  I would be guilty of moral cowardice if I did not say outright what is in my mind, and point to the dangers I see ahead.  We have gone through a couple of years of shortage of fuel.  We have gone through a couple of years of more or less increasing poverty.  We have gone through a couple of years when soap was getting very scarce and very dear. We have gone through a couple of years when, in the ordinary household, there was not the same supply of hot water as there used to be.  Through lack of fuel in many homes, people are putting on overcoats to go to bed at night.  There is less soap; there is less washing, and all over the country there is a very general increase in infestation from lice.  I was warned some months ago by a senior medical officer of the Army that conditions generally were getting so bad that almost any man who went home on leave a couple of times came back lice-infested.  The body louse is the only medium for the spread of typhus fever; no lice, no typhus fever.  If the whole Dáil were full of typhus, with only one man free from it moving amongst the whole lot of them, and if there were no living louse, that man could not be infected with typhus fever.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to know that in the Famine years, when the standard of life was low, when the standard of nourishment was particularly low, when the people were poverty-stricken throughout this land and before the name of typhus fever was ever known, in all the medical textbooks it was called Irish fever.  It has been practically wiped out in this country for the last 50 years.  There was one exception, an outbreak about 1912.  You have it in Europe at the moment and you have that state of affairs that I mention in this country.  You have typhus raising its head again in two or three counties, and for 12 months back you have had every health visitor, every public health nurse, every sanitary inspector graded as a private person for the allowance <Col N="2121" /> of petrol, and since 1st May you have the extraordinary position that it is illegal for any one of them to use cars on the roads.</P>
    <P>I was told some three months ago that this country was surely heading for as big an outbreak of typhus fever as it ever faced.  I hope that is not so, but I got startled when I read in the papers within the past few days that there has been a case, or there have been cases in two or three counties. When that is the position you have the public health staff in every county driven off the roads, the visiting staff, sanitary inspectors and visiting nurses not allowed by law to use cars on the road.  Was there any consultation between the Department of Supplies and the Department of Local Government with regard to that?  If there was, and if the Department of Local Government did not make strong and vigorous, continuous and determined recommendations, then the responsibility is on the Department of Local Government.  If, on the other hand, those recommendations were made by the Department of Local Government and rejected by the Department of Supplies, the responsibility for the appalling state of affairs that is there at the moment and for anything that arises out of that state of affairs is definitely on the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to get in contact with his colleague in the Department of Local Government, because I submit that the soil is there prepared, beautifully prepared, in this country for as big and thumping an outbreak of typhus as ever hit any country, that the time to get energetic and to forestall it is before it gets growth, and that the only way of finding an infested house is through the school-child.  If your machinery for school inspection is paralysed, immobilised or non-existent, then your detector machinery is gone.  If typhus does hit this country, as things are it will create more casualties in one month than would be created by the total war that we are all talking and thinking about, with this difference, that we have it in our own power to avert one, while averting the other <Col N="2122" /> depends upon circumstances outside of our control.</P>
    <P>I listened to a broadcast from Great Britain with regard to steps similar to those that we have taken about curtailing or limiting the use of motor cars and I would commend that particular broadcast to the Minister for Supplies and to his advisers.  In that broadcast they classified essential services very much as we classify them here, with this exception, that nurses here are restricted to midwives.  Visiting nurses, district nurses, those women who have been doing great and noble work in this country for years, taking control of a whole or half a county, bringing consolation and solace and skill into the homes of stricken people, are here, according to our Order, to be criminals from 1st May if they use cars on the roads.  The Order over there had the stamp of serious consideration, of considering as far as possible the human beings that go to make up that great country.  In addition to essential services, they had people who were gravely disabled, whether through the loss of a limb, through blindness or through very great age.  They had confirmed and chronic invalids.  They had people who lived for a number of years past more than a certain number of miles away from their offices or places of business.  You had there every evidence of an attempt to adjust the hardship to the Order.</P>

There could not be a black market in petrol here if some people were not getting far too much.</P>

      <P>Bogus lorry owners, bogus turf drawers, bogus timber men, bogus hackney men and all kinds of ramifications and particular outcrops of the necessary instruments of defence. Every Deputy sitting behind the Minister, in the confidence of his own office, will be able to tell him where the leakage is and what creates that vast black market in petrol.  The black market is evidence of the too free issue of petrol coupons where they are not of necessity required.  If we curbed that, then there would be more petrol for really hard cases and more petrol for essential services.</P>
      <P>The easiest thing is to make a rule and make it rigid, without any exceptions. We are living in a year when everybody in the country, from the Head of the State down, is calling for more and more grain and tillage.  Here and there you had a farmer who had put by a little money and who bought a little bit of land, perhaps ten or 15 miles away from his own home, and was working it in addition to his own farm, and that system was based upon motor transport between the two places.  No exceptions were made, according to the Minister's interruption, because the petrol is not available. In the same parish, provided they pay 10/- or 15/- a gallon for petrol, they could get it <i>ad lib.</i>, because to some people, to some services or to some classes, far too much petrol has been issued in the past.  There is no other explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the motion.  The points that I wish to add to those of Deputy O'Higgins are small, perhaps, but nevertheless, I think they require to be added.  Take the case here in town of an establishment where there are 900 boys&mdash;a regular small town.  The brother in charge of that establishment has been refused a disc.  A small town of 900 inhabitants might not even have the active life of this community, which is just one particular community typical of others that I speak of.  The contacts they require with the outside world are very varied.  Because the car belonging to the place cannot be disced, a taxi has to be taken for this, that and the other occasion.  On a particular day <Col N="2124" /> of the week, the bank has to be visited and £150 drawn: that means a taxi out and back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a bus service? There is, is there not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A bus from this particular establishment to the bank? If the Minister would care to travel with £150 or £175 in his pocket in a regular routine way between his establishment and his bank, nowadays, there are people who are a little more realistic and prudent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not do these things because we like it; it is because we have to.  Heads of other businesses have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this were a small town, there would be at least a couple of taxis or hackney cars in it, but the bus will not serve to do the very many journeys, for purposes of supplies or business of one kind or another, that connect a small enclosed community of that kind with its supply services outside.  Taxis will be used for some purposes and lorries and buses will be used for others, but it is simply utter unreasonableness to deny the use of a motor vehicle to a community of that particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is this.  When we consider the strain there is on local bus services at the present time, and the difficulty people have of getting in to their employment, persons who have cars and who reside outside the city a distance of five or six miles might at least be permitted the use of their cars to come from their residences to business.  The Minister has very many ways: he could get undertakings that the motor cars available in that particular way would be used simply to bring the residents from the house to the place of business in the city.  When we consider the number of people living outside the City of Dublin, in a radius of ten or 12 miles, and consider that children have to come in to the schools, and that members of the household come in to business in one way or another, it is easy to see that, with all the traffic thrown on the buses, the buses will not be able to bear it. There is an absolute waste and a considerable <Col N="2125" /> amount of inconvenience and dislocation of personal time of business people, by forcing unnecessarily all the residential traffic on to the buses that are there.</P>
    <P>The next case is that of Deputies. We are at a very critical time in the country and there have been appeals for co-operation in the formation of parish associations of all kinds dealing with the defence of the country and the increase of production.  While all those appeals have been going out, we find local authorities immobilised in one way or another now, a county council wiped out here and committees of agriculture there.  We have Deputies who are given practically no place in the various organisations that have been set up to meet the emergency.  They have a place of their own, if that were properly filled and if this House were functioning as it ought to function.  Take the size of the constituencies that we have&mdash; taken even a comparatively small one like Waterford, stretching from Dunmore East to Youghal; then go to West Cork, stretching from Kinsale to Castletownbere, Schull and Ballydehob; or Tipperary, stretching from Roscrea to Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary and Cahir.  Deputies who represent those constituencies have very grave responsibilities to keep in touch with the local conditions.  They never had greater responsibility than at the present time, and no recognition is given to the fact that they should not only fulfil their normal responsibilities as Deputies but be in touch with the various activities of one kind or another to increase production and increase defence.</P>
    <P>Our people have been fighting for generations for their own Parliamentary institutions, to stand over the development of the country and its defence.  We have, for one reason or another, got into the position that, from the man in the street to our Press, nothing is left undone that can be done to belittle the position and responsibilities of Parliament here.  A very large part of the responsibility for that&mdash;if not the whole of it&mdash;falls on the shoulders of the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2126" /> Party.  For what have we been wanting Parliamentary institutions, if not in order that individual Deputies, representing separate constituencies, will keep the Parliament here informed fully of the conditions in those constituencies, and bring to their constituents the assistance and guidance they can bring from full and thorough discussions in Parliament here?</P>
    <P>What we have at the present time is a Parliament almost shut down as far as discussion is concerned.  We are governed by the spirit which expresses itself in Section 11 of this particular Order&mdash;the spirit emanating from the Front Bench and the power that drives that spirit emanating from the silent ranks of the Party that guards the Ministerial spirit by its strength in numbers.  The effects of the Order have been fully described by Deputy O'Higgins.  Section 11 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister is satisfied that a vehicle has been used in contravention of this Order, he may if he thinks proper, cause such vehicle to be seized and removed to such place as he shall direct.</P>
    <P>(2) A vehicle may be seized under this Article in any place, public or private, in which it is found, and the person making such seizure may, for the purpose thereof or for the removal of such vehicle, break, enter, and search any building in which he reasonably suspects such vehicle to be and may also, where necessary for such removal, forcibly enter such vehicle.</P>
    <P>(3) Every vehicle seized and removed under this Article shall be sold or otherwise disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer at such time and in such manner as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Order that has been so fully described in its effects by Deputy O'Higgins provides that if a particular portion is infringed the Minister may seize the vehicle that has been the medium of the offence, and it may be sold or otherwise disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.  It typifies the spirit in which the Parliamentary institutions that the efforts of generations <Col N="2127" /> of the people set up here are at present being used to narrow the position of our Parliamentary institutions on the pretence of a certain shortage of petrol to prevent Deputies keeping in touch with their, in many cases, vast constituencies.  That is simply an attempt to bolster up that type of spirit to dominate our institutions. I challenge Deputies sitting behind the Minister on the Government Benches to say how they can keep contact with their constituencies, in view of facts that are daily manifesting themselves, as to the growing difficulties under which their constituents work and live.  How can they keep in touch if they are denied the amount of petrol allowed to a dispensary doctor or a nurse?  How can they, even if they wished, inform them of the discussions of this Parliament to a greater extent than they tried to do in the past? How can they hope to do that with any conviction?   In spite of those who have been decrying Deputies and decrying this House and its usefulness, I say that this Parliament is more important to the country at the present time than either its Army or its police, and anything that would intervene as an excuse or as a cause for preventing Deputies keeping in the closest possible touch with the ordinary lives of their constituents, with the movement of defence and of production going on in their constituencies, is a blow at Parliamentary institutions here at a time when they are assailed by public ignorance and most assailed by real dangers, when we realise that we have as much petrol this year as we had last year.</P>

      <P>Whatever supply of petrol we get the maintenance of contact between this Parliament and the constituencies is one of the most important things that we require petrol for.  The bigger the difficulties and the bigger the dangers that are coming to this country generally, because of the breakdown of transport, the more important it is that this Parliament will be in closest possible touch with the people.  That is one of the principal reasons why I support the case which Deputy O'Higgins made for the annulment of this Order.  I should like to hear if there are any Deputies sitting behind the Minister prepared to stand for the Order or that Deputies can do their responsible work at present if they have not the means of transport to their constituencies.</P>

      <P>If that is so, I may say that the talk going around is that some petrol came in.  I support the motion because I think the scheme could be <Col N="2129" /> worked in a different way.  Farmers have been left out and, in my opinion, they are now in the front-line trenches. It is just as important that they should get petrol as the L.D.F.  There is a good deal of petrol wasted on the L.D.F. which could be more usefully given to farmers who are producing food.  We have people running around in ambulances and nurses bringing in &ldquo;wounded&rdquo;.  I saw last Sunday where lorries travelled miles to bring in &ldquo;wounded&rdquo;.  I think that is waste of money.  The business of people living ten or 15 miles from a bus or from the railways has been knocked out for want of petrol.  I do not think exercises of that kind are going to save the country. In my opinion that is nonsense.  I got up on platforms and spoke in favour of preparing our military defences, but I think we would be better off if money was not wasted in the way I mentioned. If there is going to be war here we will not be able to stop it.  It is only madness to waste money in the way I referred to instead of giving the petrol to have food produced.  The farmers are in the front-line trenches, and in the midlands and the centre of the country they have no railway or bus facilities.  Tuesday was an important market day, but farmers could not get to Dublin with cattle.  Salesmasters could not get to Dublin to sell cattle.  There was no bus from Mullingar and there was no train service from the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no train at all there yesterday and then we had the buses cut off from Athlone&mdash;an important run from the middle of the country. There should be some system by which we would not have the buses used by women coming up to look at the shop windows.  The buses should be confined to people who have genuine business in the city.  If there is a shortage of petrol, it is the business of the Minister for Supplies to see that people who are on business can get seats in a bus.  People who are going only as far as Kilcock get into a bus at Aston Quay.  They should be catered for on short runs and let people from down the country avail of the long-distance bus.  I had a disc yesterday to come to the Dáil and I <Col N="2130" /> had to carry five persons.  At Kinnegad, I found two persons waiting. They had to stop over from the previous day because there was no bus.  At Enfield, there were 12 or 14 persons clamouring for seats.  They all came from the middle of County Meath because there was no train coming up from Kingscourt or the middle of the county.</P>

      <P>Your van is not intended to convey people to the Dáil.  It is supposed to be used for some other purpose.  I think that the Minister should look up this matter and consider the situation of families living in the midlands ten or 12 miles from bus or rail.  Then, certain men may have been able by hard work to buy a bit of land ten or 12 miles from their homes.  These small farmers may have had an old car not worth £10 which they used for passing backwards and forwards to milk their cows and do other work of that kind.  They cannot take out that old car now.  Some genuine scheme should be prepared whereby everybody's case would be considered individually and nobody would be licensed except those who are in the front-line trenches.  In July and August, a farmer may have to go to a fair 15 or 16 miles distant.  He will want to sell his cattle and get back to his men so as to save his crops.  If he goes to the fair, he will lose a whole day under present conditions. There should be some provision by which he could go to the local Gárda barracks and get a disc for the journey, even if he had to pay a small tax.  A man like that cannot afford to hire a car in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the petrol position improves, the people who should get petrol first are the farmers.  I have no sympathy with the people for whom Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="2131" /> pleads who live around the city and who have Drumm trains and other conveyances at their service.  I am concerned for people who are living ten or 15 miles from bus and rail, particularly the people in the midlands. I do not know whether the Minister will answer for their sins or not but there are several old people in that area who did not go to Mass since these restrictions were imposed.  The custom was for a person with a car to carry four or five of these people to Mass.  It was thought a lucky thing to do.  Now, that cannot be done, and people living six and seven miles from the chapel in country places are in a difficult situation.  I know that, owing to the shortage of petrol, the right thing to do was to knock off a lot of the cars.  Since the Minister has knocked them off, he should set up a committee and, if he finds the position improving, he should give certain people petrol.  Then he should have some scheme whereby people would not be using the buses for joy rides or a woman would not be coming up in the bus to buy a hat which she could do without.  It is very hard on people who have business to transact to see these people getting into a bus in which they themselves cannot get accommodation.</P>
    <P>Another thing I notice is that some of the buses are half-full of soldiers. They may be going on holidays, but the Army has plenty of petrol and should supply transport for them.  They should not have the buses half-full of soldiers going on holidays.  I ask the Minister to look into these points.  If he says there is a shortage of petrol, let him deal with it in a common-sense way and let those who have business travel. Some people have lost their livelihood owing to inability to travel, and other people are using the buses which they have no need to use.  I ask the Minister to make an announcement and say that this is done because of the shortage of petrol.  In Mullingar, there was a football match on Sunday and there were from 30 to 50 cars there.  It is hard on people who cannot get to Mass because of shortage of petrol to see 30 or 40 cars at a football match.  I have played a great deal of hurling and football <Col N="2132" /> myself but, when it is a case of putting one's nose to the grind-stone, business should come before pleasure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the speeches that we have heard this evening from Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy entitle us to despair of ever getting some members of the Dáil to face realities.  Is it not time we got out of this world of fancy and faced facts?  This country is facing a crisis of the first magnitude arising out of difficulties, inevitable during the course of this year, in connection with transport.  I am not using the term &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; merely for the purpose of dramatic effect.  It may be impossible for us to move the harvest. There may be, in parts of the country, an actual shortage of food because of inability to deliver available stocks into those districts.  Hundreds of people are losing their employment because of shortage of transport.  Thousands more will lose their employment for the same cause.  It is in relation to facts of that kind that this motion must be considered and that the representations made by Deputies concerning certain sections of the community to which they belong, or in which they are interested, must be judged.  Deputy O'Higgins wants more petrol for doctors. Deputy Mulcahy wants more petrol for Deputies.  Deputy Fagan wants more petrol for farmers.  I am sure that every Deputy who may intervene in this debate will urge that more petrol be given to the particular section of the community with which he is most familiar.  We all know that a shortage of petrol is bound to cause inconvenience and hardship, but that is not the question we have to discuss here.  We know that inconvenience and hardship cannot be avoided, but is it possible to use the dwindling stocks at our disposal to minimise the hardship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not get rid of hardship by talking about it.  We do not create pools of petrol by making speeches such as those to which we have just listened.  We cannot increase our supply of petrol by imagining the increased supply is there, as Deputy Mulcahy did.  In normal times, when this country had abundance of rail transport and unrestricted road transport services&mdash;frequently, far in excess <Col N="2133" /> of the country's needs&mdash;we consumed, on every form of motor transport, approximately 44,000,000 gallons of petrol in the year.  Last year, we got 20,000,000 gallons.  This year, we will get, perhaps, half that amount or, if we are lucky, 60 per cent.&mdash;that is to say, 12,000,000 gallons.  Deputies can try to persuade themselves, if they like, that some miracle is going to happen and that the curtailment of our petrol supplies which we anticipate will not occur.  But can we base our plans upon the expectation of miracles?  I do not think we can.  If we are going to find ourselves this year with not more than 12,000,000 gallons, against a normal consumption of 44,000,000 gallons, if we have to make these 12,000,000 gallons provide for transport services which in normal times were supplemented by railway services, omnibus services operated on fuel oil and other public conveniences which do not now exist or do not exist on the same scale, we must make up our mind that somebody has to do without petrol.  The elimination of the private car altogether from the roads of this country, whether driven by doctors, midwives, farmers, priests, or any other class of the community, will save 1,500,000 gallons.  That is all.  Last year we had 20,000,000 gallons and we had a debate like this in the Dáil in which the inconvenience caused by the curtailment in the petrol supply was pictured in the same terms as were used here to-day.  But this year we have to do with at least 8,000,000 gallons less and only 1,500,000 gallons of that 8,000,000 can be secured by the elimination of the private motor car. These are some facts I want Deputies to face.  Deputy Mulcahy said that he had been informed that we are going to get the same quantity of petrol this year as we got last year.  We are not.</P>

      <P>In January of last year.  Subsequently, the position improved, petrol supplies were resumed and we did succeed in getting over the whole of last year&mdash;not in the first three months because in the first three months we got very little petrol -20,000,000 gallons.  Delivery of petrol at the same rate as during the latter part of last year continued for the first three months of this year, but I am now informed that the total quantity we can expect to get, at the maximum, is between 12,000,000 and 13,000,000 gallons, counting what we have already got, which means that the quantity to come in between now and the end of the year will not be half the quantity that came in in the same period last year.  I am trying to get Deputies to understand that these are facts.  They were officially stated in the newspapers but Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy choose not to believe them because if they did believe them they could not make the type of speech they have made here this evening.  They cannot dodge facts.  They cannot make motor cars run upon the type of hot air we get in speeches here.  If we are to provide for doctors, Deputies, farmers and all other classes of the community who know that they are inconvenienced by the absence of private motor cars, we have got to take petrol from the essential services. The essential services are those engaged in the transportation <Col N="2135" /> of food and fuel upon which the lives of people in many parts of the country depend, upon which the industry of the country depends, upon which the employment of thousands of people depends.  We cannot give more petrol to doctors unless we take it from somebody else.  Deputy O'Higgins says we are giving too much petrol to hackney owners and lorry owners.</P>

      <P>We have got to allocate 12,000,000 gallons of petrol, provided we are lucky.  I cannot say that 12,000,000 gallons will in fact come into this country this year.  The only thing I can say is that not more than 12,000,000 gallons will arrive.  It may be that through misfortune some of the consignments will not reach us, in which case we will have to do with less.  That is 8,000,000 gallons less than we used last year.  We have got to make up 8,000,000 gallons by curtailing the use of petrol by people who, last year, were getting it, even though we know that last year the reduced quantities of petrol available caused considerable inconvenience and considerable debate here about that inconvenience. We can make up only 1,500,000 out of the 8,000,000 by putting private cars off the road.  The transportation of goods and the public passenger services must be cut to make up the other 6,500,000.  Having got that fact clearly understood by Deputies, we can proceed to appreciate on their merits the claims made on behalf of doctors, Deputies and other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire to curtail petrol allocations to doctors, to limit the operations of county medical officers of health, to restrict the beneficial services rendered by midwives, county nurses or any other persons associated with humanitarian services.  If they are restricted, it is because we have no <Col N="2137" /> option but to restrict them.  Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion that it is unwise to deny petrol to the residents of the suburbs of Dublin and compel them to use buses was the poorest argument advanced here.  No doubt, the bus services are restricted and, no doubt, in due course, bus services will have to be further restricted and may disappear, and these people will have no means of getting into town except on their feet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The buses are not sufficient for the traffic there is at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they are insufficient for the traffic.  I know that. Only within the past month I found it necessary to have further discussions as to the possibility of effecting still more substantial reductions in the public transport service because the means of carrying them on are not there.  We are not restricting transport services or petrol allocations or other public conveniences because of a whim.  We are doing these things because stark necessity is driving us to do them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot give petrol to suburban residents to come into Dublin and thus avoid putting them to the necessity of using the bus service.  We cannot give petrol to farmers who have farms at some distance from their residences which they want to look after, much though we should like to do it.  We cannot give any more petrol to doctors, however great the need is, because we have not got it.  We have at the moment to face the fact that even the existing curtailments in the use of motor vehicles is not going to be sufficient.  We have to go further.  We have operated, it is true, the permit system only in respect of private cars for this month.  Inevitably, it will have to be extended to light vans in respect of which a considerable number of abuses are evident. In order to get these under control, and to limit the use of them, it will be necessary to provide that permits for their operation will also be required. Doctors, undoubtedly, have a need for transport for emergency calls.  That is the only justification for giving them petrol at all.  It may be an inconvenience <Col N="2138" /> for a doctor not to be able to use his car when travelling from his place of residence to his consulting rooms or to his place of business, but we must get these doctors to understand that, in so far as we have given them petrol, it is merely for the purpose of enabling them to carry out their duties when there is no other means of doing so except the use of motor transport.</P>
    <P>The argument that a doctor must always take his car with him to enable him to attend any call that may come along could be extended indefinitely. It could be suggested that if he goes to a theatre it would be necessary to take his car with him, as he might get a call while in the theatre. It could be suggested that if he went to a golf club he might be rung up there by some patient needing his services and that he should therefore be allowed to take his car to the golf club.  These arguments, all of which have been advanced to me by medical people, indicate a failure to realise the seriousness of the situation.  We have given doctors petrol because of the possibility that once in a while an emergency call will reach them which they cannot attend other than by the use of a car, but if there is any other means by which they can attend to their duties and serve the requirements of their patients, without the use of their cars, they must do so, because it is only with considerable difficulty that petrol is being made available for them at all.  The same remark applies to other classes in respect to whom permits for the use of private cars have been issued&mdash;clergymen, veterinary surgeons and midwives.</P>
    <P>We have, I know, found it difficult to distinguish between the relative merits of the claims of one professional person and another.  It is quite possible that, as a result of statements made to us, some doctors and some clergymen may have got petrol that they did not really need.  I want such people to understand that they are doing an injury to people in other occupations which may have very serious consequences for these people.  There are many people dependent on motor transport for their employment who, if they cannot get petrol, will lose that <Col N="2139" /> employment.  There are many industries which cannot be carried on without petrol, but it may not be possible to make petrol supplies available for all of them.  No doubt there is a certain amount of unwillingness on the part of doctors, clergymen and others who have been accustomed to use a motor vehicle, to adjust their mentality to circumstances in which that motor vehicle will not be available to them, but they will have to do it.  If necessary, they have got to be made to do it by the infliction of the drastic penalties for which the Order provides and to which Deputy Mulcahy objects. These drastic penalties are not put there merely because we get some pleasure out of inflicting them on people.  They are put there because it is necessary to impress on the minds of people concerned how serious the situation is and how very necessary it is that they should conform to the restrictions that have been placed upon the use of motor vehicles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with this question because Deputy O'Higgins has elaborated on it.  I find that motor vehicle owners who resent the restrictions placed upon them by the petrol situation can be divided into two classes.  There are those who are in a general class but who insist that their circumstances are unique and that consequently they should get treatment denied to others in their class.  On the other hand there are those whose circumstances are exceptional but who try to generalise their situation by applying a general argument to their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins comes into the latter class.  As I understand Deputy O'Higgins' argument, he is in favour of giving more petrol to doctors and he urged that if we could not give more petrol to doctors, we should at least give more to county medical officers. Again he urged that if more could not be made available for county medical officers, we should try to have an arrangement whereby a county medical officer who had a motor car and a <Col N="2140" /> motor bicycle could transfer his disc from one to the other.</P>
    <P>Many doctors own two cars, a number of doctors own a car and a motor-bike, and some doctors cannot afford either a car or a motor-bike.  Our job is not to put one class of doctors in a relatively superior position to another class.  It is to distribute amongst doctors the quantity of petrol we can make available for the medical profession as equitably as possible. It is not merely necessary that the method of distribution should be equitable, but that it should appear equitable to every member of the profession.  A doctor who has a 30 h.p. Daimler car may also have an 8 h.p. Ford car and he may decide that by using the petrol ration in respect of the larger car on the small car, he can cover an extra mileage.  He may be a wealthy man who can afford to do that, but he would be placed in a privileged position as against the doctor who could not.  Further down the scale we have the doctor who owns a motor car and a motor bicycle.  He is above the young fellow who has a motor cycle only.  If we were to adopt Deputy O'Higgins' suggestion, the net result would be that the richer people are, the more petrol they can get and the longer mileage they cannot knock out of that petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The doctor who owns a motor car and a bicycle is not of any greater service to the public than a doctor who owns a motor cycle only.  I do not care where you start, whether you start with a 30 h.p. Daimler or an 8 h.p. Ford, the whole purpose of the suggestion is to ensure that the better off people will get more petrol.  That is how it will appear anyhow to the fellow who can only own a motor cycle.  It is true that it is desirable that we should encourage people in essential services to use motor cycles if they have them <Col N="2141" /> in preference to using motor cars.  To that end we have given, in fact, a relatively higher allocation of petrol to those who elect to use motor cycles than to those who elect to use motor cars. That is the only encouragement we can give them.</P>
      <P>You can devise another system if you like, but I am sure that if I were to devise another system, that would be denounced more vigorously than the first.  I would be told that I was not distributing available supplies fairly, that I was discriminating in favour of one section of doctors as against another section, and particularly in favour of those in better financial circumstances as against those who are not able to afford to transport themselves as they did in times of peace.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fagan suggested that we should set up a committee to distribute petrol.  I have frequently indicated my willingness to share my responsibility, in the distribution of available petrol supplies, with a Committee of the Dáil.  That suggestion of mine has never been enthusiastically received, and I doubt very much if I shall renew it in view of the obvious impossibility of getting agreement, even amongst the members of the Party opposite, concerning the distribution of petrol supplies.  Is it not quite clear that, amongst the three members from the Party opposite who have already spoken in this debate, you could not get agreement as to the best method of distributing petrol?</P>

      <P>I should like to say to the Minister that I did not suggest a Committee of the Dáil.  What I had in mind was, say, the local Gárdaí, or some local committee, that would be empowered to deal with the case of, let us say, a farmer, or a group of three or four farmers, who wanted to travel ten miles or so to a fair.  My idea was that you could have some such local committee that would issue a special disc to enable that group of farmers to go to the fair, and that it would be only available for that purpose. That was my idea, or something similar to that.</P>

I, however, did suggest a Committee of the Dáil at one time, because I felt that it would be a convenience to me if I could share responsibility amongst the members of the Dáil for the distribution of the diminishing quantity of petrol that we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that no two people will agree on this question of the distribution of petrol, and somebody must make a decision, if it is to be distributed at all.  My decision was to keep the maximum quantity of the available supplies for the goods transport services, and, within those services, to give most of the petrol available to the essential services.  Out of the private car-owner class of persons, we selected only the doctors, the clergymen, the veterinary surgeons, and the midwives.  They, and they only, are getting permits to drive cars on motor spirit.</P>
      <P>We have also given permits to some of the public utility companies to operate cars required in connection with emergency services.  There are some passenger-carrying private cars permitted to be operated by the railway companies, by the Gas Company, and by one or two other public companies of that kind, in respect of which emergencies might arise at any time, requiring the immediate transportation of engineers and others to look after things, but outside these limited classes of persons nobody has got a permit to drive a motor car on petrol.  I do not want to complicate this matter by dealing with the position of cars driven by producer gas.  What petrol will be left, after all these private car owners are provided for, will still be substantially less than was available for the essential goods services last year, and every Deputy knows that the quantity of petrol that was available for essential goods services last year was substantially less than enabled these services to be carried on efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties have already arisen in <Col N="2143" /> parts of this country, where there are no rail services, in the matter of the regular distribution of essential foodstuffs. We, who live here in the centre of the transport system of the country, do not fully appreciate that there are wide areas in this country where there are no other means of transport except the motor car, and into these wide areas foodstuffs must go regularly.  The distribution of foodstuffs in these wide areas can only be achieved by means of motor vehicles, and because of the action of individuals, or because of the difficulty of maintaining a regular supply, urgent problems have already arisen in these areas.  Wherever they have come to our attention, they have been remedied, but these problems are going to arise with greater frequency in the future, and the matter of distributing essential foodstuffs to these districts is going to become one of greater difficulty as time goes on, because there is none of us, I am sure, so optimistic as to believe that any improvement in the situation will take place while world conditions remain as they are.  It is, I think, almost certain that this time next year the situation will be very much worse.</P>
    <P>The sole reason why this Mechanically Propelled Vehicles Order, requiring a permit for the operation of private cars, was made was the shortage of petrol.  No doubt, we would have had to consider at some time dealing by such means with the question of the utilisation of rubber, but that would not have been an urgent problem.  Many of these vehicles have been equipped with tyres that would last for years, and there would have been no need for this Order merely because of the rubber situation.  We could have dealt with that situation, if it were the only one confronting us, by restricting the use of tyres, or the sale of tyres to the owners of such vehicles.  This Order, however, became urgently necessary when we were informed, at the beginning of April, that the total quantity of petrol that we would get this year would be 13,000,000 gallons, counting what we had already got up to that time.  There might have been a possibility of being more liberal, but in <Col N="2144" /> view of the comparison suggested by 13,000,000 gallons as compared with the quantity last year, it was obvious that for the remaining months of the year, even more drastic action would have to be taken, and I immediately arranged to give public notice of the situation and of our intention to put the private car owner off the road, not because we wanted to put the private car owner off the road, but because we had to&mdash;there was no option.</P>
    <P>It has been my policy, as I explained to the Dáil more than once, since the war started, to keep the private car going as long as possible.  There were even times when Deputies in this House criticised me for that policy, but I did so because of the employment involved in connection with the servicing of private cars and because I knew that a very great deal of public inconvenience would result from any curtailment of their use.  It is only a very small number of private car owners who use their cars exclusively for pleasure.  A great many people do not use them for pleasure at all.  The great majority of motor cars are bought and used by the people of this country in connection with their business, or as an essential part of the equipment required by them to carry on whatever their normal avocation is.  I do not know what Deputy O'Higgins meant when he asked me to look into this question from a non-Party point of view.  I do not think it is possible to have a Party point of view in connection with the allocation of 13,000,000 gallons of petrol amongst those who need petrol in this country.  Probably, there was nothing behind that suggestion except an attempt to convey the impression that in some way the interests of the doctors of the country, or the Deputies or the farmers, were being prejudiced by the fact that the Minister for Supplies looked at such things from a Fianna Fáil point of view.  Well, if there is a Fine Gael point of view as to how 13,000,000 gallons of petrol will be distributed among our people, let us have it.</P>
    <P>The only suggestion that was made was that we could give more to doctors, and more to suburban car owners so as to avoid the necessity for these people travelling on the buses; and <Col N="2145" /> there was also the suggestion that we should give more to Deputies.  Now, on this question of giving petrol to Deputies, I want to say a few words. I think I am as interested as Deputy Mulcahy is in retaining respect for this House, and I know that certain newspapers have been running a campaign designed to bring this House into disrespect. I know also that amongst uninformed sections in the country there are adverse comments on happenings here which tend to lower the prestige of the House.  It must be remembered that the ordinary Deputy is a most important part of the machinery of administration.  The operation of law and of Government regulations is necessarily impersonal, and in between the individual and the law there comes the Deputy, who tries to secure that the administration is softened or diverted in individual cases where justice requires it.  It would be almost impossible to carry on government in the way in which we are trying to carry it on, without the rigorous and harsh penalties which are operating in some other States, if the private Deputies were not there to keep in touch with the public and to find out how a general rule was operating unfairly in an individual case, to bring that individual case forward for the attention of the Minister concerned, and generally to ensure that the circumstances of individual districts and sections would be ventilated and the necessary adjustments in general rules made to deal with them.</P>
    <P>It is going to be a serious matter for the country if it becomes impossible for Deputies to meet their constituents and deal with the complaints of their constituents as easily as heretofore, but it is something that we cannot avoid. There are, of course, large numbers of Deputies who do not own, and never have owned, a motor car, and some of them are able to do their constituency work just as well as those who have had the advantage of the ownership of a motor car.  I do not know if Deputies think it is going to help them in maintaining the prestige of this House, or their own prestige in their constituencies, if they are given an unlimited supply of motor petrol when it is known that that petrol can only be <Col N="2146" /> given to them at the expense of people who need it to maintain employment or to make a livelihood, and that any increase in the total allocation given to Deputies will mean that here and there throughout the country somebody is going to lose his job, that a number of people are going to be put out of employment, and that some difficulty in distribution of essential supplies is going to result.  I think there is an obligation on us to ensure that Deputies are facilitated in attending meetings of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important that no difficulty should prevent a Deputy coming here in order to discharge his duty as a public representative.  I have endeavoured to ensure that arrangements will be made which will be satisfactory in ensuring that every Deputy will be able to get to this House no matter how defective the public transport services might prove to be.  Recent developments in connection with the railways, and the difficulties experienced by the railway engineers in carrying on with any regularity in existing circumstances, may involve some modification of the arrangements made for the distribution of petrol to Deputies, but I do not think it is possible for us to do more than that.  I do not know if there is a majority of Deputies who would suggest that we should do more than facilitate them in attending meetings of the Oireachtas in the circumstances I have described.  As I have said, there is very little prospect of an improvement in supplies in present circumstances.  However, I felt there was an obligation placed upon me to ensure that, in so far as a quantity of petrol was required to enable Deputies to attend here.  I was bound to give it to them, but that it was not essential, even though the lack of it might be a great inconvenience, for Deputies to have petrol to enable them to attend to their constituency work.</P>
    <P>May I say this, also, that the enforcement of this Mechanically-propelled Vehicles Order has been taken out of the hands of the Department of Supplies by the general public?  There is not a motor car which travels in Dublin now, in anything like suspicious circumstances, but dozens of reports concerning it come to the Guards or to <Col N="2147" /> the Department of Supplies from members of the general public who are watching it.  Everybody is jealous of the person who has got a permit to drive a motor car.  If the slightest irregularity occurs in the use of a car by an owner who has got a permit hundreds and thousands of reports concerning it will come in.  Deputies, in these circumstances, will realise the danger they will create for themselves if they demand petrol supplies sufficient to enable them to travel freely around their constituencies.  They cannot put a notice on the windscreen of their cars to indicate that they are going to see John Bourke about a bog road, about his Land Commission annuity or some other matter.  The public will always assume the worst.  They will assume that the Deputy is merely joy-riding, or that he is going to see a friend upon some purely personal matter, and, in the long run, the Deputy who is seen driving a car around in that way will, I think, suffer in the public estimation.</P>

I have not attempted to impose my views upon the House at all.  If Deputies come to me and show, with any degree of unanimity, that they think they should have unlimited petrol supplies then, no matter how the rest of the country may be curtailed, I am prepared to meet them.  I will argue against it and express my point of view.  I have said that I felt there was an obligation on me to see that they were facilitated in attending the meetings of the Oireachtas, and that, from that point of view, it would be unwise to demand more.  But if, as I say, there is unanimity in demanding more than that, then I will be prepared to go further, but I will make <Col N="2148" /> Deputies understand what precisely the allocation of more petrol to them means and from whom we are going to take it in order that they should get it.</P>

It is impossible to assess the petrol requirements of one Deputy in relation to another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to meet Deputies and discuss the matter at any time with them.  I have already met and discussed certain aspects of this question with Deputies of all Parties. I indicated that I was prepared to meet them again at a later stage and discuss with them one particular matter which they raised but which is not urgent at the moment.  Deputy Mulcahy must not misunderstand the suggestion that I am putting forward here.  I do not think this is a Party matter.  I do not think that we could have an organised Party view, secured by a majority vote, on this issue.  I think that answers Deputies in all Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we want to consider, and I want them to come to their conclusions in the knowledge that we have reached the position this year that we have 12,000,000 gallons of petrol to carry on services that normally required 44,000,000 gallons: that no business man in the country, no matter how urgent his needs for motor transport may be, can get a permit to drive <Col N="2149" /> his car although many of them have written to me to say that if they cannot get permits to drive their motor cars the particular works they are in charge of will be stopped and the employment they are giving is going to be terminated.  Notwithstanding all that, they cannot get permits for their cars.  There is also the fact that many farmers in the country have urged that it will be impossible for them to supervise the tillage operations which they have undertaken unless they can get a permit for their cars.  Notwithstanding that, they cannot get a permit, and it is in the light of all these circumstances that I want Deputies to consider just precisely how they should be treated in relation to the public work they have to do.</P>

As I have said already, I am putting <Col N="2150" /> a personal view forward.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very substantial saving.  Of course there is a great deal of misinformed comment on the use of petrol by the Army.  I want to say that the use of petrol by Army vehicles is prohibited at present except under special permit and, to a very large extent, the Army are utilising horse-drawn transport and rail transport for the movement of supplies.  But a very large number of the Army posts are isolated, as Deputies are aware. They are chosen for strategic or tactical purposes and are not in contact with public transport services of one kind or another.  Supplies have to be brought to these posts and occasionally an Army lorry bringing supplies is seen returning empty to its base and probably people will say: &ldquo;There are Army lorries running around the country empty, burning petrol.&rdquo; There is within the Army organisation a far stricter control of the use of petrol than exists in most organisations because, of course, Army discipline ensures that control can be effective.  No doubt here and there wastage may occur.  Subordinate officers and men may not carry out in full the spirit of their instructions, but these cases are few and far between and, when detected, the punishment imposed is salutary.  There has been a very substantial curtailment of the use of petrol by the Army and by all Government services.  As Deputies are aware, Government services did in fact utilise <Col N="2151" /> a great deal of motor transport in normal times.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the petrol is going to public transport services for use in lorries and buses which are available for public hire, either the buses on the passenger services throughout the country, or the lorries operated by the licensed hauliers, whether the railway companies or the privately-licensed hauliers which are available for the transportation of anybody's goods when required.  The next biggest consumers of petrol are the private lorry owners, people engaged in the transportation of goods, not for hire, but for the purpose of their own businesses. It is not necessary to enumerate all these classes.  You have the local authority services, the fire brigades, ambulances, and all the services which must be kept going because of their essential character.  These are the services which must not be cut except as a very last resort.  The quantity of petrol which is being utilised by the private cars which are permitted to operate under this Order is considerable, even though it has been reduced by 1,500,000 gallons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Utilisation of horse transport is obviously desirable and clearly, under present circumstances, more economic than the use of motor vehicles.  But, as the Deputy is aware, there are problems arising in that connection.  We sometimes <Col N="2152" /> read in the newspapers that this limitation of petrol is going to put us back where we were 50 years ago.  I am afraid it will not be even as good as that, because 50 years ago there were a number of horses and horse-drawn vehicles, harness-makers and horse-shoers that do not exist to-day, so that we could not get back even to the comparative comfort of 50 years ago in the circumstances we are now facing.  Unless there is an improvement, which is unlikely, it will be much worse than it was 50 years ago so far as the transport service is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It is because of that that I want Deputies to understand why I feel obliged to resist the pressure put upon me by individuals or by sections of individuals to increase their allocation on the ground of the inconvenience or even the hardship imposed.  Some Deputy referred to cripples who are unable to go to Mass, or other people who were depending on motor vehicles to get around at all.  I have had thousands of letters from people in such circumstances and it has not been an easy matter to write back to say it cannot be done.  Even though many of those letters reveal circumstances which would almost justify exceptional treatment, <Col N="2153" /> and certainly make it possible to defend that exceptional treatment in the Dáil, I felt that the only wise course to take was to confine the use of private vehicles to persons in definite categories and refuse to consider even the circumstances of other cases, because, no matter how strong the circumstances were, it would not be possible to grant the concession asked for, having in the back of my mind the fact that later in the year there will be this problem of getting the corn off the farms into the mills, of getting the beet into the sugar factories, of getting turf into the cities, and of bringing firewood and other essential commodities to the places where they are required.  We had a tremendous problem in dealing with that last year, even though the quantity to be moved was less than we hope it will be this year, and the amount of petrol we had to do it was greater.</P>
      <P>In this year we have to carry a much greater quantity with less petrol.  It will be a tremendous problem.  It may be impossible to solve it by that means. It may prove impossible to solve it altogether. In the course of the next 12 months I have no doubt that there will be local periods of breakdown in the transport services which will cause individual hardship.  So that we must make up our minds that nobody will get more petrol except he can show that it is essential not merely in the individual interest, but in the national interest that he should get it.</P>

      <P>Not this year.  So far as the transportation of turf is concerned, the work has proved satisfactory up to the present, but I cannot guarantee that the coal difficulty, which is now becoming acute for the railway company, will not interfere with it.  It seems indicated that there is a maximum quantity of turf which can be moved, and that that maximum quantity will be moved.  I do not say that the quantity will be entirely sufficient to meet the needs of the non-turf areas, but we have decided that it cannot be increased because of transport difficulties.  The problem of the transport of grain is a different one, because to a much greater extent you can get the co-operation of a large number of individuals to make the problem easier.  That is largely a matter of giving general directions, knowing that behind those general directions there will be individual gain, which, of course, is a very compelling motive in securing co-operation along the lines suggested.  I have spoken longer than I intended, because Deputies kept me going by asking me questions.  I do not think there is any case against this Order.</P>

    <P>I think it would be sheer madness to pass a resolution annulling this Order <Col N="2155" /> and removing the restrictions on the use of transport.  No Deputy who is prepared to face the facts, and to devise a plan of action based on the facts, could possibly vote for this motion.</P>

      <P>I have not very much time to say anything on this, because Deputy O'Higgins has to get an opportunity of replying.  At the beginning of his speech the Minister advised Deputies to get out of the world of fancy and live in a world of reality. I wonder has the Minister taken the trouble of getting himself properly informed on the world of reality?  The Minister has not shown very much solicitude for the good name of this institution here.  He comes in with a proposal which has been prepared by a bureaucratic machine in that cloistered Department of his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy get it into his head that the proposal was prepared by me and nobody else, and that I have taken personal responsibility for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this much, that the Minister is absolutely adamant in this House, and that no matter what representations are made to him he never varies any proposal that he brings in.  No matter what is the practical experience of Deputies in this House, the Minister's attitude is to stick to his original proposal, no matter what merit there may be in the case made against it.  Personally, that is what I resent more than anything else in the attitude of the Minister towards any problem which he has to face.  We must all appreciate that the Minister <Col N="2156" /> has a difficult job, but to my mind his attitude towards those questions is not making his job any easier.  One of the things that I feel more aggrieved about than anything else in his method of distribution of the available supplies is the fact that he has, through thick and thin, stuck to distribution on a class basis.  It is ridiculous to allocate petrol to medical men as a class, irrespective of what their work is.  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And is that done all over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done in respect of all those persons in essential services. There is no basic ration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is done only in certain categories, and, outside those categories, no matter what the hardships are or what the national interest is, the Minister is not prepared to entertain any proposals.  For instance, it appears to me to be an extraordinary situation that a man who is operating three or four tractors, which require a good deal of supervision, is denied even the use of a motor bicycle.  I do not know whether or not the Minister proposes to make any provision for this situation, but I can well visualise that he will adopt a cast-iron attitude in regard to it.  A man who has to supervise the operations of four or five threshing sets over a big area will not be allowed any petrol, and, side by side with him, you have a county instructor getting petrol.  I think, from the national point of view, there is no analogy between the two.  The man who is giving the really essential service is the man who operates the threshing sets; the county instructor could use a bicycle or a bus or any other public mode of conveyance. His is certainly not an essential service by any means.  There are many other types of Government inspectors whose work is not an essential service <Col N="2157" /> at the present time.  Representations have already been made to the Minister, that, in the case of people who have out-farms, and must visit those out-farms in order to supervise the work, the use of a motor bicycle or an autocycle would be very essential if the food production on those farms is to be properly and efficiently carried out. Such a case will not be considered by the Minister in any shape or form. That is what I resent more than anything else, that the Minister is still sticking to certain classes and certain categories, and under no consideration whatever is he prepared to depart from them.</P>
      <P>The amount of petrol available in the country at the present time is so very small that it should be the Minister's concern to use it in the best interests of the community as a whole.  I am not making a case for myself; I am not making a case for any particular individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I never made such an accusation against the Minister or anybody else.  I am simply urging that, in a case like this, you must deal with individuals, when individuals are looked upon as giving essential service.  With the limited amount of petrol available, you cannot put people into definite categories, and say that they all belong to the same class.  In the case of doctors, all of whom have been placed in one category, there is a wide variation in the volume of work that must be done by those men.  Similarly, with regard to clergymen, the Minister knows that the transport problems of a clergyman living in the city or in a big town are very different from those of a clergyman in a rural parish say in West <Col N="2158" /> Kerry or somewhere like that.  The Minister is not prepared to make any differentiation there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told the House that the total saving effected by putting all cars off the roads would be 1,500,000 gallons.  He has been asked to explain where the petrol came from that reached the black market.  There was a big volume of petrol offered on the black market and it must have come from people who did not require it, people who got too much of it, or who, by false representations to the Department, secured a supply.  It is in such a set of circumstances that the Minister persists in the distribution of petrol on a class basis.  I think such a system is most unfair and it creates a good deal of hardship.  The Minister should consider individual cases outside the categories he has mentioned, cases where petrol is of vital importance, cases of men who have to do essential work, who have to supervise food production, who have to travel to farms ten or 15 miles away and possibly transport working men there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that at no time has the Minister shown any great sympathy for the agriculturist and his problems. Possibly because the Minister is a city man he does not appreciate the problems that the farming community have to contend with.  They have to tackle those problems, they have to surmount problems that seem almost insurmountable.  I suggest to him that although it is important that petrol would be retained for defence purposes, for the L.D.F. and the Red Cross, the most important service, the one we must preserve at all costs, is that concerned with the production of food.  In the neighbouring country the people who are engaged in food production are not overlooked, even though there are limited petrol <Col N="2159" /> supplies.  Where a man can make a case for a supply, his case is fully examined, and I cannot see why the Minister should shut the door in the faces of the people here and say that no matter what hardship exists he will not examine any case.  Will the Minister consider the plight of the type of man I have in mind, the man who owns four, five or six threshing sets and who is anxious to operate them over a big area?  These sets need constant attention.  It is essential that these machines should be carefully supervised.  Then you have the case of the man with three or four tractors, the man who is operating them for ploughing and general cultivation work.  How can he serve these tractors or ensure that they are worked efficiently in the national interest unless he has an adequate supply of petrol?</P>
    <P>His case is ignored; apparently the Minister is not prepared to give it any attention.  He has not consulted the House and I doubt if he has consulted any Deputies of his Party or any man who has a practical knowledge of these things.  That is where I feel aggrieved about this matter.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties, but I do not think he is making things any easier by the attitude he has adopted.  He submits certain proposals here and he persists in sticking to them and refuses to listen to what practical men have to say.  None of us wants to be unreasonable. We realise that people cannot get petrol if it is not there, but we suggest that better use should be made of what is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister in so far as, with his usual <Col N="2160" /> debating agility, he made a very strong, vigorous and excellent reply in the main to a case that was never put up.  I listened to the Minister a few nights ago taunting Deputies of the Labour Party with not even being clever in their misrepresentations. That is a charge that can never be levelled against the Minister.  His misrepresentations have the brand of cuteness and cleverness.  The Minister hung the greater part of his speech around a misrepresentation of my statement.</P>
      <P>He started off jauntily to reply to an application by Deputy O'Higgins for more petrol for doctors as a class, for more petrol for county medical officers of health.  Deputy O'Higgins was very careful not to make one or other demand. He merely sought information. He opened his statement by saying that he did not know what the petrol situation was, that he had no information from the Minister, but from outside he heard there was as much petrol coming into the country this year as came in last year, and he regretted the fact that the Minister published his Order without taking Parliament into his confidence, without giving them any picture of the situation, and he regretted the tendency to do this kind of business by regulation rather than by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister came into the House this evening, having received notice of the motion, and having arranged not only the day but almost the exact minute the motion would be taken, to tell the House that he did not know how the estimated or available amount of petrol was going to be divided.  There is no excuse for that kind of laziness.  The case I put up to the Minister, in the main was this, that people who were privileged to use petrol, whatever that amount of petrol was, great or small, should be encouraged in any device they made use of to extend the use of that petrol and make it go further.  The Minister's answer to that was that if one doctor <Col N="2161" /> had a Chrysler and a Ford 8, and another doctor had a Ford 8 and a motor-bicycle, by drawing petrol for the big vehicle and using it in the little vehicle they would be in a position of advantage over their neighbours in so far as they would be able to attend to more suffering human beings.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out to the Minister that, if they got only one allowance on one vehicle, and that calculated on a mathematical basis, everyone of them would utilise the heavier and more luxurious vehicle, the one it is more comfortable to ride in; and that, by the Minister's rigidity on that point, he was not saving one wine-glassful of petrol per annum, but was ensuring that less work would be done for the petrol available.  I think that was a perfectly reasonable request to make to the Minister, particularly dealing with professions such as clergy and doctors and the third profession which attends to the diseases and sufferings in the animal life of the country.  The only result of granting the application made would be a gallon of petrol in fine weather would do 100 miles of work instead of 30, and would bring relief to three times as many suffering humans or animals, or spiritual aid to three times as many people in danger of death.</P>
      <P>The only answer to that is to classify members of those professions as if they were engaged in cut-throat business, one trying to get an advantage over the other.  Let the Minister go to those engaged in those professions&mdash;in the veterinary business, the medical profession, clergymen and nurses&mdash;and he will find that that spirit is practically nonexistent. Sixty per cent. of the work done by any of them is done for nothing per year.  That is the spirit on which those professions were founded, and that is the tradition around every one of them.  For any man to lay it down from a Ministerial bench that they cannot use a light vehicle in fine weather because they would do more work in relation to those professions, is not nationally sound.  I leave that point for the Minister and his colleagues to turn over in their own minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not want to discuss this in Dáil Eireann; I wanted it settled outside. <Col N="2162" /> It is the kind of appeal that would be more likely to succeed without any strip of carpet between us, but definitely it is the type of appeal which should be listened to.  In the case of the man with the Chrysler and the man with the Ford car, there may be a stamp of wealth which may give one man a slight professional advantage over the other.  Wealth always does that, and the man with wealth, when he exhausts his monthly supply of petrol, can quite easily hire vehicles and thereby have an advantage over the other.  I would urge the Minister that his line in this crisis should be to encourage every user of petrol, no matter what cost or hardship to themselves, to use whatever type of vehicle will make each gallon do five times the amount of work for those professions. That would seem to be a headline for the Department of Supplies. There is no suggestion made, nor was there one made, that a person should get petrol for both vehicles but only for whatever vehicle he has been accustomed to get it for.  If, in addition, a person buys a motor cycle or something of that kind during the fine weather, to extend the field or utility of the petrol, I would imagine he is doing the type of work that suits the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>I did not ask for more petrol for anybody&mdash;either doctors or nurses. What I did say was that nurses whose contract and whose responsibility it was to visit the sick in their homes&mdash; those nurses are few in number: about two in each county&mdash;and those people who follow up the defective cases in the schools, people whose duty it is to visit tuberculous people in their homes, should not find it made illegal for them to use the road.  Since the 1st May, it has been illegal for public health nurses to use the public roads in a motor vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, to use their own cars.  Surely the Minister will be reasonable.  People of their modest <Col N="2163" /> salaries cannot hire cars at 1/- a mile. The public boards and authorities operating under the Minister's Government will allow 3d. a mile.  These people are getting about £150-a-year salary and, by virtue of their appointments and as a condition of their appointments, they have purchased motor cars, have taxed and insured them, yet it is illegal for them to do their jobs.  In every county there are three or four such officers&mdash;the county sanitary inspector and two or three nurses&mdash;who are paid to visit the sick in their homes and not for any other duty.  At present they are drawing the salary and not allowed to do the work. That amounts to about £1,000 a year in every county.  If they are not allowed to do their jobs, they should be seconded from them and given some work they could do.  I believe it is a national mistake, no matter how scarce petrol is, that the conditions prevailing through lack of soap, hot water and fuel have meant a resultant increase in uncleanliness.  It breaks down all that structure that has been diligently but slowly built up, since the opening part of this century, merely in order to save, as the outside, putting them at the high rate of a doctor, 16 gallons of petrol per month.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the black market.  Is it not obvious and is it not common sense that there could be no black market in petrol, if some persons or classes were not getting considerably too much petrol?</P>

      <P>I agree.  When the Minister challenged me on that point I agreed that it was bogus hackney owners, turf drawers, lorry men, etc. Surely, if the Minister has machinery to investigate the movements of a priest, so that the car will not bring him back <Col N="2164" /> to his residence at night, there should be enough machinery available to expose all these bogus hackney and lorry owners in the past and present.  With a little co-operation between Government Departments and county council secretaries, it would have been possible, at any time in the past, to supply a list, in the counties, of cases of lorry owners and alleged hackney owners, which would at least bear looking in to.  The sergeant of the Civic Guard in any parish would be able to tell the Minister whether so many cars, which were getting petrol as hackney cars, were being used for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that, and it paid him very well to get them registered.  Whether it was subject to that certificate of the sergeant or not, there was certainly any amount of coupons on sale, they were more prevalent than postage stamps. People who had a job of work to do, reluctantly and against their will were driven in the past six months to purchasing those coupons.  In some cases, I must say they were obliged by being given the coupons.  The work done under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, or supposed to have been done, could not have gone on since last February but for the coupons given or purchased in that way.</P>
