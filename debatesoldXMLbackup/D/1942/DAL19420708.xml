    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state (a) the price of milk fixed by him for human consumption, giving particulars of seasonal and district variations; (a) the basis on which those prices were fixed, and whether cost of production was taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question the prices fixed by me have been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  The relevant Orders are:&mdash;(1) Milk (Retail Price) (Dublin Sale District) Order, 1942, which applies to the County Borough of Dublin, the Administrative County of Dublin and the Urban District of Bray; (2) Milk (Retail Price) (No.2) Order, 1942, which applies to all parts of the State with the exception of the County Borough of Dublin, the Administrative County of Dublin, the Urban District of Bray and the Administrative County of Louth; (3) Milk (Retail Price) (County Louth) (No. 2) Order, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, the Minister for Agriculture has fixed minimum prices to be paid to producers in the areas of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, and he has, I am sure, taken all the relevant facts into consideration in determining these prices.  The maximum retail prices fixed by me were fixed in relation to the minimum price to producers as fixed by the Minister for Agriculture; the scale of prices applicable in the <Col N="136" /> case of the Cork District Milk Board has been taken as applying to the rest of the State excluding the Dublin Sale District and the Administrative County of Louth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that milk brought into Dublin by the large wholesalers, for which the producer is paid 9½d. per gallon, is sold retail at 2½d. per pint (or 1/8 per gallon), or in bottles at 2/4 per gallon; and whether he will state further if he will take steps to eliminate the wasteful methods of distribution which involve this wide margin of difference between the producers' price and the retail price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of 9½d. per gallon referred to by the Deputy is the price payable to producers residing outside a 40-mile radius of Dublin, where delivery is taken by the whole-, saler either at the premises of the producer or at the nearest agreed collecting station.</P>
      <P>The prices paid by wholesalers and retailers respectively for milk delivered in Dublin during the months May to July, inclusive, are 11½d. and 1/1 per gallon.  These prices form a fairer basis of comparison than the 9½d. referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The price of loose milk to consumers is 2½d. per pint when the purchaser takes delivery at the premises of the vendor.  The maximum price fixed for bottled milk when delivered to the purchaser otherwise than at the premises of the vendor is 3¼d. per pint (2/2 per gallon).</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the margin allowed to wholesale and retail vendors of milk in the Dublin area is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the consumption of milk in Dublin is as low as a half pint per person, and does he realise that the drink more milk campaign would be helped by the provision of milk at cheaper rates?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to me to be an entirely separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the desirability of eliminating wasteful methods of distribution by making the Dublin District Milk Board the sole distributors of milk in the Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if any substantial difference in the retail price of milk would result from the elimination of what the Deputy describes as &ldquo;wasteful methods of distribution.&rdquo;  It is true that, by altering the system of distribution, we could put a large number of people out of employment, but I doubt if the result, in the price of milk, would be commensurate with the disemployment that would be caused.  So far as the margin between the wholesale and retail price at present fixed is concerned, the vendors in the city have been agitating continuously in support of their contention that it is entirely inadequate to cover their expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say on what ground the difference between the price paid to the producer for his milk and the price paid for it by consumers is justified?  Can he give the House details which can justify it, or say what is the justification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification is that one must allow reasonable expenses to the distributors of milk.  These expenses have been calculated and an allowance has to be made for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if he has ever investigated why the cost of the distribution of milk in the City of Dublin was increased, and why the distribution of milk in the City of Dublin was concentrated in the hands of the big distributors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a large quantity of milk sent into the City of Cork, because it cannot be sold at 1/8 per gallon, is sold to the college at 7d. per gallon?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Flour Quota for Belturbet Electoral Area.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state what is the population of that portion of West Cavan known as Belturbet Electoral Area, and what is the weekly quota of flour made available for distribution in that area; and whether, with a view to an equitable distribution, he will cause inquiries to be made through the Gárda Síochána as regards the distribution to individual traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The population of the District Electoral Division of Belturbet (Belturbet Urban District) is 1,341, according to the Census of Population, 1936.  At present the normal deliveries of flour to shopkeepers generally represent 90 per cent. of their average purchases in 1940.  As a result of a special investigation carried out recently in Belturbet area, special arrangements were made to release additional supplies of flour to traders.  I am not in a position to state what is the actual amount of flour available weekly for distribution in this area, and I do not consider it necessary to institute any further inquiries of a general nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is general complaint there, with good sound reasons, that a great many people cannot get 1 lb. of flour per person per week on the average, as it is not distributed equitably? If the Minister would act on the suggestion to have inquiries made through the Gárda Síochána in the different districts they would be able to advise the Department as to the position.  It is not the business of anybody else.  Other people cannot go <Col N="139" /> round to find out the particulars.  I think the Minister should take some steps in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the complaint, as I understand it, which the Deputy says is a good sound one, is that so much flour was smuggled into that area in the past that normal sales by shopkeepers do not represent the requirements of the district.  As I have informed the Deputy, an investigation of the circumstances was carried out in the area and an adjustment in the allocation has been made as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it equitably distributed? There are some people getting their share and perhaps more than their share, but are all the people getting it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will say whether supplies of kerosene will be made available for creameries in the coming season as they were last season; and whether Swanlinbar Creamery will be put on a similar footing with other creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowances of kerosene for use in creameries registered with my Department as industrial users of kerosene will be granted in relation to the supplies available for issue. Swanlinbar creamery is not so registered, but, if supplies are required by that creamery for industrial use, any application for registration will receive consideration on a similar footing to other creameries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the great inconvenience caused to the farmers of Lixnaw by the closing down of the Lixnaw Co-Operative Creamery Mill, which compels them to take their wheat and other cereals several miles away to be milled; if he will grant a permit to the society so as to enable them to have the mill reopened and thereby obviate much inconvenience and waste of valuable time and labour.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some inconvenience has been caused to local farmers by the closing of the Lixnaw Co-Operative Society's mill.  In view of the irregular practices carried on by the management of this mill and their general indifference to the law on the utilisation of wheat, I regret that I am unable at present to agree to the reopening of this mill.</P>

County councils have been requested to meet at a very early date to consider how far the existing polling places which have been appointed meet the reasonable requirements of the voters when voting and to appoint such further polling stations as they consider necesaary.

      <P>The quantity of highest grade milk delivered in Dublin is limited and would represent about 5 per cent. of the daily milk consumption in the city.  There is no scientific authority for concluding that the incidence of all forms of tuberculosis in Dublin is associated with the limited quantity of milk available for human consumption from tuberculin-tested herds.  The general provisions of the Milk and Dairies Act and Regulations are intended to secure a pure and wholesome milk supply for the community, and under the Act the steps necessary to compel the pasteurisation of all milk sold for human consumption in the city rest with the Corporation of Dublin in the first place.  At present the proportion of the milk supply to the city which is pasteurised is substantially as stated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The question appears to refer to the holding of Michael Brennan, Tromaun, Roscommon, the subject of receivable order No. 131/945.  In this case a six-day notice was issued in January 1942, for the December, 1941, instalment, and the amount in respect thereof not having been paid a warrant was issued to the county registrar on 19th June, 1942.  The appropriate costs (amounting to 5/-) became payable on the issue <Col N="146" /> of the warrant, which was in the name of Michael Brennan, as the land Commission had no information as to his decease.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the news bulletins is to give information in brief form and the time for the preparation and delivery of these is strictly limited.  The inclusion in the bulletins of the question and name of the Deputy does not add materially to the summarised information given in the reply. The news officer, under the supervision of the director, decides on the specific material to be included in the bulletins and on the form in which it is to be given and I have not interfered with this practice.  On very careful examination, I am convinced that any other practice would make the task for the reporter impossible.  Brevity and rapidity in the work is so essential that no other consideration must be allowed to interrupt or distract the summarising of the reports.</P>

      <Col N="150" /> The Minister has indicated that it is hoped to hold local elections some time around the middle of August.  The portion of the section I have quoted sets out &ldquo;every local authority&rdquo;.  I understand from certain remarks of the Minister last night, and a certain implication in the Chair ruling amendment No. 2 out of order, that there are some local bodies that are at the present time dissolved in respect of whom it is not intended to hold an election. Will the Minister indicate what are the local bodies that are not included in the words mentioned here&mdash;&ldquo;every local authority&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>On the 20th May last, in reply to a Parliamentary Question put by me, the Minister circulated a schedule which was printed in the Parliamentary.

I should like to know from the Minister in respect of the county councils of Tipperary (S.R.), Kilkenny, Laoighis, Waterford, Westmeath, Dublin and Clare, whether it is intended that an election will be held for those local bodies on the appointed day and, if not, will he say for which of these bodies it is not intended to hold an election, and what is the law or the regulation governing the matter that excludes these from the term &ldquo;every local authority&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Beegan raised a very important point here yesterday in connection with the polling day.  I think most of us who are acquainted with rural districts are quite satisfied that the 15th August would be definitely the most suitable polling day in so far as rural Ireland is concerned. I think the same thing applies to the towns and cities.  We are definitely going to have a very small poll.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.  It is a very busy time of the year.  Farmers would find it very difficult to leave their harvesting operations.  I fail to see why there should be any opposition to the fixing of the 15th August for polling day.  In most towns all over Ireland people work on holydays as they work on ordinary days and I do not see any objection to having polling on a holyday. <Col N="151" /> I wish the Minister would take these facts into consideration and decide on the 15th August as the polling date.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is very undesirable to have polling day during the month of August owing to the fact that it is a very busy season of the year.  It is possible, and very probable, that harvesting will be in active operation during the middle of August. I do not agree, however, that the 15th August should be fixed as polling day. I think it wholly undesirable to use Catholic holydays for that purpose.  The fact that work is carried on on those holydays in towns and cities does not justify extending the principle.  There is also this argument against it, that a very considerable amount of time would be required on that day for Divine Service and as the number of hours for polling is hardly sufficient, as has been pointed out already, it would make the matter more difficult. I suggest that the date should be fixed some time about the middle of October. By that time the main harvesting operations will be completed and I think that in every way the time would be more suitable.  In addition to the time which would be lost from harvesting operation on the actual polling day, it must be remembered that the majority of candidates going forward in these local elections will be farmers and agricultural workers and people who would be normally engaged in agricultural work.  In order to make the necessary arrangements for election purposes they would have to devote a certain amount of their time to election work, time which would be taken from their ordinary harvesting operations. That would be very undesirable.  Therefore, I suggest that some time in the middle of October would be the most suitable date for polling.</P>

Now, this is the 8th July, 1942.  More than 14 years ago, in June, 1928, the electorate of South Tipperary were called upon to elect a county council.  If the election is to be held in the middle of August, they are now being given five weeks. Surely it is important that they would be told now whether an election is going to be held.  I do not want to start a question and to hunt the Minister down, because he is going to refuse to have an election, say, in County Clare.

Is the Minister choosing a time when the rural community cannot devote any time to the local elections? Having waited for six years in the case of Dublin City and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and for eight years in the case of Ireland generally, could he not wait another couple of months and hold the elections in October when the harvest will in all probability be secure in the haggard?  I would strongly appeal to the Minister if he wants to consult the electorate, to give the electorate a chance of giving him an answer.  Otherwise they will not bother about the elections.  It will be the greatest farce that was ever known in this country if the elections are held before October.</P>

I can say that, on the whole, very satisfactory replies have been received.  I do not anticipate that local authorities, so far as the actual election requisites are concerned, will experience any difficulty.  There may be a certain amount of difficulty in providing additional polling places but I think that these difficulties would persist, even if we were to defer the elections to a later date.</P>

      <P>On the question of a suitable date, there will be a difference of opinion no matter what date is fixed, but if the Minister proposes to hold the elections around the 15th August, I would like to suggest to him that the elections should be held on the 15th August.  That day is a Catholic holyday, and in rural areas people will be leaving their homes in the ordinary course to go to Mass.  I would suggest that that is an opportune time to allow them to record their votes.  I know there may be objections to holding elections on that day but, taking it on the whole, I think you would be facilitating the rural community if that day is selected.  Owing to the lack of transport, the difficulty will be to induce the rural community to leave their homes and to go out to record their votes.  If anyone has a grievance about the holding of elections this year, it is the people who live in the rural areas.  The people in the towns have no grievance <Col N="158" /> whatever, because they do not need transport.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If they cannot walk across the street they should not be allowed, even in normal times, to have transport. It is the people who live four or five miles away from polling booths who have a grievance in this case.  If the incoming county councils are not to be representative of the urban communities alone, every facility should be given to rural communities to record their votes on that day.  That is why I would suggest that the 15th August, if at all possible, should be selected as the polling day.  It is a suitable date and, as I have already said, people in rural areas will be leaving their homes on that day.  Everywhere there is a church, a polling booth should be provided in which these people could record their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he had communicated with the county councils asking them to fix additional polling booths, if they considered them necessary, to facilitate rural dwellers.  That is most important, and I hope the returning officers in each county will not put any obstacle in the way of county councils in providing these additional polling booths.  I am somewhat afraid that if the Minister has not advised his officers to facilitate the local councils and the local people by providing additional booths, these officers may possibly say that they have not ballot boxes, or that they would have great difficulty at this late stage in discovering suitable rooms or other requisites in areas where people have to travel five or six miles to get to a booth.  There should be additional polling booths in these areas to facilitate people who would other wise have to travel long distances to record their votes.  I hope the Minister has advised his returning officers to do all they possibly can to provide these additional booths.  Again, I want to ask the Minister not to pass lightly over the suggestion to fix August 15th as the polling date.  I do not agree with Deputy Belton that the period around the 15th <Col N="159" /> August is the busiest time of the year. The date between the 1st and the 15th August is one of the slackest periods farmers will have between now and the 1st November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will probably be the slackest period that farmers will have. A small amount of corn will be ripe between the 8th or 10th and 15th August.  After 15th August up to 1st November is the farmers' busiest period of the year.  There is not one week between 15th August and 1st November that could be called a slack period.  Whenever the elections are held, I hope it will not be during that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of a suitable date, I know that the Minister will find it impossible to please everybody, but if he fixes 15th August he may find himself in the position that the Church will not approve of it.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Davin that, at any period of the year, the agricultural community will say they are busy.  I think they might find themselves just as busy in October with the potato harvest or something else.  The month of August, however, has this definite advantage, that the people can make use of the long evenings. I think the Minister should fix a date in August, and make use of the long evenings by extending the time to 10 o'clock, so that the country people can record their votes after working hours.  If they work up to 6 o'clock, there would then be four hours during which they could record their votes, and that is enough for anyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer again to the point I raised yesterday about the difficulty which I am absolutely certain will be encountered by urban voters through having to vote for county councillors and urban councillors on the one day.  I suggest that special care should be taken by the Minister to see that his returning officers in the country make the necessary <Col N="160" /> arrangements to provide the people with an opportunity of recording their votes.  I remember distinctly that at the last election in my native town&mdash;the register in Wexford is only 4,000&mdash;the people found great difficulty on account of the two ballot papers, one for the county council and one for the urban council.  Coming up to the time when the booths were to close, the people had to go away because they were queued up outside and could not get in.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that the hour should be extended. We are permitted, I understand, to have an extra hour, if application is made, but there should be a still further extension in order to ensure that the people will have an opportunity of voting.  In my opinion, it will be difficult to get them to vote at all in this case, and perhaps 15th August, the date mentioned by Deputy Allen and others, would be a suitable day to have the election, as it might be more convenient for the people.  I would ask the Minister again to revert to that question of holding the urban and county council elections on the one day.  In my opinion that would create difficulties, and therefore the hour ought to be extended.  I think the Minister suggested yesterday that there should be extra polling places, but I doubt it the boxes are available. I should like again to impress on the Minister that the holding of the two elections on the one day will create an amount of confusion, and I should like him to give the matter special attention.</P>

After their day's work on the bog, they are fairly tired&mdash;their journey alone is sufficient to tire them&mdash;and no matter what facilities you give them it would be fairly difficult to get them to take the trouble of recording their votes at all.  If it should happen that only 15 per cent. of them voted, or even if 25 or 30 per cent. of them did so, it would be just as well not to hold the elections at all, because the result of such an election could not be considered as representing the views of the people.</P>

      <P>I cannot see the reason for holding the elections on 15th August.  We have nine Catholic holidays in the year.  Reference has been made here to the number of people who will vote.  I know that in the West of Ireland and in many other places there are &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; held on that day, and big numbers of people congregate from the different parishes. In one place in the West of Ireland, Knock, 15th August is a very big day; a number of people who would ordinarily be recording their votes in other <Col N="162" /> parts of the country will be doing the pilgrimage on that day.  The same thing applies in my own town.  A number of business people there will be doing the pilgrimage.  In my own parish there are four electoral divisions, one in Loughrea, two in Galway and one in Tuam.  If some of the people from those areas were doing the pilgrimage to Knock, I do not know whether they would have an opportunity of recording their votes.  It has been suggested that the hour should be extended to 10 o'clock, in order to give the people a further opportunity.  I know that a by-election was held on 29th June, but it is also true that we had general elections held during very busy periods; we had them in June and in September, and in some places up to 60 per cent. of the people recorded their votes.</P>

      <P>I thought we had given sufficient reason why this election should not be held in August, but several Deputies have suggested that October is as busy a month as August. I do not think any farmer will agree with that.  The main harvesting operations will be completed in September. A few farmers in backward districts may have a little corn or hay to get in. But in August it is altogether different. Every day counts.  It would be an extraordinary thing&mdash;having regard to the need for saving our grain harvest and getting every ounce of grain that can be got from the land&mdash;if we had to interrupt the harvesting operations for the purpose of holding an election in August.  In addition, I think it would be a great insult to religion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state fully the position of Howth and not have the people there confused?  Will they have separate polling booths? Will they get separate representation or are they merely thrown in with the ordinary voters of the City of Dublin &mdash;with the electors of Dollymount, Clontarf, North Strand, The Docks, and all around there?  I hold that they are entitled to special representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has already been dealt with by Act of the Oireachtas.  I dealt with it yesterday in my reply to Deputy Fogarty.  The position is that Howth is being merged in the city and there is no provision for special representation.  Henceforward, Howth will be part of the City of Dublin and the people there will vote as residents and electors of the City of Dublin in whatever happens to be the electoral area appropriate to them.  That was decided by the Dáil and, for that decision, Deputy Byrne must accept responsibility, with every other member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do wish that we had not had the parade of piety we have had from Deputy Cogan, with the implication that some Deputies would insult religion.  Every Catholic in the House is as concerned as he is that nothing should be done which would be wanting in respect or in deference to the religion which we all hold sacred but which we do not make a parade of in hypocritical fashion, as he has done, holding himself up to the nation as a Pharisee.  The choice of public representatives is a very high civic obligation and it ought to be treated as such.  Otherwise, we shall not get the type of representative which the country in the present emergency requires.  You can be disrespectful to rightful authority by casting reflection upon the seriousness of these elections or by implying that the person who does cast his vote on that day <Col N="164" /> is performing a mere, temporal duty. He has a moral obligation as well, and, While I shall not draw a line as between one obligation and the other, I, certainly, do not think that any statement made by a Deputy should leave our people under the impression that they are doing anything unworthy, or anything contrary to public morality, or insulting to religion by participating in the elections.</P>
    <P>As to the date of the elections, opinions will differ.  In one part of the country we are told, on the one hand, that one date is suitable and in another part we are told, on the other hand, that that is not a suitable date, that a more remote date should be chosen.  In coming to a decision, a multitude of considerations have to be borne in mind&mdash;difficulties in regard to the provision of artificial light, suitability of the weather from the point of view of voters who may have to travel long distances without adequate transport, the fact that, having come to a decision to hold the elections, we ought to hold them as early as possible and not allow months to elapse in which, perhaps, bitterness and bad feeling will be engendered.  If the thing has to be done, it is better it should be done quickly.  It is, I think, in the national interest&mdash;with one or two exceptions, every Deputy is convinced that it is in the national interest&mdash;that the elections should be held.  That is the answer to Deputies, like Deputy Byrne, who say that nobody wants an election.  In the sense that most people in the county would like to avoid the trouble and inconvenience of an election, these Deputies may be right in their assertion.  But I believe that the people of the country want to feel that, if this emergency becomes more acute and if our local conditions become more difficult, there will be on the local authorities men able to discharge the responsibilities which will, inevitably, fall upon them. I think that the people of the country will welcome the opportunity to put fresh blood into the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that, in this House, which is composed of the elected representatives of the people <Col N="165" /> and which does, in fact, derive its authority from the people, there should be opposition to the holding of elections, that members elected to the corporation, or to this House, should seem to think they should continue to hold their seats in perpetuity. That is not the principle on which this State has been built nor is it the principle on which our local affairs are administered.  It is an essential duty that we should give to the people, from time to time, as ordained by law, the right to say whether or not they are satisfied with their representatives or whether they desire to change them. Once we come to adopt as a guiding principle that elections must not be held because they cause a little trouble or inconvenience, that moment the whole structure of the State will begin to decay.  It does not matter whether it is Deputy Byrne or some other Deputy who wishes to deprive the people of their right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have addressed a circular to local authorities, of which I will read the last paragraph to the House, in order to show the steps that have been taken to obviate, so far as we can, the difficulties under which the public are suffering, having regard to the fact that transport facilities are exceedingly limited.  The concluding paragraph is in the following form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;County councils are requested to meet at a very early date to consider how far the existing scheme of polling places meets the reasonable requirements of the electors, having regard to the shortage of transport; and to appoint such further polling places as they may consider necessary. Schools generally should be appointed, unless there is a courthouse or similar building already appointed.  The existing scheme of polling places should be recast, where necessary, and any minor adjustments made, so as to secure that the same polling place will not be used for the polling in two different county electoral areas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say also that, so far as we can and so far as it is necessary to enjoin it on the local authorities, we will see that every possible facility is afforded to those who may intend to vote.  I suppose this is the only opportunity I will have, on this section of the Bill to deal with some of the remarks made.  I deprecate very strongly the inculcation among the people of the idea that the poll for these elections <Col N="167" /> will not be representative.  I think we should try to induce everybody who possibly can come to the poll to come out and exercise the franchise on that day.  If we keep on saying that people will not vote, and that sort of thing, some people will get the idea that the elections are not serious and that they are not expected to vote.  That would be rather unfortunate.  It would be much better if we started with the idea that we want them to vote an so discharge the heavy responsibility which rests upon them in the present circumstances of the country.  If we say that men will be busy at the hay or bringing in corn, we will create the feeling in the minds of those people that those things are much more important than the elections and, therefore, that the elections can be neglected.  Undoubtedly, the bringing in of the harvest is a very important matter, but this is the only opportunity that the people, living in country districts in particular, will have, for perhaps three years, of selecting the men on whom will devolve the administration of any special emergency services which may have to be set up in the near future.  It is important, from the point of view of the people themselves, of their families and of their neighbours, that they should take pains to ensure that worthy people will be elected to the local bodies.  They can only ensure that if they cast their votes for those people who, in their judgment, are best able to discharge the responsibilities which may be imposed upon them.</P>

      <P>To deal first with the point raised by Deputy Mulcahy, I do not think there is any real conflict between what I said to-day and the view Deputy Allen has taken, because, while we use the word &ldquo;emergency,&rdquo; we are perhaps envisaging entirely different sets of circumstances.  No doubt Deputy Allen had in mind the fact that regional commissioners have been appointed throughout the country and were ready to take up office in the event of hostile action against this country requiring a very large decentralisation of authority.  I suppose it was to that extent he felt that, if the local authorities could not meet and function, the regional commissioners would carry on.  I take the view, and it as the wish of the Government, that if such a state of affairs were to arise, the local authorities, to the extent possible, should carry on and function as they functioned during the 1920-21 period.  At the same time, we have to consider a position in which perhaps sections of the country might be in enemy occupation and the local authorities would not be able to meet. There would have to be some person <Col N="172" /> to act as a sort of co-ordinating authority, not merely of the functions which would normally be fulfilled by the officers of local authorities, but of the duties which would be discharged by the officers of the central authority. That is the position in which these regional commissioners were.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, and from our hope that that situation will never arise, we are facing the position referred to by the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the course of the debates on his Estimates in which transport difficulties and difficulties in regard to supplies are going to become acute, and we may have to improvise machinery to be administered on the spot by people in whom the local communities have confidence. I cannot think of any persons more likely to attract that confidence than the members of the local authorities who would have to administer these special services, and, at the instance of the Government, to try to mitigate so far as they could all the difficulties and hardships which would arise by reason of the fact that supplies were falling, and that transport was breaking down and to deal with the other problems which, in all the ways in which we can imagine and which are perhaps too difficult to enumerate, will be occasioned by such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Allen and Deputy Brennan, the position is that, as the law stands, once these local authorities have been elected, they will carry on until the appointed day fixed by the Minister. The appointed day will be, we hope, 1st October, and it may be necessary to reconstitute the boards of health even for a temporary period of six weeks.  I should say this, however, that if it is found possible to bring the Act of 1941 into operation before 1st October, we shall bring it into operation. But that will create certain difficulties for us and might create some difficulties for the new local authorities because of the fact that the new administration would trench upon the first half of the financial year.  We were rather anxious, from the point of view of the preparation of accounts, <Col N="173" /> that one half-year should be completed under the old system and that the new system should begin with a new half-year; but, if we can get the county managers appointed in time&mdash;and the Local Appointments Commissioners have been requested to take steps in regard to that matter&mdash;and can get the other arrangements made, even before 1st October, notwithstanding a certain amount of inconvenience which it would cause, we may bring the County Management Act into operation before the end of September.</P>

      <P>On Section 6, Sir. The words used in the section are: &ldquo;For the purpose of removing doubts&rdquo;, and I should like to have some information as to what is the intention of this section.  In the original Act&mdash;that is, the Emergency Powers Act, 1939&mdash; certain powers are given in Section 2 (1). One might almost say that they are omnibus powers, and then sub-section (2) of that section of the Act sets out a number of individual authorisations or special powers, covering some two or three pages of the Act. Now, as to what the doubts are, I do not think that was explained on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I took it that so far as the enumeration of certain specific powers is concerned it meant that it was placed beyond doubt that there was power to do those things and that there was reserved, in Section 1, other powers over and above those which were so set out. Perhaps we would hear what are the precise doubts that are being dispelled by this section, as it is strange that, having had the Act in operation for the best part of three years, same question, of which the House knows nothing, should have been raised, which prompted the insertion of this particular section.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken when he says that no explanation as to the doubts was given on the Second Reading.  I think I pointed out, in general terms, that the difficulty was that when you have general powers and, afterwards, specific powers &mdash;particularly if, in the enumeration of these specific powers, there are certain limitations&mdash;these specific powers would be interpreted as covering the particular thing in question, and that, to that extent, if they were in any way restricted, the restrictions that would be implied in that particular section would be implied in the general powers given.  For example, in paragraph (d) of Section 2 (2), of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, you have the phrase &ldquo;otherwise than in Irish currency&rdquo;. It might be suggested, for instance, that because you make that limitation there in regard to the specific matter mentioned in paragraph (d)&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the acquisition by or on behalf of the State of any currency other than Irish currency&rdquo;&mdash;Irish currency was excluded because you excluded it in the particular enumeration.  The court might hold that this matter was under consideration definitely in paragraph (d), that you exclude Irish currency and, therefore, that you are excluding it altogether from the power of the Minister or of the Government.  Now, that was not the intention.  Very often, you have these excluding paragraphs because you are enumerating a particular kind, and you just want to say that you are dealing with that particular kind and not with something else.  It is to remove doubts of that sort that this section is introduced.  That is a simple example that I have given, but in general there is that possibility, and the idea is to provide that such a possible interpretation of Section 2 (2) would not lead to a diminution of the generality of Section 2 (1).</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan.  I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; in line 18, page 3, to add the words <Col N="175" />&ldquo;nor operate to add a liability or to increase a penalty for such act on a person beyond the liabilities and the penalty prescribed at the date of the commission&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The first three amendments in the name of Deputy McGilligan seek to provide that a penalty shall not have retrospective effect.  Amendments 1, 4 and 10, possibly, have some points of difference, but that is not clear. Amendment No. 3, in the name of the Taoiseach, may be considered to meet the points raised in some or all of Deputy McGilligan's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure that that which was not an infringement of the law on an anterior date, should not be made so by this retrospective clause. The purpose is to ensure that the same safeguard would be inserted, in respect of a penalty, which would flow from declaring something retrospectively. For example, if it were decided to make the purchase of cigarettes subject to a certain penalty&mdash;let us say, a licence or something of that sort&mdash;and that an amendment of the law was made by means of an Emergency Powers Order, retrospectively imposing a licence fee in excess of the amount that was in force on a particular date, we are ensuring that there would be a safeguard where a thing of that sort would occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the various emergency Orders and other legislation of the State a sum of something like £20,000 has been collected out of licence fees and other things of that sort.  It is a considerable sum, and in view of the tendency in this Act to add noughts either to penalties or fines, some safeguard should be inserted which would ensure that there would be no danger of an extra liability being incurred by any citizen of the State by reason of the retrospective power that is taken in this section.  It is quite clear that in certain cases, if Orders are to be amended, in the interests of the public they should be amended retrospectively, as in the case mentioned on <Col N="176" /> Second Reading.  The supposition there was that an alteration took place in, say, the value of coupons for clothing. Suppose it were necessary to tender 40 coupons to-day for a suit, and that the Order requiring that number was amended to-morrow, reducing it to 20, it would be unfair, I think, to the person who tendered the 40 coupons yesterday not to make a return to him of 20.  There is a necessity for the amendment, I think, in a case like that. There does not appear to be anything in the section as it stands to prevent an increase in any liability which may be imposed by means of this retrospective provision.  It is for the purpose of dealing with such cases that the amendment was put down.</P>

      <P>We propose to meet the point which the Deputy has raised in amendment No. 3, which appears in my name.  Section 8 is the penalty section, and I think it would be more appropriate to bring in the matter of penalties there.  If the Deputy turns to 6A he will see that, as it will appear when the proposed insertion is made, it covers his point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It only covers portion of it, the portion which deals with the offence.  Let us assume for the moment that on the 5th day of January this year the licence for selling wheat was £5, and that on the 5th day of February an Order was issued amending that emergency Order by laying it down that the licence to be paid for dealing in wheat was £50, that, I suggest, is not covered.  What is covered is merely the offence, but the other matter, the liability which is more or less to be interpreted from the amended section, is not covered. One thing deals with something which is punishable, but the other thing&mdash; the liability&mdash;is not, I think, covered, and it is that point that I am concerned about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete lines 22 to 27, page 3, and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  by the deletion in sub-section (6) of the words &lsquo;and every person who not being an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident within the State commits or is deemed to have committed within the State an offence under this section&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion of the following two sub-sections after sub-section (6), that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(6)  (a) Every person who,&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section in the original Act dealing with offences, punishments and so on consisted of eight sub-sections.  This Section 8 seeks to amend that section in a number of ways.  It proposes to increase the penalties on summary conviction. The fine is not to exceed £500, and there is provision for otherwise increasing the penalties that may be imposed. The purpose of this amendment is to divide the liabilities into two classes, keeping the penalties which are to be imposed on Irish citizens to what was laid down in the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, as originally passed, but allowing for the change that is proposed in this amending Bill to apply to persons who are not Irish citizens, persons not ordinarily domiciled in this State.  The amendment marks this distinction: that a person coming in from outside to create a disturbance is regarded as being one almost outside the law.  As regards persons who are Irish citizens, our desire would be to give them at least this measure of confidence, that we would hesitate to believe that, as citizens of ours, they would engage in such activities.  We desire to mark that distinction between citizens and <Col N="178" /> non-citizens in our legislation.  When the original measure was introduced quite a number of changes were made in it before it finally emerged in the form in which it has been the law for some time.  So far as the new and additional penalties are concerned, they are reserved, by this amendment, for non-citizens, while the penalties provided in the original Act, which is in operation to-day, are reserved for Irish citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the penalties originally provided do not appear to have been sufficient to deal with our own citizens.  This measure has not been brought in to aim at one class of offender only.  It does not propose to distinguish between those who are ordinarily resident here and non-citizens. The difficulty, apparently, has been with our own citizens.  There have been a number of prosecutions and the penalties provided do not appear to have been sufficiently severe to indicate the magnitude of the offences committed.  This particular measure has not been designed to deal with a particular class of offender, namely, those who are not citizens.  If cases of the kind which the Deputy seems to have in mind occur, the justice has the power to distinguish between them. The penalties which are being provided are sufficiently high to enable a considerable amount of discretion to be exercised by the justices, even after this measure has been passed.  We assume that if there was a situation, such as that indicated by the Deputy, the justices would duly note it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the unfortunate part of it is that it is offences committed in the main by our own citizens which have given rise to the need for this.  I do not think, therefore, that we would gain anything by leaving it as it was in regard to our own citizens.  With regard to possible offences committed by people who are non-citizens, at the moment we shall have to leave that to the discretion of the justices in regard to the distance they will go beyond the minimum.  If, of course there was an indication that there was a definite campaign by non-citizens resident here, then we might have to move in the direction of further excess <Col N="179" /> penalties, in the direction the Deputy indicates, but I have no information that there is anything like that actually occurring at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be conceded that the penalties proposed are very heavy. The total punishment which a person might incur in this case is so heavy as almost to suggest that it is punishment for high treason.  We have probably two methods of dealing with offences, one, a fairly generous and easy form of punishment, and the other, which is very heavy, one which might almost cripple a person's finances and leave him and his family in penury for the rest of their lives. That type of penalty rankles in the mind of a man and in the minds of his family.  It is a very nice question as to how far persons conjure up these things in their minds before committing an offence.  It is thought by quite a number of people that a man's downfall is brought about, as we learn in the catechism, by little and little and, consequently, he may find it easy to arrive at a stage in which he commits some offence which the State considers merits very severe punishment.</P>
      <P>The real question at issue here is whether the penalty proposed is sufficient to deter people from committing an offence.  If the very heavy penalty proposed is sufficient to deter people, then it is possible that there would not be so much objection on the part of Deputies to passing this section.  But, human nature being what it is, we fear that it will not. There are quite a number of ways in which a person can become liable to this very heavy fine and you will then have a situation in which you are probably making a bad citizen out of an indifferent one, or perhaps even out of a good one.  To that extent it struck us that the penalty proposed was too heavy; that it was almost dangerous to have a penalty of that sort; and that unless the offences are so serious as to warrant very special penalties, we ought not to pass a section so penal in its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> There is another aspect of this question of making the penalty as heavy as it is.  Persons are inclined to take a risk that they will not be convicted owing to the enormous liability that would be incurred and owing to the operation of the law being so slow it is liable to come into contempt.  However, what is at issue here is whether the offences are so serious as to warrant these very heavy fines and other penalties that are involved.  I think the House is entitled to some sort of proof with regard to that.  Take one particular offence which I believe has grown up since the emergency, namely, smuggling. Whatever prompted the legislature to make that a major offence, it was done, and every person responsible for altering the legislation in this country has followed suit.  But it has not stopped it.  In fact, if one can believe the rumours in connection with it, it has almost added zest to the activities of those engaged in it.  When the penalties are enormous they say: &ldquo;If we can get through on three journeys, it is possible to bear the heaviest penalty that could be imposed and to make money.&rdquo;  Therefore, you have the speculative gambling spirit entering into the matter.  If the fines were smaller, it is possible that there would be less sympathy for the persons who would be caught and what is surrounded now by a certain amount of bravado would be regarded in quite a different manner.  Again we are faced with the problem: has it stopped it? Will this stop the breaking of the law? I fear it will not.  Unless we were satisfied that the offences are so serious as to warrant very heavy punishment, I think the House ought not to pass so penal a clause as this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much disturbed by the penalties outlined in this section.  I have in mind particularly what the Taoiseach said on the Second Reading when he referred to offences under the tillage regulations and was endeavouring to justify, particularly, the terms of this section which sets out penalties of a very severe order indeed and also sets out minimum <Col N="181" /> penalties.  After all, on reflection, why should we set out minimum penalties of that kind?  We, as a legislature, do not presume to be dictators.  We leave the matter to the judgment of the person who hears the case and who is justice appointed for the purpose. There are circumstances which we here cannot provide for and which we ought not to try to deal with in a general way.  All people are not possessed of the same amount of intelligence and in very many cases there are extenuating circumstances with regard to these tillage offences.  I know persons who have been prosecuted under the tillage regulations and in some cases very small fines have been inflicted. Perhaps the Taoiseach would not think they were commensurate with the gravity of the offence owing to the existence of the emergency.  But it is quite possible, if the Taoiseach knew the weak mentality of some of these people and the conditions under which they have to live, he would feel very differently about it.  If we provide a minimum penalty of £100 we will probably inflict very grave and very serious injustice on some people.  We are not probably the best persons to judge in the matter, although the Taoiseach and the House may feel that we are the best persons to decide that an emergency exists.  We certainly are not the best persons to judge on the merits of a particular case as it is presented in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that if the House indicated that it was not satisfied that some of the penalties imposed were commensurate with the gravity of the cases, there might be an improvement, if I might use that word, in that respect with regard to the penalties imposed.  But when we set down, as is now proposed, that the penalties shall not be less in some cases than £100, or not more than £500, we are doing something the reactions of which may be very serious for us all.  I feel that, in the majority of cases, if we insist on enforcing a penalty of that nature, we will be doing a very grave, a very serious, injustice to people.  I think it is quite sufficient for us to make it known that there is not <Col N="182" /> general satisfaction at the penalties that are being imposed in some cases; but that we should fix a minimum penalty and insist on not less than a specified amount of £100 or not more than £500 or a term of imprisonment of not less than six months, without knowing the circumstances of the various cases to which those penalties are to apply, would be inflicting a very serious injustice upon some people.  It is quite possible that certain individuals would be getting off lightly&mdash;I am not disputing that&mdash;but even one instance of a very grave injustice to people who did not deserve it is something we ought not to be responsible for, if we can avoid it.  I am entirely with the Taoiseach that, so far as tillage prosecutions are concerned, they ought to be dealt with according to their gravity, but I am opposed to a fixed minimum penalty.  That is something we ought not to do, and I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw that particular portion of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure, from what the Deputy has said, that he has carefully read this Bill. We are not here laying down definite penalties of not less than £100.  We are merely envisaging a range of offences for which £100 might, in some instances, be a relatively small penalty.  We are saying that, by order, certain things may be done, and we are defining the limits of the Order, the extent to which it can go.  We are saying that a minimum penalty up to £100 may be prescribed in particular cases.  I do not see that we are laying down a penalty of £100.  We are merely indicating a range of offences in respect of which an Order may set out penalties.  There is nothing in this measure which says that there shall be a minimum penalty of £100 for any offence.</P>

      <P>It may.  You must give a certain latitude to the Minister and the Government in making an Order, in view of the variety of cases to be covered.  I agree with a good deal of what has been said with regard to penalties in general.  It is true that people will take risks.  What we have to do is to make the penalty sufficiently great that, if people are prepared to gamble, it will not be the gain side that they will have to look upon, but the other side.  There may be big gains made by doing certain things, but they will have to consider the other side as well.  What we have to do is to make them realise that the loss might be very much more of a certainty than the gain.  If there was a certainty of punishment, it would have a deterrent effect.  It is not possible to ensure that they will be caught.  What you have to do is to make the risk sufficiently high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said to the House when I was dealing with that on the last occasion that it is quite true that <Col N="185" /> the Minister has not all the material for forming a judgment that the justice would have.  This form of legislation is distasteful to the Government and distasteful to everybody, if we could avoid it, but the emergency is such that we feel we cannot do without it. I have a whole list of cases where the penalties were ridiculous in view of the offence that seemed to be committed, that is, <i>prima facie.</i>  Again, I am not the justice.  But, when you get a large number of these cases, the general feeling is that the justices do not appreciate the gravity of the situation. One of the difficulties we are in is that we have followed the British system in regard to our system of law generally and in regard to our courts, and so on, but there are parts that we have not adopted.</P>
      <P>One of the things, for instance, that we have not adopted is the practice of the British Home Office of sending around circulars, indicating certain general principles, not dealing with particular individuals, but indicating in regard to a particular type of offence and a particular piece of legislation what is the matter involved and what are the consequences from the community point of view.  We do not do that.  I would imagine that if we had that system, one of the first things we would have done when the Compulsory Tillage Order was made would be to issue a circular giving a general indication of the gravity of the crisis and the importance of growing sufficient food for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be pointed out how grave an offence it was to feed wheat to animals and the danger to the community in doing that, that it was anti-social in an emergency like this to do it and that, consequently, the offence should be regarded by the justices as a very serious one.  We did not do that and the result is that you have a great lack of uniformity between the attitude taken up by the various justices in different parts of the country.  One man who appreciates the situation is inclined to be severe, may even go to the point of being more severe than the Minister or the Department would be if acting as judge.  In <Col N="186" /> another case you have people who treat it lightly.  This legislation is brought in by reason of the fact that there was an accumulation of cases in which the justices seemed to regard offences in regard to this matter as if they were really trifling infringements of law, almost technical matters. Cases where people were let out under the Probation of Offenders Act, and so on, seemed to show want of appreciation on the part of the justice of the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>There was no other course left.  We postponed it; we hesitated about it; we put it back more than once, until finally the position was reached in which the Ministers said that they did not think that they would be able to get the regulations which they felt necessary to make the Orders effective unless we had this.  We are coming to the House in the very same spirit. To meet the Deputy's point of extremely difficult cases, there is the remedy of an appeal for mitigation to the Minister and that is the only way in which we can cover these exceptional, hard cases that may occur.  We agree that they may occur and, consequently, that some sort of machinery should be provided to deal with them.  That is the only machinery we can see.  However, the penalties here are not fixed in this Bill but there is power undoubtedly left to fix these. If you make the limits lower I am afraid you will put it out of the power of the Minister to make it sufficiently severe in a case where we probably would agree that the offence was of the type that the penalty should be as great as the Minister would make it. I am afraid, in view of the circumstances, that I cannot go any distance to meet the views for mitigation or lightening of these penalties.  I am afraid if we were to make them less, we would put it out of the Minister's power, even in a case where the House would be prepared to grant that power to the Minister, to take the necessary action.</P>

      <P>May I put this point to the Taoiseach: he may be misjudging some of the justices and their judgments? I remember one case and I <Col N="187" /> should like to put it to the Taoiseach to see what he would say to the decision in this case.  A man was prosecuted for non-compliance with the tillage regulations.  He is a small farmer. He was ill last year and he recovered. He had not very much money.  In the ordinary way he would be subject to a fine of between £10 and £20.  The district justice asked this man what he was prepared to do this year and the man said he was prepared to till his quota this year plus what he was short last year provided he was not fined anything, because if he were fined he would not be able to buy the seed.</P>

That man tilled three or four acres extra because of that and because he had the price of the seed.  Was that judgment good or bad for the community? I put that to the Taoiseach. The judgment of that particular district justice might be taken up in this House and paraded as a most idiotic, ill-considered judgment, whereas I think it was a good judgment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan has taken the regulation fence before we pass the preliminary fence in relation to quite a number of these.  We will come to that in its own time, but for the Deputy's information, I may tell him the Civil Service would not accept that explanation and anybody who knows it realises that what I am saying is quite true.  There are various offences set out in this particular piece of legislation.  We propose in connection with them to increase the fine to a fine not exceeding £500.  We propose later, on conviction on indictment, to make the person liable to a fine of £5,000 and at the discretion of the court to ten years penal servitude. That is a pretty stiff proposition.  A man would require to be guilty of a very serious offence in that case.  Let us take an example.  We will suppose that an Army officer took an aeroplane out of this country to one of the <Col N="188" /> belligerents.  Is that a type of case that would be regarded as a major offence under this legislation?  Presumably, that man would be dealt with by a courtmartial and presumably also those who were responsible for courtmartial would have in mind the gravity of the effence and would fix the penalty to meet the gravity of the offence.  I wonder would they fix a penalty of £5,000 and ten years penal servitude? I have the greatest possible doubt that they would do that.  In fact, I would go so far as to say they would not do it.  Very good.  What is the offence under this Bill which renders a person liable to a fine of £5,000 and ten years penal servitude?  We are laying down the law here for the courts.  I am not going to go into it now, but we are in essence taking away from the courts a discretion which they have so wisely exercised down through the ages.  The judges of the courts have earned the confidence and respect of the people because of their knowledge of humanity and their general acceptance of jurisprudence and because of the fact that a person who goes before them knows he is not there to be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that this legislation means persecution and destruction and I do not think that legislation such as that will ever earn respect or consideration from the people.  Amongst the series of offences for which I presume a person would be liable to heavy penalties is that of aiding, abetting or conspiring with another person to do certain things. Anybody who knows this country knows that sometimes quite a number of innocent people are often dragged unwittingly into cases of this sort and they may become liable, under this Bill, to a heavy penalty.  For that reason I say that we should mark a distinction in this legislation in the gravity of these cases.  I am prepared to give the Government these powers if they want to use them against persons who are not citizens of ours.  If outsiders come in here and take these risks, if they interfere with our laws during a time of emergency, any power the Government desires to deal with them I would willingly concede to them, but I hope, as regards our own <Col N="189" /> citizens, we shall temper justice with mercy.  I should very much prefer to see minor infringements of the law go unpunished than that even a very limited number of the people would be convicted by the courts, in circumstances which would make these convictions rankle in their minds and the minds of their families for long afterward, or that they should feel that they had been unjustly dealt with by the authorities.  As I said before, one peculiarity of this State and the neighbouring State is that the authorities regard any offence against the State as a mortal sin.  If a man robs me of £2&mdash;it is about as much as ever I have in my pocket&mdash;that is regarded as a venial offence.  But let him take 5/- from the State and he will probably get 12 or 18 months in jail.  I am very much less able to sustain a loss of £2 than the State is of 5/-.  There is, however, that sort of peculiarity, that there is a tendency to deify the State by this type of legislation.  I think that is unwise and it is not likely to instil in our people that respect and veneration for our laws which it should be our duty to foster in all our legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a very strange case in support of the fixing of a minimum penalty, when he stated that it was necessary to fix such penalties because we failed to follow the example of Great Britain in circularising justices in regard to the gravity of these offences.  The question naturally arises why should we have failed to circularise the justices in regard to these offences?  If the Taoiseach has to choose between two courses, surely the more humane and the more sensible would be to circularise the justices in regard to the seriousness of these offences rather than to tie their hands and to deprive them of any discretion.  I am only concerned with the cases in regard to compulsory tillage.  There will arise cases of aged people, perhaps of uneducated people, who may commit an offence, who are definitely guilty of a violation of the law and who could not escape being prosecuted on the plea the Taoiseach has mentioned that their violation of the law was justified.  At <Col N="190" /> the same time, the circumstances would be such that no justice would consider it desirable to impose upon them the maximum or minimum penalties which are prescribed here.  Justices are only human beings like everybody else, and if they are called upon to convict, if they feel that a conviction means putting an unfortunate person out of his home or putting his children out on the road, they will be inclined to err in the other direction and acquit the person prosecuted.  That is a consideration which should weigh with the Taoiseach.  I think that the plan which he has mentioned as being followed by the British is a very wise one and should be followed here.  In so far as maximum penalties are concerned, if they are not sufficient they should be increased to whatever extent is necessary in view of the nature of the offences.</P>

      <P>I think in these cases the Government should be very careful before providing for minimum penalties.  When the Oireachtas passes laws to impress upon everybody the seriousness of the situation, that should be done by providing heavy maximum penalties but the moment you decide to prescribe minimum penalties, all sorts of questions will arise.  You will have cases coming before district justices in which the minimum penalty that can be imposed will be so serious that it will mean that a poor farmer may be put out of production.  A case has arisen in my county at the moment in which a farmer, who owned a fair farm but who was ill for a considerable time and who had not much money, was called upon to till about 17 acres of land.  He went to his bank, or to the bank in which he thought he would get some money, but he could not get any.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He could not get any money from that bank.  He then applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan but, because he owed some money to the bank he would not get a loan from the corporation.  He then applied to the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="191" /> to get a loan from the county council but he found that before he could get that, he would have to get two solvent securities who, of course, would be called upon to pay if he defaulted.  While there may be many friendships in the country, it is very hard sometimes to get a security who must be a ratepayer of a certain valuation before he will be accepted by either the county council or the committee of agriculture.  In the end the poor man himself was obliged to take his spade in his hand.  He went out, himself and his family of six daughters&mdash;he had no sons&mdash;and they turned with their spades about four and a half acres.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That man worked from last November and he is working even yet, turning with his spade and doing the best that in him lay, but now he is summoned for failing to comply with the tillage regulations. That is an offence under this Act. Surely to goodness, when that man comes in and discloses his circumstances to the district justice, the district, justice should have discretionary power to say whether he honestly tried to comply with the law?  He has about five acres tilled, but that is immaterial. The facts that can be established before the court are that the man made the best effort that within him lay to comply with the law.  Of course, one might say that that farmer should have set that land, but, mind you, farmers in the country do not very much like people coming in on their farms.  There are a thousand and one reasons why they do not want them. He may be able to get a lot of people to take the land if he opened the gate, but for his own reasons he felt it was better that he should hold his own fort and do the best he could.  I think when the facts come before the district justice he should be able to say: &ldquo;Very well; what will you do next year?  Can you do so much better?&rdquo; In a case like this&mdash;mind you there are many similar cases throughout the country, and I am just taking this one <Col N="192" /> as a sample&mdash;the district justice should be allowed to say: &ldquo;Very well; I will fine you 10/- or even 2/6 on condition that you do so much tillage next year.&rdquo; That poor unfortunate man does not know the first thing about petitioning the Minister.  Perhaps he reads the <i>Longford Leader</i> or the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> once in the month if somebody else tells him there is something of importance in it.  I think that the minimum fine should be taken out, and the maximum put there.  What is the Taoiseach's point in having the minimum here?  The district justices have not realised the seriousness of the situation?  There is only one way for him to tell them that, and that is by putting in the maximum and impressing on them how serious it is.</P>

I know the Government regretted that, but because they had put themselves into a certain situation they could not do anything better about it.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the amendment which has been spoken to by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Brennan already.  By this amendment, it is hoped to effect two things; one, that the judgment of the Government may be made not in the heat and rancour of the moment, when they are filled with the importance of <Col N="195" /> the case from the State's standpoint, and with resentment that the law has been broken; in other words, that they will amend the law or make changes in the law at a time when there is no heat and no feeling that the State has been outraged.  The law will be laid down then in sober judgment, and will be fair to everybody.  That is the second part of the amendment.  The other part of the amendment is to ensure that the law will be at least six months' old prior to a prosecution under it.  It is not unfair.  It ought to be possible, with the experience that has been gained over the last three years, to settle those matters, so that first of all, the penalties will be there for everybody to see, and to realise what will be involved by breaking the law.  In the second place, I want to ensure that, under no circumstances, will a penalty be increased after the offence has been committed.  Let us assume that a man broke the law by using a motor car when he was not entitled to use it or by selling a suit for one coupon when he should have obtained 36.  The offence having been committed, I want to secure that the penalty will not be increased after its commission.  That is not unreasonable.</P>

There is no question of deifying the State; it is a question of trying to safeguard the community.  Departments cannot be expected to be able to make an Order with reference to some matter that may arise in six months and penalties cannot be arranged before the Order is made.

There are people being regularly prosecuted under Acts of Edward III.  Surely the penalty in respect of murder existed before even the great Queen Anne, who is looked upon as having died a very long time ago.  Six months is a long time when we consider that we have three years' experience of infringements under this legislation.  Directly an emergency of this sort was envisaged, those who used to be described as the &ldquo;law officers of the Crown&rdquo; immediately put their hands into a pigeon hole and took out an Act which, altered according to the changes that had taken place, would meet the situation.

      <P>Let us distinguish between making an Order and fixing the minimum penalty.  This clause is one which enables the Government to fix the penalty and to change the penalty&mdash;that is, to put in a minimum penalty of £100, if they like, in respect of an offence.  Take one case that we have been discussing here for a long time&mdash;the case of compulsory tillage. As the law stands, there were altogether some 540 persons alleged to be defaulters under the tillage Orders. I calculate that the exact proportion of that is three persons out of every 2,000 farmers in this country.  This particular legislation will be law in a month's time&mdash;that is, in the month of August.  I want to make sure that, in respect of next January or February, those people will not be liable to a fine of £100, because the Minister for Agriculture comes to the Government and, in a mad moment of political exaltation, tells them that, unless there is a fine of £100, he will not be able to keep control.  I want to make sure of that.  It is not unreasonable, having regard to the fact that only <Col N="199" /> three persons are alleged to be defaulters out of every 2,000 farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you cannot give six months' notice if the Order is being made for a specific purpose.  It is made because it is urgent and because acts in contravention of it can be offences the very moment it is made. Surely the penalty must be put into the Order and will have to be effective <Col N="201" /> when the Order becomes effective.  If the Deputy wants to make some exception to that, he will have to bring in an amendment on those lines.  The amendment he is introducing now is covered by this proposed amendment. It is completely impracticable to see six months ahead.  As far as the penalty is concerned, the amendment brought in states that the penalty must be stated at the time the offence is committed&mdash;in other words that you cannot go back, retrospectively, and change the particular penalty for an offence, after the offence has been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us read the amendment, in conjunction with the sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the offence is one in respect of which any Order, made by virtue of the next following sub-section, is in force at the time the offence is committed, the penalties provided by such Order....</P>
      <P>A man may not yet have committed an offence.  It may be that he will be charged next February, March or April with having committed an offence.  I want to make sure that an alteration will not be made in the penalty.  We are giving the Government extraordinary powers in this matter.  It is not usual to allow any Executive to regulate minimum penalties in respect of an offence.  It is the exception rather than the rule. It is a concession that this House is giving to the Government.  We are asking, in connection with that exception&mdash;and it is a remarkable exception which would not be given in circumstances other than those of an emergency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure, having regard to the trend in places on the Continent.  We are asking that six months' notice should be given of the penalty.  That is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is most unreasonable.  I cannot understand it <Col N="202" /> at all.  As far as I can see, we are either arguing completely at cross-purposes or something else is happening. I cannot see what the Deputy is hoping to obtain by this.  He is asking for six months and, to my mind, he is asking a complete impossibility. A number of Orders are made&mdash;not all of them tillage Orders&mdash;in which the offence begins to be committed at once and, therefore, the penalty must be stated in the Order, and must apply immediately.  You cannot anticipate six months ahead.  If you wanted a regulation in relation to a particular type of offence, it would have to be limited to that.</P>
      <P>This reminds me of an argument we had some time ago about two things, and it was settled finally by the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;, which happened to have been omitted from the draft.  Neither of us was able to understand the other.  I am afraid that there is complete want of understanding from the point of view of reading this. On the previous occasion, I was reading a document I held, and the Deputy was reading one which he held &mdash;apparently another draft.  In this case I am anxious to do everything possible. I assure the House I do not want this type of legislation, if it is possible to do without it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has asked me why we do not circularise district justices as was done in Britain.  I have been told of a case where it was done, and the justices resented it.  They said it was an impertinence, so to speak, to do anything of the kind.  It was an attempt to get some uniformity and proper understanding.  There will be another occasion on which we shall have to go into this whole question, but as I read this amendment, one point in it is that there should not be penalties different from the penalties in existence when the act was committed. I take it that that is covered.  If it is not, I promise the Deputy I shall look into it and assure myself, by my own reading of it, and by any expert advice I can get, that the position is as I have said I believe it to be.  With regard to the Deputy's suggestion about six months' notice, I think he is asking something which is quite impracticable, <Col N="203" /> and, with all the will in the world to endeavour to meet anything I can meet, I am not able to meet his point, because to attempt to do so would, I think, be contrary to common sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of this section deals with increasing the maximum penalty which may be incurred for breaches of the Emergency Powers Act.  We go on then to 6a, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In case the offence is one in respect of which any Order, made by virtue of the next following sub-section is in force, the penalties provided by such Order...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We can bring out an emergency Order to-morrow stating that a person who contravenes an emergency Order is liable to particular penalty, but, when we come to 6a, I say that the Government can exercise that power only six months before an offence under it&mdash; under that power and not under the other power&mdash;is committed.  There is a change there in the penalty.  It is a different thing from bringing in an Order and bringing in an Order with a penalty.  This fixes the minimum penalty which, in essence, is £100.  I am asking that in respect of that change&mdash;a very big and very important change&mdash;six months' notice of the penalty only shall be given.  It is a penalty in respect of which a district justice has no discretion.  A man is charged for not having tilled ten acres. He has tilled nine and a half acres and he must be fined £100.  I say that that man must get six months' notice that he will be liable to a minimum fine of £100.  Is that unreasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept everything the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies say about the importance of this, but I am entitled to look at what has happened over the last 12 months.  I find that three farmers out of 2,000 have been charged with breaches of the tillage Order.  No discretion whatever with regard to extenuating circumstances or reasons of any sort or kind will be permitted to <Col N="204" /> a district justice in dealing with a case of this type.  There is a minimum penalty likely to be imposed in this case&mdash;a penalty of £100&mdash;and I am asking for six months' notice of the liability incurred by a breach of the tillage Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has something like that in mind, why did he not put it down in some place where it would have reference to tillage? The Deputy is evidently aiming at something like this, that in the case of tillage Orders, just as prices are announced in advance, where possible &mdash;there are a number of cases where it is quite impossible&mdash;some time in November, after estimating what the position is likely to be, a quota should be fixed and anybody who does not meet that quota will be liable to a certain penalty, and that penalty will remain unchanged.  If the Deputy is aiming at that, I am quite willing to take it up with the Minister for Agriculture and to see how far it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I wanted from the very beginning.  I mentioned it often enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy gives that as an example, his amendment is altogether wider in scope. There is a certain time for sowing and so on, aud I suppose it would be practicable to give notice in September or October and to indicate a particular quota, although I do not know whether there would be sufficient stock taken of the amount of food available to enable the Minister for Agriculture to do it as early as that.  On a few occasions, we have had to change the tillage percentage. We fixed it at one time in the late autumn and had to change it in the spring because we found that the reserves were less than we expected.  With regard to meeting the Deputy on the tillage point, it is a different matter, because it is of peculiar character, but I still protest that his amendment does not set that out.  He is trying to get as to put into an Act of Parliament something which is quite impracticable, because, while it may be possible to anticipate in <Col N="205" /> regard to tillage, it is not possible to anticipate in the case of Orders in general, and this amendment would apply to Orders in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to ask the Minister for Agriculture if we could get some amendment to cover the point, so that he could give notice in that sense. One of the troubles is that he has to fix a date so that, if he has to enter on lands, it will still be possible to till, because the purpose of this section is not to punish anybody.  All these penalties would be avoided if people tried to work in accordance with the spirit in which they are prescribed, and tried to secure the safety of the community, but in those cases in which it is not being done, the Minister must be allowed a margin of time, so that if he thinks the community's need of food is so great that he cannot allow certain lands which ought to be tilled to remain untilled, he may carry out that tilling.  Deputy MacEoin spoke of hard cases, but I say that these hard cases will have to be met by the procedure I have indicated, that is, by way of appeal for mitigation to the Minister, but if everybody who finds it difficult, and in many cases it is difficult for farmers, to meet our tillage requirements takes that line, we shall not have for the community the bread required, and we ought to approach this whole matter from that point of view.  It is not a deification of the State but ordinary commonsense to try to get every member of the community to realise the seriousness of the situation and the necessity for everybody to do his part, and the farmers will have to do it.  In the case of other offences, other things have to be done.  Certain prices are fixed, and so on, and those prices have to be kept to, so as to safeguard the community from being unfairly treated.  In regard to the particular question of tillage, however, it does seem that in a case of that kind, where an Order was made, say, some time in the autumn which would cover the whole tillage requirements, you could not say that a particular farmer had not fulfilled these requirements up to some time in spring.  I think there is some date fixed&mdash;February is the month fixed at present, I think&mdash;as the date on which the Minister, if he is not <Col N="206" /> satisfied, may enter upon the lands. That matter, as I say, will require a little bit of careful examination, and I promise to give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conceding the point in regard to tillage, but why not consider this whole matter in general? The only thing I am concerned with here is the change in the penalty.  All I am asking is that that would be considered, and I am only putting it forward from the point of view of ensuring respect for the law.  For instance, if a person should come into court and be convicted there on a changed penalty&mdash;that penalty not having been in existence at the time of his offence&mdash;he would be entitled to say: &ldquo;That has been changed only in the last six weeks.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is covered; but why, then, should there not be at least some longer time than merely that date?  I do not want to bind it down to six months.  We only put down six months in order to draw attention to it.  I think that in the case of tillage; six months' notice ought to be given because people must make their dispositions, arrangements, and so on, and it might be that it would take the whole of that period for a man to get what he would require in the way of seeds, manures, and so forth.  I do say that the date before the offence was committed was too close.  I would not bind myself to six months, but I certainly say that it should be at least three or four months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate thing is that the amendment, as far as I can see, is not phrased in such a way as would meet the points that the Deputy, clearly, has in mind.  I take it that he wants that if an Order providing a penalty has been in existence for a certain time&mdash;say, that there was a certain penalty laid down in an Order for exceeding the price in selling tea&mdash; and that it is deemed desirable to <Col N="207" /> change that Order&mdash;it is the word &ldquo;change&rdquo; there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But each change of penalty would mean a new Order.  I take it, there are Orders in which there would be penalties which it would be possible to change without going into further detail, but there would be other cases where that would not be possible.  However, I shall go into the point with a view to seeing whether we cannot get some phrasing, that if there is a change there will be a certain interval before the change takes place: that is, when a new Order changing a penalty is made, the new Order will indicate that the penalty will come into effect after a certain date.  I can see, at the moment, that just as in the case of other evasions, some people might take advantage of that interval to do things which they would not do at all after the interval has passed.  However, I shall have a word with the Minister. I take it that in this case it is the Minister for Supplies who will be most affected and I will take the matter up with him in order to see whether the cases we envisage would permit of that.</P>

Where a person is liable to a very big penalty&mdash; and a penalty of £500 is big, no matter on whom it is imposed&mdash;and where the person concerned has had full advertence to the law, nobody has any great <Col N="209" /> consideration for the person in that case.  There is the second case, however, in which a person had no knowledge whatever of the danger that the was running and of the penalty under the law which he was incurring.  Then there is the third case, in which there is indifference.  The sum and substance of the whole thing amounts to this: Is the law that we are passing now likely to be generously accepted, or is it likely that there will be an attempt at general evasion?  Is it likely that we will effect the purpose that we have in mind, of getting the law respected, by leaving in those impositions?  Now, this is one of the cases in which the Government, &ldquo;whenever and as often as they think fit, by Order declare any of the following things,&rdquo; and so on. That is to say, they made it clear that the punishment to be awarded may be a fine of £500, together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine, not exceeding £10, for every day on which the offence is committed.  I have a natural objection to this continuing fine business.  It savours more of persecution than of prosecution, and I do not know that it is wise.</P>
    <P>I said on the previous amendments practically all that I have to say.  It would be highly desirable that we should get general acceptance of the law if it is passed.  In a country with the history of this country, even for the last 20 years, if not for any period prior to that, there has not been, if one might say so, competition between the different political Parties in the State to show their desire to get the law respected.  Now, there is general agreement upon this measure&mdash;not as regards its administration but as regards the necessity for having a code of this sort&mdash;and I think it was given a fairly generous measure of support from all parts of the House. We might conclude from that that an effort ought to be made to get the same measure of generosity extended towards any amendments of the law that may be involved.  I disagree absolutely with Section 8.  I dislike it because it is penal in every respect.  It gives too much power to the Government. In my view a Government ought not, even in a time of emergency, <Col N="210" /> seek the power to increase or vary penalties, and particularly the power to impose minimum penalties.  I think that the case that has been made for this amendment of the law is not a strong one.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the tillage phase of the emergency Orders.  The breaches that occurred have, to my mind, been negligible.  Let us consider what was involved there.  From 1927 to 1932 we had a period of political agitation of one sort or another in the country, one political Party in the State telling the farmers that there was no national liability on them in respect to the payment of the land annuities.  We had then the economic war, during which the whole economy of the agricultural population was upset.  Now, in a period of emergency, we tell the farmers that they must till 25 per cent. of their arable land.  Let us see how they, responded to that demand.  We find that only three out of 2,000 were liable to prosecution.  Surely that represented a very generous acceptance, on the part of the farmers, of their responsibilities. Our answer to them is to bring in a law which gives power to impose penal liabilities on them: penalties of £500 and a continuing fine of £10 a day.  I do not think it is advisable to hold such very heavy penalties over them, having regard to the very limited number of offenders that there have been..  On balance, I think that the amount of arable land tilled was higher than the 25 per cent. laid down in the Minister's Order.  If there had been less, there might be a case for the giving of those powers. Suppose, for instance, there had been a conspiracy amongst a section of our people to defeat the law, there might be a case for some of those penalties. Generally, I dislike penalties of the size outlined here.  Apart from an exceptional case in a particular county, I am of the opinion that any person engaged in agriculture who becomes liable to one of these penalties will be a broken man.  If those penalties are imposed in his case he will hardly survive them.  I do not think that we ought to pass a law which would create a situation of that sort for those engaged in agriculture.  I think that some reconsideration ought to be given to <Col N="211" /> those penalties in the light of all that has happened and of the knowledge that we have.  There may be extenuating circumstances in particular cases. If these cannot be specified, we do not want to have them paraded so that certain people might say: &ldquo;If we make a case we may get off.&rdquo;  Allowing for the special circumstances to which I have referred, going back over the last 20 years, I think that the response made in regard to tillage has been very good, and that it might be well for us if we were to take a nought each off every one of those penalties.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendments is to limit the enforcement of the minimum penalties set out in the Bill.  Personally, I am opposed to the principle of minimum penalties.  In these amendments an attempt is being made to mitigate what I would call an evil.  Most of the discussion has centred round the penalties proposed to be imposed on farmers for non-compliance with tillage Orders.  I am not quite sure that the object of the Bill generally is not directed against them I hope I am wrong in that, because I believe that, taking farmers generally, they are the most law-abiding section in the State.  The figures quoted by Deputy Cosgrave prove that, since only three farmers out of 2,000 were prosecuted for failure to obey the regulations. I think the figure given by the Minister for Agriculture was one in 600 or 700.  Either figure represents a very small percentage of the total.  Could the same be said of any other section of the community: that only three out of 2,000 failed to obey some particular law?  I am certain that minimum penalties are not necessary in regard to farmers. The figures quoted prove that, speaking generally, they discharged their duty under the tillage Orders very faithfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of delinquents was small. It may be that a good many of them were women who found it almost impossible to comply with the Orders. The fact that the district justices took that view proves my case, I think.  Our district justices are not unreliable administrators of the law.  They are an excellent body of men, and I believe <Col N="212" /> are as anxious as any Minister that the law should be upheld.  If, in the discharge of their duty, they find that there are extenuating circumstances in a particular case they ought be left a discretion and not forced to inflict penalties which they believe are not just.  So far as the farmers are concerned, and I am speaking here principally for the members of the farming community, I resent the fact that they are being treated as Public Enemy No. 1 in the matter of the breaking of regulations. I do not believe that of them, nor does anybody else.  In regard to these tillage Orders, if a farmer fails to comply with them his failure is almost certain to be detected. There is no chance of escape for him, because it will be obvious to everybody that he is not complying with the law. But, in regard to other sections of the community, they may break the law and still conceal the fact that they have done so.  They can do that far more easily than the farmer can in regard to his tillage.  Other classes in the community can not only break the law but can continue to break it without being detected.</P>
    <P>To get away from the farmers for a moment, and to come to the ordinary, commercial people, the Taoiseach last week read out a list of people who had been convicted for breaches of Orders in order to justify imposing minimum penalties.  I noticed that the great majority of the cases he quoted were cases where there was a very small breach of Orders; a case of a man selling tea at 3/8 per lb. instead of 3/4, or a man selling tea at 4/4 per lb. instead of 4/- when the price had been raised. Only in a very exceptional case was there a very severe breach of the regulations. Most of the cases he quoted were merely infinitesimal breaches of Orders.  Out of the whole list there were not more than two or three cases of grave breaches of Orders.  If we interfere with the discretion of the district justices in these cases, then we are administering the law in a harsher manner than I believe it is administered in any other country.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there have been more serious breaches of the Orders <Col N="213" /> than the Taoiseach read out.  I am convinced that the infringements of the Order with regard to tea are not confined to charging 4d. or 6d. or even 1/- over the fixed price.  But the majority of the cases which the Taoiseach quoted only referred to small breaches of Orders.  The real offenders have not been caught and never will be caught, and providing for a minimum penalty will not catch them because they are too clever.  The people who will be punished by these minimum penalties will be mostly those of whom I spoke, people who commit small infringements of the law and do not take any great trouble to conceal them.  But you will not catch the real malefactors by this process more than by any other. They will still go on diddling the Minister and everybody else and will never come before a district justice.  In cases which come before a district justice, I think the justice ought to have the discretion of deciding whether there were extenuating circumstances and of imposing a fine that will have some relation to the offence committed.</P>
    <P>I, certainly, am opposed to the principle of minimum penalties in cases of breaches of the tillage operations.  As I say, the offence is so obvious that it cannot go undetected, and the breaches of the regulations were so few that they only ranged from one in 600 to one in 2,000.  There were evidently some reasons why that small number did not comply with the regulations, and if the district justices, after hearing the evidence, which the Minister will not hear, in their discretion see fit to impose a very small fine in certain cases, I do not think we ought to interfere with their discretion in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we weaken the case for this amendment by dwelling unduly on one particular class of defendant.  The object of this amendment is to reduce the virulence of Section 8.  Section 8 implies that every district justice and every Circuit Court judge are in a conspiracy to defeat the purpose of Oireachtas Eireann.  Is that true or is it not?  There never yet was an executive in any country that did not from time to time come to the conclusion <Col N="214" /> that the judiciary were damn nuisances, that they were hindering and blocking the executive from giving effect to public policy and that something ought to be done to ginger them up.  The plain truth is that Section 8 derives from exactly the same mentality as induced Deputy Smith, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, to say on one occasion that it was high time we cleared some of the old &ldquo;cods&rdquo; off the bench that were on it on the occasion on which he was speaking, because the judges would not do what Deputy Smith thought they ought to do.  At that time the desire which inflamed his manly breast was that the judges should put all of us who were not in the Fianna Fáil Party in jail, and because they would not do it, he thought some of them ought to be got rid of.</P>
      <P>Now the Taoiseach feels that persons who infringe emergency Orders ought to be fined up to £500 as the minimum penalty fixed by Executive Order, or six months in jail at the discretion of the district justice.  That is a thoroughly rotten principle, and it is a thoroughly rotten principle for this reason: no matter how carefully legislation is framed in this House, cases of exceptional hardship will appear in court. If an Act of Parliament were proposed that women who murder infant children should be made amenable to the capital penalty, few persons would demur at such legislation.  If women want to go out and murder infants, it seems well to declare that they ought to pay the penalty for murder.  Such was the law. But it became so manifestly outrageous to enforce that law that in Great Britain they amended the law and introduced a special category of crime known, I think, as infanticide, for which a very much wider discretion was left to judges in inflicting penalties simply because judges declared that this habitual sentencing of women to death in circumstances which technically constituted murder was insufferable, because in certain circumstances it was perfectly manifest that they should not be sentenced to death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in a very much minor degree we are attempting to create the very <Col N="215" /> evil that the British Legislature was concerned to abate, because we are saying to the district justices: &ldquo;If a person is convicted of any offence which comes within Section 8, you must impose the minimum penalty whatever the attendant circumstances may be.&rdquo;  It is very typical of the bureaucratic and indeed of the urban mind to take up that position, because they cannot transfer themselves into the circumstances in which we who live in rural Ireland normally live.  You get a case brought before the court in which it is perfectly clear that in fact the land has not been tilled as it should have been.  But it emerges that the land is the property of a widow woman, that she has one son whom she is gallantly attempting to maintain before the neighbours is a normal boy, but who, in fact, is known by all the neighbours to be a half idiot.  The district justice and the State solicitor knowing the circumstances admit at once that this woman did not till the land and should have tilled it.  But everybody knows the reason it was not tilled, because the woman left it to this half-competent boy to get the work done that his father used to do and, of course, he did not get it done. According to this, that widow woman is to be fined £500.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that she can appeal to the Minister and the Minister can mitigate the penalty.  That is all very well.  The woman sentenced to death for infanticide in England always did appeal to the Home Secretary and the penalty was always mitigated.  But that does not save the unfortunate creature in court the intolerable suffering and apprehension that such a penalty hanging over her head occasions to her.  Take a respectable individual operating a little shop in the country.  The junior assistant, perhaps a lad of 14 or 15 years, or a little girl, sells a loaf of bread and charges 6d. for it instead of 5½d.  The shopkeeper is prosecuted.  He goes to court and admits at once that there was overcharging and he expresses his regret.  He explains that the boy, had stepped behind the counter only ten minutes before the customer arrived and he did not know the price of the <Col N="216" /> bread and merely took whatever coin was offered to him and threw it into the till.  The district justice, if he is satisfied with that explanation, will impose a nominal fine in order to mark that such overcharging cannot be sanctioned and must be penalised.  In the circumstances, a nominal fine will meet the case and will make clear that the district justice saw no vice or criminal tendency in the defendant. Under this section the district justice is obliged to fine the merchant £500, if that be the minimum, prescribed penalty.</P>
    <P>If you are going to set up a legal system in this country designed to do substantial justice among the various communities where judges function, let the judges function.  Let not the Executive intervene to take from the judges that measure of discretion which it was deemed expedient to give them when we established a judiciary.  If the judges are of such a character that they will not enforce the law, then they ought not to be judges and the proper constitutional measures ought to be taken to clear them out.  I know of nobody here who will say that the judges are corrupt or incompetent.  If they are, there is a way to deal with that.  The Government can get powers to remove them and put in their places men who will honestly and fearlessly do their duty.  But if our judges are honest and competent they understand the circumstances better than the Executive. They know how best to secure the proper observance of the law. They know the methods which will most effectively achieve that end.  Why not leave them the discretion they always have had?</P>
    <P>I am arguing that this amendment put forward by Deputy McGilligan is a <i>pis aller</i>, something a little less obnoxious than what appears in the section.  I want to impress one thing on the Taoiseach, and he is the kind of man who ought to understand because he is, perhaps, the least detached from the rural community of any of the Ministers.  He ought to realise the insufferable hardship involved in putting a shameful and onerous stigma on somebody who the judge is satisfied is guilty of no evil purpose&mdash;<Col N="217" /> he is merely being convicted of a technical offence.  The Taoiseach ought to know that saying to a country person: &ldquo;You can apply to the Minister for a remission of the penalty&rdquo;, is very poor compensation.  There is no use in talking of the collection of £500 from a small shopkeeper or farmer.  They have not got it.  They know the moment that sentence is imposed it can never be given effect to, because they cannot pay the fine.  It is no special compensation to them to say: &ldquo;You will never have to pay it.&rdquo;  They can tell you that themselves, because they will not be able to pay it.  But that does not materially mitigate their mental suffering.</P>
    <P>What is the measure of our problem? Against whom is this section being directed?  What crime in this country is being encouraged by the district justice by reason of inadequate penalties? Will the Taoiseach tell us?  Is there a plague abroad of land owners who are not tilling their land in accordance with the requirements of the statutory Orders?  If there is, I have not heard of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent their letting land on the 11 months' system.  This section does nothing to meet that.  Surely we are not going to allow ludicrous misrepresentations of this section?  If Deputy Victory does not know what is in the section, is it not time the Taoiseach told him?  It is suggested that this section is for the purpose of encouraging the farmers to till the best land on their holdings.  Deputy O Briain knows what this section is intended to carry out.  He knows that it is designed to get at what he describes as the very small minority.  But is it not &ldquo;daft&rdquo; to suspend the whole system of judicial operation in order to get after an evil <Col N="218" /> which all agree is microscopic, presents no serious problem, and shows no tendency to spread?</P>
      <P>If this House accepts in this measure the principle that minimum penalties may be prescribed for offences against emergency Orders, it is not the last we will hear of it.  This precedent will be quoted and used again and again. Any practising lawyer in this country will tell you that this principle will result in cruel hardship which will afflict not the grave offender, but the defenceless individual who has come technically within the reach of the law.  I am thinking of my neighbours in the country, of simple people and the kind of suffering that is occasioned to them by situations such as will arise under this section.  I am asking the Taoiseach to throw his mind back to these people who do not know where they are, people to whom being brought to court is in itself a great penalty, people who, when they hear they are fined £500, will be inconsolable, because that in their ears sounds a sentence of destruction.</P>
      <P>I strongly object to the section and I prefer the amendment.  I will vote for the amendment and against the section.  I warn the House that if it does not defeat the section it will be used hereafter for the purpose of introducing a similar principle into other legislation and, if that is firmly fixed in our system of law, then the independence of the judiciary has been very materially qualified, and qualified, not at the expense of the Government, but at the expense of the individual citizen whom the judges were originally appointed to protect.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to put himself in the place of <Col N="219" /> some of the farmers who did not comply with the Order.  There is 99½ per cent. of the tillage quota done in Westmeath, I am told by one of the inspectors, but I see an advertisement that four acres are to be set by the Government.  I would ask the Taoiseach to go down to the person concerned and investigate his case personally. If he does that, he will see the hardship that would be inflicted if the minimum fine fixed in this section were to be imposed.  I think this is a poor return to the farmers after all they have done in growing food for the people of the country.  I must say that were it not for the action of the district justice in Westmeath last year, the full amount of tillage would not be done. If the district justice had fined everybody that came before him last year £20 or £30 there would be no tillage carried out by these people.  He did a very wise thing, in my opinion.  He gave all the people that were brought before him a month or six weeks, after which they were to come back and if they had done the required amount of tillage in the meantime he would reconsider their case.  I am sure 40 or 50 cases went through the courts in that way last winter in Westmeath and in every case, when the person concerned came before the district justice again, the tillage had been carried out and in the majority of cases more than the quota had been carried out.  If a fine had been imposed for not doing the tillage in the beginning, none of those people would have done their tillage; they would have nothing to do it with. If a farmer of 20 or 30 acres were fined £20 or £30, he would be crippled and could not possibly do the quota.  The district justice in Westmeath in my opinion did much to get the tillage done and to encourage people who were not complying with the law to comply with it.  I suggest that that should be continued next year.  If a man is short in his tillage he should be given a month or two and if he does not carry it out in that time a fine could then be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fixing of a minimum fine of £500 is like holding a gun to the farmer's <Col N="220" /> head.  I do not think the farmers deserve that sort of treatment because, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, the farmers by the acts of this Government for the last ten or 15 years have been brought to very low water.  It reflects credit on them that in County Westmeath there is 99 per cent. of the tillage done and if the amount that has been done in addition to the quota were counted, the total would be well over 100 per cent.  I think the Government should reconsider very seriously that section.  No minimum fine should be fixed, but it should be left in the hands of the district justices and the judges.  They will deal with it in the right way and will get the work done. I would ask the Taoiseach to consider that and to accept the amendment.</P>

Deputy MacEoin cited a case here this evening which, on the face of it, looks like cruel hardship.  I would suggest that if the tillage inspector were sent for by some of those people who have difficulties about getting their tillage done, the tillage inspector could arrange for the setting of the land and give the owners some reasonable compensation.  There should be some way out for that class of person. We have not many such cases, but there are some.  I think everyone in the House realises the importance of growing food to-day.

The tillage inspector should be sent for and if he cannot satisfy the tillage inspector, the inspector should take over the land and have it tilled and pay the owner compensation. That would get over the difficulty. None of us, particularly those of us who are farmers, likes the idea of a compulsory minimum fine.  I would be inclined to say to the Government that they should consider this.  I was amazed when Deputy Dillon told us that we should take notice of what the judiciary is doing.  He criticised what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said on one occasion and then he came along and went further himself.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Bennett saying here that some of these farmers were too clever.  I agree with Deputy Bennett there.  It is the mean type that the whole trouble is about.  I would suggest that the fine should be reduced, if that is possible, but at the same time I would only reduce it on condition that the tillage inspector was sent for, that he investigated the whole case and, where necessary, that he would try to set the land and give some compensation for the land he took over.</P>

      <P>I am all in favour of the law being absolutely enforced and I am all in favour of nothing going forth from this House as said by anyone here which would in any way bring the law into disrepute.  One of the reasons why I would be against the innovation contained in this section is that I think the effect of it would be to bring the law into a certain amount of disrepute.  There came to my notice&mdash; not in my professional capacity&mdash;a certain prosecution.  A shopkeeper in a country town had in his employment a servant girl who happened to serve an inspector, or some person making inquiries, with a box of matches at, I think, a halfpenny above the regulation <Col N="222" /> price.  That constituted a breach of the law and constituted an offence. It was my view, on hearing about the case that, so far as the shopkeeper was concerned, particularly having regard to the early stage in the history of these newly created offences, that it was only a technical offence, but I recognised that somebody has got to carry the burden in order to advertise to the public what the law is.  A very competent district justice heard the case and he imposed a penalty of £10. The shopkeeper was entirely unaware of the sale.  The sale was through the instrumentality of the servant girl who came into the shop because somebody came into the shop at that moment and there was no one in the shop to serve. Obviously, it was implied that the shopkeeper had given her authority.</P>
      <P>I think any Deputy would agree with me that £10 was, under the circumstances, a severe penalty, but it may have been necessary in the general course of things to advertise the position of the law.  But what would be the position if the penalty were limited to at minimum penalty of £100 or £500 in the same circumstances?  It would break that particular shopkeeper. That is a very serious matter.  I think that this section is altogether too harsh.  It is introducing a novelty into the administration of justice that is entirely uncalled for and is offering a gratuitous insult to the bulk of the population of this country.</P>

I have told the Taoiseach of a particular case where there was a fine of £10.  I am a lawyer; there are other lawyers here; all of us here are in one way or another connected with legislation, and we find it impossible&mdash; at least I do&mdash;to follow day after day the Orders that are put out by the Government.  With the best will in the world, it is very hard to keep up-to-date with the various offences that <Col N="223" /> are created from day to day.  The general members of the public are undoubtedly unaware of what is an offence or what is not an offence.  You go to bed one night having done a particular act during that day, and you wake up in the morning and find that if you do the same act you will be guilty of an offence.  There is not a sufficient explanation of what the law is.  On numerous occasions there must be, and are, breaches of the law by undoubtedly innocent people.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Government are deliberately going to create offences or to frame penalties to fit these offences negligently or without due regard to all the circumstances of the case, but I do submit that the innovation introduced in this section leaves them open to do that.  I do not think that the circumstances of the case or a knowledge of what has been happening in the country justifies this section.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach objected to my use of the phrase &ldquo;a gratuitous insult&rdquo;.  I did not use that in any harsh sense, but it is a gratuitous insult to the bulk of the population to suggest that they have not obeyed the ordinary law or the law as reinforced in the particular Act with which we are dealing. It is now found necessary to tie the hands of the justices to such an extent that they must impose in certain circumstances a certain penalty.  That is the opinion we have of how laws are going to be interpreted and obeyed in the country, and I do not think it is a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold no brief for those who have been dabbling in the black market, or those who have been overcharging unfortunate people.  I want to see them brought to justice where possible, but I must say that I think that, if we pass this section, we shall bring the law into a certain amount of contempt because possibly there will be cases where the district justice, with a knowledge of all the facts before him, will be obliged to impose the minimum penalty and that will only lead to further evasions of the law.  It will bring the law into disrepute.  One can almost imagine what a justice will say <Col N="224" /> with the ruined head of a family before him.  He will say: &ldquo;I have no discretion.  That is what Parliament has decreed and I must accordingly impose this penalty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When it was found necessary to deal with infringements of the licensing laws in this country some years ago an innovation was introduced in a sense making it mandatory that a conviction should be recorded and that forfeiture of the licence should follow, with the result that for some time licences tended to disappear altogether.  At present there have to be three records of convictions before the licence is abolished.  That was a concession to the licensed trade which successfully endeavoured to get the law amended in that respect.  There must he three records of convictions now before the licence can disappear, but in many cases, if the minimum penalty proposition is adopted here, it is within the power of the Government to so frame the laws that any person can not only be wiped out of business as a result of the commission of a technical offence, but must, in fact, be wiped out of business.  We here are the persons who will be held responsible for that.  Surely to goodness, there is enough public spirit left in the country that the laws, harsh and all as they are at the present moment, difficult and complicated as they are to understand, will be obeyed by the people of the country without the necessity of resorting to such a section as this. What has happened during the past three years since September, 1939, to justify the harshness of this section? Surely we could frame this Bill in a different way?  It is not beyond the wit of the advisers of the Government to frame Bills in a different way to get hold of the real blackguards and the real delinquents without leaving this extraordinary power in the hands of the Government.  I do not wish the Government to assume, from that remark of mine, that I suggest, in any way, that they are going to misuse these powers.</P>

      <P>I am speaking entirely for myself.  I am not suggesting in any way that the Government will misuse these powers, but it is still a dangerous weapon to put in the hands of the Government and it is more or less a breach of trust in the people to give them these powers.  When the original Act was passed in September, 1939, I thought that it was not such a good thing to give the Government these powers.  I anticipated that they might be carelessly or improperly used.  That was the breach, that was the chink in the armour, so to speak. We handed up the right of making laws to the Government.  Now we are giving the Government not only the right of making laws but the right to fix minimum penalties afterwards and to limit the action of the judges in properly trying cases that come before them.  I think it is a very unwise thing to do.  It is neither necessary nor expedient and I do not think any case has been made for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could ever get to the Arcadian state of believing that the Government will not abuse powers given to it, of course we could wipe out the courts altogether.  The only reason that the courts were established, that over the centuries the people have fought for the independence of the judges and have buttressed up and fortified the judges in their independence, is that there was that particular feeling that Governments would abuse their powers.  If it were not for that feeling and if it were not for the experience people have with regard to the misuse of powers, a great deal of contentious history would never have been written. I have not reached the idyllic state of believing that the Government will not misuse their powers, and I want to guard against that misuse.  I have listened to only one speaker trying to defend the section, Deputy Victory.  He gave one case, and then he spoke of a <Col N="226" /> category of cases.  The one case is a case which in some way or another would escape the law altogether.  It will not be met by this section.  If it is a case which should have been caught and was not caught, the Government have ample power, which they avail themselves of frequently, to amend and change and repeal and put out new Orders.  If it is only a case of getting wording to fit the offence, they have that power already.  Deputy Victory then went on to speak of easing the fines.  The whole burden of his song was to ease the situation which has been created in the country through the imposition, according to what gathered from him, of too severe penalties.  That was the only speech made in defence of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to try to find out what is the framework of all this.  I have said already that, as far as the definition of offences is concerned, the Government have a free hand.  They can define and re-define.  They can do their usual business of testing by trial and error, and they can get there eventually.  They can get a comprehensive definition which will catch anything they intend to catch, and they can do that by a series of Orders.  If they are not capable of doing that, it is not our fault. They have the drafting experience, and they have considerable practice in these later days of trying to frame wording so that it will catch the particular offence they want to meet.  So far as definition is concerned, they have every power that can be given to them.  So far as the application of whatever definition they may get from time to time is concerned, I think they have the fullest possible power.  In so far as they had not that power, they are given it now.  Under an earlier section, they can make any Order retrospective. As Deputy Everett said, they have issued Orders and prosecuted under them at times when people, <i>bona fide</i>, were ignorant of what they were being charged with.  I have personal experience of a case in which, under the Department of Agriculture, a person in the Cork and Kerry labour group was prosecuted; he was given time to do certain things, and up to the day on which that time limit expired it was <Col N="227" /> not possible to get from the Stationery Office a copy of the Order under which he was prosecuted.  But that did not deter the Department from going ahead, and that man had to be subservient to a particular piece of legislation of which he had no notice, and could have had no notice.  I had notice, because as a Deputy I get advance copies of certain Orders. I was probably one of five or six people who had any knowledge of the matter.  As far as that individual and his legal advisers were concerned, they attended at the Stationery Office day by day, until the last day of his term for complying with the law had come and gone, and day by day they were told that the Order had not been published.  But that did not deter the application of the Order.</P>
    <P>The definition is under the Government's control.  The application, even with retrospective effect, is now under their control.  As far as the penalty is concerned, and the sufficiency of it, there is no allegation made here that the extremity of the penalty is not sufficient to deter any of the people who may commit offences.  As it used to be, it was fairly heavy; as it is going to be, under the early part of this Section 8, there is the possibility of a £500 fine, together with a fine of £10 a day for a continuing offence, and, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a period of 12 months, or, if the court likes, both such fine and such imprisonment.  That ought to satisfy the most hardened bureaucrat as regards the weight of it.  As if that were not enough, there is power that any goods or chattels in relation to or by means of which the offence was committed shall be forfeited, and those goods and chattels can be disposed of as the Department thinks fit.  In the case of compulsory tillage, Orders have been made allowing entry on the land and the working of the land.  As far as those land owners are concerned who may come under the harrow of the law, they can be fined up to £500, and, in case of a continuing offence, £10 a day; they can be sent to jail for 12 months, which ought to keep most of them from a repetition of the offence <Col N="228" /> in the year afterwards, and in the meantime the land can be entered upon.  If that is not a sufficient deterrent, the Government should have told us that it was the extent of the penalty that was not sufficient, and gone on to amend it still further.</P>
    <P>On the lenienoy side, as far as the application is concerned, we are asked here to permit a minimum fine to be established.  I asked that a case be made on that.  I had hoped that some statistics would be produced&mdash;I gave an opportunity in a question put down yesterday&mdash;which would enable the House to form an opinion on one point, that is to say whether the cases in respect of which leniency is complained of are cases which are arising only in one or two parts of the country or all over the country.  Very well, it is all over the country.  I was wondering whether it was only in the case of one or two district justices, because the Government can prosecute anywhere they like.  If one or two district justices are cranky about those things, no case need be brought before them.  Those people can be prosecuted in any district court, irrespective of the place in which the person is alleged to have committed the offence.  I find it is all over the country; in other words, it is the common view, the average view, and the district justices have from time to time, in respect of mitigating circumstances, worked towards leniency.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is sufficient answer to any case that might be made.  It is quite possible that you might get a district justice who was taking too lenient a view of a particular type of offence, but if the district justices on the average are, so to speak, being brought under adverse criticism here, then I think that is almost in itself a sufficient answer to the whole matter &mdash;that right over the country, when cases are brought before the District Court, the judges now and again find such mitigating circumstances as enable them to impose small fines.</P>
    <P>I would not say, certainly in respect of one type of case, that there is any complaint about failing to find that an offence had been committed.  I take a question that was asked yesterday in connection with the land offences, and I find that there are 430 occupiers <Col N="229" /> prosecuted.  Up to date, 341 cases have been heard in the courts, and 339 convictions were obtained; one case was adjourned and the other was dismissed without prejudice.  Out of 341 cases taken into the courts, convictions have been obtained in all except two.  Of those two, one was adjourned, so it is still pending, and the other was dismissed without prejudice. The district justices are certainly doing their duty in respect of finding that offences were committed. The fines ranged from the minimum of 1/- up to the maximum of £100.  The question is whether the district justices were entitled to impose small fines in some of those cases, or whether it was proper for them to do so.  They have the facts before them.  The Taoiseach told us in this House that in certain cases the two Departments concerned, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Supplies, did not believe that the mitigating circumstances were such that the particular fines imposed were sufficient.  It depends on who reported to those two Departments.  If it were the officials of the two Departments who were down in the courts, they might have felt rebuffed at the fact that a particular penalty was not imposed, and naturally their report back to the Department would be somewhat prejudiced. I think one would need to have heard not merely the Departmental side, but the opposite side before a correct judgment could be found as to whether or not the penalty imposed was a sufficient one.</P>
    <P>On the known list of cases&mdash;this House at this stage I am sure will not go into the circumstances of mitigation and leniency&mdash;the Department simply having come to the conclusion that fines which were not proper were imposed, we are asked to change the whole law.  In respect of an unspecified list of matters, we are to give the Government power, by Order, to declare that there is to be a minimum penalty.  I think that that is too great a power to ask.  We inquired about the question of an appeal and we were told that, if a minimum fine is imposed, so far as there is any complaint about the <Col N="230" /> harshness of the fine, the only appeal is to be to the Department.  Is not that getting very close to taking away the control of the judiciary and establishing a clear and open bureaucracy&mdash; giving the bureaucrats power, to be exercised on information which will be supplied to them behind closed doors, about which the public will not hear, where political considerations can weigh and where you are not going to have the same impartial outlook as that of a person who is buttressed in his position and accustomed to decide on the presentation of a case in open court?  That is a bad change and a change for which no argument has been advanced.  The only argument supposedly made in favour of it turned out to be an argument against it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to reconsider this whole matter.  If they do not think they have sufficient power in respect of any of the matters I have spoken about, they can describe the offence in anyway they like; they can hunt the offence by a series of phrases until they get the one that catches the point.  They have considerable power and they have used that power to get people prosecuted in circumstances that seemed definitely unfair.  There is power to impose a sufficient penalty, on conviction, to deter anybody from the commission of the offence.  We find now, at the heel of the hunt, that, in so far as leniency is complained of, it is leniency on the part of the whole corps of district justices.  Deputy Esmonde said that this was an insult to the public but surely we are now criticising, without any statement as to why, the whole corps of district justices. I do not think that that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I said that it was with extreme reluctance the Government took the step of bringing in this measure, that we realised that it would be very much better if we could attain the purpose we had in view&mdash;to safeguard the community&mdash;by indicating maximum penalties in the usual way, leaving the law to be administered by the district justices in the ordinary way.  I pointed out that there were long lists&mdash;I read a number of <Col N="231" /> them&mdash;of cases in which there had been convictions in respect of offences of serious consequence to the community. That long list indicated to our minds that the district justices generally&mdash; perhaps, there were some exceptions&mdash; did not seem to realise the seriousness of the situation through which we are passing.  Somebody said that this legislation was an innovation.  Unfortunately, the whole crisis is an innovation.  We are asked to do things which we do not have to do in normal times.  We have to get the people to realise that the provision of food for the community in present conditions is a serious matter and that it is also a serious matter for people to make use of the shortage of supplies to enrich themselves. The whole of this legislation is in the interests of the community, as a whole, and it is ridiculous for Deputy Esmonde to suggest that it is an insult to the community as a whole.  The only people aimed at are those who are not doing their duty.  If the majority of the people are doing their duty, then it is right that the black sheep should not get away with their misdeeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to add my word of compliment regarding the work done by the farmers.  The farmers have done marvellously well under the circumstances but it is not much of a compliment to certain farmers who have done their duty with great difficulty that somebody beside them, who could much more easily have done his duty, should snap his fingers at the law and refuse to do his part.  This legislation is not aimed at the farmers.  That it took the particular turn it did, is due to the fact that, as soon as this legislation was mentioned, the farmers' position was brought up.  This legislation refers much more to offences for contravening Orders made by the Department of Supplies than to any other offences. The maximum penalties must be large. You have to put the maximum high because you have to cover so great a variety of cases.  You do not want to prevent the penalty going up to fit the crime when the crime is of a particular type.  The variety of offences to be <Col N="232" /> covered is so great that you must necessarily have the maxima high.  If we are to have minimum fines specified, it is equally important that there should be as much discretion as possible given to the Government when making the Order, so that, when dealing with a whole range of matters, if they have to fix a minimum fine for a particular offence, that fine will be sufficiently large to be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to say, that this is persecution, rather than prosecution; that if you have power to go after a person for a continuing offence you are necessarily persecuting him.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to prevent people from contravening for selfish motives the law made in the interests of the community as a whole.  If the Ministers responsible for safeguarding the community in this matter find they cannot do so because of the trifling nature of the fines imposed, compared with the seriousness of the offences committed, they might as well not make Orders at all.  The House either wants the interests of the community to be safeguarded during the emergency, or it does not.  The Ministers who are responsible in this matter believe that we, here, are serious and that we do want to have these Orders obeyed and the community safeguarded in the way these Orders are intended to safeguard them.  You have, for instance, petrol coupons offered for sale and you have the Probation Act applied in that case. You have a person using kerosene, contrary to the emergency order, and you have the Probation Act applied.</P>

I have a long list here.  I am not going to read <Col N="233" /> it, but I will take some cases at random from it.  I will not select those which are particularly bad.  I find a case here of tea, which should be sold at 3/4 a lb., being sold at 5/- a lb.  A fine of 5/- was imposed for overcharging and one of 10/- for not giving a receipt.  I find another case of tea being sold at the rate of 8/- per lb., a second offence of failure to mark quantities and a third of refusal to issue receipts.  The decisions in that particular case, where there were three offences, were: the Probation of Offenders Act was applied in the first case, there was a fine of 10/6 in the second, and a fine of £1, with costs, in the third.</P>

We have not brought this in with anything like pleasure.  In the case of tillage Orders, there are a number of cases here where fines have been imposed that seem to be altogether ridiculous.  For instance, in a case where 63 acres were tilled out of 82. leaving 19 in default, which is a quarter of the amount, there was a fine of £2 with 2/6 costs.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it no farther than that.  The situation is that we cannot hold the Minister for Agriculture, on the one hand, responsible for seeing that food is produced for the community, and on the other hand leave it completely and absolutely to other people to nullify his efforts, by giving altogether inadequate penalties as a deterrent.  That would be an incentive to those who may have been inclined at first to obey the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-compliance with tillage Orders is not the most difficult or most serious case.  The cases in the Department of Supplies are more serious. There is a shortage of certain supplies, and we must make some effort to spread the available supplies over all sections of the community.  We cannot have some people in a particularly privileged position where, by money or some other means, they are able to get hold of these limited supplies and use <Col N="237" /> them for their personal and private advantage.  It is an attempt on the part of the Executive to see that if the rules made in the interests of the community are broken by people, they will pay a heavy penalty, and to see that they will not be tempted to gamble on the fact that they can make so much money if they contravene the law, and that, if they break the law and are caught, the penalty is going to be only a trifle.  We want to balance up the account and make them feel that if they try to make money and are caught in trying to do it, at the public expense, at the expense of the poorer section of the community, they will have to pay a heavy penalty; that if they are going to gamble and speculate in that way, they will have to realise that there is a second side to it and that it is not all a question of gain for them.</P>
    <P>I will admit, as I said before, that if we were able to be sure of catching all those who break the law, the certainty of punishment would be much better than the severity of it, but when you cannot make certain, as you cannot, that all those who do so will be caught, the neat best thing is to make sure that they will realise that they are running a big risk and, if caught, will pay a penalty.  I can imagine all sorts of hard cases and all I can say about them&mdash;and I am not pretending that it is a complete and adequate safeguard &mdash;is that the district justice, if he thinks that in a particular case there are mitigating circumstances which warrant, a reduction of the penalty, can indicate to the Minister that, in his opinion, the Minister should exercise his discretion in that respect.  The Minister in question would be the Minister for Justice.  His Department is not the Department immediately involved in the enforcement of the Orders, so that, to that extent, there is an outside mind dealing with a particular case.</P>
    <P>I will admit again in that connection that it is not as adequate as I should like it, because it is obvious that the Minister cannot try the case in the same way as the district justice trying it locally who has a view of the facts as a whole, and if it appeared to us that the justices realised the serious <Col N="238" /> nature of the position, this provision would never have been brought in.  It is because the Ministers who have the heavy responsibility of trying to ensure, firstly, that the community is fed, and, secondly, that those articles in short supply should be made available, feel that they cannot effectively do their work if penalties of the magnitude of those which have been inflicted in a number of cases continue to be inflicted.</P>
    <P>That is the position as we find it, and I think the House will have to face it, too.  We are in a serious situation.  We want to get these things done and to make sure that those who are offending, and in many cases obviously offending wilfully, because it means money for them, will be severely dealt with.  If there is any better way which can be suggested, I for one have an open mind, but having discussed this thing and seeing all the objections. which are being raised here&mdash;it is not the first time they occurred to us.  I do not say that every particular objection did occur to us, but, in general, the principal objections raised here did suggest themselves to us&mdash;we reluctantly came to the conclusion that this power was necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to extending the scope of the provisions in regard to minimum fines&mdash;it is not absolutely new because there are two or three cases in which minimum fines are imposed by legislation already&mdash;we are not anxious at all to extend that scope.  We can only say that we are passing through a dangerous crisis and the Executive must be armed with the necessary powers to safeguard the community, and, if justices do not realise the seriousness of the situation as we, whose business it is to see it as a whole, realise it, the only way in which we can convey it to them is by the Legislature, on the motion of the Executive, saying: &ldquo;This is the case you make for it.  We believe the situation is serious to the extent you mention, and we therefore convey it as a direct instruction of the Legislature to the justices that cases of this kind must be dealt with in the manner indicated by legislation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, so far from making a case for the minimum penalties proposed to be embodied in this section, has made a case against them.  He has asked for suggestions as to some better method of achieving the purpose which he says he has in view and which I say we all have in view, and in so far as the Taoiseach in his opening remarks appeared to imply that any section of this House was in favour of any person taking advantage, or allowing any person in the community to take advantage, of the present emergency and the needs of the community, he was implying something which has no foundation whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We object to this method of meeting the situation because we are entirely convinced that, so far from meeting the situation, it will merely aggravate, and, possibly, acerbate it.  If the Taoiseach had taken the advice of some of his legal advisers, if he had had the industry to search into legal history, he would have found that one of the surest methods of bringing the law into contempt, one of the surest methods of providing means of evading the law, is the rigour of punishment.  It has been the whole history of jurisprudence that over-rigorous punishment, so far from deterring criminals and so far from achieving the purpose desired, that is, the prevention of crime, had quite the opposite effect.  British criminal law is built up on the manner in which severity of punishment was evaded by lawful and legal means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we object to is that while <Col N="240" /> public opinion should be, and, to a very large extent, is, behind every effort to put an end to black marketing and to the exploitation of the needs of the community in the present crisis, over-severity of punishment, turning the district justice into a rubber stamp as this proposes to do, will cause a reaction in public opinion in favour of the black marketeers.  That is what we object to.  That is what over-severity of punishment always does.  From the time I had anything to do with the administration of the law in this country from 1922, I fought inside against minimum penalties.  I fought as Attorney-General against them, and I am fighting now as a Deputy in Opposition against them, because I believe they do not achieve their ends, and that, so far from achieving their ends, they bring about precisely the opposite of what is desired.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appears to me to have adopted the theory of a writer on jurisprudence whom I remember reading. His speech recalled to me my student days when I read in some book on jurisprudence the theory that it is better for the law to be certain than just.  That sentence appears to me to embody what the Taoiseach has just said: that it is better for the law to be certain than just.  The Taoiseach wants to be absolutely certain that if there is an offence, however technical it may be, automatically the district justice has nothing to do but to record a conviction and impose a minimum penalty.  What is going to be the result of that, apart from the effect on public opinion?  The result is going to be that nothing but minimum penalties will be imposed on those who have mitigating circumstances and on those who have not mitigating circumstances.  There is no objection from this side of the House to the maximum penalty, provided that it is the persons in whom the Executive have entrusted the exercise of judicial power in this State, by their own appointment, who do that sort of thing.  We have no objection to a particular maximum penalty being put in to meet a particularly serious case, but to provide that every case, irrespective of the facts and circumstances, must be dealt with on the <Col N="241" /> same par as a very serious case, and a case where there are no mitigating. circumstances whatever, is something that we cannot stand over.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on two occasions, in the course of his remarks, stated that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case against the district justices.  He said that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case that their actions in connection with prosecutions, imposing fines and other penalties, gave the impression that the district justices did not appreciate the gravity of the crisis.  A <i>prima facie</i> case?  The only sort of case that could be made for this is a conclusive case, or, if not a conclusive case, at least a case that is not merely a <i>prima facie</i> case.  A <i>prima facie</i> case, from its very terms and words, means a case that can be answered.  If it is a <i>prima facie</i> case, an opportunity ought to be given to allow it to be answered.  I heard the Taoiseach giving a few instances, which did not commend themselves to me at all, but before I refer to them I should like to ask this question.  Have the Government, or the Ministers who are responsible for the prosecutions in the cases of which they now complain, made any representations, through State solicitors or State counsel, in any particular case or series of cases, that the circumstances of the time or the particular circumstances of the case, irrespective of mitigating circumstances, required that in view of the gravity of the crisis the offence should be marked by a heavy penalty?  Have these representations been made by State solicitors or State counsel in court before the district justices, before these justices are condemned on what the Taoiseach has twice said is merely a <i>prima facie</i> case?  Everybody knows what is meant by a <i>prima facie</i> case. It means a case that has not been really investigated, and that is the case that we are asked to pass this section on, a case that has not been thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said&mdash;and, of course, it was perfectly obvious that he could not be in the position to say anything else&mdash;that he was not able to give the circumstances of each of these prosecutions which were before him.  He spoke of somebody selling tea at 8/- <Col N="242" /> a pound instead of 3/4.  Everybody knows that 8/- a pound for tea in the black market is a ridiculous price.  It is 5/- a quarter in Moore Street, and the usual price is £1 per pound in the black market.  Leaving that aside, however, I can give a case, that came within my own purview in practice, and where there were mitigating circumstances, of a proprietor of a big concern who had given definite instructions to his employees not to contravene the Order, but an employee, perhaps for reasons of his own, sells the tea at 8/- instead of 3/4, and a prosecution follows.  The proprietor comes in to the district justice and says: &ldquo;I have done everything possible to comply with the law; the law has imposed on me liability for the acts of my employees, and I am prepared to accept that liability, but at the same time justice requires that if I have taken every step that was reasonably and humanly possible to see that the law was observed properly, I should not be punished in the same way as the person who actually did the job.&rdquo; I know of cases also where the actual person who sold the article at a greater price than the fixed price was fined less than his employer, who was held vicariously responsible for the act of his employee.</P>
    <P>There must be some justice in this. Justice must be tempered with mercy, or there will be no respect either for justice or the law, and that is what we object to in this: that it will defeat its own ends.  We object to it on the question of principle, in the first place, but also on the question of expediency. because we believe that if the district justices are treated fairly, they will do their duty by the people and the State as they have always done it.  I want to know, and I ask again, can any Minister connected with these prosecutions tell me, or can the Taoiseach ascertain it from his Ministers and tell me, or any case where, a solicitor or counsel prosecuting in any offence having made representations in a particular case to the district justice, these representations were deliberately ignored?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has spoken about a case of the sale of petrol coupons where the Probation of Offenders Act <Col N="243" /> was applied.  If that Act was improperly applied, the prosecution would have their remedy, as there is an appeal in a criminal matter, by certiorari, and I want to know if that was tried in this case of the application of the Probation of Offenders Act.  I want to know if the Taoiseach has forgotten that in all these cases he has available to him the machinery of the Military Courts, the special tribunals, which have been largely availed of. Why not try them, as they have, in fact, been tried in certain cases&mdash;even in connection with the sale of petrol coupons?  I have seen such cases come before the special tribunal, and what is the hullabaloo about, when you have that tribunal?  It has not, perhaps, the judicial experience and the judicial training of the district justices, but where is the case for us condemning, by a legislative Act, on a <i>prima facie</i> case, an inconclusive case, a case in respect of which the Taoiseach is not able to give any details or any conclusive or coercive evidence&mdash;where is the case for us condemning the district justices for not realising the gravity of the crisis?  I think it will be agreed that since 1923, when that body were established, they have given the greatest satisfaction of any branch of the judicial hierarchy and have done their duty in every crisis; and in ordinary fairness to them, a case of this kind should not have been made here, in the first place, and if there was a case to be made, at least there should have been an opportunity afforded of answering it; at least, the prosecuting counsel or solicitors, in condemning these cases, should have made their representations in open court and to each particular district justice.  That is where the case should have been made, and not in this House&mdash;the case that has been made here for increases. in penalties.</P>
    <P>We have not got any statement or any evidence whatever that these men have not realised the gravity of the situation.  I would venture to say that probably the whole of them, and certainly 99 per cent. of them, are in closer touch with the people of this country than any member of this House, including the members of the Government. <Col N="244" /> They are fully alive to what is going on around them.  They live with the people in their districts and they know what is going on, and the gravity of the situation.  They are in a judicial position.  They have to act between the prosecutor and the person charged.  No person can be a judge in his own cause and I say, and I emphasise it, that, particularly, no official either can be, or ought to be allowed to be, a judge in his own cause, because that is what is happening here.  It is the officials who want this.  It is they who want, as they always wanted, this thing of minimum penalties&mdash;that has been my experience since 1922&mdash;because they want to have their own way always, and they cannot understand a judge hearing a case impartially and then deciding against the way they want it to be decided.</P>
    <P>I have seen&mdash;and I know as much about it as any member of the Government&mdash;that a person who is in a position to prosecute in any of these cases for the State, inevitably becomes an advocate.  When he is making his report, you will not get a fair or impartial review of the circumstances of the case.  You will get a grouse and a growl against any decision that is brought against the State.  They always complain when there is an adverse decision.  I have never known a case where any Government Department or Government official was satisfied when the case was given against them.  I am quite satisfied that the judge or district. justice who decided a case against the State was not wrong, but that is what is happening here.</P>
    <P>The last thing that I have to say is this: that so far as I know&mdash;and I am open to correction if I am wrong&mdash;in the case of the multitudinous Orders made during the last war under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and in the case of the multitudinous. Orders that are being made at the present time in Great Britain when Great Britain is fighting for her very existence, I challenge the Taoiseach or any member of the Government or their legal advisers to produce any regulation which provided for minimum-penalties <Col N="245" /> in a time of great crisis in that country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello has said that everybody in this House wants to see black marketing suppressed.  Certainly, the speeches made by members of the House in the past have given that impression. Most of those speeches were, however, directed towards demanding of the Government that effective action should be taken to that end.  The Government, in order to take effective action, thinks it requires another instrument. Deputies, however, are now opposing the giving of that instrument to the Government.  What was the burden of the complaints made by Deputies here in the past?  First of all, that only a fraction of the number of cases of offences which are committed appear before the courts at all, and that when they do come before the courts the penalties imposed are, in a great many cases, inadequate to the offence.  That has been the burden of Deputies' complaints, and they have voiced them as a criticism of the Government.</P>

      <P>And other Deputies made the same complaint.  This device of minimum penalties is not new to the law.  It has been adopted in other cases where the circumstances were such that the difficulty was in producing evidence that would lead to a conviction. Revenue cases are of that kind.  Offences against the revenue, of smuggling goods into the country, the evasion of the payment of tax, are not infrequent, but only in a small number of cases is it possible to get evidence that will stand in a court of law and lead to a conviction.  Because that was so, even in normal times, the device of minimum penalties was adopted in order to ensure that persons who took the risk of breaking the law would realise that the penalties that would follow detection were going to be severe.  The penalties were designed to deter people from taking those risks, and they may have had that effect.  I do not say they necessarily had that effect, but certainly people will be less inclined to take the risk of breaking the law when they know that severe penalties will follow than if they are led to believe by newspaper reports that the penalty will be a light one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole difficulty in regard to enforcing price fixing Orders is of getting cases into court at all.  Every Deputy knows that offences against these Orders are committed daily without the facts ever coming to light at all, because the purchaser, as well as the seller, is engaged in a conspiracy of getting around the law.  It is not <Col N="247" /> only in the interest of the seller of goods that a price fixing Order should be evaded.  It is frequently also in the interest of the buyer of the goods.  The buyer of goods may be getting supplies in excess of what he is entitled to.  He may be getting an undue proportion of the limited quantities available for the people of his particular district.  He is engaged in a conspiracy, with the seller of the goods, to break the law, and each is getting an advantage from their action.  In such cases it is almost impossible to secure a conviction: to get evidence which will stand in court or justify the court in imposing a penalty.  In the limited number of cases where it becomes known that an offence was committed, the difficulty is to get witnesses to give evidence.  Do not Deputies know that? Is it not known to everybody in this House that even where it is well known that a trader is overcharging for tea, flour, or some other commodity, nobody in the district will come forward and give sworn testimony in the court to that fact?</P>

      <P>In the great majority of the cases that come to court the only evidence available is that of the officer in the Department of Supplies who detected the offence.  That officer went, perhaps, into the trader's shop and succeeded in purchasing 1 lb. of tea at 10/- or 15/-.  As a result of that one particular incident, the trader is brought to court.  When that case appears before the court, the justice is dealing only with the facts that are sworn to before him, and what is sworn to is that on one occasion, to one person, that trader sold tea at a price in excess of that fixed by Order. But does anybody believe that in 99½ per cent. of these cases that have appeared before the courts the only <Col N="248" /> offence committed by that trader was that for which he was convicted?

      <P>He was not.  The Deputy is raising a most irrelevant and ridiculous point.  I am referring to an authorised officer of the Department of Supplies whose duty it is to detect offences of that kind.  When he brings his case before the court the trader is convicted of that one offence, but everybody in the parish knows that the trader was only caught on one occasion but had, no doubt, been breaking the law on a number of occasions.  It may be that in an isolated case there was only one offence, but, in the great majority of cases, everybody knows that the traders who are caught were not merely the unlucky ones, but had been continuously breaking the law before they were actually convicted of one offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that you require minimum penalties.  A justice, dealing with the facts sworn before him, may be disposed to impose only a penalty related to the facts of that one case but our circumstances require that the penalties are such that a trader will understand the big risk he is taking on every occasion that he breaks the law, even when he thinks that he is not going to be detected.  Deputies may give lip service to the efforts of the Department to try to suppress black marketing, but if they are in earnest about it they must realise that the penalties imposed by the courts must be a deterrent upon all those people who will never come before the courts but who are equally guilty with those <Col N="249" /> who are detected and charged.  Deputy Costello spoke about over-severe penalties bringing the law into disrespect. He has suggested that the penalties that will be imposed under Orders made by the Government providing for minimum penalties will be over-severe.  The Deputy is talking something for granted.</P>

      <P>If a person takes wheat required for human food and feeds it to animals, what penalty is severe enough for that?  There were people doing that and at the same time there were queues standing outside bread shops unable to get supplies of bread. While that was happening people were feeding wheat to pigs.  The gravity of that offence obviously depends on the circumstances at the time.  It was a less grave offence when our bread supplies were reasonably adequate, when we had the prospect of being able to maintain an adequate flow of flour and bread to meet the requirements of the community.  It became a much more serious offence during the time in which bread was scarce.  It may become, in certain circumstances, a very serious offence indeed.  A man may take a sieve in a small mill and pass the product of the mill through it in order to get white flour to sell on the black market.  That is a serious offence.  But when we find in one case a man who was actually operating what was tantamount to a factory for the manufacture of white flour, with a number of people employed producing white flour from <Col N="250" /> a 100 per cent. product on mass-production methods, white flour which he sold in the black market as having been smuggled over the Border at an exorbitant price, a man who was probably making, judging from the scale of his operations, a profit of £200 or £300 per week, being charged before the district court and fined £3, was that penalty over-Severe?  What penalty would be severe enough in these circumstances?</P>

      <P>That is Deputy MacEoin's suggestion.  We are not suggesting that in this Bill.  When we come to deal with these Orders which are designed to secure an equitable distribution of available supplies at a reasonable price, we are up against the immense difficulties of enforcement.  I ask the Dáil to try to appreciate that. These difficulties of enforcement are such that, unless we can secure that the penalties imposed by the courts are severe enough to deter people from taking the chance of not being detected in evading the regulations, our efforts to enforce them are certain to be inadequate. I do not know what brings the law into disrespect more than the impression created by newspaper reports that there is not in the minds of the justices a proper appreciation of the gravity of our position in respect of matters of supply or the disproportion of the penalties imposed by one justice and the penalties imposed by another in what appear to be similar circumstances.  I have seen cases reported on the same day where, for a precisely similar offence committed apparently, in precisely similar circumstances, one justice imposed a penalty of £10, or £15, or £20 and the other justice imposed a penalty of 1/- or 2/6. Does that help to bring the law into disrespect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the newspaper reports revealed the circumstances, they were the same.  I am dealing now with the reactions of these newspaper reports on the minds of the public.  One advantage of providing for minimum penalties is that disparity <Col N="251" /> between decisions of different justices in similar circumstances is removed and a uniformity is secured in the punishments inflicted for offences of this kind.  Many of these Orders made by the Government controlling supplies are of vital importance to the country.  It may be that the justices do not appreciate that fact.  They may not have the knowledge which will enable them to appreciate fully the gravity of the offence committed by the individual charged before them. That knowledge may be only available to the Minister who made the Order or the members of the Dáil who discussed it here and may not be fully appreciated by the members of the public, much less by the justices of the district court.</P>
      <P>It is in such cases that the Government should have power to indicate the importance which they attach to the regulations made and the necessity for securing obedience to these regulations by putting in the Order provision for a minimum penalty.  If we are to get respect for these Orders fixing prices, it must become obvious to the public that offences against these Orders are regarded as a serious matter, and that the persons committing these offences will be severely punished.  It is only in that way that you can secure that traders and others will avoid the risk of detection.  We can no doubt improve our methods of enforcement. We can multiply the number of our inspectors.  We can adopt various devices in order to secure that these inspectors will be more effective in detecting offences. But, unless we can get behind all these methods the general idea that these offences are serious ones, that those who commit them are enemies of the people and should be punished as such, that the risk of breaking these regulations is a great one and involves serious consequences for the perpetrators of the offences, then all our efforts to suppress black marketing will be inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies cannot pretend to be in earnest in their support of the efforts of the Government to suppress black <Col N="252" /> marketing unless they will deal in their criticism of this proposal of the Government with the points I have mentioned, namely, the difficulties of securing convictions in cases of offences against this Order, the knowledge that there are a number of offences that will never appear before the courts, the fact that, even where it is well known to the public that, individuals are breaking the law, those who have that knowledge will not swear to it in court, and the impossibility of preventing people being encouraged into committing breaches of the law themselves by newspaper reports which indicate that those who committed these offences were lightly treated when charged before the court.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that if we could ensure that every case of a breach of these regulations was brought to trial, that in every instance in which people overcharged for tea or cigarettes or something else, they appeared eventually before a district justice to answer to that charge, then this need for a minimum penalty, this need for severe penalties, would not exist.  If we knew that every offence would be brought before a court, there would be no difficulty in allowing the district justice to assess the offence committed in the individual case and to determine the penalty accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is because we know that every case will not come before the court, that only a minority of the cases will come before the court, that the penalties must be such as to ensure that the importance which the Government attach to the offence becomes clearly recognised.  It is the very inability of the State to secure a certainty of enforcement that makes this other device necessary.  That was so in times of peace in relation to revenue offences and other classes of offences.  It is doubly so now in present conditions when these offences are much more numerous and their consequences to the community much more serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the sound and fury we have just listened to means anything in the way of argument, then this whole case has suddenly changed. We are now concerned with the <Col N="253" /> leniency of the district justices.  The Minister asks us to see to it that the gentleman who is caught is fined for the 10 or the 12 who commit an offence and who are not caught.  That is his case, and he asks whether the penalties are going to be over-severe.  Any penalty fixed on that basis is bound to be over-severe.  One man will be caught out of 20 offenders and we are going to build up the penalty in such a way that, having convicted the man who is caught, we will penalise him for the 19 who have escaped.  Of all the nonsensical arguments that have been used in this House, the limit has been reached to-night.  That is the Minister's contention.</P>
      <P>He asks us to believe that it is amazingly difficult to get offenders.  Will it be more difficult or less difficult to get them if there are minimum penalties? What does the minimum penalty do with the evidence that is procurable in court?  Nothing except this, that people might, on the feeling that the district justice might temper justice with mercy, go to court in order to give evidence.  I suggest they will be more reluctant to do so when they realise that there is a minimum penalty of £100 to be imposed no matter how technical is the offence.  The Minister, in his effort to make a case, succeeded in displaying his own weakness.  He will be in a position to salt the single man that he is able to get into court for the 19 or the 20 who have escaped. There is no logic or sanity or justice in that line of argument.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the Government are taking as their ideal the Revenue Commissioners and their penalties.  We have changed the law again and again, not merely to give the Revenue Commissioners higher penalties, but to make things easier for them.  What is the result?  Revenue offences were never more numerous, and smuggling was never more rampant.  Although the law has been eased year by year in favour of the Revenue Commissioners, we find that the number of people trying to evade the revenue laws are more numerous than ever before.  And that is the example that the Minister thought fit to give us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was exceptionally vague <Col N="254" /> in his remarks about the man who was running a business and who was engaged in some black marketing in flour.  Where was that case heard? Who is the district justice who tried it? I should like to have some information with reference to that case, so that I may track it in the newspapers and learn a little more about it than I could gather from the few phrases the Minister hurled at us.  I do not think what the Minister has told us represents the correct picture.  The statement he made merely conveyed that a man was proved to be making an income of almost £200 a week and he was fined only £3.  I want the name of the person involved in that case, the area in which this particular offence occurred, the time it occurred&mdash; some definite statement, so that I can track the case in the newspapers; that is, if it was ever reported.  I do not remember any such case and I wonder has that case ever occurred, as the Minister stated it?</P>
    <P>It is conveyed to us that purchasers and sellers are in a conspiracy.  There are times when the only person who can go into court to give evidence is an officer of the Department.  How is that situation going to be eased by the application of minimum penalties? The Minister is critical of the House in its attitude towards the black market.  He almost insinuates that Deputies here are not in favour of stopping the activities of the black market. It is suggested that people do not realise as seriously as they should that certain articles are in short supply. Who is to blame for that?  I suggest that the Minister is.  What has he done to get the people better enlightened as to the shortage of supplies?  The fact of the matter is that his Department is a joke in the eyes of the public.  It is hardly possible to get any respect for the Department. It is not easy to get credence even for the statements of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello asked a cogent question.  Has the Minister ever told those appearing in court for him to make, on a particular case, a representation to a district justice of the gravity of dealing with an article in short supply?  If he has, will he let us <Col N="255" /> know what the district justice said, how he behaved on such an occasion, and whether his penalty was tempered with too great leniency?  It is at such a time that the case should be made and not here, through vague generalities, about people and their attitude to the black market and this man with the £200 a week who was fined only £3.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that by the populace he is regarded as the father and the mother of the black market, the man who was the main cause of it, the man who authorised the system of rationing through retailers, the man who left people in such a way that they could not demand or be entitled to get certain supplies.  Once yon create the impression that articles are in short supply and you leave people in trade to parcel out what they have amongst customers, there is a golden opportunity at once for a black market. That has been the Minister's conduct up to recently.  Then he went in for rationing by the coupon system, and it is not worth while at this point to speak about the result of that.  The Minister is, to a great extent, to blame for two things: firstly, for giving marvellous opportunities for back market rackets and, secondly, for not sufficiently educating the public as to what the dangers were and are.  I do not think he has set out on any course in order to educate the public and, if he has, whatever little result his efforts might have got ordinarily have failed, because his Department was derided by the public at the time he set out to educate them.</P>
    <P>We have been told now by the Minister that people were feeding wheat to animals at a time when people here were queueing up for bread.  The Minister used to say they were not queueing up for bread&mdash;it was for hot bread. It is a good argument at this moment to say that a district justice was lenient in the imposition of a penalty with regard to bread when it was in short supply.  The Minister now refers to the time when people were queueing up.  We remember how vehemently he used to deny that that was the situation so far as this city was concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> There are certain points that have to be answered.  We want to be told the answer to the question that Deputy Costello put here.  What representations have been made in court, and what are the occasions upon which these representations were not treated with the respect that should have been given to them?  Will the Taoiseach do this, with the number of cases he has in front of him&mdash;will he tell me that the leniency would be a matter that would affect district justices all over the country?</P>
    <P>I get back to my original argument with regard to people with trained minds, asked to relate circumstances to an individual case and the pleas made in court.  These people all over the country have apparently failed to realise the gravity of the situation, in the phrase of the Minister for Supplies. That being the situation all over the country, would the Taoiseach go one step further and say from the cases that he even has at his disposal or has heard of, what percentage of all the offences that the district justices tried would the lenient cases be, as I certainly think this House ought not to be asked to pass legislation of a minimum penalty type on, say, 2 or 3 per cent. of cases in which even what the Department calls leniency was shown in respect of these cases.  In relation to agricultural matters, the Minister was talking about evidence. There were 341 cases here and in all but two cases convictions have been recorded, and one of the two cases in which a conviction has not been recorded is a case which has been adjourned and is still pending.  In one case out of 341 there was a dismissal without prejudice.  That is the case as far as the Minister is concerned.  If the penalties are not sufficient for the Minister, the Minister has power to enter on lands.  If the Minister has not exercised that power it is for some reason known to himself which he will probably now tell the House about.  If he has not exercised it effectively to make these Orders better observed all over the country, he will tell us why he has not entered a great many more times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to one other matter that I refer to here in <Col N="257" /> conclusion.  He said that it is possible, and we have seen it happen, that some of the cases that have been spoken of have been brought before the Military Tribunal.  One of the cases referred to is this case about coupons.  These cases have since gone before the Military Tribunal.  If the Government want to make a demonstration of what they think as to the gravity of a particular situation in respect of some commodity, it is easy for them to schedule a particular, offence as an offence under the Offences Against the State Act and thereupon there is still somebody to deal with it who is not a member of the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Supplies.  There are these people who are attached to the Military Tribunal and they can deal with it.  It is possible, it seems to me, a situation might arise which would call for such treatment as that&mdash;it is not that I am commending it at the present moment&mdash;but the fact that the Government has not sought to treat any shortage of any material in what way indicates that the case made here at the moment is a completely artificial one and no case here can possibly commend itself to this side of the House unless in respect of, say, one or two cases where it is alleged too great leniency was shown, we are told what were the extenuating circumstances expressed to the district justice and how he responded to those.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think anybody listening to this debate would, perhaps, form the impression that there were no such things as minimum fines already in existence.  I happen to have had to deal with offences where minimum fines are inflicted.  These were fishery offences.  I take it that the reason these minimum fines were brought in in the beginning, for poaching and so on, was that, as the Minister for Supplies pointed out, it is so hard to detect these particular crimes and so hard to get evidence that they are not caught very often, but when they are caught the penalty has to be severe. I think, although Deputy McGilligan appeared to think that it was a ridiculous argument, that the legislators who drew up that legislation very <Col N="258" /> many years ago, which has stood the test ever since, must have had that fact in mind: you do not catch them very often, but when you do catch them they must suffer the penalty.</P>
      <P>Deputies talked here of the undesirability of having a Minister responsible for leniency rather than a district justice or judge.  In that particular case, the district justice very often inflicts the minimum penalty and at the same time makes a recommendation for mercy.  That recommendation comes to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Justice, in practice, asks for the observations of the Gárdaí in the district and of the Board of Conservators, and if he finds that there is a volume of opinion in favour of leniency he, after consulting me, the Minister concerned, is always inclined to be lenient in these particular cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan talked of the number of tillage cases brought and the number of convictions.  That has nothing to do with the minimum fines, for or against.  The fact that of the 341 cases already heard under last year's Order, the Department got convictions in 339 cases I think only proves that they had very good evidence that the offence was committed. If they had brought cases where there was doubt we must presume that some at least would have been, thrown out but, evidently, there was no doubt in these cases.</P>

      <P>The fine was not sufficient. There is not very much use in bringing a man before the court for say, having a number of acres untilled under the Order when he is fined 1/-. We feel it would be better if we had not brought him to court at all because we feel that, naturally, the farmers all around, if they are opposed to tillage and if they believe that from their own economic point of view it would be better if they did not till, will say: &ldquo;We can easily take the risk of not <Col N="259" /> tilling if the fine is going to be 1/-.&rdquo; As I said, it would be better not to bring the case at all.</P>

      <P>But the Deputy asked for one thing&mdash;he said he would like to know, for instance, with regard to the percentage of cases in which there was leniency.  I could give some idea with regard to the percentage of cases where I believe the penalty was in no <Col N="260" /> way adequate.  I will take this point first: the Deputy also asked whether these inadequate penalties, in our opinion, were general all over the country or only in particular districts. They were, to some extent, general all over the country but, on the other hand&mdash;there is no doubt about this&mdash; some district justices were invariably very much more severe than others.  I remember reading in the paper that one particular district justice said that in every tillage case that came before him he would fine £5 per acre and, as far as I could follow that district justice afterwards, he carried that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And you can bring every case before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look into that point, too.  I am taking a note of that. He is a district justice who evidently looked on the offence as being fairly serious.  I do not think he was severe enough but he did look on it as fairly serious when he proposed to inflict a fine of £5 per acre on everybody who came before him.  There is another district justice, and if all the cases that came before him were taken, his average fins was about half-a-crown an acre.  His maximum fine did not exceed £1 an acre.  Several cases came before each of these two district justices.  It is not possible, surely, that there were mitigating circumstances always in the case of Justice B. and never mitigating, circumstances in the case of Justice A.  So, when Deputies argue here that the district justice is there to look into mitigating circumstances, it does not hold in all cases, at least, and if this minimum penalty were inflicted, on the whole, I am quite sure you would have very much better justice than you have under the present system.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan wanted to get some idea of the percentage of inadequate fines.  I do not know what Deputies would agree is inadequate in these tillage cases.  I think anything under £1 per acre is inadequate but I will go very much lower.  Take, for instance, under £1 an acre.  Last year, out of 134 cases, there were 65 cases under £1, that is, almost half the number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> I think that everybody will agree that if we are to try to have compulsory tillage at all, there is no use in a fine of anything under £1 because, if a farmer is opposed to tillage, and if he has to be forced to do it, he will certainly believe that it would pay him better to pay £1 per acre and not till at all.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that a fine of under £1 an acre is inadequate in these tillage cases.  The returns show that the number of cases in which fines of between £1 and £2 were inflicted was 23.  Adding 65 and 23 together, we find that in a very high percentage of the total the fines imposed were under £2.  That gives some indication of the answer to the question put by Deputy McGilligan as to the percentage of cases in which the fines would be regarded as inadequate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already that there were two district justices, one of whom made it a practice to fine £5 per acre and the other of whom made it a practice to fine in or about half-a-crown per acre.  I have here a sheet of fines running from 1/- in one case&mdash;and that was not per acre&mdash;up to £100 in another case.  Strange to say, I find that the very lowest fine of 1/- is for a default of 6¼ acres and the very highest fine of £100 is also for a default of 6¼ acres.  Deputy McGilligan may say that perhaps there were mitigating circumstances.</P>

It is possible, Deputy McGilligan says, to bring all the cases before one district justice.  I believe it is under the Act.  Again I say to Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Costello and other Deputies if they want to make nice debating points, they can argue in that way.  It is a nice point to make, but do those Deputies who argue with such vehemence that we are going to bring the law into contempt by this provision think that in these cases of compulsory tillage, if I direct every case to be brought to one particular place and tried by one particular justice, that that will not create any contempt for the law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means to avoid certain justices?  That might be done I suppose, but still I think the proposal put up here is better on the whole.  If I bring a particular case here and I tell all the circumstances, I am quite sure that Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Dillon would get up and say that there might be mitigating circumstances under some heads. No one could argue on these lines.  It is not going to help us to solve the problem we are up against in dealing with these offences, whether black market or tillage offences.  I have the right of entry, it is true, and I have a very large number of inspectors. Probably Deputies will say that there are too many inspectors but, even with all the inspectors I have, they could not possibly deal with more than 1 per cent.&mdash;in fact, they could not deal with 1 per cent.&mdash;by way of entry because they must inspect those farms at a particular time in order to enter.  They must go back later and deal with each case and see that the whole thing is done in a proper legal fashion.  A great number of cases will only be detected after the sowing season is over.  If by any chance we fail to enter on a farm and if later on we find on inspection when the sowing season is over that the particular farmer has defaulted in his tillage, then we should have some way of inflicting a penalty.  The only penalty we have, or that I can even think of, is a monetary penalty.  Again, the monetary penalty must be substantial; it must be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But why must it be a minimum?  Even if it be substantial <Col N="265" /> and adequate, why must it be a minimum? That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be substantial and adequate.  I have already said that certain district justices did not make them substantial or adequate, and, therefore, there must be a minimum.  The Taoisoach said here already that the Government reluctantly came to bring in this measure.  I was certainly one of those who were reluctant to bring it in, and if Deputy Costello or Deputy McGilligan can suggest to me a way of dealing with those particular cases in which I am interested, I will not mind adopting the suggestion.  Even though it comes from a member of the Opposition, I should be very glad to adopt it if I could avoid this particular way of doing it.  But the Deputies have made no suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a very valiant effort to make me contradict myself in some way, but I cannot contradict myself because I have only spoken of what the case really is.  We dealt with 341 cases before the courts, and there may be others that must come before the courts yet.  I say that we cannot inspect all the cases, and we certainly could not inspect them at the <Col N="266" /> particular time when you could enter. We may inspect cases when the time for entry is over.  How are we going to deal with them then without an adequate penalty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an adequate penalty, but why a minimum penalty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only way, I suggest, to make the penalty adequate. The Opposition have not suggested anything else.  They suggested to-day that there is nothing very serious about those things; that there might be mitigating circumstances; that a man might charge 8/- a pound for tea and might be justified in doing it; and, therefore, that there should be no minimum penalty imposed.  Deputies asked whether we had tried to get the State solicitors to urge that those cases were serious.  We did; through the proper quarters&mdash;Deputy Costello knows what those are&mdash;I had the State solicitor in each county instructed to go to the district justice and impress on him the gravity of the situation with regard to those tillage cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Openly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course; in court.  Where else?  It was done in every case.  Those State solicitors went before the district justices and pointed out that the position was very serious as far as food supplies were concerned, and that those who were defaulters under the tillage regulations should be severely dealt with.  As I have said already, some district justices were impressed by that&mdash;not to the extent that I should like to see then impressed&mdash; but some of them were impressed; others refused to be impressed, and went on with the very inadequate fines of 1/- or 2/6 per acre.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by stating again that, if some alternative can be suggested which will give us what we want in this case, that is, that certain district justices will not continue to inflict those very inadequate fines.  I certainly will be prepared to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this discussion, it appeared to me that each speaker was looking at a different phase of the problem.  Under those <Col N="267" /> conditions, it is not surprising that we have not had any sort of agreement. The Minister for Agriculture has been complaining about the inadequate penalties in cases where the tillage Order has been evaded, and in fact he has mentioned that there are certain farmers who would pay a fine of so many pounds an acre rather than till those acres.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but it seems to me that, even if there are such farmers, what the country wants is the food produced from those acres and not the imposition of fines.  The Minister has complained that no alternative suggestions have been made.  I should like to suggest one alternative, and that is that defaulters be required to till double the number of acres in respect of which they were in default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But supposing they refuse to do that, too, what is the next step?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>You could impose a very large suspensory fine, which would be done away with if they came forward the next year having tilled the required amount.  I merely want to put that suggestion forward.</P>
      <P>There was also another case in which I was rather interested, and that was the case mentioned by the Minister for Supplies, where a black-market mill was milling white flour, and the owner was supposed to be making a profit of a few hundred pounds per week.  It was complained that in that case the district justice had merely imposed a fine of £3.  I should like to ask whether there is not one trifling circumstance which the Minister has left out of account in that case, and perhaps the district justice took it into consideration as a mitigating circumstance.  I take it that the mill owner had his mill taken from him as a result of being caught milling white flour?  I take it that the mill was closed down, thus depriving him of his livelihood?  If that was not done, there is certainly power to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Government do not need dungeons if they can prevent offenders from earning their livelihood. In this case, I am assuming that the <Col N="268" /> mill was closed down.  Surely, it was represented to the district justice that this man had had his livelihood taken from him?  I do not know how far that would have entered into the calculations, but certainly it shows that in some of those instances which have been brought before us it would have been better if we could have gone to the end of the road and seen whether there were any mitigating circumstances which might have been taken into account.  I take it that, in this particular case, a very different story would have been presented on both sides.  On the one side we have a miller who was making £300 a week in the black market, and who was fined £3, while on the other side it might be put forward that here was a man who had had his livelihood taken from him.  Surely, that would be an adequate penalty.  We have here to consider how far we ought to make the punishment fit the crime.  In the old days, people were transported to the colonies for stealing a head of cabbage.  That did not stop, the stealing of cabbages. It is not stopped even at the present time.  But nobody would now suggest that people should be transported, even if we could transport them, for stealing cabbages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are transporting themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>They might transport themselves if they got warning that somebody in another country was looking for cabbages.  Speaking as an ordinary individual, if one had to give evidence in a black-market case a certain effect would be produced if one felt that a savage penalty would be imposed.  I take it that what the Taoiseach really wants is to educate the country into appreciating the gravity of the situation and realising that the punishment should fit the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the arguments for and against this proposal.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, I spoke against the proposal.  I am still convinced that it is very objectionable from the point of <Col N="269" /> view of every section of the community and, particularly, from the point of view of the agricultural community, I cannot see how it can be operated with equity and justice.  The Taoiseach warned the House of the gravity and seriousness of the whole situation. Deputies appreciate the seriousness of the situation and are anxious to help in every possible way but, as pointed out by Deputies on this side, there is a responsibility on the House to secure that any enactment passed will ensure justice and equity to the individual. We feel that we cannot ensure that in the proposals now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the measure is unduly interfering with the discretion of justices.  If an individual is appointed to a judicial position, it must be presumed that he is fully qualified for that position and that he is fully trained as regards the imposition of penalties that will meet the gravity of offences charged before him.  We cannot stand over the argument that there must be minimum penalties and that extenuating circumstances cannot be considered.  I am particularly concerned with offences under the tillage Order.  I fully appreciate that there must be a wide variation in the seriousness of offences.  I have no sympathy with a man who deliberately refuses to comply with the Compulsory Tillage Order and who makes no effort whatever to do his quota of tillage. But a man who all but complies with the Order&mdash;say, a man who has to do 25 acres of tillage and who does 22 or 23 acres&mdash;may find this minimum penalty operated against him.  It is quite on the cards that the man who deliberately refused to comply with the Order might be fined merely the same amount as the man who had gone very close to full compliance with the Order.  From that point of view, the Bill is very objectionable.  You are taking from the justice his right to exercise discretion and to exercise his legal training so as to fit the penalty to the offence.  The case made by Deputy Costello should have impressed any Deputy.  Where the minimum penalty is operated harshly, you will have the sympathy of the public, in <Col N="270" /> general, with the individual who has been harshly treated.  That is the danger I see.  It is unjust and unfair that we should pass any such provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to the number of excuses put forward by farmers for non-compliance with the tillage Order&mdash;that they could not get tractors and that tractor owners promised to send them tractors to do the cultivation and failed to send them. I know a number of cases where that did occur.  It occurred mainly in non-tillage districts, where equipment was scarce and difficult to procure.  On several occasions here, I told the Minister for Agriculture that it was his responsibility to organise equipment in districts where equipment was difficult to procure.  He has ignored that situation and it is now proposed in this Bill that he is to be the sole judge and arbiter of any mitigating circumstances. The mitigating circumstance may be that he himself has failed to make provision for equipment where provision ought to have been made by organised methods.  Surely, the Taoiseach appreciates that there are many districts where little or no tillage was carried on in the past and where the amount of equipment available was not sufficient to carry out the tillage required by the Order.  A number of men were harshly treated as a result of their failure to comply with the Order&mdash;men who found it impossible to obtain the necessary equipment and who received no assistance from the Department of Agriculture.  I have said to the Minister for Agriculture that his inspectors should be in a position, where the farmer makes the excuse that he is unable to hire the necessary equipment to say that they will send equipment on the following Monday morning.  The Minister's inspectors should be in that position.  The Minister has never attempted to organise equipment behind them, so as to ensure that wherever equipment is lacking it will be sent there by the Department.  The extraordinary paradox about the whole proposal is that the Minister has failed in that respect and now we are asked to make him the sole court of appeal, where an individual feels that there <Col N="271" /> are mitigating circumstances which ought to be considered.  He, and he alone, who has contributed to the failure, is to be the judge in such matters. That is altogether wrong and unfair; there would be no justice or equity in such a proposal.</P>

      <P>There was talk about people in Dublin starving and deprived of food.  The acting and levity of some people will not improve the situation, or get us out of our difficulties. Deputies have the first responsibility to see that there is sufficient food in the country for our people.  There should be no tillage offences&mdash;there should be no occasion for them. Deputy Hughes tells us about the poor fellow who could not do his tillage in time.  The inspector entered on those lands in March or April and the man had until September to plough them, if he wished to do so.  He was not inclined to do it; he did not want to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for a county where not 25 per cent. but at least 40 per cent. of the land is under tillage to-day, providing food for the people, I would like to protest here against the manner in which the tillage Order has been treated all over the country, and the manner in which individuals and areas have evaded it.  Anyone travelling up here every week, by road or rail, as do Deputies from Cork, can see the way in which the tillage Order has been treated in certain counties&mdash;it is being ignored completely in some areas.  The very Deputies who were shouting about the poor having no bread are the individuals who object now to a minimum fine being put on people who will not produce that food. I speak as a farmer and as much a representative of farmers as any other <Col N="272" /> Deputy.  Coming from a county where the farmers really do their duty, I have no sympathy whatever with the farmers who are not prepared to till their land.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion to the Minister some time ago&mdash;that there should be compulsory notification by the owners of land, on or before the 1st November each year, of their inability to carry out tillage operations.  If, for any reason, a farmer thinks he will be unable to till his quota, he should be compelled to go to the local Gárda barracks and notify them, say in October of each year, that he cannot carry out his obligations.  If there are such areas, as suggested by Deputy Hughes, the Minister would then be able to send down tillage equipment to those areas and have the land tilled. In the case of 6,000 acres, where last year 3,000 were tilled and the crop brought in was not 25 per cent. of a normal crop, the land was not entered on until April and May when grain crops could not be grown.</P>
    <P>Apparently, there is any amount of supporters of the black market now on the opposite benches&mdash;even Deputy Dockrell.  I have no doubt it is a good investment.  We had Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Tadhg Murphy here the other day, and other Deputies from West Cork, complaining about the scarcity of flour in West Cork and the difficulties in regard to sugar and tea there.  Yet we see a case where 40 tons of sugar were taken out of West Cork Creamery and sent up to Sligo to go over the Border.  That was 40 tons of sugar from the poor of West Cork, to go over the Border in exchange for luxury white flour and tea for the aristocracy.  They say that poor fellow should not be fined, as his business is gone from him.  No doubt it was a lucrative business: I suppose it would pay 100 per cent. on capital invested&mdash; far better than any National Loan. Those who invest in a risky business like that must be prepared to pay the piper.</P>
    <P>I agree with some Deputies over there who stated that the ordinary court is not the place for those gentlemen. Those who take 40 tons of sugar from the poor in West Cork and send <Col N="273" /> it up for the Orangemen, who can afford to pay £100 a ton for it, should be tried before a military court and the penalty, as Deputy MacEoin said a few moments ago, should be the bullet. That is the only way to end that kind of game.  The situation is too serious to have lawyers quibbling over the penalties to be imposed, and objecting to a minimum penalty.</P>
    <P>The farmers are prepared to do their duty, and the majority of them are doing it.  If there are farmers who think they have the legal fraternity of this House behind them in evading that duty, and that they can get cheap law and cheap defences if they go to the court, I would not blame them at all for trying to evade the Order.  I do not think a fine is sufficient in a black-market case.  There is only one way of stopping black-market operations and that is the imposition of a jail sentence.  I would impose a jail sentence without the option of a fine, or together with a fine, in every black-market case.  It is the only way to stop it.  The profit which the gentleman who bought that sugar at the controlled price and was selling it over the Border at £140 a ton&mdash;that was the statement made in court&mdash;was making was such that he was not going to be stopped by a £5 or £10 fine.  The position at present is that a poor workman who wants to cycle to his work and has no tyre for his bicycle has to pay 30/- or 35/- for a 4/6 tyre, in order that the capitalists of this country might have a safe home investment for their capital.</P>

      <P>That is what is wrong with Deputies and evidently what has influenced the Front Bench opposite in making such an anxious defence of the black marketeer, of those who refused to produce bread for our people and to produce oatmeal for our people. Deputies are afraid they will lose their job of demanding from the Minister for Supplies the reasons for the long queue in such a street last month, of people waiting for bread which they could not get.  What can be the <Col N="274" /> defence of a farmer for not putting at least the minimum acreage under tillage this year?  He has a choice of grain.  If his land is unable to grow wheat, he can grow barley or oats and I can see no defence for him&mdash;and I speak here as a farmer&mdash;and I am not prepared to allow him any defence, either.  We had Deputies shouting a month ago about bread queues in the streets of Dublin, and now coming in here to defend those who caused these bread queues in the first instance&mdash; the people who were not prepared to till their quota of land to provide food for the people.  There is only one cure for it, that is, to insist that in all cases not alone will a minimum fine be imposed but a jail penalty as well.</P>

He speaks about bread queues, but were it not for the British Government we would not have bread to-day.  It was not the farmers of Cork who provided it; it was the British Government.  There is no secret or hiding of that.  The farmers of Cork would not have given it to the people.  Deputy Corry knows nothing about the farmers of the midlands, who are in a different position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the observations of the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture, it appears to me that both these Ministers have confused in their statements the difficulty of detecting black marketeers and the necessity for getting adequate fines.  There is no relation whatever between the complaint made by the Government that district justices are not imposing fines adequate to meet the gravity of the situation and the difficulty of securing evidence against people who are engaged in black marketing.  The Minister for Agriculture contrasted the actions of two district justices, one of whom imposes a fine of 2/6 an acre and the other of whom has announced in advance that in every case, no matter what the facts are, he will impose a fine of £5 an acre.  I give my compliments to the half-crown district justice, and I say that the other district justice who has announced in advance what he is going to do, irrespective of the facts or merits of the case, is not dealing out justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have ascertained who the justice is to whom the Minister referred and, when the facts are known, the compliments which I hand out to the half-crown district justice will be found to be well justified.  What has happened here is that the Government have taken a list and have seen on it fines ranging from £100 to 1/- and, without knowing what the facts are, they have drawn deductions from them.  If the Taoiseach and members of his Government got a list of the convictions and sentences from Green Street, they would find sentences ranging from 15 years' imprisonment to the application of the Probation of Offenders Act, and, <Col N="276" /> if they draw conclusions from that, they will draw the same conclusion, that is, that the Circuit and High Court judges are not doing their duty either. The same conclusion is drawn from the same premises.  With reference to the so-called half-crown district justice, he is a justice who has caused the Acts and Orders properly to be administered in his county, and the results of his operations have been that not merely has there been no necessity to impose fines, but in every respect the Orders have been carried out and more tillage has been secured as a result of his method of dealing with prosecutions than any minimum or maximum penalty the Government can devise would secure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the Deputy a present of it.  &ldquo;On the surface&rdquo; is what I take a <i>prima facie</i> case to be.  I cannot investigate each one of these cases and I have not said I could.  I have a list before me.  It is an extensive list, and, on looking at it, I am satisfied that, in general terms, the position is as I have stated.  There <Col N="277" /> may be exceptional cases and mitigating circumstances, and I can see only one way to meet them if this Bill is to pass, that is, an appeal to the Minister for Justice and an examination of whether there is sufficient mitigation to warrant a reduction.  Taking cases from this list at random, I find, for instance, that where a person's quota was 45 acres, 16 acres were tilled, there being default in respect of 29 acres and the fine imposed is £5.  I do not think that a fine of £5 on a person who has failed to till 29 acres, when he was able to till 16 acres, will act as a deterrent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit all these things which can be imagined, but we have to try to deter people from breaking the law and to ensure compliance. <Col N="278" /> That is the whole purpose of it.  I find further on this list that, where 8 acres were to be tilled, a quarter acre was tilled, leaving 7¾ acres untilled, and the Probation of Offenders Act was applied.  Other cases are: 6½ acres to be tilled: 1¼ acres tilled&mdash;5¼ acres untilled and the Probation of Offenders Act applied; 9 acres to be tilled: 5 acres tilled&mdash;4 acres untilled and a fine of 10/- with 14/- costs; 3 acres to be tilled: nil tilled&mdash;3 acres untilled and a fine of 10/-; 15 acres to be tilled: 7 acres tilled&mdash;8 acres untilled and a fine of 10/-, with 2/- costs; and so on.</P>
