      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether the herd of deer in the Phoenix Park or any part of it was offered for sale by auction or otherwise; if tenders were invited for the purchase of the animals about to be disposed of, and if not, whether he will state the grounds on which it was decided to enter into a private arrangement for the disposal of these animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of deer from the Phoenix Park herd to be slaughtered, the price at which they have been sold to the contractor, the arrangements made as to the disposal and destination of the venison and the price at which it is being sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the nature and the terms of the contract entered into for the disposal of part of the Phoenix Park herd of deer, the names of the persons or firms with whom the contract was made, and the extent of the obligation assumed by the State in regard to the rounding up and slaughter of the deer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the expressed willingness of the contractor for the destruction of the larger part of the Phoenix Park herd of deer to vary the terms of the contract, he will arrange that instead of exporting the <Col N="1274" /> venison to Great Britain it will be retained at home and supplied to the poor of Dublin during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of deer belonging to the Phoenix Park herd it is proposed to retain as a nucleus for restocking after the emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the five questions together.</P>
      <P>A contract was entered into with the Associated Merchandise Company, Holles Place, under which this company takes full responsibility for the rounding up, slaughter and disposal of the deer.  Faced with the need to have the herd reduced in numbers, the Commissioners of Public Works made inquiries from a number of firms in and around Dublin, but none of these except the contracting firm was prepared to make any offer.  The herd in the Phoenix Park had increased to between 800 and 850 and it was decided to reduce it to between 40 and 50 which was considered adequate as a nucleus for the maintenance of the herd.  The number of deer slaughtered up to date is 209.  It is understood that the contracting company has given to local firms and to any person interested every opportunity to purchase the deer alive or dead, for human consumption or for preservation, but that no sales have resulted from the advertisements inserted in the newspapers.  I am advised that the present controlled price in Britain of venison on first hand sale for unskinned carcases is 8d. per lb.  The provision to be made by the State for the poor can more efficiently and reliably be made through other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, will he state the number of firms from which inquiries were made as to whether they were prepared to carry out this contract?  Will he further state why the usual practice of inviting tenders was not followed in this case?  Finally, will the Parliamentary <Col N="1275" /> Secretary state whether he has taken any steps to satisfy himself that the contractor is not acting merely as an agent for an undisclosed principal, and will he say whether he is satisfied that the provisions of the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, have been complied with by the principal in this transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The last supplementary question asked by the Deputy is one which he attempted to put on the Order Paper and was not allowed by the rules of the House so to put.  I do not know the number of individual firms from which inquiries were made, but I do know that every possible effort was made to get in touch with anyone who was likely to buy.  I am quite satisfied on that point.  It is for that reason that tenders were not asked for.  It is quite obvious that it was a question of being lucky to get anyone to take it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Micheál Ó Braonáin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state the basis on which subsidies to wheat millers were made previous to August <Col N="1276" /> of this year, and on what basis similar subsidies are now being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidy payable on wheaten meal is based on the miller's selling price fixed from time to time for that commodity. Prior to 1st April last the maximum selling price was fixed at 49/9½ per sack of 280 lbs. (f.o.r.).  The corresponding figure for the period, 1st April to the 13th September inclusive, was 52/6, which was increased to 60/- on the 14th September.  The subsidy necessary to enable millers to sell wheaten meal at these prices is determined by the examination of the trading accounts of representative wheaten meal millers, but subsidy is not paid to any miller who charges a price in excess of the fixed price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the important thing is this: was the Minister aware of the amount, whether it was small or large, of foreign wheat ground by certain of the mills in this country before he fixed the subsidy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Éire citizens insured against accident whilst working in England, under the Workmen's Compensation are debarred from receiving the compensation if they return to Éire; if he will cause inquiries to be instituted with a view to protecting Éire citizens who may become incapacitated in Great Britain and expatriated on medical grounds to this country on the advice of medical officers of the various concerns employing Éire citizens in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that workmen injured by accident whilst working in England in such circumstances as to entitle them to compensation under the British statute, the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925, are debarred by that statute from receiving compensation if they cease to <Col N="1278" /> reside in the United Kingdom, unless the injury is likely to be of a permanent nature.  Section 16 of that statute makes provision under which a workman receiving a weekly payment of workmen's compensation who ceases to reside in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands or Isle of Man) and whose incapacity resulting from the injury is likely to be of a permanent nature, may continue to receive such weekly compensation after he has ceased to reside in the United Kingdom, provided he fulfils certain conditions.  These are, that the workman, before ceasing to reside in the United Kingdom, shall take the necessary steps to obtain from the medical referee for the area concerned in the United Kingdom a certificate that the incapacity resulting from the injury is likely to be of a permanent nature, and that the workman, after leaving the United Kingdom, shall prove in the prescribed manner and at prescribed intervals his identity and the continuance of his incapacity.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any case in which a workman who was permanently injured in England in such circumstances as to entitle him to workmen's compensation, and who complied with these rules, failed to receive weekly compensation after his return to this country, but if the Deputy will give me particulars of any such case I will have it investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our statute&mdash;the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934&mdash;contains in Section 32 a similar provision to that in the British statute.  Our section is, however, more favourable to workmen (including British workmen who become injured and entitled to compensation here) in that it enables injured workmen to continue to receive compensation, after ceasing to reside here, if the employer's medical practitioner certifies that it is desirable, owing to the condition of health of the workman, that he should reside outside the State.  I am well aware of the desirability of obtaining a reciprocal benefit for our citizens under British law; but the Deputy will appreciate that the matter does not rest entirely with me or with the Government of this <Col N="1279" /> State.  The Deputy may be assured that everything which it is possible for my Department to do will be done in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The length of the Minister's reply shows how important this matter is.  I should like to ask the Minister is he aware that there are at least 20 cases in the City of Dublin of people who were injured whilst working in England, and who were told that they would get workmen's compensation. After they arrived home the insurance company concerned wrote to tell them that they were not entitled to workmen's compensation whilst living here.  There was no means of getting a passport to get back to England to draw the money then. In view of these circumstances, will the Minister communicate with the employers, the insurance company and the British Government, because it was disclosed here yesterday that over 50,000 workers have gone from this country to England within the past few years?  It was because of two or three cases, the circumstances of which I know personally, that I put down this question, but I have been informed that there are at least 20 such cases in Dublin.  I put down this question because I think the difficulties in the matter are not insurmountable.  I have reason to think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister is he aware that the British Government are disposed to ask employers and insurance companies to pay compensation to injured workers living in this country if the Minister would ask them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of British law.  What the British Government is prepared to do is presumably indicated in their law, and, under British law, workmen are not entitled to receive compensation when they leave Great Britain unless the injury is of a permanent character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 20 people to whom I have just referred <Col N="1280" /> who were sent home and who are now forced to live without any compensation? I have reason to believe that any representations made by the Minister will receive sympathetic consideration. Fifty thousand of our workers have gone across there recently and if any of them are injured either permanently or temporarily, they are deprived of the means of sustenance if they return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should realise that the British Government in the present circumstances have at least as much power as our Government under the Emergency Powers Act.  The British Government also realise that they are getting good service from our people who have gone over there to work, and they would be prepared, I think, to receive representations from our Government on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to think that they would.  There are obvious considerations which must affect the British Government to the same extent as they would affect the Government here when drafting our legislation.  It is quite clear that there are many reasons why the payment of compensation for injury of a temporary character becomes a matter of difficulty when the recipient lives outside the area of jurisdiction of the Government concerned.  Therefore, British law provides for such payment only where the injury is of a permanent character and subject to compliance with certain conditions.  From the various efforts which have been made to get an arrangement in relation to Irish workers employed in Great Britain as good as that which applies under our law to British workers employed here, I have no reason to believe that the British Government would change their attitude in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the Act was passed to deal <Col N="1281" /> with ordinary conditions, and that the situation at the moment is that at the end of six months it is necessary for a person seeking work to have his permit renewed?  If the permit is not renewed, it is impossible for him to live there, even if it is only for the purpose of receiving his compensation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the hardships inflicted on the unemployed and casually employed owing to the rapid rise in the cost of their food supplies without any corresponding increase in their allowances <Col N="1282" /> or unemployed benefits, and if he will, with a view to the granting of an increase, cause a revision into the allowances now paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekly rates of unemployment benefit payable to a claimant in respect of a dependent adult and a dependent child were increased as from 19th June, 1941, from 5/- and 1/- respectively to 7/6 and 2/6. In addition, the continuity rule was relaxed as from 7th August, 1941. Chiefly on account of these amendments expenditure from the Unemployment Fund exceeded revenue in the year 1941-42 by over £140,000, and in the current year it is anticipated that the deficit will be still greater.  In the circumstances it is not proposed to impose further liabilities on the fund.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rates of unemployment assistance, since September, 1941, food vouchers have been issued as a supplement to the unemployment assistance payable to applicants with dependents resident in cities or towns having local government.  The cash value of these vouchers varies with variations in the cost of the food commodities for which they are exchangeable and represents an addition to the appropriate scheduled rates of unemployment assistance proportionately greater than the increase that has taken place in the cost of living since the outbreak of the war.  Provision is being made in the current year for £435,000 to meet the cost of food vouchers, including a sum of £171,000 for food vouchers to be issued to eligible recipients of unemployment assistance.  In addition, a sum of £200,000 is being provided to meet the cost of special food allowances which boards of assistance may grant to such necessitous persons as are approved by them over and above the amount of home assistance normally granted to such persons.</P>
      <P>These arrangements, in so far as they affect applicants for unemployment assistance, have been adopted as an alternative to increasing the scheduled rates of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the circumstances of the people referred <Col N="1283" /> to in the request, is it not possible for the Minister to remove the means test on those people receiving some allowance from sons and daughters in England at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely different question.  The purpose of unemployment assistance was, as the title of the Act implies, to give assistance to those unemployed, in relation to their circumstances.  When we framed the Act, it was recognised that we were entitled to take into account the means which the applicant had from other sources.  Quite clearly, an applicant who is getting maintenance from a member of the family is not as badly off as an applicant not getting such maintenance; and the amount of unemployment assistance is apportioned accordingly.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Minister a concrete case of a man who has six dependent children, and whose allowance was 14/- for himself, his wife and children.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position of most of those people is that, because they were District Court clerks, they were precluded from any other type of employment, beyond the possibility of becoming auctioneers?  The fact that some of them had small pensions because they were Petty Sessions clerks, does not help the situation much.  Those men have given 20 years' service to this State at a smaller rate of pay than they were formerly receiving for a smaller amount of work.  They are now going to go out at the end of a long period of service with nothing at all.  These people have no means whatsoever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether any progress has been made in securing suitable premises for the Borstal Institution at present housed in Cork Jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to inquiries made by the Commissioners of Public Works more than 20 premises were offered for the accommodation of the Borstal Institution.  They were all found to be unsuitable and it seems clear that suitable premises in a suitable locality can be provided only by purchasing a site and building on it. The difficulties of building at the present time are obvious, but I have asked for a report as to the possibility of erecting temporary buildings in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the conditions at the premises in Cork have been considerably improved.  The authorities of University College, Cork, have kindly allowed the institution the use of a playing field which is very conveniently situated.  Bicycles have been provided and cycling trips arranged. <Col N="1293" /> These developments go a long way towards removing what was one of the most serious defects, viz., the absence of facilities for outdoor exercise.  As regards indoor recreation, a new recreation hall was completed and opened a week or so ago.  It is equipped with a stage, a piano, a radiogram, ample seating accommodation, and tables for games such as chess or draughts.  The lighting and heating are good.  The inmates are free to use this hall every evening. The doors of the cells are unlocked from seven in the morning until ten at night.</P>
    <P>Generally, conditions are very much better than they have ever been since the Borstal system was started, and I am not inclined to make a change until I am sure that it is going to be a change for the better.  I agree, however, that the permanent use of Cork Prison for the institution is undesirable not only from the Borstal point of view, but also because the prison is required for its original purpose as soon as it can be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that other premises that were inspected were unsuitable.  I suggest that they could not be more unsuitable than Cork Jail, in which these lads are confined in the cells.  I am aware of the facilities that were given to them recently, but they are still inside a jail and, if there is to be any benefit at all in Borstal treatment, surely it is not inside a jail that those boys should be kept?  Any of the places that the Minister has described as unsuitable would, in my opinion, be more suitable than the place they now are in.  There are plenty of buildings around the county in which these lads could be housed, rather than allow them to remain inside Cork Prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that Emergency Powers (Mechanically-Propelled Vehicles) (Scheduled Areas), Order, 1942, made by the Minister for Supplies on the 27th day of August, 1942, should be revoked.</P>
      <P>I move the motion for the purpose of giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Supplies &mdash;whichever is the appropriate Minister&mdash;an opportunity of telling the House what the proposals with regard to the use of private lorries and the reorganisation of transport arising out of the petrol shortage are, and to enable a matter which appears to be one of very great importance to be discussed by the House before decisions are made and actions taken which may not only have a very important effect on individual persons or particular classes of persons, but may have a very important economic bearing on some of the areas upon which the original experiments are likely to be carried out.</P>
      <P>We do not know very much of what the Minister proposes, for the reason that apparently it was proposed to put this scheme into operation without consulting the House or discussing it with the House.  All I know is that the Minister for Supplies</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;is seriously concerned about the necessity, due to present conditions, for reducing the number of commercial vehicles which may be operated. To mitigate the consequences of such reduction, it is proposed to reorganise and extend public goods transport services and to reduce the number of private lorries.  The reorganisation will take a considerable time to complete and it is important that some experience of the problems <Col N="1299" /> which will arise should be acquired at as early a date as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all we know in any official way about the matter and that information was conveyed in a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary to us on 22nd September.</P>
    <P>If the position is that the Minister has a proposal to reorganise and extend public goods transport services, on the one hand, and to reduce the number of private lorries, on the other, as conveyed in that official information, and if there is anything in the suggestion published in the Press on 28th August that, in the move he first contemplated in this matter, in relation to Mayo, virtually all the road goods vehicles in North Mayo would be taken and handed over to the railway company or to some licensed road haulier, I think the matter is of such great importance that it is very unfortunate that the Minister should have set out to put such a scheme into operation without consulting the House or the organised bodies concerned in the matter.</P>
    <P>So far as we know anything about this scheme and can see what the effect of it is likely to be, it seems to me that in selecting the area of Belmullet, which is the area indicated in the newspapers&mdash;an area of something like 50 miles by 25 or 30 miles, or 1,500 or 1,600 square miles&mdash;the Minister is selecting the worst area in the whole country for wiping out private lorries and getting the transport business of the area done by the Railway Company's services.  It is intended, so far as we know, to put private lorries off the road in a large area in Mayo as an experiment from which the Minister hopes to learn something that will enable him to make further progress in the taking of private lorries off the road and in the enlarging and reorganising of public goods transport services.</P>
    <P>There is a body, the National Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association, which has been in existence on a county basis from about 1936.  It spread throughout the country in 1938. <Col N="1300" /> It was considering the whole situation as it developed and as early as 4th April, 1941, it made representations to the Department of Supplies as to the importance of the petrol situation and as to the importance of grading the type of private lorries which were being used and assigning a particular importance to the work they were doing.  It suggested the setting up of a body which would be representative of the Lorry Owners' Association, which would co-operate with the Department in the work of conserving petrol and providing adequate transport services and it urged the necessity for co-operation between that body and the Department.  That was on 4th April, 1941, but nothing transpired in the way of the development of any co-operation between the Department and that body.  I do not know of any co-operation between the Department and that body.  I do not know that anything was heard of it until 20th May, 1942.</P>
    <P>On the 24th April, 1942, Emergency Powers Order No. 147 was issued, which set out that commercial vehicles would require a permit, which permit would only be given when the necessary information was provided by the person applying for it as to what he wanted it for, so that the Minister had full opportunity for finding out the class of work required to be done, the amount of that work, and every possible scrap of information that might be necessary.  The Guards were entitled to investigate on suspicion, and to seize, and generally the Order provided the Minister with full and adequate machinery for seeing what kind of work was done on the permit, and for judging whether there was any kind of leakage, objectionable practice, or wastage of any kind.</P>
    <P>On 19th May, 1942, it was indicated in the Press that lorries might be further controlled, and that in fact they might be centralised and brought under more direct public control.  On 20th May, 1942, the day after, the representatives of the Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association communicated with the Department of Supplies regarding their previous representations.  They drew attention <Col N="1301" /> to the fact that they had offered the Minister co-operation and assistance before, and stated that they were ready to do so now.  They pointed out that they had suggested a particular kind of arrangement before, and that they would be only too pleased to give any co-operation necessary.</P>
    <P>It took the Department three weeks to reply to that letter.  The nature of that reply was that the offer of the association to co-operate with the Department would be borne in mind in the event of its being decided to introduce a scheme for the pooling of the carrying capacity of lorries.  On 19th June the association communicated with the Department of Supplies pointing out the position of transport in general and suggesting that it was desirable that the pooling scheme already suggested should be brought into operation and that the association, which was a national body, representative of the private merchant-owned transport of the State, expected a representative on the advisory board to be set up by the Minister.  They also said that they considered they should be consulted and advised, and that they were ready to give advice on all the relevant matters.</P>
    <P>It took the Department two weeks to acknowledge that.  The reply stated that the matter was having attention. Then there were some 'phone calls and letters, and on the 4th August&mdash;six weeks after the letter of the 19th June &mdash;the association got a reply from the Department of Supplies stating that they had got the letter of the 19th June regarding the establishment of a transport pooling scheme and that the observations of the association had been duly noted.  Things went on in that way, and it was only after representations had been made that Parliament should be given an opportunity of discussing this matter, so that the various interests would not get at loggerheads with one another, that the country generally might be informed of what was being intended so that it could judge whether it was suitable or not, and so that the Minister might get the fullest possible support for his scheme, if suitable, that&mdash;on the 8th <Col N="1302" /> of this month&mdash;arrangements were made whereby the Minister would meet the representatives of the association. If one thing is more important than another at the present time, it is the realisation that the only people who can carry this country through the emergency and its many problems are the people in the several counties, the people who stand over their jobs and co-operate with one another and with the Government.  It is the ordinary people who are going to carry the country through any difficulties likely to arise.  If there is not a general understanding of what is being done, general consideration of what is best to be done and a conviction that what is attempted is the most sensible thing that could be suggested, then a very considerable amount of friction will be brought into the situation and our work will be badly done, if done at all.</P>
    <P>In this instance, it seems to me that we have simply a dark-room plan emerging from the Department of Supplies.  The Minister was so prepared to put it into operation that he only agreed to have it discussed on the reassembly of the Dáil when it was indicated that the Leader of the Opposition considered the matter so important that he would have to ask to have the Dáil specially summoned to consider it rather than that a matter of such importance should be launched upon the country in an atmosphere that was not conducive to success.  The Minister has approached this matter in a very wrong way in his treatment of Parliament, on the one hand, and of the organised body, on the other hand.  He has since met representatives of the association concerned and he will, no doubt, be able to tell the House what he proposes to do in the light of these discussions.  As regards the area to which this plan is to be applied&mdash;a plan by which all private lorries and vans run by merchants are to be taken off the road&mdash; it covers about 1,500 square miles with only about ten miles of railway.  The public transport service is to be asked to organise itself over that area.  I think that the area is the most unsuitable one that could be selected for this purpose.  Everybody who knows the <Col N="1303" /> West of Ireland knows that the economy of the various districts has grown up in very difficult circumstances and has been hammered out over a long time by people living under difficult conditions.  Many aspects of that economy are very delicately balanced.  It has been injured in recent years as a result of certain economic experiments here.  The transport system of such an area is fitted closely to that area.  You have individual merchants with their lorry system closely knit into the area and serving people in a very detailed way.  If you are going to take that sensitive machinery away and hand it over to a body which has had no experience of dealing with an area like that, the economy of the area will suffer, production will be choked and the area will probably be deprived of a considerable amount of consumable goods which it would otherwise get.  By this system, you will injure production and consumption and hurt the local economy which has been pieced together as the result of generations of experience and as a result of people, living in difficult circumstances, pitting their wits against the problems around them.  These are the points I wish to put to the Minister in moving the motion.</P>

      <P>As one of those whose names are appended to the motion asking that this Order be revoked, I should like to say on behalf of every private lorry owner in my district, and in the association generally, that we have been at all times, and are now, prepared to assist the Government in facilitating the railway company to carry out the necessary deliveries under the present haulage system of the country.  If the necessity arises, we shall have no objection to handing over our lorries but we feel that the emergency has not reached such a point as to justify the making of this Order in relation to North Mayo&mdash;an area which covers one of the most remote parts of Ireland, from Ballycroy via Lahardane to Dromore West. It has no railway and it is possible never will have a railway.  The system of transport up to 1918 was by <Col N="1304" /> means of horses.  The goods were carted over 50 or 60 miles by horses. They left in the morning and returned the following night with a ton of goods.  In 1918 or 1919, the lorry system was introduced in a small way.  It gradually took the place of the horse traffic and the horse and cart practically disappeared off the roads.  In that area, they have a system of their own.  The majority of the bigger business people replaced their horses and carts by lorries.  They collected their goods in the main depôt, which is Ballina&mdash;the nearest station to the area.</P>
      <P>The Ballina mills and the Ballina wholesale places are the nearest places for collecting goods.  All these goods are collected in these two depôts. They are taken out by the business people to their own places and delivered in two ways.  One way is that there are a number of business people whose customers come in and buy and collect the goods.  There are other people living in these areas who collect the goods in the depôts and take them out and distribute them through the country.  They have what we term travelling shops.  The travelling shop, as Deputies know, delivers goods to the farmer and collects eggs.  These are the two sorts of business which have been carried on.  In North Mayo the people put money into these lorries as part of their business. They went to the expense of building housing accommodation for lorries, putting up petrol pumps, cabins, etc., in order to make this a success.  We feel that it is not fair now to take over all those private lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first we heard about this was on the 28th August when it was announced that all transport in the area was to be taken over and put under a nominee of the railway company to discharge the work of the area.  Later on we found that haulage lorries and certain other lorries were to be exempted.  The latest is that the only lorry to be interfered with is the private owner's lorry.  If the private owner's lorry is taken away and the railway company are to carry out the services of the area, I cannot see how <Col N="1305" /> any company or anybody else can improve on the present system which is carried out by the business people of the area.  The business people have their depôt for collecting goods, as I said in the beginning, in Ballina between the railway and the mills and the wholesale places.  They have their own business places as depôts in the different districts all over the area and they have depôts in the various small towns and villages.  These depôts are spread over the whole area and the people from the different districts are served from them.  In some of these areas the people have not the accommodation which would enable them to take home a large quantity of goods. Take the Erris area.  In that area some of the people have to take home their goods on an ass's cart.  They require a service near home and, as I said, the shops in these areas give them a local delivery.</P>
    <P>If we take the import of petrol into the country prior to the war, we find that we imported 44,000,000 gallons per year.  That has been reduced to one-third.  Three years ago, when we were importing 44,000,000 gallons of petrol, the basic allowance for a 35-ton carrying capacity lorry was 100 gallons per month.  Now each of these lorries has been reduced to 20 gallons per month or one-fifth of the former allowance, while the import of petrol has only gone down by two-thirds, and is at present one-third of the former quantity.  The reduction of the allowance for such lorries to one-fifth of the former allowance means that every lorry owner in that area has to be careful about every half-pint of petrol.  He has to see that his lorry is fully loaded when sent to the depôt in Ballina or when he is collecting stuff.  When the lorry goes to the railway he has to see that everything possible in the line of eggs or any other goods, including empties, are collected, so that the lorry will be fully loaded.  For that reason, I feel that the lorry owners are making full use on their journeys of the small amount of petrol they are getting.</P>
    <P>There are times when lorries may not have a full load, owing to the reduction in the supply of different commodities, due to the emergency.  In <Col N="1306" /> that area you have different classes of business people.  You have the flour shop, the grocery shop, the licensed trader, the registered egg buyer, the bread vans, the mineral water merchants and the bottling merchants.  If you take the mineral water merchants and the bottling merchants, they have to make a delivery once every fortnight.</P>
    <P>It is possible that, owing to the amount of petrol at present allowed them, they are not able to make fortnightly runs.  They have to make the best use they can of the monthly ration.  When they send out a load of bottled stuff they have to send a man with the lorry driver and they have to send out a collector from the office to get paid for the goods.  In addition to that, they have to collect empties and to give credit notes.  All that takes some time.  There is no other system which could improve on that.  These lorries have to leave about 8 o'clock in the morning, and it may be midnight or 1 o'clock the following morning before they return.  They have to go to the different shops, deliver the goods, get paid for them, and give credit notes.  That is a 14- or 15-hour day for three men and a lorry.  If a lorry had to be employed by the day and you put the charges for that lorry against the cost of the goods, I do not see how anybody could do it at the same rate as the private owner can do it or give the same service; give the service at the time when the people require it, for instance, before fair days or after fair days.  I see that there is a new regulation now, and I believe that the regulation they have for October, so far as the petrol situation is concerned, or so far as the basic allowance is concerned, is that the basic allowance is to be given more on a log-sheet system.  I believe that the log-sheet system is a good one, that under it no lorry owner will get petrol in excess of what he requires, and that it would work out equally reasonably for those who want to operate on the other system.  I think that the log-sheet system is one that would really cover the emergency, for the present at any rate, and that if there is anything in the way of waste of petrol, that system would meet it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> If the Minister thinks that he is not able to get over the difficulty in that way, there is another suggestion here by the Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association.  They seem to have a scheme and, as far as I know, their association had an interview with the Minister last week.  I do not know exactly what transpired between the association and the Minister, but I think that any arrangement that can be made between the association and the Minister and the other parties concerned would be all to the good, and some such discussion and arrangement will be necessary if this thing is to be worked in a proper way, so as to help the railway company, the area concerned, and also the people who are private owners of lorries.  As Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, it is the people of the country and the owners of these lorries, in conjunction with the railway company and with the Government, who are going to carry us through this emergency.  For that reason, I feel that the Minister should take a broad view of the whole situation, go into the matter carefully, and not rush it on the people without any notice.  Let him give the whole thing a fair chance for a month or six weeks, or until the end of the year, at any rate, and let the experiment of the log-sheet system and the suggestion of the lorry owners be all taken into account, and if a scheme can be put into operation that will be an improvement on what is already in existence, then time should be given to think it over, and no definite action should be taken, at least, before Christmas. Time should be given between this and the 1st January to consider a scheme, whatever the scheme may be, and then that scheme could be made ready to be put into operation on the 1st January, but it should not be rushed on the people without any notice.  It was the rushing of this scheme on us, in North Mayo, that really frightened us so that we did not know where we were.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say, because I think Deputy Mulcahy put the whole matter very plainly, but I would ask the Minister to consider the whole <Col N="1308" /> thing and not rush it.  Let the three parties concerned&mdash;the railway company, the Government, and the association&mdash;take the matter up together, and let them have a scheme to suit all parties ready to be put into operation, but not before the 1st January, at any rate.</P>

      <P>I think that before the debate goes any further it would be well to tell the House precisely what is contemplated.  When any problem arises, due to a scarcity of supplies, in any sphere of commercial activity, there are two courses which the Government can take.  One course is to wait until the problem has become obvious, until the existence of the problem has been recognised by everybody, and then step in to regulate it and minimise it, if possible.  If the Government takes that course, its critics, in this House and outside, will say, as usual: &ldquo;The Government has acted too late.  They should have foreseen the development of this situation and should have taken steps to prevent it long in advance.&rdquo;  The other course is that the Government can take steps in advance, foreseeing the development of a situation likely to cause difficulty, and endeavour to do something so as to minimise that difficulty, in which case the critics of the Government say: &ldquo;There is unnecessary interference with private enterprise; there is no problem in existence which calls for these drastic measures or this interruption of existing practices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that we are facing now a problem in relation to transport which may easily prove to be the greatest of all the problems that the war will cause for this country. This proposal of the Government to undertake a reorganisation of transport services has been discussed by Deputy Browne, by the North Mayo Lorry Owners' Association, by the National Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association, and by everybody else, as if the alternative were to leave things as they are.  Surely, Deputies opposite realise that that is not the alternative.  If we could be satisfied <Col N="1309" /> that things would stay as they are, this Order would never have been made and no proposals for the reorganisation of the road transport services would have been necessary.  It is precisely because we know that things will not stay as they are that the situation has got to be examined, with a view to ascertaining the steps that must be taken if the essential requirements of the country are to be met.  I want to get Deputies opposite to try to face this question in a realistic frame of mind.  If they can guarantee to me, in a manner which would appear convincing, that there is going to be no diminution in our petrol supplies, and that it will be possible to keep up this basic allowance of 20 gallons a month to lorries and a supplementary allowance in connection with special services, then I am prepared to accept this motion, but can they give us this guarantee?</P>

      <P>This one that we are discussing.  Now, the National Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association is an estimable body, no doubt, but the scheme they propose as an alternative may not be a very practicable one, and they themselves do not claim to represent more than 10 per cent. of the private lorry owners in the country. Nothing, however, is gained, when they say that while this is a problem that has got to be faced but any solution of that problem must be such as would protect their interests. I am prepared to protect the interests of private traders, so long as it is possible to do so, but the primary responsibility of the Government is to <Col N="1310" /> see that the public needs are met, even if those needs involve interfering with private interests.  The National Private Lorry Owners' Association talk about their right to operate their lorries, and the North Mayo association say that it is a most undemocratic action to interfere with the operation of their lorries.</P>

      <P>From the day the war started, our supplies of petrol were curtailed.  It became necessary in consequence to ration its distribution amongst vehicle owners and to limit the supplies available for various purposes. Quite rightly, at the beginning, restrictions were imposed more drastically on private car owners than on persons engaged in the operation of commercial vehicles.  At a later stage the supply of petrol became more seriously curtailed and, in order to ensure that the maximum quantity would be available for the operation of commercial vehicles, the use of private motor cars was eliminated altogether except in respect of a very limited number owned by persons engaged in professional work which was regarded as of primary importance to the community as a whole.  The diminution in our supply of petrol did not stop when we put the private cars off the road.  It has continued since, and, as I informed this House earlier this year, the quantity of petrol which we are going to receive during these 12 months is so contracted that it must involve a very substantial reduction in the number of commercial vehicles. There is no alternative to that.  The <Col N="1312" /> fact is that we have not yet succeeded in any month of this year in bringing the consumption of petrol below the quantity available for that month. Even in the month of September the actual quantity of petrol issued was many thousands of gallons in excess of the allocation for that month, and these excess issues of the past months must be recovered by a further reduction in the quantity used, apart altogether from the possibility that the total allocation will be reduced in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We eliminated the private motor car because there were available for the transportation of members of the public passenger transport services. We considered that, so long as there were available public passenger transport services, we were not entitled to give petrol for the exclusive use of private individuals who required it only for their own personal transportation. We are reaching a stage now where we have to consider whether or not it is possible to continue to give petrol to private lorry owners or whether it is not better policy and the duty of the Government to ensure that the supplies that are available are utilised for the maintenance of public transport services, services that are available to every member of the public, rather than that we should give it for the exclusive use of private individuals.  We can, of course, if Deputies think it good policy, reduce the allocations to lorry owners or, when petrol supplies are further contracted, merely decide that certain classes of vehicles or certain classes of vehicle owners will not qualify for an allocation and hope that whatever vehicles are left on the road, with whatever petrol can be given, will be operated in such a manner as to provide for the essential transport needs. But I think there is on the Government an obligation to do more than that.  I do not think that we will have discharged our duty to the public if we merely give out to certain lorry owners whatever petrol is available and let them use it as they think best in their own private interests for the conduct of their own particular commercial activities.  I think there is on us an obligation to go down into each <Col N="1313" /> area and see that there exists in that area organised transport services that would ensure the delivery into each part of it of the goods that are essential to the maintenance of the life of the people.</P>
    <P>If our petrol supplies are going to be so contracted that there must be, say, a 50 per cent. reduction in the number of lorries on the road, or else a reduction of 50 per cent. in the operation of existing lorries&mdash;in any event, a reduction by one-half of the transport that will be available on the roads&mdash;is it not clear that there is upon us an obligation to ensure, not merely that certain private individuals will be able to keep in business, but that there will be an organisation of transport services sufficient to ensure that the goods that must be moved, if hardship and famine are to be avoided in isolated districts, can be moved by the services available? That is what we propose to do, but it must be also obvious to Deputies that that cannot be done overnight.  The organisation to do it does not exist.  It has got to be brought into existence. It cannot be brought into existence by Government Order.  It has got to be built up over a period of time and with great care, and clearly the creation and operation of it is going to bring to light problems which anyone studying the position from an office in Dublin cannot be immediately aware of.  Therefore, we think it is desirable that this reorganisation of transport should be begun piecemeal, should be begun now, before the crisis is on us, so that an organisation that will permit of expansion into other areas will exist, and so that the experiences which are necessary in order to ensure its efficiency will have been secured. Deputy Mulcahy says that the North Mayo area is an unsuitable area in which to try it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Mulcahy means by that that it is the area in which this reorganisation could most easily be accomplished and, therefore, that the experience gained in that area will not be valuable when we <Col N="1314" /> try to do the same thing elsewhere, then he may be right.  But, clearly, it is the one area in this country where a reorganisation of road transport services is not only necessary, and necessary now, but can most easily be done. In the North Mayo area, by reason of the contraction of the operation of motor vehicles following upon the curtailment of petrol allocations, transport difficulties have already emerged and, in fact, shortages in particular districts have been recorded.</P>

      <P>Deputies may argue about the difficulties of the country, but that is a matter we will not discuss now.  I am prepared to discuss that at another time.  We have to consider now the problem of transport.  Deputies can stick their heads in the sand and refuse to face the future if they like.  They can go now to the various motor owners, traders, and private lorry owners through the country and say: &ldquo;The Government is interfering unnecessarily with your work.  They can give you petrol on the basis that you have been getting it, at any rate for the present.  There is no reason why they will not be able to continue doing so in the future.&rdquo;  I suggest that if they do that they are not merely doing a bad service to the country, but a bad service to themselves, because inevitably the future is going to prove them wrong.  I do not know what Deputies expect in relation to the future.  I think the emergency is going to continue and that its continuance is going to mean, inevitably, a rapid increase in our <Col N="1315" /> difficulty in maintaining supplies of such commodities as motor spirit. Every day one reads in the newspapers of the destruction of oil wells in all parts of the world, of the sinking of the tankers which transport oil.  That process of destruction, which has been going on for years now, is having a cumulative effect on our ability to keep up supplies here.  Every month and every year that passes means that we are getting less and less motor spirit.  Is there any reason to believe that that contraction of supplies has stopped and that for the future it will remain precisely as it is?  If that is so and if there is no danger of any further contraction of petrol supplies, we will not have to put any more restrictions in force, and with the number of motor vehicles now on the road our transport situation is comparatively easy&mdash;certainly easier than it was going to be.</P>
      <P>If there was no problem about the maintenance of petrol supplies, we still have to look at the situation in relation to the keeping of a supply of tyres.  There will not be a new tyre in this country after the middle of next year, and from that until the end of the war.  Next July the last tyre manufactured from rubber will be fitted to a vehicle, and from that on there will be no more new tyres and not the slightest possibility of any supply of new rubber to permit the manufacture of additional tyres.  That inability to replace tyres in use now will not have an immediate effect on transport services, certainly not the same kind of immediate effect as the announcement that no more petrol was coming would have.  Nevertheless, it is going to make transport a problem for us, a problem of first magnitude, before the war ends.  Are we entitled to ignore the fact that the future holds such a problem for us and to shut or eyes to coming events by going blindly ahead and saying to ourselves: &ldquo;We are still all right to-day; to-morrow can look after itself?&rdquo; I am sure that no Deputy in opposition will make that contention. The Government have to discharge their duty to the people properly and to plan now against that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies propose now to plan ahead.  If I could devise a system by which a reorganised transport service could be brought into operation simultaneously in all parts of the country, and create offhand the organisation to do it, then I would say that it would be better to do it in that way than to apply now a form of control piecemeal in one part of the country after another.  We cannot do that.  We have not the organisation. Therefore we made an order which gives power to schedule certain parts of the country and to operate in these parts the reorganised plans which we have contemplated.</P>
      <P>What are these plans?  We propose to base our main reliance on the public transport services operating according to schedule.  The plan involves the setting up of central depôts in all the important towns, with receiving depôts in every centre of population, and carrying out a regular schedule of services between all these centres.  The services will be organised on the basis of the traffic expected, running from one centre to another on a named day or two days or every day in the week, and will be available for every member of the public who has goods to be transported.  Perhaps, at a later stage, when the services themselves have to be reduced or terminated because of further curtailment of petrol supplies, or the difficulty of replacing tyres, we will have to limit these services to essential classes of goods.  For the moment, it is contemplated that they will carry all goods offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to supplement these organised services running to schedule, by permitting other operators to carry <Col N="1317" /> on as long as possible, and to cater for the classes of traffic that do not lend themselves to the organised schedule services.  The transportation of perishable goods like milk, eggs, or fish from fishing districts in North Mayo, or other parts of the country, cannot easily be carried on on the basis of scheduled services.  If there is only one lorry a week from a particular district to the railhead fish cannot be kept waiting for that lorry, and consequently organised services must be supplemented by allowing a certain number of individual private lorries to be maintained to meet the requirements of this special traffic.  We contemplate doing that so long as it is possible that a supply of petrol for these services can be maintained.  If we get such a system working we can then face with less difficulty the situation which will arise as petrol supplies diminish, because we can contract the principal services of the country gradually by limiting them to essential traffic, and keep essential services going so long as there is anything to keep them going with.  It seems to me that that is the intelligent and the sensible way to proceed.  The alternative, if I understand it, is to give out the petrol and hope that it will be able to meet requirements. I do not think the Government would have faced up to their responsibilities if they acted by that slipshod method.  So far as petrol is concerned I cannot give any guarantee that there will be petrol a month ahead.  There was a time when we received a notification from the petrol companies supplying this country that we were getting no more, and it became necessary, without delay, to impose immediate and drastic restrictions on the use of motor vehicles. Fortunately, the intimation received proved incorrect, and it was found possible to make arrangements which ensured a continuance of supplies, even though it meant at a reduced rate. But, at any moment, it is possible that we may find ourselves without petrol at all.  Certainly, we must not ignore the probability that at some future time we may find ourselves with much less than we have, and we must get ready now for such a contingency.</P>
    <P>That is the whole basis of the Government's <Col N="1318" /> proposals.  That is what this Order is intended to do: to give us power to get into existence an organisation which will enable the transport services to be maintained when these circumstances arise.  If we are ever to have that organisation we must start now.  Deputy Browne says &ldquo;postpone it until after Christmas.&rdquo;  Somebody else may say &ldquo;postpone it until January.&rdquo;  I am quite prepared to take the risk of doing that if the House will share the risk with me, but it may be that it is in January the crisis will come.  I do not know whether it will or not.  It may be at the beginning of next year, just as it was at the beginning of 1941, that we will learn that the crisis that will probably arise is upon us.  It will be too late then to start trying to build up an organisation that will enable these minimum transport services to be maintained into every part of the country.  I think we should start now.  I think that the Deputies opposite, if they were alive to their responsibilities to the public, as distinct from their special interest in those who own lorries, would be criticising the Government because we have not started already.  I think that neither the Lorry Owners' Associations nor individual lorry owners down the country can say that they did not get due warning that this situation was going to arise.  For months past we have been telling them that it was becoming increasingly necessary for us to restrict petrol allocations for lorries. For months past we have been reducing drastically the number of lorries receiving petrol at all, and certain classes of persons engaged in what we regard as non-essential services from the community point of view&mdash;they may be very essential to the individuals conducting them&mdash;have been denied petrol allocations.  In this month of October there is going to be a further drastic reduction in the number of commercial lorries operating on the road.  We are not doing that merely for the pleasure of doing it, but because circumstances are compelling us to do it, and if we go further than that it will be solely because there has been a further worsening of the position.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government can be said to have discharged its responsibility <Col N="1319" /> if it merely takes the available supply of petrol and dishes it around at so many gallons per head among lorry owners.  I think the Government's responsibility requires it to do much more than that.  It has the responsibility of seeing that whatever petrol is there is used for the most essential purposes, and is used to ensure that the transport requirements in every part of the country are met in equal measure.  Objection has been taken to the fact that we are proposing that the public transport services throughout the country be provided by a development of the road transport organisation of the Great Southern Railways Company.  The reason why we chose the road transport organisation of the Great Southern Railways Company is because it is the only organisation there is.  It may be that that organisation has at times, in the past, not proved itself as efficient as we would like to see it, but there is no other organisation that we can use.  The company is now operating under Government direction.  It is controlled by an officer appointed by the Government to see that its activities are carried on in the public interest.  That organisation, which operates throughout the whole country, is capable of being expanded so as to meet the minimum transport requirements in every district.</P>
    <P>There may be some apprehension in the minds of lorry owners that behind this emergency plan there is some idea bearing on the development of a post-war policy.  There is no such idea.  I recognise, as everybody must recognise, that in the post-war period there must be a new development in transport organisation: that we cannot go back merely to the pre-war situation, and that whatever Government is then in office must take major decisions upon matters of transport policy.  This particular plan that we are now proposing to operate is devised to deal with the circumstances of the emergency.</P>

      <P>The particular point that I want the Deputy to understand now is that the decision to utilise the mechanism of the road transport organisation of the Great Southern Railways to provide the services which we regard as essential, so long as they can be provided, is because it is the only machinery there for us.  The plans for the operation of this system in the North Mayo area have been made, and were ready to be brought into operation on the 1st October, and will be brought into operation on the 1st November.  That is what we are contemplating.  I know that many lorry owners in North Mayo have been frightened by what was, in truth, a misconception of the Government's proposals.  They thought that there was some idea that their lorries would be confiscated and handed over to the railway company.  That is not contemplated. What is contemplated is that the railway company, to the extent that they must increase the number of vehicles available for the area, will either purchase or hire these vehicles from existing lorry owners. The other licensed hauliers operating in the area will continue to operate. The persons who are engaged as hauliers in the exempt area round Ballina&mdash;hauliers entitled to operate without a licence&mdash;will continue to operate.  Any person with commonsense will see that it is the obvious step to take.  The railway company, in organising the service in the area, will endeavour to secure a working arrangement with those other licensed hauliers and the operators in the exempt area in order to ensure that there will be no over-lapping between their respective public activities, and that the combined efforts of all will be directed towards serving the essential transport requirements of every district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no intention of confiscating anybody's property.  It may be that a lorry for which there is no petrol will be of very little value to the owner of <Col N="1321" /> it, just as the private motor car, if there is no petrol available for it, is of very little value to its owner.</P>

If we do contemplate a partial reorganisation of transport services now it is because we know that it will not be possible to keep the transport services going upon the present scale.  We know that because the indications are that there will be a further contraction of petrol supplies and, certainly, an inability to replace rubber tyres for the vehicles now in use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Supplies has made us a very long and in parts quite an eloquent speech, but the House is not very much interested in what are merely truisms, no matter how eloquently those truisms may be expressed.  We all know that there is a war on.  It does not require the Minister to tell us that.  We all know there is a petrol shortage.  It does not require the Minister to tell us that.  We know that transports have been sunk; we know that rubber plantations have been destroyed; we know that there is a world shortage of rubber and a world shortage of petrol. We know all that, and it did not require half-an-hour or more of the Minister's eloquence to convey those very simple, obvious and thoroughly well-known facts to the House.  What we are interested in is a scheme to keep down the expenditure of petrol; to see that the same service given now will be given to North Mayo under the new scheme at an expenditure of less petrol than is being used in North Mayo at the present moment.  That is the point at issue.  That is the only point at issue, and that is the one point which the Minister entirely evaded through his whole speech.  What is the good of saying &ldquo;Oh, we must spare petrol,&rdquo; unless the Minister shows that one single gallon of petrol will be spared under his new scheme? Certainly, as far as I could see from his speech, he has not endeavoured to show that that could be in any way effected.  The Minister did not show that there is any overlapping now in North Mayo transport.  The Minister did not attempt to show or suggest to the House that there are privately-owned lorries running empty in North Mayo.  The Minister did not suggest that there is anything except essentials coming into North Mayo, and certainly it seems to me that, from the public point of view, the Minister has not shown that there will be any <Col N="1323" /> saving under this new Order, or that there will be efficiency equal to the present efficiency when this new Order is in force.</P>
      <P>This is a part of the country which has already suffered, and suffered very badly, under the Minister.  How does it come about that North Mayo is in this position now, worse than any other part of this country, according to the Minister?  It is due to the Minister's own policy; it is due to the fact that he closed the Westport-Achill line.  If that railway line had not been closed by the Minister, there would not be the same problem in the Ballycroy area of North Mayo and the Achill area of North Mayo that there is at the present moment.  We are told that this new scheme will effect a saving. Here is the area in Ireland which, according to the Minister himself, is most dependent upon motor traffic; yet it is in the area most dependent upon motor traffic that economy is suddenly started.  It is the area which is dependent on motor traffic for a great deal of its food supply that is now going to be cut down to a lorry a week.  There was a shortage of food in parts of North Mayo&mdash;a considerable shortage of food.  There was a shortage of flour and a shortage of potatoes.  That was not for want of transport but because the stuff was not there.  If the Minister had set to work and organised the potato market in Mayo and other parts of the country, the surplus potatoes in one part of the country could have been brought down to the areas in which there were no potatoes. There was a shortage in Ballycroy because there was no organisation of the potato supply in the country; it was not due to want of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in the area told me the very opposite. I was given the impression that it was not due to the want of transport.  But what was your magnificent railway company doing then?  Were there not <Col N="1324" /> railway lorries running from Westport to Ballycroy?  If there was want of transport over that very line which the Minister closed down, is it not the railway company that is to blame? What is the Minister's answer to that?  The Minister sits dumb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he did.  He authorised them to close it down, and then, because railway transport breaks down, according to himself, in bringing food from Westport to Ballycroy, he now says: &ldquo;I am going to put the whole of North Mayo under the charge of the railway company which is so magnificently efficient.  It has proved itself inefficient; it has proved itself unable to supply transport for food in a particular area, but now I am going to give it a very much larger area in order that it will break down very much more.  Then we will have an example of broken-down transport for the whole area.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's own argument.  As a matter of fact, the Minister is unfair to the railway company, because I do not believe it was the failure of the railway company to provide transport that caused the food shortage in Ballycroy last year.  If we assume with him that it was, then he has damned his own scheme by his own arguments.  He was very voluble a minute ago.  He has ceased to be quite so voluble now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What control will there be over the charges? We know perfectly well at the present moment that the charges for those railway lorries are very high, but, if there is no competition, who is going to regulate the charges?  What are the people in those areas going to pay? At the present moment, there is competition between the various lorry owners and the various merchants, everybody endeavouring to supply his customers as cheaply as he can.  How will the charges be regulated now? Has the Minister thought that out? Has he thought what it might cost a <Col N="1325" /> private lorry owner to bring flour to Ballycroy or to Belmullet?  What does that cost now?  What will it cost when a complete monopoly is given to the railway company, monopolists who, as far as I can see, have most certainly not shown magnificent ability in the management of their affairs, and who are not very generous in the matter of their charges.  I do not want to go into this, Sir, because I would be wandering away from the point at issue, but in my judgment one of the things which must be gone into and ought to have been gone into before this is the terrible load which Irish agriculture has hanging around its neck in the form of the excessive charges which are made for the transport of agricultural produce, especially live stock, from the West of Ireland and from other remote districts in Ireland to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister proposes to put forward a complete monopoly, and he does not attempt to show us that there will be any saving of petrol.  We are all agreed on one major question.  We are all agreed that there is a shortage of petrol in the country.  We are all agreed that there is a grave danger of a still greater shortage.  We are all agreed that the last yard should be got out of the last drop of petrol that there is in the country, and that the last ounce that could be carried by a lorry should be carried.  But the Minister has not attempted to show us that this scheme will make for any economy at all.  I would put it to the sense of justice of the House that if there are areas which are fed by the railway lines, or areas which are fed by canal traffic, those are the areas which should be deprived of petrol before areas which, owing to the action of the Minister or for any other cause, are now dependent solely on horse haulage and petrol.  Those areas where petrol is most used are the areas into which an allowance of petrol should be most freely sent.  The Minister, I submit to the House, has not made a case for his new departure.  The Minister has not suggested that his new departure is going to be in any way effective in supplying the essentials of life to the <Col N="1326" /> people of North Mayo at a lesser cost in petrol than they are being supplied to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be obvious to every Deputy who has given any consideration to the present position of transport that the only way to get the bost use of the limited transport services available is to have transport, whether by road, rail or canal, under a system of national control.  I take it that the experiment upon which the Minister is now engaged is designed to meet the serious situation which he said exists in regard to the reduction in the existing supply of petrol.  If that be so, I think he has not made a very wise decision in selecting the scattered area of Mayo as the area upon which to carry out successfully an experiment of this kind.  I travel through Dublin every day in the week, as other Deputies do, and I see lorries owned by big concerns in this city using large quantities of petrol in bringing goods over short distances, goods that might well be carried by horse transport and for which horse transport is available.  We read in the papers every day that Guinness's shareholders are receiving higher profits because of the way in which they are carrying on their business.  Why should Guinness's, instead of using large quantities of petrol for carrying commodities over very short distances inside the city boundary and for carrying their workers over the short distance from the quays to the brewery, not have all that transport carried on with horses?  In that way you could save much more petrol in the City of Dublin than will be saved in the North Mayo area by this particular experiment. One sees quite a number of private cars going around the city with Dublin registration numbers carrying people who appear to me not to be engaged on any essential work.  I admit that I have no means of checking up to prove my statement, but, if you are going to save petrol and to use horse drawn transport as an alternative.  I say that you can save a considerable quantity by cutting out petrol driven lorries in the cities and using horse transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> The Minister's admission here this evening was a most amazing confession of the failure of his own Department and the Government as a whole in connection with the handling of the transport situation.  I remember listening to the Minister when he sat on this side of the House 11 years ago telling the people, about the January election of 1932, that it was the intention of his Party when they got into office to bring into operation a system of public ownership of our transport services. He has been sitting on the Government Benches for 10½ years, and he has admitted to-night that he has no organisation capable of facing up to that situation.  Is that not a frightful confession of failure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>He had a plan then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, he told us that he had a plan for putting into operation a system of public ownership of transport just as he said he had a plan for other problems, but on his own admission to-night he has no organisation capable of dealing with the situation that he knows to exist in North Mayo.  If he has not a plan after ten and a half years for putting his policy of that time into operation, he is not likely to have it even if he is left there for another ten and a half years.  We must get some other Minister capable of putting the policy of public ownership of transport into operation.  I admit the Minister is confronted with a very serious difficulty in this matter.  The maintenance of road transport in the country depends on the supply of petrol.  Nobody, not even the Minister, can say more than a few weeks in advance what the supply will be, and when I heard him make that confession here this evening it brought back to my mind the famous statement by Deputy Aiken, Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, when he said that if every damn ship were at the bottom of the sea we would get on far better if we only used our brains.  We know where we are now without the tankers and the Minister must know better than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister, instead of going ahead with this experimental scheme <Col N="1328" /> for a small area like North Mayo, to face boldly up to the situation that he knows to exist regarding the shortage of transport as a whole.  There is no way to deal with it except by facing boldly up to it and taking complete control of every commercial lorry, every canal system and every rail system and getting an organisation that will deal with the problem as a whole and make the best use of the limited transport and the limited petrol supply that will be available in future.  If the North Mayo experiment is a success in that particular area with its own peculiarities, what does the Minister propose to do next?  Does he propose to go into South Mayo to experiment for another month and wait for the final results of this experiment perhaps for a couple of years, when there will probably be no tyres, less petrol and a still further reduction in transport by rail?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy's Government made a mess of the railways when they practically closed them down altogether. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said on one occasion that he was not alone the chosen spokesman of workers, but that he was also the chosen spokesman of a railwayman's party and that he was going to keep the railways going.  Instead of doing so, he has allowed the railways to collapse. Now he comes along, impelled by force of circumstances brought about by his own weakness, and he is going to paralyse the road services of the country.  He is starting in North Mayo to do that.  Does the Minister suggest, when he states that he has no organisation, that he cannot get an Irishman of brains to tackle the problem that he sees better than anybody else in front of him?  I believe the person put in charge of the Great Southern Railway Company would not say so.  I believe he would know whether he has an organisation ready, or whether he could get it ready within a reasonable time, to take national control of the whole transport services of the country.  I believe the present chairman of the Great Southern Railways, nominated by the Government, would not shirk that responsibility if he were asked to face it. There are many here in this country <Col N="1329" /> who are as well able to do a job of that kind as can be found in any other country.  We always have the idea&mdash; and it has been applied in the insurance line&mdash;that you must get some brainy fellow from outside to revolutionise the transport system, the insurance system and other systems.  There are better men in this country than in any other country to deal with our particular problems, as the very fact that they belong to this country makes them able to know the particular problems here better than anybody outside.  Besides that, they are dealing with the interests of their own country.</P>
    <P>If I am faced with a vote on this particular annulment motion moved by Deputy Mulcahy, I must say that no case has been made for the annulment of the Order and, although feeling aggrieved at the failure of the Government, and of the Minister in particular, to face a solution of this problem on national lines, I would be compelled to go into the Division Lobby and back the Minister on his method of going easy to find a final solution of this matter, rather than move for the annulment of the Order for the reasons given by Deputies Mulcahy and Browne.</P>
    <P>The Minister pretended he did not hear Deputy Browne talk about the 15 hours per day which workers were forced to work under the system now in North Mayo.  I ask Deputy Browne what these unfortunate people are receiving in remuneration for that 15-hour day.  It is an illegal method of employment, as far as I know, under existing conditions.  I ask what wages per week they are paying.</P>

I would not stand for a continuance of that system, as against the system&mdash; although I am not acquainted with the details&mdash;which the Minister proposes to operate as an experiment.  Between the devil and the deep sea, I would go into the Lobby with the Minister in support of his experimental scheme rather than support the annulment of the Order.</P>

      <P>We do not wish to minimise the difficulties the Minister has to face, or the magnitude of the problem that confronts the country.  I am inclined to agree with the Minister that this is probably the greatest problem this country has to face during the emergency.  We do not want any gratuitous advice from the Minister to face it in a realistic way and without putting our heads in the sand.  We appreciate that the problem is there and we have experience of it around the country.  The agriculturists, <Col N="1331" /> under very difficult conditions, have attempted to produce the essential food requirements of the nation. Transport enters largely into that, and we, as a Party here, are just as anxious as the Minister to see that some sort of skeleton service is preserved, no matter how difficult the situation may be.  We realise that further economies must be effected, that services must be cut, that wastage must be eliminated, that the running of lorries light or empty must be avoided as far as possible and reduced to a minimum. The diminution in the petrol supplies is a very serious problem and it may be far more serious in the near future. Realising the gravity of that situation, and in this set of circumstances, I think we are entitled to ask if there is any justification whatever for the high-handed, dictatorial and arbitrary proposal of the Minister.</P>
      <P>True to the form of Deputy Lemass, without any consultation, without any indication whatever, like a bolt from the blue, the people of Mayo were informed that this Order was to come into operation on a certain date.  Is the Minister or the Civil Service such a great authority on transport problems that, without any consultation and without advice from anyone in this country, they can determine the best solution to this problem; and, by an abuse of the Emergency Powers Act, inform the public that they must abide by that decision?  That is what we object to.  Has the Parliament of this country any function in the life of the nation, or is this House a farce? Is this a totalitarian State or where are we heading for?  We might as well close up this House and let the people know where they stand.  The Minister must realise that people will not stand for that sort of thing.  He has had experience of this matter before in another case, not very many months ago, and he had to climb down very quickly.  As a responsible Minister, surely one might expect him to have learned a lesson from that and not repeat the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only when the Leader of the Opposition protested against that <Col N="1332" /> method of handing the problem that Parliament got an opportunity to discuss this matter.  A solution has been put up by the people in North Mayo. I have not examined that proposal; it may or may not be a solution.  Before any drastic Order of this sort was brought into operation, I claim, as a member of this House, and as a representative of the public, that we were entitled to full and frank information on whatever scheme the Minister proposed to operate.  If there is any danger of this Parliament being brought into disrepute, the man who, more than any other member of the House, can be charged with the responsibility in that respect is Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

I do not think the Minister can claim to have a monopoly of the brains of this country behind him in this Department with public evidence of all the blunders that have occurred there; the Department is very far from being in that position.  The Minister will persist in going from one serious situation to another, and he will deal with it on his own or on the advice of civil servants cloistered in a Department in Earlsfort Terrace.  Not one of them has any experience in the handling of transport.  The Minister is resentful if members of the House protest against that situation.  The public must knuckle down to a scheme because the Minister says so.  I can assure him that the public are not prepared to do any such thing.  Deputies have a right to demand that the House should first be informed of drastic proposals of this sort.  My mind was eased somewhat when the Minister assured us that there was no question of confiscation.  I can understand the people in Mayo misunderstanding the Order.  In the Fianna Fáil paper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> of 28th August, this short paragraph appeared:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In reference to this matter, private lorry owners whose vehicles <Col N="1333" /> are taken over will receive compensation, the basis of which will be determined later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that does not give the impression of compulsory acquisition, I do not know how to interpret English, I do not know the meaning of English.

      <P>It is not because it lacked control and direction, but because it lacked the co-operation of the workers.  Lorries operated by private owners beat them to it in the past.  Before the war we saw that valuable property in a state of dilapidation and decay, and yet they were crying out for monopoly.  There was no courtesy on the part of the railway servants, no attempt to co-operate in the taking or discharging of a load, and all over the country private ownership beat them.

      <P>I am just giving the facts.  In the past the railway workers were discourteous and failed to give their co-operation.  They had no interest in the goods they carried, and very often they abused the goods they carried.  Deputy Davin accused Deputy Mulcahy's Government of making a mess of the railways.  The company and the workers made a mess of the railways; no Government made a mess of them.  The Minister proposes to hand over the transport of part of the country to a dud company in the course of a great crisis.  I would not put them in charge of a wheel-barrow &mdash;that is how I feel about that company. I would not trust them with anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should lorry owners, who have shown their efficiency, be handed over to a company of that type?  Why should that type of company be given a monopoly of the transport, letting them charge what they like for their services&mdash;and we know what the charges are going to be when they have the people at their mercy?  That is the only solution the Minister and his cloistered civil servants can find.  They know so much about transport that they are not prepared to consult anyone.  The Minister sneers and jibes at Deputies of this Party because they resent action of that sort.  We want to impress on the Minister that in any situation that requires drastic action, the people concerned ought to be consulted.  The Minister has repeatedly ignored the interests of the people who are most concerned. I say it is the Minister's duty to consult these people first.  Instead of doing so, he has treated them with contempt&mdash;and this is not the first occasion on which he has acted in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that it is not the intention to introduce compulsory acquisition.  The <Col N="1335" /> public could not be blamed for interpreting the Order as meaning compulsory acquisition.  I am very much inclined to suspect that the Minister mended his hand when he saw the formidable opposition to the Order.  I suggest that before there is any drastic change in the present transport scheme, the people who know something about transport, who have long experience in the operation of transport and in supplying transport services, should be consulted and their advice taken.  We have in this country good Irishmen, sincerely anxious for the nation's welfare, men capable of giving advice to the Minister without taking a narrow view.  Evidently the Minister suspects that every other person takes the narrow point of view about everything.  Apparently there is no patriot in the country but the Minister.  I think he is very much mistaken there, because you will get public-spirited men prepared to give sound advice on national problems of this sort.</P>
    <P>It is the arbitrary, high-handed, dictatorial action of the Minister that we resent.  Such problems have had to be tackled in other countries.  Were their methods examined?  Deputy Browne suggested a solution which is worthy of the Minister's consideration.  The British solution was to appoint a transport officer to an area and allocate a petrol quota for that area, and that officer gives personal supervision to the operation of transport in that area.  I think it is time to decentralise the Minister's Department, so far as transport and petrol and kerosene supplies are concerned.  It is impossible for a civil servant to interpret what is simply put down in a form, to segregate the returns made by the honest man anxious to give genuine and sincere information and the fellow who tries to make a good case.  I admit there is a problem and that waste must be eliminated.</P>

Has he consulted anybody who might be looked upon as an authority on transport problems, or does he think that he is capable of solving all these problems?  I ask the Minister if the British system has been examined with a view to seeing how it could be applied here.  They appoint a transport officer for an area and the returns have to be made to him.  He has these advantages, that he has all the local knowledge; he has the local superintendent of police to help him; and he is on the spot all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a district somewhat similarly situated to North Mayo.  I regret that I had not the advantage of hearing Deputy Browne's solution for his area, but I think the Minister's solution is the only one in present circumstances, provided there are one or two safeguards.  I personally do not think that all the private transport in the scheduled area should be handed over to the control of the Great Southern Railways Company, but that all the available transport ought to be pooled, in the sense that the traffic to be conveyed in an area ought to be pooled, registered in central offices in one or two places and then allocated to the various lorries in the district.  I think that privately-owned lorries ought to be continued in private ownership and control under the new arrangement, and I refer particularly to the lorries owned by large distributors in places like Galway City, who carry the greater part of the food supplies of an area like Connemara. It would be much better from the point of view of efficiency of distribution if these owners were allowed to continue to own and control their lorries and their traffic, provided always that return traffic should, as far as possible, be sent in these lorries when they are returning light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain practical difficulties in the case of the distributor who has a lot of empties to bring back, or who has a lot of bags, boxes and cases which are lent to his customer from one journey to another.  That type of traffic cannot always be handled satisfactorily by a public company like the railway company.  I suggest, however, that that safeguard should be provided, whereby all this transport would not be handed over to the Great Southern Railways Company.  I <Col N="1338" /> am afraid I find myself in sympathy to a large extent with what Deputy Hughes has said.  I do not know whether it is the fault of the Great Southern Railways Company itself.  I am not against public ownership in principle if I thought it was the method by which we could solve our problems, and, even in peace-time, I think I would be in favour of it.  I am not, as I say, against it on principle, but so far as I have seen it operate in my own area, at all events, I am not impressed by it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made an attack on the Minister in connection with the railways. In my own district, we had 50 miles of railway which closed down, and, as one individual Deputy, I went several times to the railway authorities in connection with the matter.  I asked them if there were any considerations which would induce them to keep that line open, and I asked if they would keep it open if the Government were to come to their aid financially. I was told quite bluntly: &ldquo;We do not want any Government money by way of loan or grant.  If our railway were paying, we would keep it in order and continue to run it.  What we want is the support of the public and not the support of the Government. We want traffic, and if we can get a guarantee in respect of traffic, we will run the railway, but the public do not want us down there any more, and we are going out.&rdquo;  That was the sum and substance of their attitude, and, in the circumstances, I had no reply to make to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the average man in Connemara is concerned, he does not see much difference between control of the railway and public ownership.  The services which they got by road were far better.  The railway down there was run through a <Col N="1339" /> bog and all the stations were miles away from the villages, and the road services which came later were far more convenient, because people got their merchandise, their letters and their papers landed practically at their doors in the villages and got them early.  We did carry on a campaign, when a big housing drive was going on, to try to get the people to use the railway for the transportation of building materials, which was a type of traffic obviously suited to the railways, and we met the same reply in every place.  The man buying the materials said: &ldquo;Why should I use the railway where my goods will be loaded and unloaded four or five times, when I can have my goods carried with one loading and one unloading, and at a much cheaper rate?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All these things operated against the railway, but in any event all that traffic would not have gone from the railway to the road services, if the road services had not been there.  We might ask ourselves why they were there.  There was no let or hindrance whatever on anybody who wanted to go to a bank and raise the price of a lorry or a bus and put it on the road, with the result that what we had in Connemara was not road services but road races.  There were five companies running on one stretch of 30 miles and travelling in those days was not safe.  The majority of these companies went bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one extreme, and the other is what we would probably have under Deputy Davin's solution of public ownership.  I think that some compromise between the two can and ought to be found.  I think that as much of the transport, in places like my constituency anyway, as can be arranged to be owned and operated by private enterprise should be operated by private enterprise.  We have a number of privately-owned lorries, and I think that these ought not to be handed over to the railway company. Whatever system the Minister has, he ought to try to bring them in and let these people control and run their own lorries, employing their own men, subject to a pooling of the traffic.  I cannot <Col N="1340" /> see why the employment exchanges of that area could not be used for the regulation of that traffic.  Let the railway company be a party to the pooling arrangement same as the private owners.  I do not know what the position of Mayo was last spring but, as far as my area is concerned, I do not think that the shortages that occurred last year were entirely due to transport. I must say that the Galway distributors did their work well and sent out the flour supplies as soon as they reached them.  In portion of Connemara, the difficulties may have been due to transport&mdash;the roads in that area run east to west&mdash;but the arrangements of large distributors, such as we have in Galway, on whom the bulk of the food supply for Connemara depends, ought to be interfered with as little as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the railway company or any publicly-owned company will be able to give the service that these distributors give, whether at the present time or in peace-time. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.  Subject to that, I think that the Minister's idea of pooling the traffic is an admirable one and is justified 100 per cent. by present conditions. I do not think that there is anything in what Deputy Hughes said about this matter being dealt with in high-handed fashion.  The fact that we are discussing it here is ample evidence that it was not so dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, as I had business in a Department of Government, I missed most of the debate and had not an opportunity of hearing the Minister.  The House is indebted to the Leader of the Opposition and to the movers of the motion for giving it an opportunity of debating this matter, thus preventing the Minister from getting &ldquo;one over&rdquo; on the people in another advance towards general centralisation. The tendency for the last decade has been gradually towards the centralisation, not alone of transport but of practically every branch of the public service.  I deplore that tendency. The Minister has, probably, said that this is not an attempt to centralise transport but has been forced upon him by the petrol shortage.  That may <Col N="1341" /> be so but, if a monopoly is created temporarily, it will remain.  Drive the private vehicles off the road and you will have a rail monopoly working, as I believe, to the disadvantage of the general community.  If the movers of the motion had not taken the action they did, the Minister would have got &ldquo;one over&rdquo; on us.  This proposal would have been an accomplished fact. I do not know whether the debate in the House will prevent it or not, but I hope it will.  Surely there is some other way of meeting the situation than by handing over all the transport to one company?  I am not going to say anything at all about that company except that private enterprise is more likely to facilitate the public than any public company with headquarters in the metropolis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private lorry owners are much more in touch with local people, and much more likely to facilitate them than any big company, no matter how well managed, and we are not all satisfied about the management of this company.  Take local conditions as we know them.  I was a spectator this year when two railway lorries came to cart away a man's produce which was about a quarter of a mile in the fields from the road.  The railwaymen refused to go beyond the road, and the man had to borrow horses to bring the stuff to the lorries on the road.  The produce had been bought by a man who got railway lorries to remove it.  Another purchaser got his transport done by the local co-operative society.  The employees of that society who came with the lorries had no objection to going into the fields, taking off their coats and helping the farmer to load his produce on the lorries.  That is an instance of co-operation on the part of private enterprise as against lack of co-operation by a public company. Those instances could be multiplied by other Deputies.  Surely, there is some way out even if the Minister makes the case that this change is forced upon him by the petrol shortage.  Deputy Hughes suggested that we might follow the example of the British and appoint transport officers for the different areas.  There must be some individuals in every locality as capable as the <Col N="1342" /> management of the G.S.R. who could provide for the transport of their district. If there is a shortage of petrol, it should be everybody's desire that what petrol there is should be used to the best possible advantage, and that the greatest amount of goods should be carried by it.  Will a greater quantity of goods be carried on the limited quantity of petrol available by a monopoly than by private owners?  I believe the reverse will be the case.  If you cut down the petrol supply to an infinitesimal amount, you force upon the private owners the necessity of conserving their supplies and taking the last ounce out of them in the way of carriage of goods.  It is to their interest to do so.  To say that there is no way out of the difficulty than the centralisation of transport is ridiculous.  It suggests that the people are incapable of facing up to a difficulty in any circumstances. I believe that they are as capable of facing up to a situation as is the Minister or any public company. If this Order had gone through without the House being given an opportunity of discussing it, it would have been put into operation in Mayo.  If there were no protest in Mayo, it would have been extended to the next district, and within a few months the system would be in operation in every county&mdash;as a temporary measure, we would be told.  But the temporary measure would develop into a permanent measure and we would have a new monopoly of the whole transport services, as there is a monopoly of the passenger services at present.</P>
    <P>It would have very far-reaching effects.  Take the position of the co-operative societies.  There are in this country a very large number of big co-operative societies&mdash;there are three or four of them in my own county&mdash; with a service of lorries for the carrying on of their business with people, and they do the public carrying of these people as well.  They facilitate them in every way possible, in a way that no public monopoly like the Great Southern Railways could possibly do it.  They arrange for carrying goods one way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why attack one set as against another?  I agree that if petrol is short you must cut out somebody. Why not distribute the petrol to the best advantage?  If I had my way and had only 20 gallons of petrol, instead of 40 formerly, for a certain number of people, I would distribute the 20 gallons proportionately amongst that number and let them make the best use they could of it.  I believe they could come to some pooling arrangement.  I believe that if they were left to themselves to develop and put up a scheme they would put up a scheme which would be of more advantage to the country than this scheme of the Minister's. But the point I want to make is that the Minister wanted indirectly to get away with a scheme for the centralisation of transport in this case with a view to advancing to a general policy of centralisation everywhere. We have too much of that.  I think it is time it was attacked, and I am glad that this motion was brought in to attack it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I think the suggestion made by Deputy Hughes is a reasonable one, that a transport officer or a small committee should be appointed in each district to consider the circumstances there, and to make the best arrangement in consultation with the carriers as to how the situation should be met. I do not believe the Minister has considered this matter as carefully as he ought to have considered it.  I believe that he just made a dash at the easiest possible way out, which was to wipe everybody out except this company, and give them the whole carrying business of a particular district.  If it is done in this place, it will be possible to do it in the rest of the country if this Order stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the weaknesses of the Parliamentary system is that a Ministerial statement may be more concerned with a picture of problems than with a detailed explanation of the method proposed to solve them. In this case the Minister's statement had in it some inherent weaknesses. First of all, we were not given any information regarding the resources at the disposal of the public carrying company which we inferred from the Minister's statement he proposes to charge with responsibility for the transport of the country.  Nor did he give any information regarding the number of privately-owned lorries or those which are the property of public hauliers.  When the Minister interjects to say that some of the speakers on this side leaned towards the owners of private lorries carrying goods as distinct from the lorries of a public company carrying goods, he ignores the fact that somebody must carry the goods somewhere.  The immediate ownership of the goods is not in question. However small a village may be, if goods are required to be carried there for the public, the goods that are brought there are public goods, and it matters little to the people there whether it is the lorry of a public company which brings them or a privately-owned lorry.  The main consideration for them is that they get the goods and that the cost of transport is not too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information in regard to this <Col N="1346" /> particular problem is that there are some 8,000 privately-owned lorries in the State; that this public company has some 2,000 lorries, and that there are haulage lorries to the number of about 1,200.  Viewing it on that basis alone, it appears to me that the private lorry owners are business men, and that they expect a return for the service that is rendered by their lorries; that it is an economic proposition; that they are carrying the greater quantity of goods and that they are in essence the larger hauliers.  However one may describe the private carriers, they are in essence the largest collection of carriers in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Our problem is a shortage of petrol and tyres.  Would it not be better in a case of this sort to consult those who have been carrying the largest and heaviest quantity of goods as to how best one can reduce the consumption of petrol and conserve our stock of tyres?  The Minister's proposal, if I correctly interpret it, is to expand one service, and the question is whether it is a better proposition to expand one service than to contract one which is already in existence and which represents twice the number of those who are described as public carriers, if the figures I have given are correct.  These people know their business.  They deal with traders.  They collect goods from the railroad.  It may be an easier proposition for them to collect goods for other people than for their own particular concerns.  It may be a more economic proposition than to have, let us say, a business man in the town in which Deputy Browne lives, having his goods delivered to his shop by his own lorry and having goods delivered to the next shop by a lorry from the railway company.  That is the situation at present.  It would be important to get from the Minister what actual reduction must be made in the distribution of petrol.  My information is that the Minister informed these people that he could only give them one-quarter of their usual supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Our present supply is <Col N="1347" /> only one-quarter of what we formerly used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate being able to keep up that one-quarter?  Will he venture to give any estimate as to what reduction must be made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of this year's allocation of petrol to this country we have had to impose a number of restrictions on petrol users, but even all these restrictions have not brought down the monthly consumption of petrol below the monthly allocation of petrol.  So that, even if there is no reduction in our annual allocation, we would still have to redress the balance between our monthly consumption of petrol and our monthly allocation here, but if there is a further cut in our annual allocation, there will have to be a very drastic cutting all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that however efficiently or inefficiently the lorry-owner business is being conducted at present&mdash;and my information is that it is being conducted very efficiently&mdash;even if they were carrying to only half their estimated capacity, it would still be an economic proposition, and if they were carrying to full capacity, then, perhaps, half of the 8,000 lorries would do the business.  Is it suggested that people who are in close touch with this carrying business are to be put on one side, and that somebody, who has not been engaged in that business up to now, has got to come in?  It must be remembered that this district to which we are referring is probably, I imagine, the largest area in the country which depends almost entirely for its transport service on the privately-owned lorry. These people know the business.  They are in touch with its requirements. They know their customers, and, as one Deputy has said, they deliver goods and get back empties.  Now, that is not a business in which the public transport company can do this new work, as far as they are concerned, and it does appear to me, on the face <Col N="1348" /> of it, to be much more likely that, with the co-operation that would be given by the lorry owners, and the responsibility that would be put on them for dealing with the whole transport question, they might do it much more efficiently than the public transport company.  My information is that it is on a plane something like that by which the British have solved their problem over there.  The British have got the co-operation of all the persons engaged in the carrying business&mdash;the privately-owned lorries, and so on&mdash; and they have been able to carry on very efficiently.  There have been many criticisms of the public transport company.  Some of them are unreasonable, I admit, and some of them not, but if one reads very carefully the report of the Railway Tribunal, I think it will be found that the public transport company would not have been in the unfortunate financial position in which they were when the emergency arose if they had not paid dividends that they did not earn.  That is the main concern, and that is a fault, I think, that the lorry owners would not have committed, taking them as a body.  They would balance their budgets year after year, they would see and correct anything wrong in their undertakings, and we must assume that they have made a success of their business since they have been able to deliver goods at a lower price than the public transport company, and, after all, that is one of the principal tests that should be applied in connection with the efficiency or inefficiency of public usefulness.  If we are to take it on that basis, then it is obvious that these lorry owners must not have wasted either petrol or tyres, and that they must have got value for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, following the same line of argument, if we examine the report of the Railway Tribunal, I think it will be seen that the road services that were operated by the public transport company were not brilliantly successful. As far as my recollection goes, the goods-carrying section of the public transport service was always, more or less, on the line-ball basis, but if the lorry owners in the West of Ireland <Col N="1349" /> were on a line-ball basis, they would not last long.  Now, let us deal with that.  I admit that it would be quite hopeless for us to try to deal with the 26 Counties separately, if that number were involved, on that basis, or even with 13.  I agree that, theoretically, that is quite true, but I should prefer to have the co-operation of the people of these 26 Counties, so as to safeguard every man's interest and the Minister's interest, and to have every man made aware of the fact that there is a limited quantity of petrol and tyres available, and that he must get the maximum amount of usefulness out of them.  Again, if one were to take just a view of what has been done by the State in connection with the supply of turf throughout the country, you have lorry-loads of turf coming up here to centres like Dublin or Cork, and so on, and then going back empty, although they are capable of carrying goods on the return journey.  Surely, there must be some goods to carry back?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity of goods coming in is at least double the quantity of goods going out, and some of these lorries must go back empty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but one of the difficulties in connection with the facilities that were afforded to race meetings was that an extra box had to be put on to bring a horse or two horses to the race meeting, and that extra box meant the utilization of more coal.  If the transportation of turf had been arranged properly, you could have put on that extra box, and it would not have meant very much.  However, all I say is that I would give a lot to have the co-operation of the people of this country with regard to this particular problem.  We need not go back to the period of 10 years ago, or even prior to that, to realise how it was hammered into the people's ears that everything should not be centred in Dublin&mdash;that there should be decentralisation instead of centralisation. Here is an opportunity now for decentralisation and for putting on the shoulders of the people in their different areas a responsibility which the people themselves are willing to carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> I would much prefer that an endeavour should be made to seek their co-operation in serving themselves and the country.  I believe in giving them the fullest information as to the quantity of petrol you have and in telling them how, if it is abused, it means that somebody will run short of milk, butter, and so on.  I think it would be much better to examine that side of it, and, from what I have heard, if the Minister were to take that line, he would get all the co-operation he needed from men of good will to help him in his problem.  For instance, I met men last week, and I used all the arguments of the Minister in order to get the essence of what they thought, and they could not be shaken in their determination, which was to help in this matter if their help were availed of by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that every Deputy is anxious to help the Minister in this problem of transport, but I would suggest that, as the petrol supply is the crux of the whole matter, the Minister should see that his own house, the Government, is put in order first.  I have had experience recently in my district, and I can visualise the situation that is happening in Mayo today being extended down to Cork tomorrow, or in a month's time.  I have seen military lorries travelling empty from Ballincollig, outside Cork City, to Castlefreke, in West Cork, a distance of 40 miles, collecting timber there and hauling it to Ballincollig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that if there is going to be criticism of the administration of the Army it had better be directed to the Minister for Defence.  As far as the Army is concerned, I have no responsibility for the utilisation of petrol and I could not answer the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to answer.  I am dealing with a case in point where petrol could be conserved.  I am giving a case of lorries travelling empty from Ballincollig to Castlefreke, collecting timber there and bringing back to Ballincollig a small load of timber that no other lorry would be seen on the road with, <Col N="1351" /> while at the same time there is timber available in Ballincollig at a small price, which could be cut there.  I do not know why there is such abuse and I think the Minister should direct his attention to it and see that such things will not occur.  Deputy Davin mentioned the fact that within the city boundary in Dublin and Cork lorries are doing work that horses could do. In the past few days I have seen buses running normal services in the city.</P>
      <P>If the petrol situation is the real cause for this Order, why is there not a curtailment of these services?  Why start in Belmullet and compel the poor fellow in Belmullet to walk long distances? The Dublin City person will not walk a few yards if a bus is available, while the poor person in Belmullet or Cape Clear may have to walk 12 miles to get his business done. Why not make some attempt to conserve the supply of petrol and give the isolated areas some facilities&mdash;they could not get equal facilities&mdash;but some facilities that would bring them into line with the areas that are better served?</P>
      <P>My experience is that the private lorry owner is a much more efficient worker for country services.  As has been explained by other Deputies, private lorry owners are well established; they know their customers; they know where to deliver and where to collect goods.  I am not satisfied that if you establish a new service it will be anything like as efficient.  I believe there would be more wastage. I do not wish to intervene further, but I would suggest that where they would be suitable, horses should be substituted for lorries and buses functioning in Dublin or Cork.  The petrol thus conserved could be given to isolated areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that this whole <Col N="1352" /> crisis has arisen because of the sudden petrol shortage.  We were told long ago by the Minister that there was an allocation this year of 12,000,000 gallons.  I was called out of the House and did not hear the Minister finish his speech, but I wonder if there has been any breakdown in the supply.  If there has not been a breakdown in the supply and if the Minister allocated the supply in a businesslike way, what is the reason for the present crisis? The Minister now starts an experiment in Mayo, an experiment drafted by civil servants.  Everybody who knows the country understands that nobody can perform country services as efficiently as the private owner who himself is a country man and who understands country people.  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the fact that in Dublin lorries are doing work that horses could do.</P>
      <P>Six months ago I raised the question in this House&mdash;why were lorries being used to shift timber from Dun Laoghaire station to a dump 200 yards away. They are still at it.  The distance is so short that they have not to tie the timber on the lorry.  A horse would bring as large a load and as many loads.  That is being done by Fuel Importers, Limited&mdash;in other words, the Government.  About 8,000 tons of timber have been so shifted from Dun Laoghaire station to a dump called the &ldquo;Gut&rdquo;, 200 yards away. Why were not horses put on that work?  In face of the petrol restrictions, we sent fleets of lorries from Dublin City across the Shannon for turf, and they came back with 1,004 tons of turf to Dublin, using about 26 gallons of petrol to bring 3 or 4 tons of turf.  Would any big country that is engaged in this war do such a thing? I think if the Minister had any shame in him he would resign for the way he has mishandled the supplies position generally and the petrol position in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was inevitable that we would have to fall back on petrol to bring fuel to Dublin.  Why was not that petrol used to bring the maximum amount of fuel? I do not want to mention a case that the Minister knows of, where five times the amount of fuel could be brought <Col N="1353" /> into Dublin with the same amount of petrol, and I challenge the Minister to contradict it.  Forty tons of fuel could be brought to Dublin with 26 gallons of petrol.  Four tons of turf were brought.  Now, abruptly, everything is brought to a standstill because of a shortage of petrol which was wasted bringing turf over long distances instead of bringing in fuel that was available within short distances. Now&mdash;is it another bogey like Fuel Importers, Limited?&mdash;we want to waste petrol and &ldquo;put it over&rdquo; on the County Mayo.  How did the private owners of lorries in Mayo and elsewhere get business?  They got it because they went out and developed it. Where was your railway company then?  Where were your big combines? It seems that this country is being run now for one purpose only, and that is to wipe out the small man and to give everything over to combines after the small man has done the development. We all know that the railway company or the tramway company would not put a bus on the road 20 years ago.  It was small men, who had saved a few pounds, or who mortgaged everything, developed the bus traffic.  Then when it was developed it was handed over to combines, and the taxpayers had to hand over thousands of pounds to compensate the pioneers of that traffic.  It is terrible to hand business over to any company that cannot run its own business efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is no use in marching from inefficiency to inefficiency.  This experiment that is to be made in Mayo will then be tried all over the country in order to deal with local transport services. Why did the railways company not develop local transport services to join up with their services?  They had not the foresight, the intelligence or the industry to do that.  Those who did it are now to be brushed aside. I hope every Deputy will support the motion, in order to tell the Minister &ldquo;where to get off&rdquo;.  People in the country know their work, and they can do it if they are allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain to the House how the quota of 1,000,000 gallons of petrol was distributed monthly.  Imagine a managing director <Col N="1354" /> who was running a business being told that at the end of December the petrol supply would be halved and that half the commercial vehicles would be put off the road.  I have not seen any statement by the Minister informing the country that the 12,000,000 gallons of petrol would not arrive this year. Why should there not be as much available in October as in September? Was the Minister not planning ahead? People who carry on business must plan ahead.  They cannot wait to be told one morning that the transport they need is not available.  I should like the Minister to inform anxious people in my constituency about the petrol position.  If he is forced to take over control in Mayo, I suggest that a similar decision will follow in Dublin. The petrol situation in County Dublin is so serious that milk distributors are without a supply.  It is time that the Minister informed the country whether the promises of supplies that were made are being honoured.  I have pretty good information from petrol sources that these promises are being honoured.  Has the position been mismanaged? If the new luxury flying service to Limerick is encroaching on petrol supplies, the sooner flying for the privileged few is stopped the better, so that petrol can be used to drive lorries.  What would keep one aeroplane up in the air for one hour would drive a six-ton lorry for a month.  I am speaking from inside knowledge.  The Minister need not shake his head.</P>

Certainly electricity legislation was given to an organisation which was set up to take over compulsorily the supplying of electricity by people who were selling it to the public, but it left alone those who produced electricity for their own use.  In various types of transport legislation, the one thing definitely excepted from the whole purview of that legislation was the companies or the men carrying their own goods.  They were definitely excepted from any transport legislation, the simple device being to say that such carriage was not carriage for reward. The only traffic interfered with was carriage for reward.  Now we are going to interfere with people who carry their own goods.  We are interfering in County Mayo, a county which does not offer itself as a proper area for an experiment of this kind to be tried.  The second thing is this, that quite a number of cases were before a tribunal in connection with the confiscation of certain property of a transport type, and the one thing that emerged from these cases was this, that the very railway company that found itself in a peculiar situation in Ballina, Mayo, was given as one example.  The railway company found that 30 people were licensed to carry.  They confiscated ten, feeling that they could deal with the other 20, but they then found that they had 40 people to deal with, the reason being that some merchants who had entrusted the carrying of the ordinary transport that they required to hauliers&mdash;not of the railway type&mdash; would not trust the railway when they got a monopoly.  These men found it more economical to go into the business of haulage, even to carry their own goods, as they certainly would not find it as easy as licensed hauliers to get cargoes each way.  Nevertheless, they went into the carrying of their own goods and they found it paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> Now we are taking a step by which that type of economy is to be done away with.  The Minister's problem in the situation in which he has allowed us to be landed, is that he must collapse transport into a smaller number of vehicles.  Very good.  There are two alternatives.  Let the men who carry their own goods see if they can collapse carriage with their lorries, and so save petrol, tyres and parts. The alternative is to allow these people and their economic business to be handed over to those from whom they fled in horror.  The Minister adopts the worse of the two alternatives. He is handing over this to a public transport company.  The Minister knows, if he read the evidence given before the tribunal set up to report on transport, and which reported before the war started, that on certain points those who sat on that inquiry refused to hear any more witnesses, to say whether a private owned concern could carry goods at a cheaper rate and provide a better service than railway vehicles.  They stated that they required no more evidence, because that was admitted as a result of the evidence.  That is an admitted fact, and was reported as such to the Minister.  The Minister now decides, when he has to make this particular collapse of traffic in the number of vehicles, to select people who proved and admitted that they run an uneconomic and a bad service, and that service is now going to be run at the expense of the private body.</P>

      <P>I am not going to put Deputy Davin into the awkward situation of having to go into the same Lobby as the Minister, so that he can go with all his pure political atmosphere around him to his next public meeting.  This motion was put down for the purpose of getting the Minister to state to the House what he proposed to do.  We had a very confused statement from him.  To annul the Order before us would put us in the position that we would likely have the plans which the Minister has prepared for Belmullet and the North Mayo area generally applied to the country as a whole.  We have not yet seen the Minister's Order.  The most <Col N="1357" /> that one could learn from his statement this evening was that he is going to prevent the private lorry owners getting petrol to run their lorries after some unspecified date.  That date was to have been the 1st October.  The Leader of the Opposition felt that, before the radical changes proposed were put into effect, we should have a complete statement in Parliament from the Minister.</P>
      <P>This Order affects a very large class who have been providing a transport service in the country.  The general scheme of the Order is to hand over this transport service to the railway company and the licensed hauliers, the railway company to have the controlling hand.  The Minister suggests that something must be done, that he is going to do it, and that everybody else is simply saying, &ldquo;wait until tomorrow.&rdquo; The opening case that we made here was that, as long ago as the 4th April, 1941, the National Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association represented all the facts to the Minister.  They asked that they should be faced and that they be allowed to give their service.  Who was better entitled to offer their service&mdash;that they should be allowed into the scheme &mdash;than those who had given the service which has been so well described by Deputy Cosgrave and by Deputy McGilligan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 4th April, 1941, the Minister had concocted this scheme.  He issued this Order on the 27th August, 1942, without ever having bowed his crested head to meet the representatives of this association.  He actually did not meet them until the 8th October, 1942. Who is the president of this organisation? The man who presided at the biggest parade of the volunteer defence organisations that I have ever attended. It was held in Limerick some months ago.  He is the man who was taking time by the forelock in April, 1941.  He is not a man who is looking after his own interests, or the interests of a small class outside his own particular business, but one who is in the thick of the voluntary organisation work that is going on for our defence. The Minister is simply disrupting and bursting up the whole possibilities of <Col N="1358" /> our people in dealing with the various problems which are going to arise in the present situation by treating organisations of this kind and men of that class in the way that he has treated them in this instance.  I want to warn the Minister that in applying this experiment to Mayo he is applying it to the worst area in the country to which he could apply it.  He, of course, will be backed by his majority in the Dáil in what he is going to do.  If he is going to apply the scheme to different areas, and intends to go ahead with it, I would urge him to apply it in, say, the north Kerry and Limerick area.  Why not apply a scheme somewhat along the lines indicated by Deputy Bartley, and particularly along the lines indicated by the National Private Lorry Owners' Protective Association&mdash;one in which the haulier people, the private lorry owners and the railway company will be brought into consultation?</P>
    <P>Let there be an examination of the various branches of the transport system in which the railway, the hauliers and the private lorry owners are able to give the best service.  Have the experiment carried out in the area where this organisation was originally started, and give the private lorry owners a share in that experimental work.  The Minister says: &ldquo;What are you going to do if there is no petrol at all?&rdquo;  But what is the Minister going to do if he breaks down any possibility of co-operation or of assistance from the men who are handling the ultimate threads of our local distribution?</P>

      <P>Exactly, but I do not want to go back to the Flood.  I just want to go back to the date on which they made formal representations to the Minister.  Then, on 19th May, 1942, it appeared in the public Press that the private lorry owners were to be put off the road under the Minister's scheme.  On the following day they communicated again with the Minister.  It took the Department two weeks to reply, when they simply acknowledged the letter.  Then, when they wrote again on 19th June, it took the Department two weeks to say the matter was having attention.  Then a telephone conversation took place, but a week passed before there was any further reply.  That reply was to tell them that the matter had been duly noted.  They never got any reasonable reply from the Minister, and I personally got on the telephone to the Minister's Department on, I think, 28th August&mdash;towards the end of August, at any rate&mdash;to get an interview with the officials of the Department for the secretary of the association.</P>

      <P>In April, 1941, they offered to assist the Minister.  In May, 1942, the Minister made up his mind that he was going ahead with this scheme.  They got in touch with him again.  The Minister had proposed his Order; he had issued his inspired statement to the Press that the lorries were to go off the road, without offering to give those people an interview. It was only following the excitement caused in North Mayo by the publication in the Press, and after the matter had been taken up by the Leader of the Opposition, that a situation was brought about in which the Minister saw those people.  I do say that the Minister has a responsibility in this matter, and that he is acting in a very disruptive way.  He is ignoring people in the country who are only too anxious to help him in every possible way, and he is ignoring this House.  Even to-day, his presentation of his proposals to the House cannot be regarded as satisfactory; nobody could discuss them in a reasonable kind of way.  Where such radical changes are taking place we would expect that the various bodies in the country which are likely to be interested would be consulted by the <Col N="1361" /> Minister.  We would expect that this House would be informed in the most formal way, if necessary by the circulation of a draft Order and the issue of a White Paper in connection with the Minister's proposal.  If the Minister realises in any degree the problems we are likely to have to face, and the co-operation and assistance which it will be necessary to get from every organisation and every class of people in the country, he will have to amend the way in which he approaches his problems and the way in which he presents them both to the country and to the House.</P>

      <P>The margin between a good Licensing Bill and an indifferent one is narrow.  A certain amount of progress has been made in recent years in this very important matter.  That is generally admitted.  In my opinion, the time has come to take another step forward.  Previous speakers have made repeated references to abuses in and around the City of Dublin.  As the elected representatives of a people who are trying to build up as good institutions as can be established in any country in the world, we should ask ourselves why those abuses have arisen. Are we going to adopt the attitude that, because those abuses are there, we as the elected representatives of the people will not take the opportunity to remedy them?  Is there anything in ourselves as a people that we have anything to be afraid or ashamed of?  If we know that certain abuses are there, and that we as individuals and as a country have suffered from those abuses, we have an opportunity now of dealing with them in a trenchant manner befitting the Irish race.  Are we going to avail of that opportunity? If abuses are there, in my opinion they are there because the laws were bad. The outstanding example of bad legislation in this regard was the fixing of the hours of two o'clock and five o'clock on Sundays.  If a competition between the throat and the clock came into operation, whose is the fault?  Is <Col N="1362" /> it the fault of the working man who works all the week and needs recreation on Sunday?</P>
      <P>A man who does a reasonable week's work is entitled in a free country to freedom on Sunday within the restrictions imposed by laws enacted by free men.  Is he at the behest of any vested interest to be put unwittingly in the situation in which he is forced into competition between the throat and the clock?  That is one of the reasons for many of the abuses about which we hear so much.  The hours two to five are unreasonable.  I have heard the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; used here time after time.  I cannot picture any more unreasonable hours than two to five. The average Irishman would prefer to have public houses shut altogether rather than be compelled to drink at the behest of anyone.  On Sunday a man who wants recreation and wants to have a drink, if he has the price of it, should be entitled to go into any part of this country and have his drink at reasonable hours, not alone in the city but outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Hickey&mdash;I do not want to make any particular point about this&mdash;who spoke yesterday about home life on Sundays.  Let us be reasonable about this.  What is home life on Sundays?  Everybody recognises that there are three matters involved in this question &mdash; firstly, recreation, secondly, home life on Sunday, and thirdly, no restriction on the individual. In the average home in this country, the woman of the house would definitely like to see her husband go out for a walk on a Sunday morning with the children to take them out of her way.  If that man is a worker and wants to have a drink, why should he be prevented from having a drink on Sunday morning?  The woman of the house wants him there during the evening. He may have a walk afterwards, but if he wants to have a drink at night, when it will do him good, I think he should be free to take it. Perhaps it is not so much drink he wants as some intercourse with his fellowman&mdash;a relaxation that is lacking in my opinion in this country.  We have an opportunity now of facing up to this question in a way that will suit <Col N="1363" /> the conditions of our own country. Different laws may suit other people. If we have an inferiority complex, and are afraid to enact laws to suit ourselves, then many of the charges that were levelled against us by foreigners would appear to have some kind of justification. The hours two to five on Sunday are definitely and absolutely unreasonable.  They do not suit the person who wants drink, they do not suit the publican, nor do they suit anybody else.  My first suggestion then is&mdash;it should be fairly clear from what I have already said&mdash;that we should give the man who wants a drink in the morning on Sunday an opportunity of having it and that we should again give him an opportunity of having a drink when it will do him good and do no other person any harm, at a time later, definitely later, than the hours suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has not yet been touched upon.  We have done, and are doing, everything we can to attract tourists to this country.  People who have gone to other countries&mdash; there are people present who have travelled much further afield than I have&mdash;appreciate that, in countries abroad, special facilities are provided for tourists, and even though these are availed of by people living in these countries there is no abuse.  To go back to the question of human intercourse, and the interchange of ideas, that is a practice that appears to be very necessary for us, the more especially because this country is an island and there is a danger that we may become too insular in our outlook.  Why should we spend money in an endeavour to attract tourists&mdash;and we know that after the war quite a number of people will be very pleased to visit this country to see how our people have been getting on&mdash;and at the same time show them, when they come here, that we are insular in our outlook?  One, in travelling, meets people of different types and different nationalities.  The interchange of ideas and the encouragement of intercourse between various classes of people are all to the good and definitely should be to the good of a country whose reputation has been built up, as ours has <Col N="1364" /> been, mainly as a missionary people&mdash; not this year, not last year, but all through our history.</P>
    <P>The tourist centres should be scheduled, not by us, but by the body which has been charged with the administration of moneys voted by the people for tourist development.  On them should lie the task of deciding what are scheduled tourist areas.  That suggestion may appear to hit across the ideas of people who have made such a row about abuses.  Where is there a city like Dublin with 500,000 population without the urge&mdash;a thing I should like to encourage&mdash;to leave their tenements and their rooms, to get out of the city on the one day in the week on which they can have recreation? In fact, I would put forward this idea&mdash;that the country people come into Dublin and after a few generations they fade out.  Why?  Because they are so glad to get into a city that they have not acquired the urge to keep out in the open air.  Wherever that has happened, wherever you have a city of that type, there are bound to be abuses; but why should we, as the elected representatives of the people, allow ourselves to be influenced unduly by any section, no matter how right they may think they are in dealing with a problem of that type?</P>
    <P>There is a future for this country if we can help that type of recreation onwards, to give the people confidence in themselves, to let them see that when they want a drink they can have it, but where it would not be good for them it will be denied them. Once we get that idea into the people, we will have blotted out one stain on our character.  What do other people say about us&mdash;that we could not make licensing laws for ourselves, that we could not be trusted?</P>
    <P>In the County of Dublin, where the <i>bona fide</i> problem has been the main concern of every person connected with this Bill, or connected with the life of the people in the county, it is well recognised that a problem exists, but why should that problem be allowed to hurt traders on the spot?  Dublin is the highest valued county in the country, not even excepting the <Col N="1365" /> County Antrim.  The valuation of the premises which these men bought was assessed on the conditions at the time they invested their money.  In the ordinary course, the assessment, was high, but it was unduly high in their case, on account of the high valuation. Due, to a large extent, to conditions for which this House has no responsibility, and which we are trying to correct, these men find themselves now in a certain financial situation and must face it.  The complete cutting out of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic will not do away with the abuses, but will result in financial ruin for some of these people.  If we look at the situation in the broad way I have indicated, giving reasonably long hours and not being stingy about it, I think that all interests in the country would be united in accepting the Bill.  As I stated last night, the Government and the Minister deserve credit on account of their courage.  Having gone so far, why not go the whole way&mdash;why not pass an act of faith in the Irish people?</P>

      <P>I agree, and I will keep the tone of my speech in this matter non-controversial.  Some excellent points have been made in a speech of which I heard, unfortunately, only to-day's part &mdash; points that might engage the attention of the Minister. What is the case for the Bill?  I do not think it has been made out sufficiently by the Minister.  At least, no case has been made out for what seems to the ordinary Deputy to be the outstanding clause in this particular Bill, namely, the <i>bona fide</i> clause.  I do not know whether further legislation is necessary to deal with some abuses that are held to exist, particularly in Dublin and County Dublin, but the <Col N="1366" /> principle clause goes far beyond County Dublin.  I doubt if that particular clause will help to deal with the abuses of which I have heard some rumours.  I fear the wiping out of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic all through the country may have the opposite effect to that intended by the Minister and by some enthusiastic temperance reformers.</P>
      <P>I wonder if many Deputies can remember the ordinary country town about 45 years ago.  Comparing it with the same country town to-day, there is a great contrast, of which I think we should be proud&mdash;it is the extraordinary growth of temperance.  Surely there are Deputies sufficiently old to know what the market day or fair day was like 45 years ago, when, very often, at the end of the day, the only sensible thing was the ass that brought the people home.</P>

      <P>There has been that growth of temperance&mdash;an improvement which has been observed by everybody, in every part of Ireland, with a great deal of satisfaction.  It was the same in the City of Dublin. Those who came to the city 45 years ago, and who have lived here since, must be struck by the same contrast. Will this legislation that the Minister proposes help towards greater temperance? Taking the country as a whole, is the abuse so great?  I admit quite readily the earnestness and even the good work of what I might call extremists in this particular matter.  If they were not there we might get slack.  But I am not aware that extreme legislation is the best method of promoting temperance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a certain point if you go beyond which you will do the very opposite.  Take the experience of four people going to a place&mdash;you will <Col N="1367" /> see the analogy in a moment&mdash;to play a game of golf.  Let us say there is no licence in the golf clubs, that three of them consider whiskey an excellent drink but the fourth thinks it a poor kind of drink.  Three of the four are anxious for a drink of whiskey, and what is the method they adopt?  The obvious thing for them to do is to buy a bottle of whiskey in a public house on the way to the golf club.  Instead of having a glass of whiskey with their lunch, these three people have a whole bottle to consume.  I doubt if the denial of a licence to that club would tend to promote temperance.</P>
    <P>If you wipe out the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, surely the obvious way of side-stepping that legislation is for people setting out on a motor journey to buy a couple of bottles of whiskey.  You are going to have worse abuses, not merely in the line of intemperance, but possibly still worse abuses in other directions. I put it to the Minister, and I know he will consider it sympathetically, that in reality the effort to cope with certain abuses, limited on the whole in number, may have quite a different effect to what is intended. Take the statistics in relation to convictions for drunkenness over a number of years&mdash;the Minister knows what they are.  In an effort to cope with some abuses I am afraid we will be led into worse things, and that is really what I have particularly in mind&mdash;the general social effect of this. We know very well the effect of prohibition in America.  I met people from America when prohibition was on; I am not referring to working-class people whom I met coming from America&mdash;possibly their enjoyment was interfered with&mdash;but, taking the better-off classes, what was the effect?  In the normal way they ought to be the people who would be keen on observing the law.  What was the effect?  It was a matter of social distinction to evade and to break the law there.</P>
    <P>If you make a law wiping out <i>bona fide</i> traffic you are not going to have it observed.  You are going to have a worse abuse even than a certain overstepping of the limits in the direction of drink; you are going to have <Col N="1368" /> evasion of the law and that evasion being winked at, and that is a very serious thing.  Has the Minister no method of dealing, under the present law, with some of these abuses to which he refers?  Is the law that exists being enforced?  I am not saying it is or it is not&mdash;I do not know the facts&mdash;but if it is not, and if you make it more severe and harder on ordinary human nature, you will have a worse situation. That is really what I should like to impress upon the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that good laws&mdash;and one of the few things I do not agree with Deputy Mullen on is this, when he said that if there are abuses they are due to bad laws&mdash;do not make good people always; bad laws are not always responsible for abuses.  If the law is being violated, making it harsher will not stop violation. In fact, there would be the ordinary human tendency on the part of those who are called upon to enforce the law to shut their eyes to the violation of it, and, though I am an advocate of temperance, which is very different from being an advocate of forcing teetotalism on people, I cannot see that you are helping that particular cause by winking at abuses. I have felt for a considerable time that there is possibly too much attention given to technical violations of the temperance law.  I am satisfied, as long as the country as a whole is pretty temperate, to be satisfied with that, and I think there has been an immense improvement in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The question of property was dealt with by Deputy Mullen.  It is an important matter, I admit.  You are undoubtedly destroying an amount of property without compensation and without notice.  It is important, even from the point of view of general principle. I think the Deputy referred to another matter that ought to be borne in mind, and that is the effect on tourist traffic, whether the tourists come from within or without the country.  Deputy Norton said there ought to be the same law all over the country, because that is justice.  I think it could be injustice.  I think, from the point of view not merely of <Col N="1369" /> the publican but of the public who frequent the place, to have the same hours fixed in a tourist district during the summer as are fixed in Dublin is not even-handed justice, because the conditions are so completely different. There are places where, instead of the licensing laws being as strong as they are, the hours might actually be extended.  There are places in my own constituency, one well known as a seaside resort&mdash;Ballybunion&mdash;and there, taking it from the point of view not merely of the people who go there&mdash; and remember the time there by the sun is one hour and 40 minutes behind the legal time&mdash;they are expected to keep decent houses for those who visit them in summer, but there is practically no trade for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>If you are going to encourage the tourist trade&mdash;and here I agree with Deputy Mullen&mdash;it is no use making the place unattractive for visitors, either from outside or within the country.  There are countries in Europe that had prohibition.  I once had the pleasure of being at a luncheon in one of those countries. One man told me that if I wanted a real drink I could go behind the curtain, but I did not want the drink.  I asked him how was prohibition going on in his country.  &ldquo;How could it go on?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is against human nature and you cannot prevent smuggling in Finland.&rdquo;  He went on to refer to all the islands and bays, and he said they were made for smuggling and that the law was simply a farce.  Then he told me to put the question to my neighbour on my left, who was a strong prohibitionist.  I asked him what was the result of prohibition and he replied that the result was splendid, that everybody was obeying the law, that the people were quite enthusiastic over it and there was no trouble in dealing with them.  In reality, of course, the law was being evaded.</P>
    <P>If you try to abolish legitimate <i>bona fide</i> traffic you will be pushing legislation so far that you will do more damage, even from the temperance point of view, not to mention introducing other evils that are obvious, than you will confer benefit on the people. What are the best phrases we know in connection with the whole liquor <Col N="1370" /> trouble in different countries&mdash;bottle parties and flasks in hip pockets? Where did that practice come in and why did it come in?  Precisely because the laws were too harsh.  It came in in America.  I should ask the Minister, even from the point of view of temperance and also from other angles, to reconsider this whole business.  It is a matter which I should like him to discuss solely on its merits and possibly the present time is not the best for discussing a matter like this on its merits.  I understand that enthusiasts are excellent and necessary, but if you give them their whole way you may get more trouble than anything else, and therefore what I should plead for is a sense of proportion where this matter is concerned, a realisation not of one side of the question but of the whole question&mdash;the general outlook, the morale, the morals of the people&mdash; and, candidly, I do not think you are promoting that in this way.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has been in what I might describe, so far as the laws are concerned, the puritanical countries&mdash; our next door neighbour, for instance&mdash; will not be impressed by their licensing laws.  It is a peculiar thing that all over the Continent, where there is a great deal more temperance than there is in England or possibly than there used to be in this country, there are no such restrictions, at least so far as I know.  I have lived in and visited these countries, and in the university town where I was for a couple of years I do not know if there was any limit, except the economic limit of what time it was worth staying open to, and, on the whole, I do not think that that people were more addicted to drink &mdash;in fact, they were less so&mdash;than the ordinary people of the same class in England&mdash;leaving ourselves out altogether. If the Minister gives it further consideration, I am sure he will see the force of the arguments against one clause of the Bill in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to most of the speeches on this Bill, and one of the things I was expecting to hear from different sides of the House was some little indication of appreciation for a number of the things the Minister had the courage to put into the Bill. <Col N="1371" /> We have heard all sorts of criticism about just one section.  There is only one section in particular about which any of us has any grievance, that is, Section 7.  All the other sections are sections designed to help the licensed trade which was suffering from one thing and another in relation to the licensing laws.  All those things have been remedied by the Minister, and that is the first thing on which we should congratulate the Minister.  I am one of those who was here when the 1927 Act was put through, and the people who are doing all the criticising now probably do not want to appreciate the good points of the Bill because they had not the moral courage to face and to remedy these grievances at that time.  The first thing I want to do is to congratulate the Minister from that point of view, and I think that every Deputy, if he spoke his honest mind, must feel the same way.</P>
      <P>The next thing we have to consider is: what are the things which we see wrong in the Bill?  I suppose all of us feel that Section 7, as it is at the moment, is going to inflict hardships on certain people.  I believe that something should be done to cut out a certain trade carried on in the early hours of the morning.  There were particular abuses of the licensing laws which did not occur during the day at all, but which occurred in dance halls in the middle of the night, or in the early hours of the morning, or they occurred when people were asleep, and their peaceful slumbers were disturbed by a crowd of rowdies coming home in the early hours of the morning.  I am quite satisfied that something should be done to cut out the <i>bona fide</i> trade during certain hours, and I suggest to the Minister that public houses should be allowed to open for a <i>bona fide</i> trade from 6 o'clock in the morning until 12 midnight.  The hour of 11 p.m. might perhaps suit, but probably 12 midnight would more fully meet the wishes of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any reason for a public house being open between 12 midnight and 6 o'clock in the morning.  There is no reason in the world for it.  There may be exceptional cases of people <Col N="1372" /> travelling at that time, but they are few and far between.  Anybody travelling during those hours is travelling on some urgent matter, such as taking a patient from the West of Ireland to a Dublin hospital, and drinking on the road is not troubling him.  The anxiety in that case is to get to the place at which he wants to do business in a hurry, and such a person does not give a thought to entering a public house.  The Minister should definitely consider the question of extending the hours for travellers and fixing closing hours during which nobody would be allowed into a public house from, say, 11 p.m. or 12 midnight until 6 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think it matters whether the hour of 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. is fixed, because I do not think anybody is going to get out of bed to go for a drink at 6 o'clock in the morning; but in the West of Ireland most of the fairs start very early, and people who travel long distances with cattle or sheep are entitled to some refreshment when they arrive, and are entitled to try to buck themselves up for the rest of the day after the hardships they have gone through in bringing their stock along the by-roads and highroads.</P>
    <P>I would go one step further in the Bill.  I know the West of Ireland from A to Z, and, in the West, most country people do their shopping over the week-end.  At the busy time of the year, they cannot get into the local shop on Saturday evening.  In the little towns and villages, the local shops are shops which do a mixed trade.  There is a grocery section as well as a bar and perhaps a drapery section, too. A number of people in the country cannot get in to do their shopping on Saturday night.  If the weather is fine, they are busy on the land.  They say: &ldquo;I will get the few little things I want when I go in to Mass in the morning.&rdquo; Having had the courage to do a number of desirable things in this Bill, the Minister should have the courage to proceed further and give an opening period in the country from, say, 12.30 until 2 o'clock on Sundays.  I am not asking this purely from the point of view of the publican.  I am speaking <Col N="1373" /> about it from the point of view of relieving a hardship.  A case can, however, be made for the publican.  If he is free to open his public house after second Mass, which is generally finished by 12.30, until 2 o'clock, he can always say to those on the premises: &ldquo;Time, boys; get out.&rdquo;  He can clear them out as he clears them out at 10 o'clock on an ordinary night. If he cannot do that, he is going to have, and we are going to have, the law broken every hour in the day.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said that it is necessary to travel three miles to get a drink.  If I feel like a drink, you are just forcing me to go three miles to have it.  If the public houses are open, I may not feel half as much like a drink and I may not go into a public house at all.  If the public houses are not open, I may try to sneak in by the back door when the Guards are not looking.  Instead of having Billy, Jack and Teddy trying to slip in and the publican regarded as a &ldquo;bad fellow&rdquo; if he does not allow them in at any time&mdash;even if he wants his dinner&mdash;why not do as I suggest and let him get his public. house cleared at 2 o'clock? The Minister has been plucky enough to put a number of good sections into this Bill.  He should go further and remedy a number of abuses in public houses all over the country by doing as I suggest.  It would save the Guards an enormous amount of trouble. Guards in the country know the position.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Opposition said that we had the means of dealing with the people who were breaking the law and asked: why not use these means?  Guards must be commonsense people and must know the locality in which they are stationed.  If the Guards know that people want to go into the local shop, which is, probably, a public house, to purchase some goods, they are not going to be so silly as to stop them.  If what I suggest were done, the Guards could say to the publican: &ldquo;You know that you should have your premises cleared at two o'clock and we must prosecute you.&rdquo; Then, people would not be running to me and every other Deputy, as they do when a technical offence is committed <Col N="1374" /> and a prosecution is brought.  They try to get the Deputy to ease off the case because the offence is technical and the publican was merely doing something to satisfy a customer and not turn him against him.  Publicans must keep customers on their side in the same way as T.D's. must keep their constituents on their side.  If the persons concerned did not get a drink there, they could get it somewhere else.  I suggest that the Minister should examine the two points to which I have alluded.  I should definitely have a closing period between 11 and 12 o'clock &mdash; I prefer 12 o'clock &mdash; until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning.  Six o'clock would probably, meet the wishes of everybody concerned.  In the second place, I would allow an opening period on Sundays in the country which would stop all sorts of abuses and give the Gúards an opportunity to stand on their own feet and do their duty regardless of anybody who might interfere later.  It would also give them an opportunity of saying to the publican that the law was amended to suit him and that, when he outstepped the law, it was his own funeral.</P>
    <P>I notice that some of the temperance people have been showing their temper or their teeth and sticking out their chins on this Bill.  Some of them say that the Bill provides for opening on St. Patrick's Day.  I have examined the Bill from beginning to end and I see nothing in the Bill to authorise a public house to open on St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>The Bill gives permission for a drink with a meal.  I am not one of those people who do not believe in &ldquo;wetting the shamrock&rdquo;.  At the same time, if we were allowed to have the public houses open on St. Patrick's Day the same as on any other day, we would &ldquo;wet the shamrock&rdquo; so well that we would have it planted on everybody's forehead, and there would be great abuses.  But if I start out from the West of Ireland for Dublin and feel like a feed when I arrive there, I should also be entitled <Col N="1375" /> to a drink.  That is different from meeting Billy, Jack and Teddy who bring me into a public house to have a bit of &ldquo;skite&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>You will have leakages no matter how you do things.  The Minister has taken a step in the right direction in this regard.  One cannot sit down all day in a hotel.  After having a feed and one or two drinks, one becomes tired and is not inclined to drink to excess.  This provision remedies a grievance and is a step in the direction of common sense.  I congratulate the Minister on his courage in remedying a number of grievances. Several times I had to approach the Department of Justice in connection with publicans who had public houses stuck in a hole or corner on one side of the road and a fine house on the other side.  They could not get the licence transferred because the other house was in a different townland. That has been remedied, as have a number of other things.  The Minister deserves congratulation on having done that.  I trust the Minister will try to put in the two things I have suggested.  If he does, I do not think any publican or anybody who wants a drink can have any grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A correspondent writes to me and asks me to draw the attention of the Minister to his own explanatory note, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 8.  The purpose of this section is to grant wider discretion to justices of the District Court in regard to the endorsement of licences.  Under the existing law, a justice must endorse every conviction for specified offences, unless he certifies that the offence is of a &lsquo;trivial nature&rsquo;.  Licence holders are entitled to appeal to the Circuit Court against endorsement, and the Circuit Court is empowered to remove an endorsement if he is satisfied that there were &lsquo;extenuating circumstances&rsquo; in the case.  It is proposed by the section to give the same discretion <Col N="1376" /> to justices of the District Court as that enjoyed by Circuit Court judges.  It is proposed to preserve the right of licence holders to appeal to the Circuit Court against endorsements, but it is proposed to remove the right possessed by the prosecutor under the existing law to appeal to the Circuit Court in a case where the justice of the District Court does not endorse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My correspondent goes on to add that the Act of 1902 (Section 3) provides protection for an &ldquo;on&rdquo; licence holder in the event of the termination or expiration of a lease or having harsh or unreasonable demands made in connection with a renewal, the protection being his right to get a transfer of his old licence to suitable premises in the vicinity.  My correspondent adds that it has worked well as a safeguard against injustice, and asks why should not the same protection be afforded to the &ldquo;off&rdquo; licence holder.  In view of the removal of certain injustices on which a previous speaker has congratulated the Minister and as to which I join in congratulating him, I ask that the same law should apply to the &ldquo;off&rdquo; licence holder.  If a family grocer with an &ldquo;off&rdquo; licence business and a good trade has his house condemned, or if he cannot get a renewal of a lease without an exorbitant fee and can find a suitable or better house in the neighbourhood, he should get the same concession from the Minister as he has now given to the &ldquo;on&rdquo; licence holders. I join in congratulating the Minister on the removal of certain injustices referred to by the previous speaker, and I merely ask the Minister to give consideration to the point made by my correspondent, that the &ldquo;off&rdquo; licence holder should get the same concession as the &ldquo;on&rdquo; licence holder.  Also, if an offence is considered a trivial one, the right to close down his premises should not be kept hanging over his head and he should have the same right of appeal and get the same treatment as in the other case.  These points have been put to me by a preminent resident in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputies who represent other rural areas I have had quite a number of letters in connection <Col N="1377" /> with the contentious portion of the Bill, namely, the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade during the ordinary weekdays. The Minister's case for it, as outlined in his opening statement, was that he had various complaints from the Commissioner of the Gárda Siochána.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister either now or during the Committee Stage a statement as to the details of these complaints, because I would be surprised if at least 75 per cent. of them had not reference to the neighbourhood of Dublin, or at any rate the neighbourhood of Dublin and the other boroughs. I should say that they are almost entirely confined to the neighbourhood of Dublin.  If that is so, I think it is very drastic to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> trade over the whole country in order to remedy an abuse which is very limited in area.  The abuse that has been generally referred to is that of drinking which starts at midnight on Sunday.  That, I think, could be met largely by the provision in the Bill extending the opening hours on Sunday in the boroughs to 7 o'clock in the evening instead of 5 o'clock as heretofore.  That will, to a great extent I think, wipe out the abuse that has prevailed in the neighbourhood of the City of Dublin.  If anything further is required to deal with drinking on Sunday after midnight, that could very easily be done without depriving the whole country of the rights hitherto in existence.  It can be done by abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade until 6 o'clock on Monday morning, for instance, without interfering with the <i>bona fide</i> trade during the rest of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letters that I have received, I might inform the Minister and the House, were not by any means all from publicans.  I represent a constituency which has a large tourist traffic and quite a large portion of the correspondence I received in connection with the Bill was from persons interested in tourist development in the South Kerry constituency &mdash; in Killarney, Kenmare, Waterville, etc.  These correspondents have personally nothing to do with the licensed trade.  They are not publicans and are not interested <Col N="1378" /> in the liquor trade.  I do not know whether the Minister has given consideration to this point: that at present, with train services as they are, visitors going to places like Waterville arrive in Cahirciveen about half-past ten at night, although the train is due there at 7 o'clock.  I do not think the train leaving Dublin at 9.45 in the morning, though it is due in Cahirciveen at 7 o'clock, has arrived there, for several months past, before half-past ten.  Visitors going to Waterville have to travel to Cahirciveen and then drive ten miles to Waterville.  It is absurd to deprive persons after a long journey of any refreshments that they may require when they arrive at their destination. What I am referring to applies to very many other out-lying tourist areas.  If visitors after a long journey happen to arrive after 10 o'clock at night on a week-day, they will not be able to get refreshments in their hotel on arrival.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter has been stressed here by various Deputies from the rural areas and that is the position of men travelling long distances to attend fairs.  In the old days I used to see men leaving their home about 4 o'clock in the morning in order to drive cattle to the local fair and arriving there about 6 or 7 o'clock. If this provision is carried, such men would not be entitled to get a bottle of stout or whatever else they require until the ordinary opening time, namely, 10 o'clock.  I think that that drastic provision to remedy what is purely a city abuse is going entirely too far and is a very serious interference with the rights of the ordinary people.</P>

      <P>It is my contention that the abuses in the liquor business have been confined largely to the boroughs and surrounding districts and that, because of these abuses, ordinary people throughout the country have to suffer, and areas, which depend largely on the tourist traffic, are suffering very considerably because of these limited abuses.  There is another point that I wanted to raise on this Bill.  I do not know whether or not anybody else has raised it, but many of the traders in the small country towns are in the position at the moment that they can get practically no supplies, especially of the Guinness products. Of course, in the small towns of the country the mainstay of the publican's trade is the Guinness products.  For instance, I know of two licensed holders in one street in the town of Killarney, who have no quota of Guinness, for one reason or another. Now, if they cease to pay their licence, the licence expires, and I wonder whether the Minister could do something in that regard.  It is not actually a matter for the Minister's Department, I know.  It comes under a Finance Act provision, but I think it should be the Minister's business to put it up to the Minister for Finance that some provision should be made whereby such licences could be kept alive for a nominal fee, so that if these people had to go out of business, as a result of the restricted supplies, the licence would be still available when they would get their quota of Guinness, and when the present restrictions on the sale of Guinness would cease.  On what they sell now, they do not make enough to pay for their licence, but if they cease to pay their licence, they lose what is a valuable, or a potentially valuable, property when the war is over, and if they had to sell their <Col N="1380" /> property, the question of whether they had a licence or not would make a very great difference in the sale.  I am asking the Minister to consider what could be done about such persons who are receiving no quota of Guinness, with a view to having their licences kept alive for some nominal fee in the period in which they are not receiving their quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F. Crowley Mr. F. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I wish to raise, particularly with regard to tourist centres. At the moment a special licence can be issued to tourist centres to open on Sundays from one to seven.  Now, a person staying in a licensed hotel in a tourist centre is entitled to take a drink in the particular area in which the hotel is situated, but an extraordinary anomaly is that a person staying in a private hotel or guest-house in the same town cannot get a drink in any licensed bar on a Sunday.  A guest staying in a private hotel or guest-house in the same town cannot walk into a licensed bar and get a drink.  I think it is extraordinary that such a privilege should be given to a guest staying in a hotel which holds a licence &mdash; in other words, which runs a bar &mdash; and that a guest, staying in a private hotel next door, cannot get a drink in any licensed bar in the town. I suggest that that is an inequality which should not be allowed to prevail, and that it should be remedied in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is that I do not agree at all that it is going to do any good to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  The hours from one to seven could be altered by breaking them up, say, from one to two, four to six, and eight to ten.  That would be a better distribution of the hours and would take two hours off the usual hours allowed.  I am referring to Sundays, and I am speaking from experience as a member of the Tourist Association for a number of years.  I know that the hotel-keepers would prefer the breaking up and shortening of the hours on Sunday, rather than have a continuous opening from one to seven.  We have recently formed the Tourist Board, and they are supposed to be catering for the amenities of the different tourist <Col N="1381" /> centres, and we have the Tourist Association, but I can tell the Minister, quite clearly, that if he abolishes the <i>bona fide</i> traffic it will go a long way to neutralise the activities of these two bodies.  Accordingly, I would ask the Minister, seriously, to probe into this whole matter before he decides to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker that it would mean a great hardship on the farming community if the public houses did not open till 10 o'clock in the morning.  Anybody who knows the conditions under which farmers have to travel to a fair on a cold, frosty day, or on a wet and blustery day, arriving at 6 o'clock in the morning, will realise that there is no sense in expecting these farmers to wait for a drink until the public houses open at 10 o'clock.  There is one thing that I would seriously ask the Minister to do &mdash;I do not know how this is going to be interpreted, and I am speaking from my own point of view, but I hold that all drinks at dances should be abolished. When I say that, you can call me a pussyfoot, if you like, but I am very emphatic about the abuses that have taken place at dances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I agree with the point made by Deputy Killilea.  I do not exactly know the history of the licensing laws in this country, but I cannot see why public houses should be allowed to open in Dublin and the different boroughs in this country on Sunday when they are not allowed to open in the urban or rural areas.  I am not a very great customer at bars, but I do say, in all sincerity, that it would be worth the Minister's while to open the public houses in the rural areas on Sundays, say, from one to two, and then the people could go back to dinner, and the public houses could open up again from four to five.  After all, there is not very much pleasure in the country at the moment &mdash; no cinemas, no concerts, or anything else&mdash;and I do not think it would lead to any abuse at all. Apart from that, I wonder even if it is morally right that the people of cities <Col N="1382" /> like Dublin and Cork should hold privileges that other people have not got?  Perhaps it may be said that this is a vote-catching speech, but I say quite seriously that I think it is wrong that people coming from last Mass on a Sunday, who want to do a little shopping, cannot do it because the shop concerned is a combined licensed premises and grocery shop.</P>
      <P>My suggestion is that the Minister ought to try this out for a period of six months or 12 months, to see how it would work, but I wish to point out again that I am very emphatic about this matter of the tourist centres&mdash;particularly the case of the person staying at a private hotel or guest house, who cannot get a drink, whereas the person staying at a licensed hotel, in the same area, is entitled to get a drink.  I also think that, instead of abolishing all <i>bona fide</i> traffic at tourist centres, the Minister would meet the situation by altering the hours and not having a continuous opening, because I think it is the continuous opening that is doing all the harm.  I congratulate the Minister on certain sections, particularly on one section. As a man who comes up regularly to see the all-Ireland football final, I think it was an extraordinary state of affairs that when a person left Croke Park after the match there was no hope of getting a drink for his friends.  That has been remedied by altering the hours.  There are other sections also on which the Minister must be congratulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the Deputies who have spoken on this Bill so far have referred to the very vexed question of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  I have very slight knowledge of that and any I have would not be of any assistance to the House.  Therefore, I do not propose to discuss that question.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to another section of the Bill, and as it is a matter concerning local government, I am glad that the Minister for Local Government is here also.  At the present moment, if a local authority contemplate a street-widening or road improvement or anything of that description, one of the first things that <Col N="1383" /> they are likely to assess in that street is the number of licensed premises in it that would be affected by such widening, because the experience is that when one comes to take a licensed premises for street widening the value of the premises is only a fraction of the amount of compensation which has to be paid for the abolition of the licence.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, at the present moment there is no system of overcoming that difficulty, but I want to suggest to the Minister that if Section 14, transferring a licence of a damaged premises, were stretched to include a premises acquired or about to be acquired by a local authority for road improvement purposes, and permit the transfer of the licence, it would then be possible for the local authority to acquire the licensed premises merely for the value of the premises.  The licence would be transferred to an adjacent premises and the goodwill of the licence would still exist.  That would materially affect the costs of road improvements in certain areas in the city.  I think the Minister should consider whether anything of that sort can be done.  There may be ramifications of which I am not aware, but if the Minister will have the matter examined before the Committee Stage I think it may be a thing that would be of great advantage to local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot congratulate the Minister on this Bill. There are certain parts of it that are all right, but the section dealing with the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade is, to my mind, most serious.  It is taking away the liberties enjoyed by the ordinary people of the country for a long number of years.  What is the position of members of the licensed trade at the moment?  I am a member of the licensed trade, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that there is no section of the community suffering greater hardships than the members of the licensed trade.  I am not speaking now for the big traders in the cities. I am speaking for the ordinary small traders in the country towns and villages who stand behind the counter from 10 o'clock in the morning until <Col N="1384" /> 10 o'clock at night for a very small wage.  To my mind these traders are nothing but tax-gatherers for the Government.  They sell Guinness over the counter at 10d. a pint, but the Government will get 7d. of that.  What will the publican get?  He will not get one penny for his time and his labour. Publicans are the worst paid section in this community at the moment.  The laws that operated up to the present time were severe enough, but all the laws passed by this Government, in the past three or four years at any rate, have been crushing the people, especially the people of the small towns and villages.</P>
      <P>One of the Deputies opposite, when speaking a while ago, explained the position of the housewife who would not be able to come into the village on Saturday night to do her shopping when her husband was paid, and who would postpone it until the following morning.  Coming from first Mass she would do her shopping for the week. She can no longer do that, because even the small unlicensed trader who would supply her with tea, sugar or bread, dare not open his door.  Under the laws passed by this Government they can no longer open on Sunday, they can no longer open after 8 o'clock in the evening.  This Bill is introduced simply because you have a crowd of young people in the City of Dublin and around it who have so much money that they do not know what to do with themselves.  They go to the outskirts of the city to enjoy themselves all through the night, and they can find people in licensed premises to entertain them and keep them there.  The Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána complains to the Minister.  I do not know what is the present strength of the Gárda Síochána, but it is very strange that the Commissioner and his men are not able to enforce the law in the city and outskirts of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more concerned with the hardworking industrious people in rural Ireland.  What will their position be if this Bill is passed in its present form?  As a publican, I believe I am <Col N="1385" /> in a better position to discuss this matter than many Deputies who contributed to this debate and who are not members of the licensed trade.  I have first-hand knowledge of it.  I know that people who were called upon by this House to produce food for the people, slaving from six in the morning in all weathers, have also to work at threshings until eight, nine or even 10 o'clock at night.  Only a few nights ago, 12 or 14 men, after walking three miles, came into my house from a threshing.  As the law stands these people could not get a drop of whiskey, although they were drenched.  After Mass on Sundays if people live three miles from a village, but not outside the parish, if this section is passed, they will not be entitled to a drink. It is most unreasonable on the part of the Minister to treat people in that manner because of abuses that occur in this city.</P>
      <P>There are abuses certainly through the country, but I blame the Minister for that, because any person who gets up a dance in any part of rural Ireland can apply to the court and get a licence for a bar, where he can sell liquor worth from £50 to £100.  On the other hand, the man who works hard on the land and who wants a few drinks on Sunday evening, and who cannot afford more than two or three, cannot get them.  As Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned, those who go to clubs can buy a bottle of whiskey and have a round of golf and a round of whiskey.  There is nothing to prevent that.  The poor man cannot go into a public house on Sunday to enjoy a pint of Guinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the laws passed by Fianna Fáil in the last few years this proposal is the most drastic.  I hope it is one of the last of this kind.  I warn the Minister that if he persists with this section it will be the most damaging piece of legislation ever passed by this Parliament.  If the Minister wants the law to be observed he should extend the hours of opening.  The public houses in the country need not be opened until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evenings, because there is nobody to go into them until the day's work is finished, about 8 or 9 o'clock.  On <Col N="1386" /> Saturday night licensed houses have to close at 8.30 p.m., and by the time men who were working two or three miles distant come in, I will be shouting &ldquo;Time!&rdquo;  The Minister should do what Deputy Killilea suggested, and allow the public houses in the rural parts to open from 12.30 to 2 o'clock. Publicans could then clear their premises and everybody would be satisfied.  People living in the country cannot now get a drink on Sundays, while other sections can go to their clubs and enjoy themselves, or can bring drink into their homes or have bridge parties and a good time. Country public houses are the only, clubs and the only places of recreation for those who are feeding the country. Here we have a Government elected by the people, and the Minister for Justice brings in a Bill which deprives poor men of the opportunity of getting a drink on Sundays.  I know that the Minister for Justice is a just man, and a straight man, and I cannot believe after what he has heard during the debate that he will persist with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which the ordinary Deputy would be inclined to approach with great caution.  One is inclined to ask, what is the real intention of the Government, and again to ask if the Minister intends that this Bill shall go through this House and the present Parliament as it has been drafted, or if there is not some other deep underlying intention behind it. We listened to many members of the Government Party attacking the most important clauses, and we are inclined to wonder if the Minister intends to stand behind the drastic changes which are embodied in the Bill in regard to the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic. If the Minister does so intend I think he has more courage than we have credited him with, and we have always regarded him as a man of great courage.  I am inclined to believe that the Government and the Minister are simply &ldquo;pulling the legs&rdquo; of Deputies and of the country in connection with this Bill, and that they have no intention whatever of going forward with if as it stands, but will simply pass the Second Stage and then let it be hung <Col N="1387" /> up indefinitely, or, alternatively, let it be very drastically amended.  In the event of the Bill being &ldquo;hung up,&rdquo; the Government Party and the Minister can go to the country and say to temperance reformers: &ldquo;We have done our best.  We introduced the Bill to improve and reform the law in regard to temperance, but we had not sufficient strength to go forward with it.  We had not sufficient moral support.&rdquo;  On the other hand, they can say to the licensed trade: &ldquo;We have been forced to take certain measures by temperance reformers, and if we get back into power we will show these people where they get off.&rdquo;  Again, if this Bill be very drastically amended the same arguments will apply.  The Government Party will say to the temperance reformers: &ldquo;We did our best.  We tried to reform the law, but the forces against us were too strong, and we had to yield.&rdquo;  Then they can turn around and say to the licensed trade: &ldquo;The forces of organised temperance reform in this country made a sudden organised attack on the Government. They overwhelmed the Front Bench, but the rank and file of the Party rose up in strength to drive back the enemy, and we captured the position and rescued the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;  Thus we will have the Fianna Fáil Party playing the old game of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.</P>

      <P>What is the Deputy's attitude towards the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will state his attitude towards the Bill in clear and unmistakable language right now.  If it is the intention of the Government to go forward with this Bill as it has been presented to the House, it stands condemned on the face of it.  It seeks to extend the facilities for drinking in our four principal cities, and drastically to curtail facilities for drinking in rural Ireland.  It is simply another exhibition of the mentality of the ruling classes in this country.  I think it has always been the philosophy of the ruling classes in every country, when they want to show the world how superior they are morally <Col N="1388" /> and intellectually, to set about reforming the lower classes.  They never set about reforming themselves.  Thus we have the city mentality seeking to reform the benighted rural community, while at the same time extending facilities for drinking for themselves. I hold that there is no justification whatever for extension of the opening hours for drinking in the city on Sundays, having regard particularly to the fact that, in the rural areas, the public houses are not allowed to open their doors at all on Sundays.  This is a small country, and you cannot have that far-reaching measure of inequality between the city and the country.  It seems to me that if you are to continue the practice of opening public houses on Sundays in the cities you will inevitably, sooner or later, be forced to extend that amenity to the country.  The question arises: if those opening hours in the city are extended, the inevitable result will be that you must give those extended hours to the country.  I hold definitely that no case has been made by the Minister &mdash; I think he did not attempt to make any very substantial case&mdash; for extending the hours for drinking on Sundays in the city.  I think that three hours are quite sufficient for anybody to get all the drink he requires. We have heard statements advanced here in regard to the race between the clock and the throat.  I think it is a very useful kind of race.  It often saves a man from having to be carried home &mdash;the fact that the clock has curtailed his bout of drinking.  In my opinion three hours are quite sufficient.  I think that an unanswerable case has been made for giving a similar concession to public houses in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it might be a popular line for a country Deputy to go on to emphasise this clash between the interests of the city and the interests of the country.  I could develop it to a considerable extent if I were a professional politician, but I do not intend to do so.  I think that in approaching a measure of this kind there is a bigger issued involved, one which no Deputy can afford to ignore and that is, the clash between right and wrong. In this, the national Parliament of the country, we have to consider not only <Col N="1389" /> the interests of the various sections in the country no matter how powerful or influential these sections may be, but also the best interests of the country &mdash; not only the people who are alive to-day but those who will inherit this country in the future.  There is certainly a moral responsibility on our shoulders to see that the laws which we pass here, and which become part of the code of laws of the nation, are calculated to improve the lot of the people in general, to improve their conditions socially, morally and economically. We will be told that you cannot improve the condition of the people morally: that good laws cannot make good people, but it may be possible that bad laws may make bad people.  Therefore we have to consider carefully whether, in passing legislation here, we are not permitting or encouraging habits which are demoralising. We have to consider carefully what the effect of this legislation will be upon the habits of our people.</P>
    <P>This question of intoxicating liquor is a very delicate and contentious one for any Deputy to deal with.  One fact, I think, clearly emerges, namely, that the consuming of intoxicating liquor in moderate quantities is no evil. Another fact upon which we will all agree is that excessive drinking is definitely an evil.  Our legislation, therefore, should be calculated not to interfere in any way with the reasonable requirements of our people in the matter of taking intoxicating drink in moderate quantities.  I think that everybody who is engaged in the licensing business, and everybody who has the best interests of the country at heart, will agree that any legislation which seeks to infringe unduly upon the ordinary man's right to take drink in moderation is unjust and unfair.  It will also be agreed that any legislation which tends to promote or encourage drinking to excess is an evil.</P>
    <P>On those guiding principles we can examine this Bill.  We may ask how is excessive drinking, and other similar abuses in regard to drinking, to be checked or discouraged by legislation. I would say right away that the most serious check on excessive drinking which has occurred in this country to <Col N="1390" /> the knowledge of every one of us is the check which was imposed by the increased duties upon all kinds of intoxicating drink.  There is no doubt whatever that drinking has declined to a considerable extent during the past 30 years, and that decline has coincided with the increase in the price of drink.  We must, however, bear in mind the fact that the economic conditions of our people may improve with normal times, and with that improvement it may be possible for people, notwithstanding the high price of drink, to drink excessively in the future.  We have the example, in fact, that here in the city area, where money is in greater circulation and where the standard of income is higher, drinking is more excessive than in remote rural areas.  Therefore, it would seem that if, as we all hope, the economic conditions of the country improve, the check which has been imposed on drinking as a result of the high prices of all kinds of alcoholic liquors may not always be effective.</P>
    <P>Now, it may be asked what are the other inducements to excessive drinking. I hold definitely that prolonged hours for drinking, and particularly late hours, do tend towards excessive drinking.  Anyone who gives the matter a moment's consideration will realise that.  Some people might suggest that since the one and only evil in connection with drink is excessive drinking, an easy solution of the whole matter is to have the public houses open at all hours and ration drink in the same way as, for example, tea is rationed at present.  That might seem on the face of it to be a very easy way out of the difficulty, but let us consider for a moment what it would mean.  It would mean that the Minister for Justice would have to go over to Ballsbridge and borrow a number of officials there who are skilled in this matter of rationing supplies.  Then he would have to introduce a rationing system. First of all, he would be up against the difficulty that everybody does not indulge in intoxicating liquor, and, if coupons were issued to everybody, as in the case of clothing and food, the father of a family could pool the family coupons and have a very good time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister would have to segregate the population into drink consumers and non-consumers. That would mean the issuing of drink consumers' licences, which I suppose would also have to be graded as between light drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers. There would probably be three different forms of licence in three different colours, green for the novices, white for the moderates, and gold for the fully fledged &ldquo;boozers&rdquo;.  We can imagine then all the difficulties which would arise.  It would also be necessary to have those coupons issued for each day of the year, to be cancelled at the end of each day, as you could not allow a consumer to use his week's coupons or his month's coupons all at once.  This solution, therefore, would cause endless difficulties both for the Minister and for the trader.</P>

I think I have shown that it is not a working alternative, although it might suggest itself to the Minister for Supplies if he were in the place of the Minister for Justice.  It is clear, therefore, that restrictions of hours are necessary, and the one question which this House &mdash;as the national Parliament of the country with responsibility for the good government of the country on its shoulders&mdash;must consider is what constitutes reasonable hours for drinking.  I have said that three hours on Sunday for the City of Dublin constitute a reasonable opportunity for any citizen of this country to obtain all the drink he requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same hours would apply there.  If, however, it is found that the particular three hours at present provided are not suitable, it may be found desirable to alter those three hours to a later time.  For example, if the hours from two to five do not suit, why not have three to six, or 3.30 to 6.30, so as to facilitate people coming up to Gaelic finals and other functions of that kind?  If we are agreed that it is right and proper that people here in Dublin should have three hours for refreshment on Sundays, I think it is equally right and proper that the people in the country should have three hours also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arguments have been put forward in favour of an opening period beginning after Mass on Sunday, say, from 12.30 to 3.30, and I do not think that, on the face of it, a case has been made for such hours.  I speak as a country Deputy, living three miles from any village, and a case has been made that a man coming in from the country would be entitled to a drink after Mass; that he would have to drive in the cold and rain, and would therefore be entitled to a drink immediately after Mass.  There is one point which appears to have been overlooked, and it is that, if a man comes in three or four miles to attend Mass, his wife and children also come in the same distance, and I wonder do Deputies who have made the suggestion that those licensed houses should be opened immediately after Mass mean that the man's wife and children should be brought in too and treated to intoxicating drink, or do they intend that they should be left standing out in the cold while the man himself is having a drink?  I do not think there is a reasonable case for opening licensed premises at such an hour.  I think the first thing people should do is to have their dinner, and after that there could be no objection to the licensed premises opening for a few hours and then closing completely.  The hours fixed for the city, as I have said, are undesirable in every sense of the word. The hours from one to two are altogether too early, and coincide too nearly with the hours of Church services; the same applies to the <Col N="1393" /> closing hour of 7 o'clock, which coincides with evening devotions.  I think from 3 to 6 p.m., or from 3.30 to 6.30 p.m. would be the most reasonable hours, and those would also be quite suitable hours for country public houses.  I think a very reasonable case could be made for a similar concession in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the vexed question of the complete abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  There is no doubt whatever that the <i>bona fide</i> trade has been very seriously abused, particularly in the vicinity of the cities and large towns.  There have been abuses practically everywhere, and it is a very difficult matter to avoid abuses. The one question that the Minister should consider is whether he will remedy these abuses by such a drastic and far-reaching step as the complete abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  I do not think he will; the step is altogether too drastic.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies have pointed out, the position at the present time is that a man can get a drink at any hour of the day or night.  As the law stands at present he can get a drink within easy reach of his home at any hour of the day or night.  Therefore, to completely debar a citizen from getting a drink at any hour from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. is a step which is altogether too drastic and too far-reaching to be justified.  It might very probably have the effect of causing other abuses, and that is not what this House or any temperance reformer would desire.  The members of the licensed trade have suggested that there are certain hours of the night within which <i>bona fide</i> facilities might be very reasonably completely cut off. It is merely a question of deciding what these particular hours are.  It is certainly not justifiable to cut off completely the entire <i>bona fide</i> traffic from the present closing hours until the opening hours in the morning.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins stated very truly that the Minister in drafting and in introducing this Bill went very close to colliding with himself inasmuch as he was trying in one way to extend drinking facilities and in other ways drastically to restrict them.  As I <Col N="1394" /> pointed out, the extension of drinking facilities is mainly for the upper classes, the ascendancy classes who can travel about and dine in hotels, while the restrictions are mainly for the lower classes&mdash;the farmers, workers and people like them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the philosophy of the city mentality, that the people in the cities and large towns are the upper classes, and that they, therefore, should be immune from the restrictions upon liberty which they are very nobly imposing upon the rural population. If the Minister was in danger of colliding with himself in introducing the Bill, I think practically every Deputy who spoke on the Bill went very close to having a similar accident. For example, every Deputy who denounced the <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sundays and advocated the opening of public houses on that day, referred to the absurdity of the situation under which a person requiring drink has to travel from one village to another, while the people of that village had to go to the first village for any drink they required.  Deputies pointed out that the only effect was to produce more wear and tear on bicycles and footwear.  If that argument holds good in regard to the <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sundays, it can be used in fact against the <i>bona fide</i> traffic at any time.  In that way the people who denounced the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic went very near colliding with themselves.  My personal view is that if we could get completely away from the <i>bona fide</i> traffic it would be a good thing, but the step is too drastic to take at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important aspect of the question which I think every Deputy completely overlooked.  It is that there is no provision in the Bill, while it sets out to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, for compensation for those traders who are being deprived of such a large section of their trade.  Surely any measure which sets out to restrict to such an extent a trade which has been legal and legitimate up to the present, which has the effect of lowering <Col N="1395" /> the capital value of licensed premises in many cases to less than 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. of their present value, should have embodied in it a clause making provision for adequate compensation?  In this measure we are supposed to aim at raising the moral tone of the community. That is as far as it relates to the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, but it does not make any provision for raising the moral tone of the community if we condone the confiscation of the means of livelihood of a very large and important section of the community.  Take for example a young man who has invested all his money in a licensed house which by reason of its situation has a good <i>bona fide</i> trade.  He may have invested £5,000 or £6,000 in that business.  He finds as a result of an Act lightly passed through this House that his premises are reduced in value to perhaps £1,000.  The savings of his lifetime are completely wiped out, and no provision is made for compensation. Surely a Parliament seeking to do justice to all sections of the community should make provision that where it is necessary, in the best interests of the community, to deprive a citizen of a very substantial portion of his means of livelihood, that citizen should be adequately compensated.  It is because there is no provision for compensation in this Bill, because the step which is being taken is too drastic to take in the one measure, and because of the provision for the extension of the opening hours in the cities while no provision is made for similar opening hours in the country that I am opposed to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that the Minister had not the advantage of hearing the discussion he has listened to for the past few days before he decided to introduce this Bill.  He would have learned more from the discussion between all members of this House than he has learned from the Commissioner of the Gárda and the civil servants who, I hold, are mainly responsible for the drafting of this Bill.  The Minister in introducing the Bill gave very few reasons for it. <Col N="1396" /> Some of the reasons he mentioned were, the abuses connected with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic in licensed premises near the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are about 180 licensed premises in County Dublin, the constituency which I represent.  The Minister did not give many particulars to the House regarding abuses, and I have no hesitation in saying that 95 or 96 per cent. of the publicans in the county conduct their houses in a proper way.  The five or six houses where the <i>bona fide</i> law has been abused, and on which the Minister relies for the introduction of this Bill, could have been dealt with under existing legislation.  The Minister has sufficient legislation at his disposal at the moment to deal with any abuses.  The Department of Justice dealt with other abuses in the city and country very effectively&mdash;the Minister dealt with gangs at race meetings and football matches, and his action had very good results.  We have not had many repetitions of the conduct which was experienced at race meetings and football matches for some years past. The Minister has the gangs safely locked up, and I hope he will keep them there.  Decent people can attend matches and race meetings now without any danger of being assaulted, or of unseemly conduct occurring as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister utilises the legislation he has at present he can deal effectively with the abuses.  In how many houses in the area can the Minister state that the <i>bona fide</i> laws have been abused?  Five or six?  In only three cases, so far as I am aware, in the County Dublin have the Gárda thought it proper to oppose licences. The Minister could have introduced a Bill to deal with a matter of that kind. Three endorsements would have put those people out of existence.  The Minister cannot contradict me when I say the abuses have been carried on by publicans with no experience in the licensed trade.  The ordinary licensed trader in County Dublin and the adjoining counties, who has been engaged in this trade for years past, is ashamed of some of the tactics carried on by some newcomers.  Why should the Minister inflict a Bill of this type on him because of the conduct of five <Col N="1397" /> or six publicans?  I am speaking now on behalf of the majority of those licensed traders in County Dublin who are anxious to carry on their trade under proper conditions and in accordance with the Minister's regulations, and who would welcome any suggestions the Minister may put forward.  If he suggests reasonable hours, the licensed trade are prepared to meet him.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many Deputies speaking on this Bill and very few of them seem to have met it 100 per cent. They have expressed the views of the different constituencies.  I have been looking up statistics since the Minister moved the Second Reading and I find that, in 1900, 92,000 people were prosecuted for drunkenness in this country.  In the year 1941, as certified by the commissioner, there were 2,200 convicted of being drunk.</P>

      <P>That is another question&mdash;probably he was not.  Anyway, I must have said something that touched on Deputy Hannigan's corns or he would not be intervening.  In order to justify this Bill, the Minister has relied on the abuses in County Dublin, where there are 84,000 people over the age of 21, that is, on the electoral list.  During 1941 there were 150 people convicted of being drunk out of the 84,000.  Considering that there is a city convenient with 500,000 people in it, 150 cannot justify the Minister in regard to abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the licensed trade is concerned in County Dublin, this Bill means practically confiscation of property; and in the adjoining counties it means a reduction by 50 per cent. of the value of the property.  The Minister should view the matter from that aspect, and not from the point of view of the opening of public houses, and should try to remedy the evils he refers to.  If he examines the statistics prepared for him by the Gárda Síochána, he will find that these abuses <Col N="1398" /> to which he refers occurred at two, three or four o'clock in the morning. This Bill has good points and, if amended, it could be an admirable one.  The Minister should at least allow the <i>bona fide</i> traffic until 12 midnight and close the public houses then from one end of the country to another until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. That would go a great deal of the road to check the abuses to which he refers.</P>
    <P>He and several other Deputies referred to the fact that the abuses took place within ten or 12 miles of Dublin, but no one has referred to the fact that you can go into any theatre in Dublin and have a drink in comfort for half an hour after the curtain falls, which is generally at 11.30 p.m.  It is after that hour that people with plenty of money engage taxis and go out of the city to enjoy themselves until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.  That is where the abuses come in, and that is what the Minister should consider.  There is no mention in this Bill of clubs or hotels.  I hold&mdash;and several other speakers, I am glad to say, have referred to this also&mdash;that there is no disgrace in having a pint.  The ordinary working-man is entitled to his pint. He is just as much entitled to have a pint as the fellow with plus fours is to have his Scotch and soda.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will only examine these licensing laws properly, he will have plenty of food for thought.  Let me take some of the days during the year, say Christmas Day and Good Friday and some other days when the licensed houses are closed. An unfortunate working-man, having worked all through the week, finds he cannot have a pint, but if I have a set of golf clubs I can get a Scotch and soda on the club premises.  The working-man, with his 8d. in his hand, will not be able to get his drink, but the clubs can supply drink to their members.  I wonder did the Minister ever look at it from that point of view?  The Minister is afraid that on St. Patrick's Day some of our people may drown the shamrock.  I am very great with clergymen, and I have a number of relations who are clergymen, and I will say there is not a parish priest's table or <Col N="1399" /> a curate's table on which there is not a bottle of malt or a bottle of port on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>I want to point to the defects in this Bill and to bring home to the Minister how the ordinary working-man, the farm labourer in Kildare, Dublin, or Meath, is situated in this matter of getting a drink.  These poor men can see the cars going by on St. Patrick's Day; they can see the flash cars going by, containing Ministers of State, doctors, Deputies and others who can afford to run such cars.  The working-man can see those people going to Baldoyle races, where they can drink at their leisure.  The unfortunate working class cannot afford to go to a race-meeting and cannot have a drink because the Minister is afraid they will drown the shamrock and create scenes that would be unworthy of St. Patrick's Day.  Well-to-do people may go where they like and drink what they like.  They can go to Balydoyle race-meeting on St. Patrick's Day and to the Theatre Royal that night.  These are matters which the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the licensed houses around should be open all hours of the morning.  I think they should be granted permission to open during reasonable hours and I suggest, as a reasonable period, up to 12 o'clock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>What about the other parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Davin puts up a case for later opening in other parts of the country, I shall not fall out with him.  I am putting up a case for my constituency.  I believe that legislation of this kind operates unfairly against one class, and that is the working class, the people who would like a pint.  It operates against the type of man who likes to go into a public house&mdash;which is really the working-man's club &mdash; and have a drink with his friends and a chat.  The working-man cannot afford to pay three guineas to become a member of a golf club; he cannot afford to go into hotels.  After a hard day's work he likes to visit the local public house, <Col N="1400" /> have a drink and a chat, and possibly a game of rings or darts.  The working-man is entitled to that, and I think the Minister would do a good day's work if he facilitated that type of man.</P>
      <P>The Minister should remember that we are far removed from the days when Father Mathew started his campaign. There is no such thing now as trailing your coat along the street on a fair day.  Those days are gone and the ordinary public house is now regarded as the working-man's club. Take this Bill in its application to Sunday trading.  Is it not farcical that a man from one village should have to walk three miles to some other village for a drink, possibly meeting his pal from that other village walking in the opposite direction with the same object in view?  I guarantee to the Minister that if the local publicans were allowed to open there would be less drinking on Sundays.  A man would come out after Mass, have a drink in the local public house, a chat with his friends, and then he would go home to his dinner; but if he has to travel three miles for a drink he will remain in the public house until closing time.  If facilities are offered to him near his own home he will have a drink or two and go home to dinner and I guarantee there will be little abuse.</P>
      <P>I heard arguments put forward from different sides of the House that there should not be any opening of public houses on Sundays and holidays because you will have people rushing out from Mass to the public house.  What about the ordinary Church holidays when the public houses are open from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m.?  On those days I have not seen, and no Deputy here has seen, any great rush out of Mass in order to visit the local public house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never seen any more people in a public house on a Catholic holiday than on an ordinary week-day.  The Minister cannot produce any evidence to show that on a Catholic holiday in the country, when farm labourers have a day off, there has been any abuse.  That is one good argument why there should be an opening of local public houses and not have the farce of compelling a man to walk <Col N="1401" /> from one town or village to another in order to get a drink.  That generally results in a man remaining to drink all through the day, whereas if the local public houses were allowed to open he would have a drink or two and go home.  If the Dublin man is entitled to have a drink in Dublin.  I maintain that the Mullingar man should be entitled to have a drink in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Some objections were raised with regard to the special licensing of aerodromes and aeroplanes.  I believe aerodromes are entitled to a special licence.  I have had some experience of travelling by air and, in the course of the next ten or 20 years, when a big number of us will not be in this House, air travel will be the principal form of travelling.  Anyone who has travelled by air on the Continent is aware that in the air liners there you can be served with drink.  Since the air service between Limerick and Dublin was established I availed of it and I found, when I arrived at Collinstown, I could not get a drink because there was no bar there.  When I reached Rineanna I could not get a drink there either, and I had to travel 14 miles to Limerick before I could get a drink.  The aircraft on that service are not designed for that purpose.  I had an unfortunate experience on one occasion, and perhaps if it were possible to have a drink served on the aeroplane, as is done in the case of continental air liners, that incident would not have occurred.  When we were travelling by air one of the passengers went a little bit out of his mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if there were the facilities that they have on continental aircraft, where one can have a chat and a drink and move about freely, that might not have occurred.  If some of you people had been there at the time, you might not have smiled, particularly in one of the small aircraft which carry only nine or ten people.  There is no reasonable Deputy, and no association, can object to a licence at Rineanna, Foynes or Collinstown airports.  They talk about <Col N="1402" /> the Minister getting discretion to grant these licences and speak of <i>bona fide</i> traffic in respect of people who fly 50 miles, but so far as I know no one flies a distance of 50 miles.  The least distance I know of is not under 100 miles, between Limerick and Collinstown.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister realises that this Bill will affect 11,000 licensed premises in Éire and that for the abuses which have taken place in four or five public houses in County Dublin, he is going to penalise all the licensed houses throughout the country.  He has sufficient machinery at his disposal at present to deal with such abuses, and let him deal with them, as he dealt with the race and football gangs, and let him allow the honest, decent publican in County Dublin and every other county who has been in business for years, and his father before him, to carry on his trade.  They are all willing and anxious to give the Minister every assistance they can.  I hope the Minister will agree to extend the <i>bona fide</i> hours until 12 o'clock and to allow some opening on Sundays in country districts.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that none of these golf clubs contributes anything in the way of revenue to the State? They have not to pay a licence duty equal to that paid by the publican, and that is a matter which should be considered by the Minister for Justice and by the Minister for Finance from the revenue point of view.  They should not be given any special facilities as against the licensed trade.  The Minister's object in introducing the Bill is to curb abuses, and I believe that, if it is amended, he will be able to bring forward a measure which will be acceptable both to the general public &mdash;the consumer, as he might be called &mdash; and to the licensed trade and that he will then succeed in his object of cutting out these abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what the Minister has in mind.  He has a good deal of information about the ladies who go out at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning for their &ldquo;gins and limes&rdquo;, and &ldquo;gins and its&rdquo;, but the Minister can cut that trade out without doing any harm to the licensed trade which, I believe, would welcome <Col N="1403" /> it, and without doing any harm to the ordinary working-man and the ordinary business man.  I believe that if the Minister, as I am sure he will, accepts reasonable amendments to the Bill before it passes, he will be meeting the wishes of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>In making my case, I do not intend to make any attack on either clubs or hotels.  My principal object is to uphold the rights of the ordinary plain people when travelling at night, or going around the country on business of any description to get a drink at any hour, at least up to midnight, and also the rights of the licensed trade who have expended so much money on their premises during the last five or six years, so that their property will not be practically confiscated without some consideration from the Minister. Anybody who has moved around in recent years knows that the licensed trade have improved their premises from the point of view of comfort and the provision of games, and I hope, therefore, that before the Bill passes the Minister will give due consideration to the points of view put forward by me and by other Deputies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fogarty, in speaking on this measure, has the advantage of having already listened to the Minister explaining it, firstly, at a Party meeting, where I understand there was a straight talk on the subject, and, secondly, in the House when moving the Second Reading.  He has, therefore, a considerable advantage over Deputies like myself in dealing with the measure and putting forward counter proposals.  I mention this because I was surprised to hear Deputy Fogarty suggest &mdash; and I am sure he has good reason for suggesting &mdash; that the real reason for the introduction of the measure is the abuses for which five or six publicans in his constituency are supposed to be responsible.  Is that a fact?  If it is, it is certainly not a sound ground upon which to make alterations in laws affecting areas all over the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Portion of the existing licensing laws which have been in operation for a long period are, in my opinion, based on old-fashioned ideas which were quite applicable to the days of the stage coach.  There is in sections of the existing licensing laws a definite preference in respect of drinking facilities for one class of the community as against another.  The people in the cities are given all the facilities they need, within reason, for drinking as against people in rural areas.  The people who are members of clubs and who have money enough to enable them to frequent hotels have facilities much in excess, if they care to make use of them, of those available to people who frequent public houses.  People who require a licence to carry on dances in hotels have facilities over those who may apply for a licence for a dance in a parochial hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put that to the Minister because he is a democratically-minded citizen, apart from being broadminded as a Minister, and if there is to be an alteration in the existing licensing laws, these points should be taken into consideration, and the laws amended accordingly.  If the Minister and the Commissioner of the Gárda are to get co-operation, as they should, in the effective administration of the licensing laws, one of the things which will appeal to the average citizen is that there should be an equal opportunity for every citizen, regardless of class, to get any facilities of this kind which he needs within reason.  That is <Col N="1405" /> not the position under existing legislation. Under this Bill, no attempt has been made to remove these inequalities. Additional facilities are to be given in the county boroughs under the terms of the Bill, but there is to be restriction of the existing facilities in the rural areas.  I doubt if that appeals to the Minister as an individual, but I daresay his advisers have given him some good reasons which he has not conveyed to the House in justification of the continuance of out-of-date licensing legislation.</P>
    <P>I stated here during the discussion on the 1927 Bill that I was in favour of a general opening for reasonable periods on Sundays.  I repeat that statement, even though it may bring upon my head the same kind of criticism that I received at that period from people in high places.  I cannot understand, as one who knows a fair share of what goes on in the rural parts of the country and especially in my own constituency, how any temperance advocate or reasonably broadminded man can justify the exchange of populations on Sundays for the purpose of enabling those who want a drink to get it.  I believe in giving liberty to the workman, and every other man, to get a drink on Sunday wherever he gets it on other days of the week.  If these facilities were given, there would be less drunkenness and there would be a smaller number of accidents.  I appeal to the Minister to give that suggestion favourable consideration and, if it is possible within the framework of the Bill, to give the suggestion effect on Committee Stage. If there were a general opening on Sundays for a reasonable number of hours, not cutting across church-going hours, there would be far more effective administration of the licensing laws by the Gárda.  Whenever a man was found on licensed premises outside these hours, there would be a clear case against the licensed trader and the person who ignored the law.</P>
    <P>Over a period of 30 years I have attended, as many other Deputies have done, most of the G.A.A. matches in provincial towns.  In Thurles, Kilkenny, Portlaoighise, Wexford and other towns where important matches <Col N="1406" /> are held on Sundays, there is a general opening.  Will anybody here say that in Thurles or any other provincial town, where tens of thousands of people congregate for these matches, unfair advantage is taken of the general opening which is allowed at the discretion of the district justice? I have never seen many people drunk on occasions of that kind.  That is part of the case I make for the general opening of public houses on Sundays for a short period.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to agree to its extension to Dublin.  Under the Bill, the concession is being given to those who come to the city for the purpose of attending G.A.A. matches.  So far, I have not heard a good case for the double opening period in Dublin. Although I am not a temperance advocate or a teetotaler, I do not see the necessity for a double opening period on Sunday, nor do I see the advantage of having an opening between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock.  That is a matter for the majority of the members to decide on Committee Stage.  I shall willingly accept whatever the majority of the Deputies representing the areas affected decide to do.  Under the Bill reasonable opening hours will be allowed which were not allowed in the city up to now, but which were permitted in Thurles and other provincial towns where big G.A.A. matches took place.  The question of hours is one for the Committee Stage.  I advise the Minister to adopt the procedure adopted in connection with the 1927 Act and to refer the Committee Stage of this Bill to a Select Committee to be appointed by the Committee of Selection. This is a Bill of the type which could be more usefully dealt with by a Select Committee than by a Committee of the whole House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the restriction on the hours applicable to houses in rural areas.  I think that there is a good case for continuance of the existing hours in rural areas. There is no drinking worthy of notice on five out of six days in the week on <Col N="1407" /> the part of people who live in rural Ireland.  On the sixth day of the week, when farmers and farm workers and other workers in the villages and towns have finished a hard week's labour, they are entitled to a continuance of the present hours rather than to a restriction of them, as is proposed by the Bill.  I hope that the Minister will not persist in making the proposed changes so far as the rural areas are concerned.  Every public house and every place where drink is sold, whether club or hotel, should be closed at 11 o'clock in the winter time and not later than 12 midnight in the summer time, until 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning.  I mention 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock for the reason that people attending fairs and markets from the rural areas should be allowed reasonable facilities to get a drink.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if he has particulars at hand of the number of convictions secured as a result of prosecutions in respect of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic or, in fact, any other breaches of the licensing laws in rural Ireland.  I do not believe that there is any appreciable increase in drunkenness in rural areas as compared with 15 or 20 years ago.  Deputy <Col N="1408" /> Fogarty has given illuminating figures.
