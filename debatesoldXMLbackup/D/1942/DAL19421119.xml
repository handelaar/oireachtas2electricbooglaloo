      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the recent statements appearing in the Press concerning tobacco, etc., he will state whether it is his intention to release sufficient tobacco leaf to allow 100 per cent.  tobacco and cigarette supplies to be issued to the public.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Emergency Powers (Tobacco) Order, 1942, made by me on the 31st ultimo, is that the quantity of unmanufactured tobacco which may be cleared from bond is now 90 per cent. of the quantity so cleared during the year ended on the 31st March, 1940.  Previously, the quantity that might be cleared was restricted to 80 per cent. of the 1939-40 clearances. I regret that I cannot authorise any further increase in clearances in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it desirable, in view of the fact that we grow the best oats in the world in this country, that available cargo space should be used for the purpose of bringing in inferior oats from Canada, and maize which is well known to be inferior&mdash;maize is generally brought into this country from the Argentine&mdash; for the sole purpose of beating down the price of oats produced by farmers in this country, at a time when there is a serious shortage of shipping, and when cargo space could be utilised to bring in the best wheat in the world?

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that present stocks of spare parts for Fordson tractors are in very short supply, and that ball-races, gears, etc., cannot now be obtained; and whether, in view of the national importance of maintaining all tractors in serviceable condition for food production purposes, he will say whether any survey of the stocks of spare parts has been made by his Department, and what efforts have been made to secure supplies of spare parts urgently required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he will consider the advisability of making a survey of tractors and implements for the purpose of determining the expectancy of survival of parts that must be replaced in the near future, with particular regard to tractors on rubber tyres which are three years old and over, so <Col N="2194" /> that the possibility of replacement can be examined, or as an alternative, the provision of steel wheels for land work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.  I am aware that certain spare parts for Fordson tractors are in short supply.  Arrangements have been made to recondition or manufacture some of these parts here, and representations to secure the release of supplies from the United Kingdom have been made.  A comprehensive survey of the stocks of spare parts for tractors and implements has not been made.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by a survey of all existing tractors and implements with a view to determining their future requirements of spare parts, even if such a survey were found to be practicable.</P>
      <P>There is no possibility at present of procuring rubber tyres for tractors, and the provision of steel wheels for replacement purposes is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider seeking voluntary co-operation, or even employing compulsion, to induce persons with derelict tractors to turn them into some centre, so that the spare parts needed might be salvaged for a central pool, from which working tractors might be repaired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements of that kind have been made by commercial organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that no effective effort is being made at this moment to gather in the derelict tractors, of which there is quite a considerable number lying about the country; and that no effective effort will be made unless it is done under Government aegis and unless proper compensation is paid to the persons who have such tractors?  If it is not done quickly, the tractors will simply rot away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that there are certain spare parts, such as ball races, that cannot <Col N="2195" /> be made here and cannot be procured; that many tractors are immobilised at present; and that more tractors might have been immobilised but for the fact that a certain amount of cobbling has been done on them to keep them going for the time being?  Does the Minister appreciate that it would be useful to know the types of parts that are necessary for a number of tractors and that it would not be very difficult to make a survey?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that all applications for ration coupons made by our migratory workers on their return from Great Britain are being refused on the grounds that applicants' stay in this country is temporary; and whether he will make provision for such workers to enable them to obtain their necessary supplies of clothing, footwear, tea, and other rationed commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal rule is that persons arriving in this country must have been resident for four weeks before application from them for ration books will be entertained, and in no case will a ration book be issued unless a stay of at least 12 months is contemplated. I appreciate that this rule, if applied strictly to migratory labourers on return to their homes, must give rise to hardship, and in the case of any such labourer to whom a ration book has not already been issued, I am arranging that application for a book can be made immediately on return home at the local Gárda station.  Applications in these cases will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that at the end of last week there was only one ton of turf for sale in the village of Swords, County Dublin; whether he is aware that the haulier to whom petrol for the haulage of fuel was supplied has to bring turf from the dump, which takes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to get a load to Swords; and whether, in view of the plight of the poor people in Swords, he will take steps to ensure that a reasonable supply of fuel will be made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations have been made to me regarding a fuel shortage in Swords district, which is served by two local licensed fuel merchants as well as by Dublin City merchants.  Regarding the second portion of the Deputy's question, I cannot understand why it takes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to bring a load of turf by <Col N="2197" /> lorry from the dumps to Swords, and I suggest the Deputy should give more details in support of his assertion.</P>
      <P>If evidence is forthcoming that the poor people in Swords are finding difficulty in procuring supplies of turf and that the existing trade is insufficient to cope with the fuel requirements of the district, I will be prepared to permit the Swords Parish Council to purchase a supply of turf to be sold during the winter through the medium of a licensed fuel merchant, and, if necessary, I will grant a fuel merchant's licence to any individual nominated by the parish council to enable him to sell the turf so purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state what arrangements are being made to safeguard a supply of turf or logs within a reasonable distance of the customers' homes; if he is aware that, in the event of severe snow or frost, the 400 animal-drawn fuel carts will be unable to draw supplies from the Alexandra Basin; and if he will cause the immediate removal of at least one month's supply of turf to dépots nearer the centres of consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, supplies of turf on a considerable scale have been removed from the areas in which it was produced to the City of Dublin and other centres in the non-turf area.  This turf is stored within as reasonable a distance of consumers' homes as fuel is in normal times.  The incidence of severe snow or frost will not impose upon animal-drawn fuel carts drawing turf from the Alexandra Basin handicaps which they would not have had to face in drawing supplies of coal from merchants' yards.  The removal of the turf dumps from Alexandra Basin to other sites elsewhere in the city would raise difficult problems in relation to the acquisition of sites, the provision of transport and the safeguarding of the turf in the new dumps and would involve such a substantial addition to the cost of providing such turf as to put it beyond the reach of the average consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, prepared to make arrangements with parish councils <Col N="2198" /> within the city area, similar to those made with parish councils in suburban areas, which desired to store within their areas supplies of turf against the danger of the ordinary machinery of distribution breaking down temporarily through exceptional causes. These parish councils have been granted permits to purchase supplies of turf, for the storage and safe keeping of which they will be responsible, and which would be released for sale to domestic users through a person nominated by the parish council, to whom a fuel merchant's licence would be granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, at the present moment, there are women, carrying empty sacks under their arms, going round the City of Dublin trying to purchase a shilling's worth of turf or wood blocks, and that they cannot get them?  Is he further aware that these horse-drawn vehicles&mdash; ponies and donkeys with shoes so worn out that they will not be able to get them caulked in the event of frost&mdash; cannot travel the four miles to Alexandra Basin to bring up turf to the City of Dublin; and will the Minister see that dépôts are distributed more fairly than at present?  It is not right for the Minister to say that the same terms are available as to those looking for coal, as the coal to Donnelly's used to come up to Butt Bridge and be loaded there to bellmen, who now have to travel three miles more in the cold and wet.  Will he see that the women will not have to go round, carrying sacks, looking for a shilling's worth of fuel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, with a great deal of trouble and organisation, have brought into Dublin huge stocks of turf to constitute a fuel reserve for the winter, and now the only observation of Deputies is that the dumps are in the wrong places. Surely, Deputies appreciate the difficulty of establishing in Dublin these huge stocks of turf?  They cannot be stored in O'Connell Street.  To be properly protected, they must be stored in places where there is suitable accommodation.  It is not physically possible to shift these dumps <Col N="2199" /> to other places without immense cost in transport and a substantial addition to the price of turf.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> (1)  The quantities of paper and board which the British authorities have agreed to release to this country are divided over three quota periods of four months each, the current one of which commenced on 26th October, 1942;</P>
    <P>(2)  the share of the quota to which each importer is entitled on the basis of his pre-war imports of the particular class of paper is advised directly to the importer by my Department;</P>
    <P>(3)  the importer then orders his requirements of paper or board, within the limits of the quota, through the Éire Paper Imports Committee who arrange for the placing of the order with a manufacturer in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Persons who were not previously importers of paper must order their requirements from their usual local supplier.</P>

Under the Milk and Dairies Act, every dairyman who is engaged in the sale of milk for human consumption in the form of milk must be registered with the local sanitary authority, and registration is not granted unless the premises and methods of production and distribution are satisfactory.  The animals, premises and methods of production and sale are subject to regular inspection by the sanitary authority's medical and veterinary staff.

      <P>Proceedings are in progress for the acquisition of the untenanted lands of Miltown, containing 83a. 2r. 8p., on the estate of Richard E. McKenna (formerly Miss Edge), County Leix.  The price of the lands has been fixed and a scheme for their division will be prepared as soon as possible, but until this scheme has been completed and settled it will not be possible to state when the lands will be divided. Possession of the lands has not yet been taken by the Land Commission, and they have no information as to how the lands are being used at the moment by the owner.</P>

      <P>Supervising gangers in the Land Commission who use pedal-cycles for travelling on official business are allowed expenses at the rate of 1½d. a mile in respect of the first 1,000 miles travelled in each year, 1d. a mile in respect of the second 1,000, and ½d. a mile thereafter.  These rates were fixed after prolonged consideration, and as a result of correspondence with the Department of Finance extending over some years.  In their application, a supervising ganger travelling 4,000 miles in a year would receive £14 11s. in respect of travelling expenses by pedal-cycle.  That compensation is regarded as reasonable. I am not aware that any increase has been granted in pedal-bicycle rates by other Government Departments.  An alternative arrangement to that now adopted by the Land Commission would be the fixing of a commuted allowance in each case, <Col N="2213" /> irrespective of the distance travelled. Adoption of such an arrangement would be less favourable to the supervising gangers.</P>

      <P>The Minister says &ldquo;my previous question.&rdquo;  Why does he cut it down to one?  Does he not agree with me that this is a question not for the Land Commission but for himself personally?  Is it not one of the reserved services with which the Minister deals personally?  Does he not agree with me on that, and will he explain what are the difficulties which prevent him from doing this act of common justice to these people?  The only matter involved is that instead of a number of these people having to pay their rent in one sum, it should be taken separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason is that in order to arrange matters to the satisfaction of the tenant, inspection and re-arrangement will be necessary, and the Land Commission find it difficult at present to deal with the matter of re-arrangement.  However, I shall look into the matter again to see if it is possible to come to some arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that for at least the last two years I have been endeavouring to impress on the Minister that no question of re-arrangement arises; that these people have got their lands separately and that each of them is prepared to pay so much, but that the rent will not be taken from one unless the other 11 are ready to pay at the same time.  I say that that would be a very simple thing for the Minister to remedy, and, as I have said, for at least two years I have been <Col N="2215" /> asking the Minister to do something about this, but he will not take any step in that direction.  Can he say when he will do something about the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the scheme is so simple as the Deputy suggests I do not think the Land Commission would be averse from dealing with the matter in the way he suggests.  Unfortunately, however, these things are not so simple as they might appear, when there is a body of tenants to be dealt with, and the way to deal with such a matter is by means of a rearrangement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>These people hold their lands separately, and the amount they pay is an agreed sum between themselves.  What is the difficulty, them?  I suggest that a mere stroke of the pen would be sufficient to make them separate tenants of the Land Commission instead of being tenants in common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy is to bring such people nearer to an economic standard.  These things are all intermixed and, as the Deputy knows, it is the policy to try to arrange such matters before anything can be done in the way of re-vesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>But I have not mentioned anything about re-vesting. Where does the Minister get any suggestion about re-vesting from my questions?  All I am asking is that they should remain tenants of the Land Commission, but each of them a separate tenant instead of being tenants in common.  I suppose I shall be putting down this question as long as the Minister remains Minister for Lands, and that I shall be getting the same answer as I have been getting for the last two years.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated his attitude to this amendment, and I think the line he has taken is that it is not his function but the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to indicate the conditions of employment.  Actually, however, he does here intrude into that realm, and he implies here that a child may under certain circumstances &mdash;between certain hours, at any rate&mdash; be employed at 12 years of age.  If the Minister is intruding in this particular way, I do not know why he should <Col N="2223" /> fix 12 any more than 10.  I make the point that unemployment among children above the age at which they are required to attend school is so great and so demoralising that any employment that is available might very well be preserved for children over 14 years of age.  I think the contacts they make while working for a short period on the type of work that that class of child is engaged in may be much more fruitful in securing permanent employment if the child is over 14 years of age and above school age than it would be if the child was 12 or 13 years of age and liable to have to attend school for another year or two. I had not any indication that anybody in the House sympathises with my motion.  I would not press it unless I saw some understanding in the House of the point I wish to make.  I do wish to impress on the House that, particularly in a place like the city here, there is a considerable amount of very demoralising unemployment among children who have left school.  That is a very great heartbreak to parents, and I think such employment as is available might very well be kept for children over 14 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister very strongly to accept this amendment.  I think the acceptance of it would do something to repair the very unfortunate past of the Department of Education in regard to its outlook as to the impacts which young persons are able to withstand in the viewpoint of that Department.  In the 1926 Act the Minister had power to prohibit the employment of persons between six and 14 years of age, clearly indicating that the Minister at that time believed that he ought to have power to prevent persons working between the ages of six and 14.  Even in 1926, which is a long time ago&mdash;many things have happened in the world since then&mdash;there was apparently some progress in the Department as indicated by the fact that the Department took the right to prohibit the employment of young persons between six and 14 years of age in the legislation that was then passed.  But, of course, no action was taken by the Department to <Col N="2224" /> implement the relevant section in the 1926 Act and that section of the Act remained a dead letter since 1926. Now the Minister comes along with a new Bill, which ought to represent a new and progressive approach to educational control of young children, and he repeals entirely the provisions of the 1926 Act in respect of his right to restrict the employment of persons between six and 14 years of age and, instead, embodies in this new Bill Section 7, which, I think, is a particularly reactionary section, in view of the fact that we would appear to have a better approach to the educational control of children in the 1926 Act.  Section 7, as drawn here, provides&mdash;and this must be taken as the Department's outlook on the matter&mdash;that children may be employed for two hours per day between October and April, or for three hours per day between May and September. Everybody with experience of children and of the difficulty of getting them to take kindly to school knows perfectly well that anything which distracts their attention in the form of manual work is calculated to have a serious effect upon their ability to absorb instruction during school hours, and to be used as an excuse by them for not doing their homework.  The Bill makes this further extraordinary provision that on a non-school day, which may be a Saturday, a young child between 12 and 14 years might be expected to work for five hours even though a skilled tradesman on that day would probably work only three or four hours, it being his half-day.  So that on the day the ordinary tradesman selects for his half-day his young child between 12 and 14 may be working five hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Department's outlook on this Bill.  I am glad of the conversions that have taken place since it was drafted.  As Deputy Mulcahy has rightly pointed <Col N="2225" /> out, the position of children over 14 years of age in this city, who have left school, is perfectly appalling.  There are thousands of them running around the streets.  They cannot get employment. The Minister and the officials in his Department should go through the poorer parts of the city and see the large number of children of 14, 15 and 16 years of age who are simply running around wild because they cannot get any type of employment.  These children are not compelled to go to school after they have reached the age of 14.  If any person wants to employ a child for two or three hours on a school day, or for five hours on a Saturday or a Church holiday, surely he ought to be compelled to take into his employment some of those children over 14, 15 or 16 years of age who are at present running wild through the city instead of being allowed to employ a child between 12 and 14 years of age. The only incentive to employ a child before or after school hours would seem to be that child labour can be hired at an extremely cheap rate.  I think the Minister should concern himself with trying to absorb into employment children over 14 years of age before he releases on the labour market children between 12 and 14 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say frankly that I regard the outlook of the Department of Education on children's entry into industry and employment as a most reactionary one.  A few years ago we had a committee set up by the Department, composed of unnamed folk, which made the revelation in its report that children of 14 years of age were not too immature to enter industry.  In other words, the view held was that a child of that age could go into a cotton mill and work a 48-hour week.  I wonder if the people responsible for that report ever saw a cotton mill or had any idea of the fatiguing operations that are performed in it by adults, much less young children under 14.  That committee held the view that young children of that age were not too immature to go into a beet factory, a boot factory or any other type of factory in the city. That was the viewpoint of the Department of Education at that time and, <Col N="2226" /> unfortunately, it was accepted by the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Even with the amendments which it is proposed to make to it, I still regard Section 7 as a most reactionary one. I think the Minister would get the commendation of every person rightly interested in educational progress in this country if he were to take his stand on the simple principle laid down in the Conditions of Employment Act, which will not allow a child to take work if he is under 14 years of age, and in the Shops Act which prevents a child working in shops if he is under 14 years of age.  There should be a like provision in this measure in respect of every other occupation not covered by the Conditions of Employment Act or the Shops Act, so that the Department of Education would not allow persons to employ children under 14 years of age for the reason that such employment is calculated to interfere with the children's education in a country that, God knows, still needs a lot of education for its young people.</P>
    <P>In the welter of war we can see through all the fire a recognition by progressive minded people in all countries of the value of education in the post-war period.  In those countries keen minds are applying themselves to the problem of trying to equip the young people of the future to meet the tasks that will confront them, as well as the impacts which the child's body and mind must meet in the post-war period.  We are living in peace and ought to be taking advantage of our present opportunity to equip our people with those educational qualities which it is not possible for those in other countries, in the maelstrom of war, to give to their young people.  Instead, what are we doing in this Bill?  Under a section entitled &ldquo;Restrictions on employment of children,&rdquo; we are now removing restrictions on the employment of children, and are going to permit their employment between the ages of 12 and 14.  This section, in my opinion, is a most reactionary one, even if the amendments to it, other than this one, be accepted.  Instead of raising the school leaving age, we are here virtually lowering it, so that young children between 12 and 14 years of age <Col N="2227" /> will be permitted to take work.  Any form of neglect in the children's education will be shown in their mental and cultural equipment when they come to leave school at 14 years of age.  I think that the greatest joke I have ever seen embodied in legislation is contained in paragraph (d) of Section 7.  It provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a justice of the District Court is satisfied on the complaint of any person that any child who has attained the age of 12 years and has not attained the age of 14 years is employed in a manner which, though not contravening any of the foregoing provisions of this sub-section or any regulation made thereunder, is such as to prevent or interfere with such child obtaining proper benefit from attendance at school, such justice may prohibit such employment or attach to it such conditions as he thinks suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I think, is a daft section.  Who is going to make the complaint?  Suppose I am abhorred at seeing a child at work between the ages of 12 and 14, what have I to do in order to satisfy myself that the physical labour of that young child is interfering with his education and preventing him from getting proper benefit from attendance at school?  It is daft to imagine that any ordinary citizen&mdash;one must assume that the child is being employed with the consent of its parents&mdash;will come forward and make a complaint.  Is it imagined that the parents of some other child will go to the district justice and say: &ldquo;Look here, sir, I bring to your notice the fact that Mary Murphy, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, is working for two or three hours a day or five hours on Saturday as the case may be, and I beg you to believe that that child is not getting the proper benefit from attendance at school&rdquo;?  What is the district justice to do?  Is he to leave the Bench and go off and see Mary Murphy, examine her as to how she is doing at school, compare her with the other children attending school and ascertain whether Mary is abreast of the others or well in the rear?  I venture to say that at <Col N="2228" /> the end of the next century no one will have operated this particular section. It is only in for the purpose of flap-doodle, to give the impression that someone will go to the district justice. Suppose someone does go to the district justice; suppose I am considerably interested in some particular case, and I go to the district justice; I might have considerable trouble in convincing the district justice that in fact the child was not getting the proper benefit from attendance at school following that employment.  Suppose the child then goes into other employment; an entirely new set of circumstances would then arise, and I would have to go back to the district justice.  The child, would, therefore, have to leave that employment and get something else.</P>
    <P>I never read a more unworkable section in my life, and whoever is responsible for it has unconsciously a very humorous mind.  I think the Minister should accept the amendment which has been proposed by Deputy Mulcahy.  If he does that, he will get the support of every person who is rightly interested in imparting to our children the best possible standard of education we can give them, in order to equip them for the world in which they are now merely children but in which in a short time they will be adolescents and men and women, and that is a world in which those who are unequipped, mentally and culturally, will fall very much behind in the race for a decent existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A week ago I drew attention to this matter, and I made an appeal to the Minister to introduce some form of amendment which would prevent children between 12 and 14 years of age from seeking or getting employment.  I agree with previous speakers that this will lead to a form of cheap labour, very cheap labour indeed, and it will be harmful to boys and girls who have left school at 14 years of age and have no opportunity of getting employment.  At the present moment the difficulties in the way of getting employment for children of 14 to 16 years of age are very great indeed, and it is heartbreaking for any <Col N="2229" /> member of the Dáil to meet the parents of these children when he cannot help in any way to get employment for them.  Now the Minister is going to make things worse for them by allowing children between the ages of 12 and 14 years to take employment.  He is also making it very difficult indeed for teachers to keep up their records of attendance.  We know that in some cases it is on the basis of the attendance that the teachers are able to keep their employment, and that, when the attendance drops, the last teacher in is the first out.  At the moment, there is considerable unemployment amongst the teaching fraternity.  It is not fair to them that this House should be silent, and allow this section to go as it stands.  I think the Minister would be very well advised if he accepted this amendment, and so remedied the grievance which has been complained of.</P>

I agree with everything that Deputy Norton said in relation to school-going children.

      <P>I should like also to appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  In the Cork Corporation we brought in a bye-law some time ago that children under 14 years of age could not even be employed selling papers on the streets.  If this section is passed, it means that little boys and girls from 12 to 14 years of age can sell the <i>Evening Echo</i> on the street. I am sure that messenger boys are employed in the towns and cities to-day, from 14 to 17 years of age, at 6/- or 7/6 a week, and we can imagine what will be the demand for boys from 12 <Col N="2230" /> to 14 years of age for employment as messengers from 8 o'clock in the morning to 7 or 9 o'clock in the evening.  I think it is not necessary to elaborate the matter any further, but I must express my surprise that in 1942 a Government should bring in a Bill with a section of this kind encouraging child labour.</P>

      <P>Of course, the statements that this section encourages child labour are absolutely preposterous. The position is that under the 1926 Act the Minister took certain powers to make regulations governing the question of the employment of children whose attendance at school might be interfered with.  In fact no regulations were made.  I could have entirely ignored the matter in this Bill, because the question of the control of child labour is not primarily a matter for the Department of Education. I come into it to the extent to which the attendance of the children at school might be affected, or their capacity to benefit from the instruction they receive at school might be affected, but, generally speaking, the control of child labour is a matter for the Department of Trade, or, in this country, the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have accepted the amendment which the Labour Deputies themselves put down, and have put in additional provisions whereby the type of employment and the hours of employment may be regulated in due course, and the conditions in particular types of occupation may be inquired into in that connection, and it is an extraordinary thing that it should be said that this is an inducement to employ child labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, any step in advance which does not directly achieve an ideal is a step backwards.  If I had not dealt with the matter in the Bill at all, Deputies would probably not have raised the question.  This is a very big matter, because, if the child is attending school regularly, and is profiting from the instruction, the parents were entitled up to the present to have the children in employment either with an employer or on work for themselves.  It was recognised generally that it did children no harm to <Col N="2231" /> do light work, for example, seasonal work on the land.  It was admitted by the Oireachtas here that it was a good thing, a necessary thing, and it was even suggested that from the educational point of view it might be an advantageous thing to give children special holidays from school to assist their parents.  It was generally recognised that, even for school-going children, light employment might be useful, might be advantageous, not alone from the point of view of character, training and preparation for the world, but actually from the rather narrower point of view of learning something useful, learning to use one's hands, learning that work is important, that one cannot get on in this world without working, that there is no easy or royal road to comfortable positions, that, no matter what scheme of things may face us in the future, the vast majority of our children will have to carry on work with their hands, will have to carry on in manual occupations.</P>

      <P>I explained last night that the powers I am seeking will enable me, in due course, to make regulations, when I am in a position to investigate the matter, as to what particular types of trade should be covered.  I do not believe a blanketing amendment of this kind should be accepted; while I have a good deal of sympathy with it, I do not believe that it should be accepted without careful inquiry as to what might be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the trend of events in this matter, let us take, for example, the charters from the International Labour Office.  We have not accepted them fully.  My predecessor did not accept them fully with regard to agricultural labour.  When the original Act was introduced in 1926, it was recognised that, this being an agricultural country, the question of children working on the land, helping their parents at busy times, was a very important matter and it would be difficult to close down on it.  If you close down on it completely it merely means that the <Col N="2232" /> law is not going to be obeyed; it is going to be evaded.  In the same way, there is the question of children working for their parents in a shop or some other place of business, sweeping up the place or doing other work of that kind.</P>
    <P>When the matter relates to particular industries in which children are employed by outside employers, I am quite willing, if amendments are put down covering these types of employment, to consider the matter.  I am disposed to go into it carefully to see what particular types of occupation might be banned by me under the regulations.  But it must be borne in mind that I am not in the same position as the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  What has to be proved, so far as I am concerned, is that the child's educational welfare is being prejudiced in some way by work which he is doing outside school hours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton may jeer, but, no matter what regulations you may make, there will always have to be a court to decide in the long run and it is very difficult to see how these phrases, which have been accepted over a long period of years in these international conventions&mdash;the question, for example, whether the child's normal health or normal development is interfered with, whether his education is being adversely affected, or whether he is not getting the full benefits that he should get from attendance at school&mdash;can be improved upon.  It is difficult to see how you can improve upon these formulæ.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an easy matter to set down in black and white the considerations which one must have in mind.  People may differ widely in their views in this regard.  Some persons might consider that it was in the child's interest, to the child's advantage, to do a certain amount of manual work for a period every day.  We know that in certain schools and certain other institutions children, and not the children of the poorest parents, are asked to do a certain amount of work. We know that in these places children are trained to do things with their hands and many people believe that, within reasonable limits, that is valuable.  I am simply pointing to the <Col N="2233" /> fact that you will have differences of opinion among people.  One must have regard to the actual conditions, the type of place where the work is being carried on, whether it is the home of the child or some factory in a back lane&mdash;these considerations will affect the question very seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton speaks of the children working.  Even if the children are working, it is not suggested they are doing the same type of work as adults, the type of work, even if they are in industrial employment, which the law here prevents in the case of children under 14 years of age.  Even if they are in industrial employment, they are not likely to be doing work of the same nature as that done by adults.</P>
    <P>I think the provisions in this Bill are a definite step forward.  It would be very difficult indeed to schedule particular occupations.  I think if you prevent parents from getting children to do work for themselves or for others, possibly without remuneration, outside school hours, you are going to be faced with the difficulty of making examination in every individual case. You have no general line to go upon. It is very hard to devise a general line. If the parents, on the other hand, are in very poor circumstances, if their means are slender and they are getting some small remuneration from the light type of work which the child does between these ages, they will naturally expect compensation.  They will expect, if you deprive them of that remuneration, to be compensated in some way.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Byrne. I think it is a fairly sound belief, and there is a good deal of data available in support of it, to show that in actual fact, when the juvenile labour is restricted, it is not necessarily going to mean any increase in employment for others.  It might very often mean an actual decrease in the total amount of employment given.  I am not justifying the employment of juveniles.  I merely say that if you view this purely as an economic matter, there is no use pretending that the remedies which have been suggested are going to help to solve the unemployment problem.  It was from that point of view that the <Col N="2234" /> committee which examined this question some years ago said, in summing up, that they were not satisfied that there was a case for raising the school-leaving age on that ground alone.</P>
    <P>A single phrase has been torn out of this report and has been repeated again and again without any reference to the context.  Without either agreeing or disagreeing with what the report says, I would like to take the opportunity, since Deputy Norton has raised the question, to point out, not the phrase which has been torn out of the summary of conclusions of this report, but the main section of the report in which the matter is dealt with.  One of the reasons, according to the committee, given for demands that the school-leaving age should be changed, was that children are not sufficiently matured to enter employment at the age of 14 years.  On page 20 of the report this is what the committee said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was stated that there was an increasing demand for the services of girls of 14 to 16 years of age in factories, where they are engaged on such work as packing, mechanical and monotonous operations by machinery, etc.  In such work the girls were often kept standing all day and their duties in frequent instances necessitated constant stooping.  It was contended that employment of this kind was unsuited to girls at the age of adolescence.</P>
    <P>An issue of this kind, involving the physical fitness of juveniles for employment in industry, is one on which we are scarcely in a position to express a view.  It is more a matter of expert medical opinion.  We are aware, however, that young persons between the ages of 14 and 16 years must be certified by the certifying surgeon under the Factory and Workshops Act as medically fit before they are admitted to employment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the statement Deputy Norton made.  The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We presume that before any persons are certified for admission regard is had to the conditions under which they would be employed.  It must be remembered that these young people are anxious to start work, to be independent, to earn a little for themselves to supplement the family income.  In many cases where the conditions of employment may be unsuitable a remedy should be sought by way of improving the conditions rather than by way of raising the school-leaving age and excluding juveniles from employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whether we agree with that or not, the point, I think, is perfectly clear that the question of the school-leaving age is an educational question, and if you are trying to remedy the employment of juveniles in respect of the raising of the school-leaving age, it is clearly a matter of the conditions of employment in industry being regulated by the charter which deals with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mesmerised by all the information we have got about so many things except the point we are really discussing, the point to which everybody who has spoken confined himself, that is&mdash;the reasons for changing &ldquo;12 years&rdquo; to &ldquo;14 years.&rdquo; I do not want to go over those reasons, but the Minister indicates that he is introducing an amendment by which he can prohibit employment in particular industries under certain conditions. He indicated, however, that it would be very difficult to segregate the types of industry to be dealt with. I submit, in the first instance, that this deals with a job with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is more qualified to deal, and, in the second place, that if it is difficult to segregate the industries with which children of tender years should be associated, it is infinitely more difficult to differentiate between the types of work attached to these industries with which children of tender years should be allowed to be associated, so that the amendment in the Minister's name, <Col N="2236" /> which is supposed to give him a way of avoiding a decision on this &ldquo;12 years&rdquo; proposal, is one which is not worth the paper it is written on.  If it takes so much argument, so much trouble and so much delay to do a number of things in the educational world, it will certainly take 10 times as long to get a decision under the proposed amendment, so that I leave the amendment completely out of my consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that if his amendment was not down, we might not have raised this question at all. It is quite true that we might not have seen that we had the opportunity of discussing it, but nobody who occupies a public position or who moves about Ireland at present and comes up against family life and the problems of parents on the one hand, and of the adolescent on the other, could be ignorant of the urgency and importance of the problem presented here.  We may talk about the school-leaving age and all that, and there are things which some of us would like to see done in that respect, particularly in present circumstances and bearing on the future, but that is a small matter.  It is, if you like, an academic matter, compared with the really urgent moral, spiritual and physical problem that arises for the child who leaves school, and who leaves school very often because there is nothing there to grip or hold him, for institutions that offer greater development of character and personality.  For the child who leaves school and has nothing to do but hang around the home, the home being like a nest from which the young birds cannot learn to fly, anybody in any way in touch with the situation should realise what is involved in the proposal to change &ldquo;12 years&rdquo; to &ldquo;14 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister makes some point about children working for their parents and for people outside.  I must say that I never would have thought that the sentence in sub-section (1) (a): &ldquo;No person shall have in his employment any child who has not attained the age of 12 years,&rdquo; would refer to parents.</P>

I think the Minister's introduction of that point shows either a confusion of his own mind or a tendency to confuse the situation here.  I attach no other interpretation to the word &ldquo;employment,&rdquo; but the interpretation Deputy Norton has indicated attaches to it in kindred legislation.  I do not see the necessity for going over the ground the Minister has covered, but I do see the necessity of understanding the spirit in which everybody who has spoken on this matter has spoken, and the object he had in speaking.  I think that &ldquo;12 years&rdquo; should come out, and &ldquo;14 years&rdquo; should be left in for the reasons I gave as clearly as I could both yesterday and to-day.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear Deputy Breathnach giving us the benefit of his practical experience as a teacher on this section.  I am sure his contribution would indicate considerable sympathy with our efforts on these benches to get the Minister to accept this very reasonable amendment. Though the Minister talked for some time in the course of his reply to the comments of Deputy Mulcahy and myself, he did not give us a shred of evidence to justify the continuance of the position which will exist under the Bill, if the Minister is empowered to allow people between the ages of 12 and 14 years to take up employment.  As a matter of fact, quite clearly the Minister indicated that he was in a desperate plight to find a single argument to resist this amendment.  The Minister told us that if children between 12 and 14 years of age were not permitted to work under the Bill, they could not do a single job at home.  Am I to understand from that that a child of 10 years or 11 years of age will not be allowed to do a job at home when the Bill passes, because that is the only meaning of what the Minister said?  The Minister said he wants to allow a child between the ages of 12 and 14 years to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference clearly is that unless a child is allowed to work between the ages of 12 and 14 years, he will not be able to do any jobs at home between those ages.  Take the child of ten or 11 years of age.  Will he or she be allowed to do any jobs at home?  If there is any substance in what the Minister says, no child under 12 years of age will be allowed to dirty its hands at home.  That is clearly preposterous.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem able to apprehend fully the language of his own Bill.  Section 7 says that no person shall have in his employment any child who has not attained the age of 12 years. &ldquo;Employment&rdquo;, under the Conditions of Employment Act, clearly means a contract of employment. In that Act, the term &ldquo;employment&rdquo; means a contract of employment of the master and man kind. The Minister now wants to stretch the meaning of the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo; to indicate that a child could not, for instance, bring in a sod of turf out of the coalhouse.  He suggests that even if a father wanted his child to go out and dig some vegetables in the back garden, he could not do so, because that would be employment.  That is absurd, and it is only reducing the Bill to further ridicule for the Minister to rely on arguments of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister puts forward another contention&mdash;I will not say it is an argument because it does not come up to the standard of argument that one expects in a deliberative assembly.  He says that if these children are not allowed to work between the ages of 12 and 14, the parents will look for compensation.  The only one who has thought of that is the Minister himself. It is only since he has been urged to accept this amendment that we heard that a claim for compensation might follow in these cases.  Does the Minister not know that, prior to the introduction of the Conditions of Employment Act, young children under 14 years of age were in fact working 48, 60 and 72 hours a week?  Does he not know that in shops young lads under 14 years of age were employed <Col N="2239" /> as messengers and had to work as long as 80 hours a week from the time the shop opened at 8 o'clock in the morning until it shut at 12 o'clock at night? That happened prior to the introduction of the Conditions of Employment Act and the Shops Act.  In both these Acts we inserted a provision to the effect that it would be an offence to employ a young person under the age of 14, and never at any time did we hear a suggestion that compensation would have to be paid to the parents because of that provision.</P>
    <P>It is only now when we come to deal with a range of employment not covered by the Conditions of Employment Act or the Shops Act that the Minister discovers that there might be a claim for compensation by the parents of a child, if that child were prohibited from working between the ages of 12 and 14.  Seeing that we have prohibited children from working over the wide range of occupations covered by these other Acts, I cannot see how the Minister contemplates that there will be any claim for compensation in respect of the residue of employment still available to young persons.  The Minister knows well that no such demand is likely to arise.  He is extremely hard up for an argument when he tries to rely on a broken reed of that kind to resist a progressive amendment of this kind.</P>
    <P>Through an oversight, an amendment of mine, in terms similar to that put down by Deputy Mulcahy, does not appear on the Order Paper, but that does not take from the fact that I prefer Deputy Mulcahy's amendment to the other amendments that are down.  We only put down these amendments to make the Bill less objectionable if we could not get the Minister to raise the age for employment from 12 to 14 years of age.  So far as utterances in this House are concerned, the volume of opinion expressed by all Parties urges the Minister to accept this amendment.  If the Minister does accept the amendment, he will be taking a progressive step and one that will be in tune with the aims and aspirations of the people who want to see the children of the country get a <Col N="2240" /> proper education, an education which they deserve, especially in a country whose standard of education is not at all as high as that desired by those who would wish to see the mental and cultural equipment of our people fully developed.</P>

      <P>I think the provisions in the Bill are a step forward and that it would be a great mistake to accept the Deputy's amendment without understanding fully what the consequences are likely to be.  As I have said, it is not primarily a matter for me.  The particular cases to which Deputy Norton has referred came up in another connection, and the sole question at issue there was whether it was right that all these considerations about employment and their effect on children should be taken into account. The principle underlying legislation about school attendance is that the Minister for Education should interfere only where he is satisfied that the type of work children are doing interferes with opportunities for their education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been following the International Conventions.  We have not fully accepted them, but the principle they have laid down, that children should be allowed to work only for a certain number of hours on school days or non-school days, has been accepted by me in one of the amendments put down.  Under the regulations which it is proposed to frame.  I suggest that the Minister will have discretion, and that it is merely a question of whether we are now going to take a leap in the dark or wait until we have an opportunity of examining the whole matter fully.  I think that reason and common sense would dictate that, while having the fullest sympathy with the ideals of Deputies&mdash;I have the same ideals myself, I hope&mdash; it would be only right that the Minister should have an opportunity of examining the whole question fully. Under my amendment he has power to make regulations, and if the amendment <Col N="2241" /> is accepted by the House, in due course he will have to examine the whole question.  I think it is better to examine all the considerations involved before taking the step that is suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister has said now that he does not propose to accept this amendment.  He asks for a period of time after the Bill, as he proposes to amend it, has been in operation for some time, to size up this particular matter.  If I thought that the Minister, between now and the Report Stage, would give consideration to this matter I certainly would hesitate to divide the House after the favourable expression of opinion which the amendment has received even from members of his own Party.  On the other hand, if, as I understand, the position is that the Minister does not propose to consider this matter until after he has put the Bill into operation, according to his own ideas, then I think I would be lacking in my responsibility if I avoided giving the House an opportunity of dividing on this question.  There is no use in thinking that we can deal with the problems with which we have to deal from the point of view of the general position of juveniles in this country or from an educational point of view, by deferring consideration of them in this way.  We could look for a solution until the cows come home if we tried to solve them in that way. Deputy Hickey has shown clearly that the Cork Corporation as a responsible public body, as men who have to review every aspect of the social position in the city, have actually introduced as far as they could a regulation by which children under 14 years of age will not be employed.  I think that nobody who realises the issue at stake would hesitate to take a decision.  I shall have to press this to a division unless the Minister can give me, even now, a promise that he will consider this matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>

The argument made is that, if these children are not allowed to work, the parents might claim compensation.  That argument cannot stand at all.

      <P>I cannot understand the timidity of the Minister in this matter, particularly when he indicates that he has sympathy with the object which the amendment seeks to secure.  He talks about a leap in the dark and uses language of that kind, when the only leap we are taking is to say to young children between 12 and 14: &ldquo;You will be compelled to pursue your studies at school.  With so many over 14 years of age idle, you will not be allowed to enter into competition with those over 14, where such employment is available.  In our world, in which education will mean so much in the future, you are going to concentrate on your studies and not embark on <Col N="2243" /> courses of activity or manual labour calculated to interfere with them.&rdquo; That is the leap.  One would imagine that in a progressive-minded country everybody would be bursting to take that &ldquo;leap in the dark&rdquo;.  The Minister professes to sympathise with the object that this amendment seeks to secure, yet he says he is reluctant to take that &ldquo;leap in the dark&rdquo; lest some appalling catastrophe may engulf this country if children are not allowed to work between 12 and 14.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the history of industrial England before the passage of the Shaftesbury Factory Acts.  At that time, young children of 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 worked in the mines, where they were yoked to trucks.  They were put down in the mines in the morning and their little bodies were made haul coal trucks all day, with the aid of ropes and chains.  Hordes of these young children were drawing trucks. When public-minded Britain revolted against that appalling condition of affairs, efforts were made to introduce Factory Acts, so as to regulate employment. Of course, all the vested interests, who desired to exploit young children for industrial purposes, strongly opposed such legislation.  The matter was debated in the British House of Commons and people, who at that time regarded themselves as very good military advisers to Britain and as very well-known economists, gave utterance to their views as to the effect on Britain if the Shaftesbury Acts were enacted.  Some of them stated that, up to then, Britain held unchallenged sway on the sea, her sea power was respected all over the world; others stated that Britain's armies were something to fear in all corners of the world, and that the British Empire stood there as something which begot the envy of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were economists, financiers and well-to-do industrialists.  &ldquo;Now all that is going,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;Britain's might on the sea will be menaced if you do not let these children work in the mines; British military power over the world will fade away unless you can get these people to work in <Col N="2244" /> the mines.&rdquo;  Some of them predicted even a scarcity of goods in Britain if they were not allowed to exploit young children of eight to 14 years of age.  Of course, the subsequent developments falsified all they said.  The national income of Britain increased by leaps and bounds, its productivity multiplied ten-fold, and, in the subsequent eight years which followed the passage of those Acts, Britain added probably more territory to her Empire than ever before.  These views are on record in the British House of Commons and can be read still.  They are interesting in the light of a statement that it is not wise to take a leap in the dark, as the leap might prevent young children of 12 to 14 from getting employment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any sympathy with this amendment, he should take this &ldquo;leap in the dark&rdquo;.  I do not know of one single person, whose opinion is of any value in this country, who would blame the Minister for taking it.  Most of them would say that he is taking, not a leap into the dark but a leap into the sunlight of better education for young children.  That is something to which the Minister for Education here should aspire.</P>
    <P>I do not know what consolation the Minister gets by talking about international conventions.  If he knows the way that international conventions are enacted and the trouble there is in enacting them, he knows perfectly well that they are not of themselves the pinnacle of perfection.  Anyone who has experience of the difficulty at Geneva of trying to get a convention sanctioned, knows perfectly well the seesaw delay.  One tries to get the convention through on the basis of trying to pull up the backward countries to a standard acceptable to more progressive countries.  Conventions which enlightened countries would support have to be watered down, in order to please those countries which are not so progressive.  International conventions represent, in the main, an effort to lift the backward up.  They never indicate the goal-post which progressive nations set for themselves. How many of these conventions can be ratified the following day by the progressive nations, whereas they represent <Col N="2245" /> a terrific achievement in the case of others?</P>
    <P>It is the same in matters of education. Some of the conventions are such as we could ratify very easily.  Some of the ideas were enacted here a long time before they were enacted at Geneva.  Every progressive nation could ratify some of them overnight, and would think nothing of them, as they are merely an effort to set minimum standards for backward nations and bring them up to that minimum standard.  The Minister can get no consolation out of this, and should not, in 1942, regard it as a great achievement.  He should accept this amendment, unless Deputy Mulcahy is prepared to agree to let him look into the matter between now and the Report Stage.  He can talk to the best educational minds in the country, to those who have experience in regard to children of 14 to 16 running around the street.  Then I bet the Minister will come back, on the Report Stage, and realise that his fears were groundless and that everybody interested in the well-being of education will support him strongly if he accepts the principle enshrined in this amendment.  Would the Minister agree to examine the matter between now and the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>Yes.  I must say that I should be rather interested to learn how Deputy Norton thinks this will affect the children running around the streets.  Presumably, he is thinking of the children who may be in employment. I fail entirely to see how, even if the matter is dealt with as requested, it will affect the position of children running around the streets.  It might be argued that it would be much better for the children running around the streets if they had some useful occupation.</P>

      <P>If the Minister allows children to be employed between 12 and 14 years, a person is not likely to employ a young person of 16 who would come under the National Health Insurance Acts.  What the Minister should do is to keep the school children at school and try to get employment for those away from school&mdash;even temporarily.  What is happening in Cork and Dublin is a standing argument for the extension of the age to 16 years.  It is a remarkable thing that the President of the British Board of Education said recently that he intended to introduce compulsory day-continuation schools so as to provide that, in Britain, children who leave the ordinary schools would be obliged to go to day-continuation schools, indicating that, so far as our next-door neighbours are concerned, they are quite alive to the importance and value of education.  I venture to say that if our people had a proper system of education, and if the facilities available to children in Britain were available here, we would not have so many of our people working in Britain as under-paid navvies to-day.  Many of them would be in better positions in Britain than they <Col N="2247" /> are.  Unfortunately, we export them as untrained navvies simply because our educational system does not equip them for better positions.</P>

      <P>As regards amendments Nos. 15 and 16, I have lost faith in amendment No. 16.  As regards amendment No. 15, the national school-day owing to the break, ends at present at 4 o'clock.  Therefore, I think that 4 o'clock is an unsuitable time to put down as the time from which a young person may be employed.  One of the remarkable features of the introduction of the break for meals in the primary schools is that attendance in the evening is as good as attendance in the morning. It would be a pity if the fixing of the hour for beginning work at the same time as the hour for finishing school work should introduce a disturbing element into the afternoon attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 8, page 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Every school attendance committee shall be an elective body within the meaning and for the purposes of the County Management Acts, 1940 and 1942, and those Acts shall apply and have effect in relation to school attendance committees accordingly, but with and subject to the following modification, that is to say, the authorisation of prosecutions for offences under the Principal Act or this Act shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>(2) For the purposes of the application by the foregoing sub-section of this section of the County Management Acts, 1940 and 1942, to the school attendance committee for a school attendance area which is a county borough such county borough shall be deemed to be a county and the city manager of such county borough shall be deemed to be a county manager.</P>
      <P>This amended section would place the county managers in the same relation to the school attendance committee and their officers as they stand, under the County Management Act, to the other committees of local authorities. The authorising of prosecutions for offences under the Act of 1926 and under this Act will be entirely a reserved function of the school attendance committee.  The county manager will have the supervision, control, payment and superannuation of officers, and their appointment, subject to the provisions of the Local Appointments (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some explanations are required as regards this new section.  Section 16 (1) of the County Management Act, 1940, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Neither the council of a county nor any elective body shall directly exercise or perform any power (other than a power which is vested by law (including this Act) in such council or body and is by this Act expressly made exercisable by resolution of <Col N="2249" /> such council or body), function or duty of such council or body in relation to the officers or servants of such council or body, or the control, supervision, service, remuneration, privileges, or superannuation of such officers or servants or any of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the new section is put in, the position, as I understand it, under Section 16 (1) of the County Management Act is that in relation to officers or servants of the school attendance committee, which is now an elective body under the Act, the control, supervision, conditions of service, remuneration, privileges, and superannuation of all these servants or officers or any of them will be entirely a matter for the county manager.  I entirely agree with that.  But the new situation, as brought about by the putting in of this section, would conflict, in my opinion, with what is being left in here in Section 8 (1) (b) and (c).  Section 8, as it stands in the Bill, says:</P>
    <P>(1) The functions of a school attendance committee in relation to the following matters shall be performed directly by the committee itself, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the authorisation of prosecutions for offences under the Principal Act or this Act,</P>
    <P>(b) subject to the provisions of Section 11 of the Principal Act, the appointment under that section of officers and the fixing and paying thereunder of their remuneration,</P>
    <P>(c) subject to the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 12 of the Principal Act, the appointment under that sub-section of school attendance officers.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that Section 8, if it is left in as it stands, would be at variance with the intention here.  I accept the intention of the Minister's new section as meaning that the school attendance committee will be responsible for policy as regards the using of the administrative machine to see that the Act is properly carried out, but that the providing of that machine and the looking after the general discipline of that machine will be a function of <Col N="2250" /> the county manager.  Therefore, the position will be that you will have a school attendance committee charged with the administration of the Act, and particularly with taking decisions with regard to prosecutions for offences under the Act.  They will have a considerable amount of work.  But, so far as the machine that is put into their hands for carrying out that work is concerned, the building up of that machine and the conditions of service, pay, superannuation, etc., will be the function of the county manager.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to raise in connection with that, and that is, who will fix the qualifications of the school attendance officers or any other officers who may be part of the machine?  I suggest again that that would be in fact the function of the county manager; that there would in fact be the necessary consultations and the necessary recommendations; that the school attendance committee would probably advise the county manager as to the qualifications of the various officers, particularly the school attendance officers, and no doubt, in the way in which Ministerial contact and responsibility are kept up, the sanction of the Minister would be required for the various qualifications. I should like to be clear on that point, and I would be glad to be assured that sub-section (1) (b) (c) of Section 8 is not at variance with what we hope is the intention of the new section or, if it is, that the section will be amended on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into the point raised by Deputy Mulcahy. Under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act it is probably a matter for the Minister to determine the qualifications.  If there is any anomaly, I will see that it is straightened out on the Report Stage.  I think in the opinion of the legal advisers that, so far as bringing the scheme into harmony with the County Management Act is concerned, these amendments at any rate achieve that purpose.</P>

      <P>As to amendment No. 24, I am not moving it, but I just want to add one thing which I think deserves to be said at this point.  The question of the retiring age of school attendance officers, on the one hand, and the question of qualifications for their appointment are matters which require to be given very careful consideration. So far as the qualifications are concerned, I understand that the educational standard at present for school attendance officers is the seventh standard of the primary school. But, on a recent occasion, when a position became vacant in Dublin, there were 108 applicants; of these, 95 per cent. had a secondary education, a very large number had the leaving certificate, a number of them had matriculated, and a number had university degrees.  Apart altogether from the type of material that is available for positions of that kind as shown by these applications, I think the work itself would certainly require a higher educational experience than is indicated by the 7th standard of the primary school programme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the following words &ldquo;unless his absence was due to illness or other cause deemed sufficient by the Minister but, in any event, a member of a school attendance committee, who is absent from six successive meetings of such committee shall cease to be a member of such committee immediately after the sixth of such meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think amendments Nos. 26, 27 and 28 are met by this amendment.  I think it is a reasonable compromise.  The suggestion was that allowance ought to be made for the illness of members of committees; that it would not be <Col N="2252" /> fair to terminate their membership after failure to attend three successive meetings.  My amendment provides that, if the absence is due to illness or other cause deemed sufficient by the Minister, a member may be absent from six successive meetings; but, if he is absent from six, he ceases to be a member of the committee immediately after the sixth meeting.  I cannot conceive how, after six months, a member might be considered to be a live member of the committee, so to speak, if he were not able to attend for such a long period of time.  In order to meet the position of parish priests, who may have difficulty in attending meetings, we are enabling them to appoint deputies.  This, I daresay, applies to other members of the committees, lay members, for example. I think the amendment meets the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so far as the question of illness is concerned.  But the Minister's amendment reads (amendment read).  The Minister introduces an additional matter there.  I do not know whether it is the intention to destroy the section as it is.  The section says that &ldquo;where a member of a school attendance committee is absent from three successive meetings of such committee, he shall cease to be a member of such committee immediately after the third of such meetings&rdquo;. Is that going out?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, all I want to say, then, with regard to the question of illness, is that if we take the report of the school attendance committees in the City of Dublin for the year ended 30th June, 1941, it will be found that there were 11 ordinary meetings in No. 1 area, 11 ordinary meetings in No. 2 area, 11 ordinary meetings in No. 3 area, 11 ordinary meetings in No. 4 area, and 11 ordinary meetings in No. 5 area.  That would mean that in the case of illness, extending over the whole of 12 months, one attendance in the year would be sufficient to keep a person a &ldquo;live&rdquo; member of the committee.  I do not know whether that is the intention of the Minister or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicates here that the Minister may require a school attendance committee to appoint at their monthly meetings rotatory sub-committees consisting of three of their members to hold weekly meetings for the purpose of dealing with cases of absences of children from school.  I am moving that the words &ldquo;The Minister may require&rdquo; shall be deleted and that the section should read: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of a school attendance committee to appoint at their monthly meetings rotatory sub-committees consisting of three of their members&rdquo;, and so on.  When you consider that school attendance committees are only set up <Col N="2254" /> in places such as the Cities of Dublin and Cork and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, obviously a monthly meeting is not sufficient if the administration of the Act is to be made a reality, and I think that the attitude should be that it would be a statutory duty of the school attendance committee to make the sub-committee attend weekly.</P>

I have not had an opportunity of discussing with the committee or its representative how this rotatory scheme would work, but I think it would be as well if the Minister were left with the discretion which the section, as it stands, leaves him, because it may happen that the committees may be able to show that, in fact, they cannot expedite the work by the rotatory system. I am strongly in favour of it, and will urge upon them to accept it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Linehan suggested that, perhaps, sufficient time was not being given, under the Bill as introduced, to parents to send excuses in cases of absence.  To make it five days would give parents the opportunity not to send excuses after the weekly list of absences had been furnished to the enforcing authority.  The Principal Act, I think, mentioned the third day, and we are simply reverting to the old practice.  I think that that ought to give ample time, even under the emergency conditions.  But if there were some special emergency conditions affecting school attendance generally, of course, that would have to be dealt with as an emergency matter.  Ordinarily, however, I think that it should be sufficient to allow excuses to be sent in not later than the third day after the day, or the first of the days of absence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  In any prosecution for an offence under sub-section (1) of this section a certificate purporting to be signed by the principal teacher of a school (being a national school, a suitable school or a recognised school) stating that the child to whom the prosecution relates is or is not attending that school or stating <Col N="2257" /> that such child did or did not attend that school on particular days shall, until the contrary is proved, be evidence of such of the matters aforesaid as are stated in such certificate.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that teachers will not be taken from their schools in order to give evidence, and that a certificate will be accepted as evidence.  Deputy Linehan also suggested that teachers should keep these written excuses for a certain period.  That can be done administratively.</P>

I do not see why the school attendance committees could not deal with a great deal of the details of administration.  I will look into the matter, and perhaps the Education Office could send a recommendation to the committee.  I am sure when this Bill becomes law, the Department of Education, from time to time, will have to issue instructions and they might very well consider this matter in connection with them.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The principal teacher of every national and other suitable school at which any children to whom this Act applies are enrolled or attending shall communicate at the prescribed times and in the prescribed manner to the respective enforcing authorities of the several school attendance areas in which such children respectively reside the prescribed particulars of every such child who is absent from such school and the prescribed particulars of such absences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted, the responsibility would be on the principal teacher for reporting to the school attendance committee only such absences as, in the opinion of the principal teacher, were without a satisfactory reason.  I submit to the Minister that it probably would make the work of the school attendance committee a bit easier, and it would make the position with regard to the principal teacher a bit easier, and I am sure it would not open any door for neglect of any kind, if the onus that was on the principal teacher of submitting all absences to the school attendance committee were reduced to the onus of submitting absences that, in the opinion of the principal teacher, were without a satisfactory reason.</P>

In the long run, it would have to be a matter for the court to decide whether the reason was satisfactory or not.  I am sure the Deputy will realise that it would be invidious if the teacher had to determine as between children who were absent, to say which children had satisfactory reasons and which children <Col N="2259" /> had not, when he would not have an opportunity of satisfying himself personally that the reasons given were the right reasons.  I am afraid, for that reason, it would not be workable as law.</P>

We do not even know whether teachers would like to have this duty cast upon them, but I still feel it would be very invidious, and parents would feel there was discrimination on the teacher's part, based on their family circumstances or other things like that.  When they go to the committee they feel that it is an independent body.  In a way they may regard it as a court of appeal from the teacher or from the school attendance officer.</P>

    <P>In line 1, page 9, after the word <Col N="2261" />&ldquo;Whenever&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;a member of the Gárda Síochána or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, in those areas where you have school attendance committees and school attendance officers and where up to the present the school attendance officer alone is entitled to deal with absentees from school, to give the Guards in those areas the same powers that they have in the country districts.</P>
    <P>Section 16 says that:</P>
    <P>Whenever a school attendance officer for a school attendance area situate in a county borough or borough mentioned in the Schedule to this Act finds in any public place in his school attendance area a child who appears to such officer to be a child to whom the Principal Act applies and who, having regard to the day and hour at which he is so found, ought, so far as such officer is aware, to be attending in a school, such officer may detain such child and question him as to his name, age, residence, school attendance...</P>
    <P>I think, considering the importance of the matter, and the very small number of school attendance officers we have, that if we seriously mean to get this measure administered in an efficient way, if it be only by a kind of <i>in terrorem</i> approach, we should give the Guards the same power that the school attendance officer has to challenge children and find out why they are not at school during school hours.  I do not mean that every Guard in the place should stop every child he meets, but I think the power to challenge a child during school hours should be there.  At certain periods of the year the Guards are set aside to look up our motor licences and other things. I think an odd check-up by the Guards, by giving the power I speak of, would improve things very much.</P>

The Gárda Síochána are not responsible for the administration <Col N="2262" /> of the Act in the county boroughs, with the exception of Limerick, and the authorities in the Department of Justice feel that the police force is heavily overtaxed at present.  Even in normal circumstances, I think they would be disinclined to accept any new duties that we might propose to put upon them in the way of school attendance work.  The matter has been gone into, and the position is that the Guards will not accept this duty.  They feel that, within the areas where school attendance committees have their own officers, the existing administration will have to deal with this matter.  I really have no option in the matter.</P>

      <P>In moving this amendment I want to make it clear that I do not object to a Guard stopping a child and questioning him as to why he is not at school. What I think is objectionable is that a Guard, or any official, should be free to use force when dealing with the child.  That, I think, should be left to the parent.  The section says that, if the officer is not satisfied of the truth of the replies given to his questions by a child, he may use force.  I do not think it would be the Minister's desire to give such authority to any official.  I object to the use of the word &ldquo;force&rdquo; in the section, and I hope that the Minister will agree to delete the words set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>This provision, I think, has not the meaning which the Deputy thinks it has.  It is really only a permissive provision.  It says that the officer</P>
      <P>&ldquo;may also, if he is not satisfied of the truth of the replies of such child to such questions, take such child (using such (if any) force as may be necessary) to his true place of residence and there question the parent...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> I think the Deputy will realise that the school attendance officer must be safeguarded.  It might easily happen that he might be subjected to legal proceedings even though the amount of force used might not be force as the man in the street would understand it. The word &ldquo;force&rdquo; has a technical legal meaning like the word &ldquo;assault&rdquo;. The purpose of this provision is really to safeguard the school attendance officers.  It is not to encourage them to use force, but to safeguard them, as far as possible, in a legal way.  It also safeguards them from using unnecessary force.  The officers will be under the control of the committees or of their superior officers and, presumably, will only act under their direction and instruction.  I cannot conceive any authority dealing with this matter permitting its officers to use anything that would ordinarily be described as force.  The purpose of the provision is to provide a legal safeguard for the school attendance officers in carrying out whatever duties may be entrusted to them.  It is certainly not the intention that they should use force.  The school attendance officer, however, might very easily find himself in a position in which it was suggested that he had used force and in which, if he were not safeguarded in this way, he might be subject to legal proceedings and penalties.</P>

If this provision were not in the Act that officer might render himself liable to prosecution for assault.</P>

      <P>Before Section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever it appears to a school attendance committee or a rotatory sub-committee from the report of a member of the Gárda. Síochána or a school attendance officer that a parent fails or neglects to cause his child, to whom the Principal Act applies, to attend school, in accordance with the Principal Act or this Act, the school attendance committee or the rotatory sub-committee may, by giving seven days' notice in writing, require the parent to appear before the school attendance committee or the rotatory sub-committee at a stated place and time to show cause why legal proceedings should not be instituted regarding the absence of the child.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any parent to whom the foregoing sub-section refers fails without reasonable cause to appear before the school attendance committee, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, as I understand it, the first contact that there might of necessity be between a school attendance committee and a parent is when the parent is brought into court.  As the Minister is now making provision by which there will be rotatory sub-committees, and that, therefore, there will be more frequent meetings of the members of the school attendance committee, it struck me that an experiment at any rate might be tried, or that powers might be given to summon the parent before the school attendance committee or before the rotatory sub-committee.  If the Bill <Col N="2265" /> contained those powers, we might get over a lot of the difficulties of enforcing the Act without many of the cases going to the courts at all.  I think that, when a case goes to the courts, there is always some kind of ranking in the minds of both the parents and the child in regard to the matter.  Where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against a parent, if the committee were empowered to summon the parent before them, the effect on the parent might be much more beneficial, and the result of the discussions that might take place there would inevitably be more helpful and productive of good than the type of discussions that take place in the court.  Therefore, I move this amendment as being a kind of stepping stone not to the courts but away from the courts.</P>

It is a warning that is given to the parents, and on failure to comply with that warning a summons is issued against the parents.

When the committee, for reasons that appear to themselves to be sound, prosecute the parents, I do not see why there should be any question of a warning notice.  If the committee, in all the circumstances, do not consider that they should prosecute, I am not compelling them to prosecute.  They always have the discretion whether to prosecute or not, but, on going into the matter carefully, I feel that the warning notice is no longer necessary, and that it should not be a bar, as it is at present, to dealing with people who simply are flouting the law.  They may have their own excuses, but they are flouting the law, and I do not think we should give them extra time.  I think we should go straight ahead; if the committee thinks that they ought to prosecute, then there should be no delay as there would be if the warning notice continued.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (a), line 32, page 9, after the word &ldquo;sent&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;for a period of not more than six months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 (2) provides that where, in the case of a prosecution, a parent is either convicted of an offence under the Act, or satisfies the court that he has used all reasonable efforts to cause the child to attend school, and failed, the court may, for one thing, order the said child to be sent to a certified industrial school, in which case Part IV of the Children Act, 1908, shall apply. I want to amend that by saying that the court may &ldquo;order the said child to be sent for a period of not more than six months to a certified industrial school&rdquo;.  Where the parent fails, in a particular set of circumstances, to send the child to school, or where the parent has an intractable child and is not able to get that child to go to school, there is a danger that, as the section stands, when the case comes before the court the district justice may send that child to an industrial school for a period of three or four years.  I think that should not be possible, and that, in the case of a first offence at any rate, the period of separation between the child and his family should not be longer than six months. There should be some kind of test <Col N="2268" /> applied to see whether a short period in a school where there is the discipline and regulation of an industrial school would be sufficient to overcome the difficulty in such a case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will find that the managers of industrial schools would not accept the children for such a short period as six months. I do not think they are legally bound to accept any child.  The system that has grown up is that the children are committed for a fairly long period.</P>
      <P>I think we may assume also that in a great many of these school attendance cases there are contributing factors, such as incapacity of the parents to maintain their children properly, and it is very often with the consent of the parents to a certain extent, or certainly having regard to all the family circumstances, that the justice makes the committal order.  I do not like to enter into the legal sphere, but I presume the justice will not commit the child until he is satisfied there is no other remedy.</P>
      <P>At the present time special attention is being given by the Department of Justice to the treatment of juveniles. I think we can assume, under the system of probation that exists and by reason of the experience of the justices who are dealing with this matter, that all the circumstances will be taken into consideration from the child's point of view.  I think there is no anxiety whatever to send children to an industrial school if it can be avoided.  While on the face of it the six months suggestion would seem to be a good one, I think it is out of the question for the reason that, even if we were to agree about it, the managers of industrial schools would not, I am certain, accept it.</P>

In school attendance legislation here we are deliberately bringing into our scheme a provision whereby, if the court convicts a parent for an offence under the Act, or the parent satisfies the court that he has used all reasonable efforts to cause the child to attend school, the court <Col N="2269" /> may send that child to an industrial school and, as the Minister implied, may send the child there for what has become the practice, a fairly long period.  In Dublin City we have had a considerable amount of experience of what happens in certain families. Children get into bad company of one kind or another, children of most upright and conscientious parents, and then they find themselves torn from their homes and sent to industrial schools.  I have come across many very serious and very sad cases of that sort. Here we are adding to the possibilities that exist.  As I have said, very serious and sad things have happened to quite a number of conscientious parents and decent children.  We are here adding what I consider is a grave danger.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the position in relation to these dangers is sufficiently clear in the City of Dublin, and I am very much opposed to the insertion in this Bill of a provision of this sort.  This is what it amounts to, that because parents are convicted of an offence under the Act, or because a child is an offender under the Act, without any consideration of previous history the child may be taken away from his home.  We leave a completely open door for any case of that kind. As the Minister says, the child may be taken away for a long period from his family.</P>
      <P>I quite appreciate the position of those in charge of industrial schools. If the Minister is adopting a new idea like this in order to foster a better school attendance, then he must have somewhere on the amendment paper from members of the Labour Party a suggestion that some special place of detention should be set up, some special kind of arrangement.  At any rate, some kind of institution could be set aside for short-term cases of this kind.  I think it is entirely wrong to open this new danger of an increased number of children being sent to industrial schools.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Mulcahy.  I know some people whose children were sent to industrial schools, and I must say it is very sad to hear mothers appealing for information <Col N="2270" /> as to when their children will be sent back to them.  As recently as last Monday I was asked to get a child out of an industrial school.  This child is allowed periodically to see his parents.  I am satisfied that the parents are decent people.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that six months should be quite sufficient.  There is a great inclination, when children are sent to industrial schools, to keep them there for long periods.  The desire is to keep the children in those schools as long as possible.  Many of the parents are very decent people, and they are anxious to get their children out.  In many cases children are kept in those schools for two or three years, and there is no need for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an extremely reasonable amendment.  Reading prosecutions arising out of child delinquency, one often gets the impression that some district justices regard children as a great nuisance.  I do not know whether these justices are bachelors who abhor children, but at times there seems to be a light-hearted buoyancy in the manner in which they proceed to order a child's incarceration in an industrial school for two, three, four or five years.  I do not regard industrial schools as highly laudable institutions at all.  I admit they are very necessary evils.  It is probably necessary to have them in order to curb the refractory spirit which to some extent permeates juveniles, but I do not think we should set out as our ideal the task of populating these industrial schools with juvenile delinquents.  I think there is no better place for a child's education and for the dissemination of culture, good manners and good citizenship than in its own home.  It may be difficult for some children to absorb that education and that culture because they may have in them something of the truant nature, but I think an effort ought to be made to try to induce children to step back from the code of conduct which, in the opinion of the school attendance authorities, justifies the prosecution against them and their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six months is a long time for a child to be away from its parents.  The shock of a child being thrown into an industrial <Col N="2271" /> school and having to put up with the necessarily rigid discipline of that school is, I think, sufficient to curb even the most wayward youngsters. My complaint against the amendment, if I have any, is that the period of six months is too long.  At all events, the amendment has this merit, that it will stop certain district justices from lightheartedly throwing children into industrial schools for three, four and five years.  Anybody who has had experience of trying to get a child out of an industrial school knows that it is an extremely difficult and extremely slow job.  The European war would be fought and over before you could bring a file to any kind of termination in respect of rescuing a child from an industrial school.  I had one of these cases with the Department of Education, and one would think that one had the chance of living as long as Methuselah, judging by the rate of progress made in trying to extricate a child from the clutches of an industrial school&mdash;and &ldquo;clutches&rdquo; is what it really means, in my opinion.  I think the Minister might very well accept this amendment.  I should prefer a shorter period of detention, but at any rate, there should be some maximum period set down, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept this proposal.</P>

      <P>It costs about 15/- or 16/-.  It has often been said to me that if some of that money were used to help the parents of some of these young fellows, there would be a very big change in their conduct.  The parents of many boys at present in industrial schools were allowed only 2/6 a week by the State to feed and clothe them, but the moment they enter an industrial school, it costs the State 15/- a week to keep them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the proposal is <Col N="2272" /> impracticable.  The schools will not accept children for such a short period. Deputies will see themselves that if a child is to be sent away to an industrial school, he ought to be sent for the whole of the school session at least. They will also recognise that very often you would have this type which is constantly in trouble with the school attendance authorities being put into an industrial school by a district justice for two or three months, if that policy were accepted by the schools, then coming out and being put in again.  I think the records of the courts will show that the justices give every consideration to the claims of parents.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that they have been before the school attendance committee, which gives them every latitude.  There are more people on the school attendance committee than teachers.  There are the representatives of the different religious denominations, the clergy, who are very sympathetic and humanitarian gentlemen and who give every consideration to the cases made by parents on grounds of poverty, illness, bad clothing, and so on.  On the other hand, you have cases where the father is away from home and the mother is unable to exercise any control.  The children are constantly getting into trouble and it is not merely a case of being absent from school, but of the police knowing that a youngster is going with evil companions who are certain to get him into mischief and so place a far worse stigma upon him, if the situation is not remedied, than the so-called stigma of being sent to an industrial school, where he is well fed and well looked after by teachers who have no other interest than to do their duty towards those who are placed under their control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot help that.  If the parents do not do their duty, what are we going to do with the children? If the calls of the school attendance officer and bringing them before the school attendance committee and eventually before the court have no effect, what are we going to do with <Col N="2273" /> them?  Are we going to allow them to let their children grow up as young savages, very often, when there is a remedy?</P>
      <P>The only way out of the situation at present is that the Minister, in spite of the rather damaging remarks Deputy Norton has made, is a softhearted man, and if responsible persons come to him&mdash;the local clergy or prominent Deputies, who show that they realise both sides of the case and are able to guarantee that a child will attend school&mdash;an application for release will be considered; but, as I say, when these cases come up to me, I always find that the committal of the child is only the culmination of a long series of events, that the child or the parents have very often been in conflict with the authorities for maybe years before.  If it is a genuine case of, so to speak, an accident, well and good, but the probation officer does not always feel that it is an accident. He feels sometimes that the youngster gets in with some gang or other, and that the parents themselves are not fully aware of the real situation.  I think Deputies know that is the position.</P>
      <P>All I can do to meet the Deputy is to promise that I will go carefully into any petitions that come to me and consider whether anything can be done, but I feel that this proposal is quite impracticable because it would mean setting up a new institution.  The existing institutions find it difficult to carry on and there would be the whole question of the management and financing of such an institution.  It would be quite impracticable to set it up in existing circumstances, I fear, even though we might have the consent of all concerned.</P>

I should be just as well pleased, and so would a great many of the authorities outside, if they were all closed down, and if there was no necessity for them. There is no use in the Deputy pretending that I want to send children to them, because I do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I think you will have to control the schools, or create some other kind of detention for these boys.  The Minister seemed to think, from his opening remarks, that if these boys were sent in for short periods, the schools would not take them and that boys have to be sent in for the full school session.  I am not worried in the slightest about the schools.  I would not care if they all fell down to-morrow morning and if a law were passed to prevent their reconstruction.  I am concerned with ensuring that the child who has certain rights will have these rights respected, and that these rights will not be conditioned to the school law but rather that the school law will be conditioned to a recognition of the child's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that in these matters he is sympathetic.  From personal experience, I know that to be the case, but that is not really the point at issue. What we are doing in this Bill is giving district justices power to send boys to these schools for what we know in many instances have been very long periods.  I object to giving district justices power to send boys to these industrial schools for long periods, until I am satisfied that sending them for a short period does not meet the case.  It may very well be that, in the case of a boy sent to an industrial school, a few weeks' or a few months' <Col N="2275" /> detention is sufficient to enable him to realise the error of his ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no knowledge of that either.  He is just supposing it because he thinks it a nice thing to suppose.  He has no foundation whatever for his belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I not this foundation? The Minister gave some statistics showing the period of detention in industrial schools.  My remarks are based on cases of which I read in the newspapers, by which I noticed that young boys were sent to industrial schools for long periods.  I would not allow them to be detained there much longer than is necessary to effect reformation. I think it unwise that district justices should have power to send children there for a long period without first trying the effect of a short maximum period.  The amendment seeks to make it possible to send them to these schools for a maximum of six months.  That is an experiment worth trying, to see what is the reaction on a child that is incarcerated for six months.  If the child shows that it is prepared to reform within six months, I would then let it out.  I would not be too perturbed as to what those in charge thought.  I suggest that the Minister should give this proposal a trial.  It is hardly good legislation to give district justices very wide powers or to give the Minister power to modify their decisions.  It would be better to have a maximum period of six months. Try that as an experiment and if it does not work with certain children we can provide a remedy.  One has to remember this basic fact: that the children have rights, and that district justices should not be allowed to send them to industrial schools for a period which may be longer than is necessary to effect the desired reform both in conduct and outlook.  The Minister ought to accept the amendment in order to get some experience of the operation of the Act in an amended form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy speaks of the child's rights.  A child is not in a position to judge, and the Minister has <Col N="2276" /> a certain duty cast upon him to endeavour to see that the child is properly educated.  Deputies should see the reports of the school managers when these applications are sent in, and also the educational standard of these children.  He would then see that not infrequently there are boys of 12, 13 and 14 years of age in only the third standard.  There may be some special reasons in particular cases, but I am quite convinced that a large section of children would be deprived of education altogether if these institutions were not there.  They are not penal institutions.  Deputies should go and have a look at them, when they would, perhaps, change their views.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the managers of these schools do a great deal for the children.  If the Deputy is familiar with life in the City of Dublin he will know that the managers of these schools do everything possible to try to secure employment for them.  While their drunken fathers and mothers are so often neglecting them the whole parental responsibility is very often thrown on the managers of these schools.  We are dealing with a special type of defaulter whom it has been impossible to bring to book.  Absence from school cannot be of such a character that six months would be sufficient as a corrective. The Deputy must know that there are children who go to school very, very irregularly, and whose standard of education is so low at the age of 14 that they are almost illiterate. In these schools they have an opportunity of getting education as good as that given to children whose parents are really interested, and who make every effort to look after their children's education The products of these schools bear witness to that. Deputies have an entirely wrong idea about this, and they should take the opportunity to visit these schools.  I would be very glad to assist them in that.</P>

I object to a new principle being brought in without any case being made for it, apparently without any appreciation on the part of the Minister that there is some kind of go-between, either leaving the child without education, putting it into a school for three or four years, or putting the parents right.  The Minister must know that there is.  If this does not suit the industrial school people then the whole matter should be reconsidered.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to endeavour to restore to this hospital its character as a hospital and to take away the surroundings of pauperism which it is intended to impose on the board by this section. This is an institution which has been in existence for the best part of a century. At any rate, it is almost a century since there was an inquiry into the Dublin hospitals by the British Government. This hospital has since maintained its character as a teaching hospital and as a centre of activity for medical and surgical purposes.</P>
      <P>It has been administered by a board over a long period.  Although many criticisms may have been passed upon British administration during its period here, at any rate there was one thing that could be said about it: when they appointed a body such as this, they leaned towards an extension rather than a restriction of the autonomy of such a body.  And it was right that it should be so.  The board is composed both of the medical members of the hospital and of outsiders. It got a Government grant, and up to a few years ago was in receipt of Government money.  It is not now in receipt of Government money.  There is no staff and no Minister in this State qualified to sit in judgment upon a board of this character, with which the medical and surgical professions are associated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the principal hospitals of the city.  It is not in competition with other hospitals.  It has been and is performing a great public service. Perhaps the most distinguished medical practitioner and surgeon of the 19th century was a member of this board. Having regard to his eminence, we can imagine the horror with which he would regard any attempt on the part of the Government&mdash;doing nothing whatever for the hospital&mdash;to take control of the appointment of either the charwoman or the matron or, perhaps, a paid surgeon, if there be such.  As I have said, there is no experience whatever in the Department of Local Government and Public Health of the control of such a body as this.  They are and have been concerned with the functions of the Charities Act, of dispensaries <Col N="2283" /> and of county hospitals, but not of a teaching hospital such as this.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows what the purpose of it is, nor will anyone ever know, as far as I am aware.  The board makes an appointment, let us assume for the moment, to-day, and sends it on to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  There have been complaints from one end of the country to the other about the length of time it takes that Department to make up its mind about certain matters and, from the information available, they do not seem to have improved in that matter of administration.  What knowledge would they have of this matter, assuming now that they enter into consideration of it with the best possible motives?  What knowledge have they of any sort or kind regarding this in the Department?  What useful purpose is served by giving them this power? Has the administration of the Department during the past ten years been such as would qualify them for any such authority as is proposed to be given to them under this section?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the brother of a distinguished officer giving service here in 1916, having had long service as a surgeon in a hospital in the West of Ireland.  He retired from service some time in July of one year.  He was a broken and spent man.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health took until the following June to give him a pension.  They gave him the least possible sum of money they could give him, nevertheless they took 11 months to make up their minds on that subject.  This is the body&mdash;this same Department, with possibly the very same persons as I believe were in charge then&mdash;to which we are now proposing to give authority to supervise, and approve or reject as the case may be, every single appointment made by the board of the hospital. There is no machinery or experience whatever in the whole Department from one end to the other of any association with teaching hospitals.  Nobody knows why it should be sought, and it is to be hoped that the Minister will give the House some information on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave makes a case for what he calls the restoration of the character of the hospital and the removal of restrictions on its autonomy.  I submit to the House, and in particular to Deputy Cosgrave, that the character of the hospital is not being altered by any of the terms of this Bill; but that, in fact, if the amendment moved by the Deputy were accepted by the House and incorporated in the Bill, a very radical change in the relationship between the hospital governing board and the Department would be brought about thereby.  Listening to Deputy Cosgrave, one would think that this matter of Ministerial sanction to appointments made by the board, of officers or staff of the board, was an entirely new departure&mdash;that it has been introduced in this Bill for the first time.  Deputy Cosgrave knows well that that is not the position, that these appointments have been subject to sanction since this institution was set up first.  In fact, the powers that are vested in the Minister under the Act of 1856 are substantially more extensive powers of control than those sought in the present Bill.  Section 4 of the Act of 1856 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Lord Lieutenant shall, subject to the Approval of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury and to the Provisions herein-after contained, regulate and determine the Number and Description of Officers and Servants to be kept for the said House of Industry Hospitals as he may think fit, and the Salaries to be paid to them respectively, and the Lord Lieutenant may from Time to Time appoint or remove such Officers or Servants, and upon every Vacancy by Death, Removal, or otherwise in any such Office may appoint some other Person to such Office, and may fill up or not, as in his Discretion he may think fit, Vacancies among such Officers and Servants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That very extensive power, which has now devolved on the Minister, is not being repeated in the present Bill.  The section which Deputy Cosgrave now proposes to amend provides that, after the passing of this Bill, the Minister <Col N="2285" /> can, by Order, exclude such offices as may be agreed upon or as he may determine, from the category of officers or servants that would require Ministerial sanction.</P>
    <P>That will be done in consultation with the board and it is not intended to interfere with the discretion of the board in matters of appointment in the ordinary course of events.  Not only during the past ten years but even in the period of Deputy Cosgrave's Government, the same system obtained.  In April, 1930, the board appointed Mr. Richard Slattery as honorary surgeon. That was submitted to the Governor-General for his approval.  The Governor-General sanctioned Mr. Slattery's appointment on the 22nd April, 1930.  In October, 1930, Doctor Leonard Abrahamson and Doctor James O'Connor were appointed to the medical staff.  On the 28th October, 1930, the Governor-General sanctioned the appointments. In November, 1930, the board recommended the appointment of Mr. Michael Bourke as honorary surgeon, and on the 25th November the Governor-General sanctioned the appointment.  The salaries of a pathologist and bacteriologist were increased in 1934, and sanction of the salary of the pathologist was given on the 2nd March, 1935.</P>
    <P>In the light of those facts, it is scarcely fair to say that some radical departure in the status of the hospital is being aimed at in this Bill.  In fact, it is not.  As I have said, the Minister is foregoing substantial powers which he holds at the present time and which he could continue to hold if this Bill were not brought before the House. He is doing that in the belief that, through the medium of this Bill, better machinery of government of the institution will be set up and harmonious relations maintained.  It is sometimes of considerable advantage to a board of governors of such an institution&mdash;I understand from some of the members of this board that they look upon it as being of some advantage to them&mdash;to have this question of Ministerial sanction to fall back upon. Members of a board of governors are sometimes considerably embarrassed in <Col N="2286" /> the making of appointments.  A good deal of pressure is brought to bear upon them from time to time in favour of a candidate who might not be the most suitable candidate.  There might be difficulties for members of the board in refusing to recommend such a candidate for appointment.</P>
    <P>It is a useful way out, if I may put it that way, to be able to say: &ldquo;I am prepared to recommend you all right, but bear in mind the Minister's sanction has to be obtained.&rdquo;  That provides a certain amount of protection for members of the board.  At least, so it has been represented to me.  There may not be a great deal in that but, on ocasions, there might be.  We are not encroaching on the autonomy which the board had in the past or which it is enjoying at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The very small number of cases which the Parliamentary Secretary read out is, in itself, sufficient answer to the case he has made. It is to be remarked that he said that the Governor-General made certain appointments.  Obviously, there was no Ministerial interference and, if there were, there would be some justification for it if we are to regard a contribution towards the maintenance of the hospital as qualifying for such interference. Not a penny is being given by the State now, nor has any contribution been made for some years.  At one time, this was looked upon as a hospital which depended exclusively for its maintenance upon the Government of the day.  In the year 1920, the Government of the day would not accept that liability.  The board resigned and a new board was appointed on the recommendation of the medical members.  If the operations of the Governor-General were automatic, what is the use of mentioning them?  Is it not a joke to put forward that as a reason why the Minister should inherit these powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that they were automatic.  I do not know whether they were or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly obvious that they were.  As I have said, the Department of Local Government have <Col N="2287" /> no experience whatever of a hospital of this kind.  The last argument the Minister put before us appears to me to be the worst of all.  Imagine a board of governors hoping that Ministerial sanction will be maintained because the name of a candidate may be submitted by them to the Minister which they, in their better judgment, would not recommend.  I do not believe that.  Assuming it is so, it is time to put an end to it.  The board ought to bear its own responsibility.  Parliament has its responsibility.  There is no vetoing by anybody of the work done here.  Once it leaves us, any imperfections in it are our responsibility. Where a veto exists, it may be availed of occasionally and, in consequence, the better judgment of the body responsible for giving decisions may not be always enshrined in its legislation. Is the board to be invited to resort to what was called at one time here the &ldquo;backstairs of the Castle&rdquo;? Are there to be backstairs to the Local Government Department?  A communication comes in from a board comprised of a number of the medical men in the hospital and a number of the Minister's nominees.  That communication will come in by the front door, but another person may come up the backstairs and say: &ldquo;Do not make that appointment; the board is not in favour of it.&rdquo;  That would be a deplorable degradation of responsibility.  A hospital could not be regarded as well run in which the board may make any appointment it likes and look to the Minister to set matters right.  I have the gravest doubt that a single member of the medical board would make such a suggestion.  If an appointment of a physician or surgeon is to be made, is there not a major responsibility upon the persons best qualified to judge to realise how much the life and death of certain people are involved in the appointment?  Is it conceivable that a medical board would solemnly vote in favour of a candidate and, having done so, send somebody up the backstairs&mdash; if there is such a staircase&mdash;of the Custom House to inform the Minister that the appointment is not to be made, that the better judgment of the medical members of the board is <Col N="2288" /> against it?  That would not be in the interest of the hospital or of the patients who will go to the hospital.</P>
      <P>If that be the intention, there is sufficient reason in that to oppose this Ministerial sanction.  Ministerial sanction may have on occasion some right to consideration. If the Minister were putting up public funds for this hospital he would be probably justified, assuming he was inheriting the same right, in maintaining it.  I was not aware that this board operated under Ministerial direction or approval.  It may have been discovered lately.  I did not hear of it until now.  Under the Governor-General, yes, but that was merely an automatic business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Lord Lieutenant before him.  As I said, on a certain occasion when there was no board, the medical members, quite irregularly, acquainted the Lord Lieutenant that there was no board and recommended a board on which the medical members were appointed and certain other nominees, and they kept the doors of the hospital open when they would have been closed but for their action.  I want to know what advantage there is in having this Ministerial sanction or approval.  It is a limitation on the autonomy of the board.  It is their responsibility to run the hospital.  They will have to be responsible for any operations performed there, and not the Minister. Let us conceive a situation in which Surgeon A. is recommended by the board.  The Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, having been advised by the backstairs method that it was not in the best interests of the hospital.  That might be done by somebody who at the time was in a minority on the board, and Surgeon B. is appointed.  He may be the second-best.  But the people of Dublin are entitled to the best.  With whom is the last word in wisdom in connection with an appointment of that sort&mdash;the Minister, even if he be a professional man, or the members of the board?  I say that if there is any character whatever left in the medical <Col N="2289" /> profession it would be amongst the medical members of the board.  They have the major responsibility; they carry out the day-to-day work.  The Minister comes in and goes out as occasion arises; the medical board continues.</P>
      <P>I say it is not in the interests of the hospital that there should be any limitation on the autonomy of the board. It could only be envisaged in case the Minister is doubtful regarding the nominations that he makes to it.  He must have some misgivings about his own nominations or about the nominations of his successors.  If, arising out of that, it is conceivable that you might have an incompetent board, there may be a case for this.  But there would be a better case, in my view, for doing away with the board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave seems to be determined to continue this debate on the basis of the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke institution being, in fact, a voluntary hospital. He appears to close his eyes to the fact that it is incontrovertible that this is a State hospital, that it is not a private hospital.  It is a State hospital over which the State has always had complete control.  It is a State hospital over which Deputy Cosgrave's Government had complete control and over which the present Government have had complete control for the past ten years.  Now Deputy Cosgrave implies, or practically says directly, that because the State has ceased to give an annual grant towards the maintenance of this institution, the State has no further right to interfere in the affairs of this institution; that it ceases to be a State hospital just because of the fact that moneys provided by the Oireachtas are no longer disbursed to that institution.  But, in fact, as Deputy Cosgrave and every Deputy in this House know, much larger sums of money, which are under the control of the Minister for Local Government, than ever were given by way of State grant are now disbursed annually to this institution.  I think that the annual deficit paid out of the Hospitals Trust funds under the control of the Minister for Local Government in the case of this particular institution is the <Col N="2290" /> largest disbursed to any hospital in Ireland.  I do not say that there is not good value given for it; I am not making that suggestion at all.  But I do say that when the Minister approves of the payment of a deficit amounting to £21,000 in the year, in view of the precarious position of the Hospital Trust funds, the Minister ought not to relax any control he has over that institution.</P>
      <P>The case has never been made&mdash;in fact it is quite the contrary&mdash;that this hospital is a State hospital by virtue of the fact that it has received a State grant.  Away back in 1919 this matter was raised in the House of Lords on the question of the grant.  Lord Crawford, speaking on behalf of the British Government of that time, took the view that the institution was not, in fact, a State hospital, that it was in much the same position as the other voluntary hospitals or public charitable hospitals here in Ireland.  But that view was not accepted by the board of governors or by the secretary of the board of that time.  In answer to Lord Crawford, the secretary of the board of governors, Mr. W. Webster Smith, published a letter in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 15/8/1919 in the course of which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By the Act of 1856 the government of the hospitals was retained in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant, who alone could nominate the governors.  The Treasury pension regulations were applied to all permanent salaried offices in the hospitals and every foot of ground and every stone in the hospitals was was vested in the Board of Works. These conditions would appear to render the hospitals a State institution, and certainly militate against their recognition by the public as on the same plane as the ordinary charitable hospitals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secretary of the board in 1919 claimed that, by reason of the considerations set out, this hospital was a State institution.  If it was a State institution because of these considerations in 1919, it is certainly a State institution to-day when, in addition, the Minister for Local Government causes to be disbursed out of the Hospitals <Col N="2291" /> Trust funds a sum of £20,000 or £21,000 per annum by way of payment of its annual deficits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to read on and see what happened after that.  The hospital put up that case to the Government, and the Government said: &ldquo;No.  We accept no responsibility. This is not a State hospital.&rdquo; The Government said that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, but not only that; they said that they would have to take in patients and contribute towards the maintenance of this hospital, and the board would not do it. In essence, therefore, the hospital was closed, and would have remained closed but for the efforts of the medical staff, who came together, kept it going, and accepted whatever contributions were given to them.  I do not accept for the moment the case that has been put up that because the hospital has received certain moneys from the Hospitals Trust Fund that gives the Minister power to go in there. That is a new leg, and the Minister must choose between the old leg and the new leg.  This is a new case, if the Minister says that because of the moneys of the Hospitals Trust Fund he has the power to enter and take control here.  If he bases his case on <Col N="2292" /> that, will he take the same control in the case of all the other hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary wants to have it every way. He wants, first of all, to make the case of the hospitals, which was repudiated at the period when the board went out of existence and would not be anything else except a voluntary hospital, and then he takes the other line that it is a State hospital and that the State has control.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot be both the Lord Lieutenant and the secretary to the board of governors of the hospital at the same time.  He must be one or the other.  If, alternatively, he is taking up the line that it is because the money is coming from the Hospitals Trust Fund, that is another leg&mdash;an entirely different case&mdash;because these funds cost the State no money and, in fact, the State gets money out of them.</P>
      <P>These governors of boards of hospitals are autonomous bodies, and ought to be autonomous.  They are the best representatives of the various people concerned, and the interests of the students, doctors and so on, are best served by having them autonomous bodies.  I put it to the House that that is the responsibility of the House with regard to this matter.  For the past 100 years we have had good teaching hospitals here, free from State control or from State interference, and the mere automatic approval of the Lord-Lieutenant in a matter of this sort is beside the question.  The system has been a great success, so why interfere with it?</P>

The first says that, subject to the provisions of this section, the board shall not, without the consent of the Minister, exercise, in relation to any office or employment under the board, the powers conferred on the board by sub-section (1) of Section 16, and so on.  In other words, the Minister's consent must be given to those things.  I am taking out that.

It is their job.  They have done it well up to this, and we ought at least to have confidence in their continuing to do it well in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17, standing in the name of Deputy McGilligan:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, lines 42 and 43, to delete the words &ldquo;in relation to any person for the time being holding any office or employment under the board,&rdquo; in line 44, to delete the words &ldquo;any of,&rdquo; and to delete all words after the word &ldquo;namely&rdquo; in line 45 to the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 47.</P>
      <P>This is a proposal to give those officials who are already in the employment of the hospital immunity from the sanction which, according to this clause, the Minister proposes to exercise in relation to the officers and servants of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever may be done in regard to appointments to be made in the future, at least as regards those who are there &mdash;some of them may be there since the period when the Lord Lieutenant had the making of the appointments&mdash;they ought to be considered in the usual way in which officials are regarded in Acts of Parliament when changes are proposed.  There is no particular reason why they should be included now and brought under the direct control of a Government Department. <Col N="2297" /> So far they have not been under that control.  As I said before, there is no information whatever in that Department. It cannot get it nor is it likely to get it.  I am quite certain that no surgeon in a teaching hospital will ever be a Minister for Local Government or a Parliamentary Secretary, and, in consequence, so far as that part of the administration is concerned, there is not that information there.  The same applies to the Department's officials. They are accustomed to dealing with boards of health.  Some of them may have been engaged in administering the various Medical Charities Acts under the poor law system, but they have had no experience of a teaching hospital.  It was outside their scope.  The Lord Lieutenant, in exercising this control, simply put his name to a document when it was submitted to him and there was no more about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is evidently to extend the powers of the board in regard to the fixing of salaries.  Under paragraph (b) of the section as it stands, the board cannot exercise these powers without the consent of the Minister.  I do not see much use in going over the same ground in relation to this particular amendment that we went over on the last one. Deputy Cosgrave has not any faith or confidence in the Minister or in the Parliamentary Secretary or in the Department.  That is regrettable, but I am afraid that he is not altogether unbiassed.  I think that the powers that are being sought under Section 15, in paragraph (b) of it just as much as in paragraph (a), can be well and properly exercised by the ministerial heads and their advisers, and that there is not any danger of hardship or injustice being inflicted on anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary try to get off the tangent that I am biassed?  I have had some experience of local government, much more than the Parliamentary Secretary.  He was a paid official of a local authority.  I was a member of a local authority for a great number of years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, without <Col N="2298" /> offence, what experience the Parliamentary Secretary has of a teaching hospital?  I have none.  My only experience of one was as a member of a local authority in this city which contributed in or about £6,000 a year to various hospitals.  Part of the duty of the members of a certain committee of which I was one was to inspect those hospitals.  There was something in the nature of an annual inspection.  In one year the inspection might be made in the month of May, and in the following year in the month of September.  These inspections did not afford us information of any kind regarding the administration of the hospitals.  May I put this question: Is it likely that you would have anybody in the Department of Local Government with experience of a teaching hospital?  No.  The officials there, the best and the worst of them, are civil servants.  As regards the professional men in the Department, not one of them has ever been a surgeon in a hospital.  They were simply there for a period of six months when doing their course.  I suppose we may take it that not one of them has ever been a physician in one of these hospitals. If he had been, he probably would have remained there.  Now we are to have this new arrangement under which the Minister is taking more power than the Lord Lieutenant had, and gives nothing.  At least, the Lord Lieutenant gave something, or it was given in his name.  Then there is the Hospitals' Commission to please, a commission on which there are two doctors.  One of them may have had hospital experience, but certainly not the two.  In addition, there is the Minister who may be a layman or a medical man.  If the latter, then except for the experience he gained when going through his course he will have no knowledge of a teaching hospital. It is proposed that this board should take over control and have a say in regard to every appointment that has been made by the old board, or any alteration made in status, salary or term of office.  The proposal is ridiculous.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section it is proposed to build a hospital elsewhere than on the present site.  So far as I can see through this measure, there is no provision for any loss that would be sustained by certain persons who are either paid by the State or by the local authority and whose income would be affected by reason of the alteration in the situation of the hospital. On the occasion of the changeover of the North Dublin Union Hospital, as it then was, somewhere about 1916 or 1917, and its amalgamation with the South Dublin Union Hospital, my information is that there was provision made to compensate such officers of the local authority who suffered loss in their incomes by reason of the alteration.  I have not discovered any such provision as that in this measure. Whether it is to be made elsewhere, I do not know.  That it does not come exactly within the scope of this measure appears likely, but surely, if there is damage occasioned to anybody, the person performing the operation has a certain responsibility for it, and in this case the Parliamentary Secretary is doing it.  Is he going to leave those unfortunate people, who will be getting reduced incomes by reason of this change, without adequate compensation?  Is he going to do anything for them?</P>
      <P>We were told a short time ago, when we were pensioning off the Currency Commission, which is to be called in the future the Central Bank, that it is customary, when we are determining the life of any public or corporate body, to pension off the existing members. Here is a case on all fours with that, but there does not appear to be anything like that proposed.  My information is that these people are professional colleagues of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Of course, the matter may have escaped his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has certainly raised an entirely novel consideration. I did not anticipate, and I do not anticipate now, that the staffs of the existing institution will suffer <Col N="2303" /> financially by the bringing into being of a modern hospital to replace it. Deputy Cosgrave presupposes that if the hospital is changed from the present site the staffs will suffer financially. Of course, the staffs will be taken over and a pension scheme will be submitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary does not want to waste time.  I have not anybody in the hospital in mind.  I am concerned with the registrar of births, deaths and marriages and other officers of that sort who will not perform their customary functions in this new neighbourhood. They were compensated before when the North Dublin Union was removed. Is there any provision for compensation for them here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into that point.  I do not think it will be necessary to cover it in the Bill, and I do not think that this would be the appropriate place, anyway.  However, I shall look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that matter will arise, if it arises at all, for quite a number of years.  It is not proposed to close down the existing institution immediately the new hospital is provided.  It is anticipated that, with the present bed shortage in the City of Dublin, it will be necessary to retain the existing hospitals for probably a very considerable time after the new hospital has been provided, so that during that period until the existing hospitals are in fact closed, such damage as Deputy Cosgrave has in mind cannot very well occur.</P>

      <P>We are going to change the name, and, as soon as this Bill passes into law, assuming the Minister's amendments are inserted, the title will be St. Laurence's Hospital.  Ontside the City of Dublin and the Archdiocese of Dublin, if that is the proper description, St. Laurence O'Toole is known by that name, even in the case of a church on the quays of which he is the patron.  There is a St. Lawrence in the <i>Ordo</i> whose feast-day is 10th August and to whom the Escorial in Spain has been dedicated. He has an Octave.  St. Laurence O'Toole has an Octave also, but only in the diocese.  St. Lawrence of the Gridiron has an Octave and is regarded as one of the principal saints.  Once we take &ldquo;O'Toole&rdquo; out of this measure, nobody may know what St. Laurence is referred to.  I think you can get over the whole thing by putting the name &ldquo;O'Toole&rdquo; in somewhere&mdash; either here or in the Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest also that the name should be &ldquo;St. Laurence O'Toole's Richmond Hospital&rdquo;.  The name &ldquo;Richmond&rdquo; is known and has been known for a great many years.  As I said before, it is associated with the name of perhaps the most prominent, the most gifted Dublin surgeon, Dominick Corrigan, who has bequeathed, one might say, his great button to posterity. If these amendments are inserted, this will be &ldquo;St. Laurence's Hospital&rdquo;, and outside of Dublin, the name &ldquo;St. Laurence&rdquo; may connote the other saint.  I think it is St. Paul who says that there ought not to be competition between the saints, and that people ought not to compare <Col N="2305" /> them.  I am not doing that; I am simply pointing to a distinction.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not as much interested in this as we are. I happen to be a member of this diocese, while he is just an intruder, and consequently cannot be expected to have that veneration for, and one might almost say, that adoration of the Saint as we here have.  His name is not to be mentioned.  He came from a great old Irish family, a family as old as the hills, and I want the name O'Toole to be mentioned somewhere in the measure.  I should like also to preserve, for the sake of the reputation of the hospital, of those who are engaged in it, of the work it did and of the many very eminent persons who have passed through its halls, the name of &ldquo;Richmond&rdquo;.  It can all be done without offending anybody, and, at the same time, give an intelligent connotation to the name of the hospital.</P>

      <P>To deal first with the suggestion that the name of &ldquo;Richmond&rdquo; should be given statutory recognition, I am not prepared to accept that.  The name &ldquo;Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke hospitals&rdquo; has no statutory recognition at present. The existing institution is known in law as &ldquo;The House of Industry Hospitals&rdquo;.  They came to be known as, and to call themselves, the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke hospitals, and if they continue to call themselves by that title, there is nothing to prevent their doing so, but it is not proposed to give official recognition to a perpetuation of the memory of Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke, or to Richmond, leaving out Whitworth and Hardwicke, in the Bill.  I think it would make a very unhappy combination to attach Richmond to St. Laurence O'Toole, but we shall leave that there.</P>

      <P>I should not like to leave St. Laurence O'Toole looking after the other man.  I quite appreciate Deputy <Col N="2306" /> Cosgrave's adoration for St. Laurence O'Toole, and he, perhaps, has a better right to speak with fervour on that matter than I have, but, at the same time, I have some feelings on the matter, too.  In the Bill as originally introduced, the name of the hospital was to be &ldquo;St. Laurence O'Toole's Hospital&rdquo;.  Objection was taken to that in the course of the debate by, I think, Deputy McGilligan, and attention was drawn to the fact that the name would be so abbreviated that it would become anything but a reverent reference.  That representation seemed to me, on examination, to have a good share of sound sense behind it, and it was for that reason&mdash;in order to avoid the possibility of its irreverent use in abbreviated form&mdash;that we changed the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we have three Saint Laurences in the <i>Ordo.</i>  Our St. Laurence O'Toole is described in the <i>Ordo</i> as St. Laurence, and there is not a word of reference to the surname throughout.  St. Lawrence of the Gridiron is down in the <i>Ordo</i> as St. Lawrence with (m) after his name, indicating &ldquo;martyr&rdquo;.  There is also St. Lawrence Justinian, and it seems to me that if we admit the necessity of attaching the surname in Ireland, we admit that the predominant St. Laurence was not St. Laurence O'Toole.  To us, there is only one St. Laurence&mdash;St. Laurence O'Toole&mdash;but to people outside this country, St. Lawrence of the Gridiron might perhaps be more important.  I think that so far from its being any slight, we are paying a tribute to St. Laurence O'Toole by referring to him as St. Laurence in the Title of the Bill, inasmuch as we thereby imply that it is not necessary to attach his surname in order that he may be recognised.  It is not a matter about which there can be any feeling.  I do not see how you could reconcile calling it St. Laurence's Hospital in one section, and calling it St. Laurence O'Toole's in another section.  St. Vincent's Hospital is known all over Ireland, as is also St. Bricin's.  I understand that the name of the amalgamated hospital should be St. Luke's.  Whatever <Col N="2307" /> name you call the hospital it is going to be abbreviated.  If we call it St. Laurence O'Toole's it may not be abbreviated to St. Laurence's.</P>

      <P>In a particular parish here a church is dedicated to the patron saint of this diocese.  The Archbishop is in the direct line of descent from St. Laurence O'Toole.  Look at one of the stained-glass windows in the ProCathedral. Is St. Laurence the name there?  Not at all.  It is St. Laurence O'Toole.  No one would think of leaving out the name &ldquo;O'Toole&rdquo;.  As far as my memory goes, the late Deputy Thomas Kelly, who was an Alderman in the city and a member of the Government Party&mdash;I am sure he was not comfortable in it&mdash;he was in it but not of it&mdash;expressed indignation on the last occasion this Bill was before the House, when the name &ldquo;O'Toole&rdquo; was taken out.  The name has been a characteristic one for Irish people for a number of centuries.  St. Bricin had not a second name.  He belonged to <Col N="2308" /> another diocese.  In this instance we cannot forget St. Laurence having the name &ldquo;O'Toole&rdquo;.  I ask for a division on this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment consequential on the proposal to close the hospital from time to time as the Minister after consultation with the board may determine.  In the original draft, it was intended to close the existing hospitals after the new hospital was completed.  On further consideration it seemed desirable, and indeed will be necessary, to continue the existing institutions until the acute bed shortage in Dublin has been satisfied. Consequently the closing date, which was the pivotal date in the original draft, must now be replaced by the transfer date.  There is no other principle involved except to provide the necessary pivotal machinery in the absence of a closing date.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate&mdash;Turf Supplies In Dublin.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past few weeks I have made an effort to draw attention to the hardships which bellmen are undergoing in this city and the difficulties they have in getting reasonable supplies to enable them to live, keep their families and pay for stabling and so on.  I drew attention to the fact that, one day last week, I personally counted 247 carts&mdash;donkey carts, single-horse drays and pony carts &mdash;waiting for six to eight hours before they could get fuel.  In one case a man informed me that he left Dundrum at 4 o'clock in the morning and did not get back until 6 o'clock in the evening. Yesterday morning, I met a woman who was driving a donkey and cart, with a small load of turf on it.  She told me that, having remained up all night, she was at the dump at 4.30 in the morning, that she thought she was very smart, but that there were ten others before her.  I want to impress on the House and on the Minister that nothing can be said against these people regarding their desire to work. In the cold, the rain and the storm, with wet sacks on their shoulders and rolled round their heads, they were waiting there for supplies.  On a little over half a ton the profit was 8/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They complained to me that there were 74 fillers at Alexandra Basin dealing with that number of carts, about a similar number having been supplied earlier in the day.  In the old days, they said, when the bag of coal was sold for 1/-, 1/6 or 2/-, they were supplied at Donnelly's at the Custom House and at Spencer Dock, also Donnelly's. They were supplied there with coal, and at those coal dumps there were 500 fillers engaged in filling coal for people who bought in bags and smaller lots.  The difficulties having become greater, instead of improving on that number of 500 fillers, Fuel Importers.  Limited, who got the <Col N="2313" /> monopoly from the Government, employed only 74 fillers at Alexandra Basin.  Apparently, they were caring neither about the value of the time of those driving the carts, nor about the hardships which those people were undergoing.  There was no restaurant to give them a cup of tea.  There was one small restaurant&mdash;about twice the size of the reporters' table&mdash;a little alcove at Alexandra Basin, in which a caterer was endeavouring to give them a cup of tea at 2d.  per cup, but supplies were exhausted after the first hour.</P>
    <P>I want the House to realise, first of all, that these people are genuine workers, earnestly desiring to get work, to earn their own living.  Had they stayed at home and not worked, they would draw more in unemployment benefit and from certain relief measures; but they assured me that they did not want to do that.  They had their customers, who were kind to them in the past, and they had their ration cards entitling them to get turf. Some of those customers, because of the delays in getting turf from the small purchasers, withdrew their cards and told these small carriers and bellmen they could not wait any longer, and that they were getting their supplies direct from Fuel Importers, Limited.  Thus it will be seen that there is a double complaint.  As well as the hardships of the weather and the delay which they are undergoing, they run the risk of losing their customers, and in many cases they have lost them.  I want to bring home to the House that we are not giving encouragement to those who want to work and who are willing to bear these hardships if they get fair treatment.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister that there were depots all over the city where turf could be dumped&mdash;say 1,000 or 500 tons.  I will first draw attention to my question and the Minister's reply to-day.  He says that the turf is stored within as reasonable a distance of consumers' homes as fuel is in normal times.  I just mention now that, in normal times, they were supplied with fuel at Donnelly's at the Custom House, at Butt Bridge and at the yards at Spencer Dock.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> To Alexandra Basin from Butt Bridge is nearly two miles.  That means two miles down and two miles back, while the dump is almost out in the open sea; it almost touches Clontarf baths.  It is so far out that the hardships on a cold and wet day are terrific.  I want to get this point home to the Minister: what is going to happen if we have one night's severe frost or if we have, as we had last year, a week's snow?  There is no petrol wherewith to send mechanical vehicles to Alexandra Basin to carry fuel to the tenement areas in the city or to working-class homes in the city. The carts are not being encouraged to go down there even in normal times, not to speak of when the snow falls. The people who own these donkeys have to pay 8/- for shoeing and, when the snow falls or the frost commences, they will have to pay about 4/- additional for caulking to protect the donkeys in using the streets.  These people are getting no encouragement to go that distance to bring fuel into the areas I have mentioned and there will be considerable risk to their animals when the frost comes along.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister, before it is too late and before such circumstances arise, to see that those people who buy a shilling's worth of wood blocks or turf will have that fuel available at a reasonable distance from their homes.  Yesterday morning, I saw a woman, with a sack under her arm and a couple of shillings in her hand, coming in from Crumlin to Parnell Street to buy a stone or two of logs or turf. Yesterday, in Inchicore, I met two persons from a place called Kennedy's Cottages coming to the centre of the city to look for a stone of turf which they intended to carry out on their backs to Inchicore.  There should be a dump of about 500 tons of turf somewhere in Inchicore for the use of the people in that area.  The Minister has made reference to the difficulty of procuring sites for turf dumps elsewhere. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The removal of the turf dumps from Alexandra Basin to other sites elsewhere in the city would raise difficult problems in relation to the acquisition of sites.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2315" /> The City Manager has sites available in his housing schemes, and dumps could be provided at Kimmage, Crumlin, Drimnagh, Dolphin's Barn, Donnycarney, Cabra, Ellenfield, Larkhill, Oxmanstown Road, Keogh Square, and other areas.  If there were a few hundred tons of turf in all those areas, it would be within half an hour's or a quarter hour's distance from the people's homes, and, if we were to have snow or frost, the people could walk to those dumps and draw their own supplies instead of depending upon a pony and cart which could not be used on account of the frost.  Fuel supplies for cooking would in that way be safeguarded.  Last Sunday morning, in Railway Street, I saw a queue who were disappointed on Saturday night in procuring a supply of blocks. They were told that the blocks would be brought in on Sunday morning.  On Sunday morning, at 11 o'clock, I saw a queue of the poorer working-class element waiting with baskets and sacks to bring home the fuel to cook the Sunday dinner&mdash;the fuel they could not get on Saturday night.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to-day for the first time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am, however, prepared to make arrangements with parish councils within the city area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn, said when I appealed to him six months ago to allow Clontarf Parish Council to take fuel into the Clontarf area&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  So far as I know, it comes to the same thing.  They could not get a permit to bring turf into the Clontarf area although they had the money to do so.  This was one of the really &ldquo;live&rdquo; parish councils.  I hope the Minister will not defer this matter for another period, that something will <Col N="2316" /> be done immediately, because the snow and frost may come at any time and the Minister's own constituents in South Dublin may be left without fuel. I am not talking of the very poor&mdash; those who are entitled, because of their poor circumstances, to get free fuel. Unfortunately, that scheme was spoiled by not arranging to have the turf delivered to them.  Old age pensioners and widows have to take their sacks and carry stones of turf for their own use.  As Deputy Doyle knows, when 6,000 or 8,000 bags of fuel were distributed as a result of the Mansion House Coal Fund, this fuel was delivered to the people's homes.</P>

I implore the Minister to do something before the frost comes, which may be in a week or two. Mothers of large families who are dependent on the bellmen for a sack of turf will, otherwise, be left without fuel.  It is to avoid that contingency that I have raised the matter to-night. I hope the Minister will see his way to do what I ask and establish fuel depots.  I hope he will open the Phoenix Park to supply that area with turf, and I hope he will see that the people get decent turf.  I saw in the paper recently reference to &ldquo;legal robbery&rdquo;.  There are two types of robbery&mdash;legal robbery and illegal robbery.  It is legal robbery to sell turf with 40 per cent.  moisture and 10 per cent.  not fit for burning.

      <P>I want to join with Deputy Byrne in pointing out that people are suffering considerable hardship through failure to secure turf that is undoubtedly there.  I know that there are many difficulties in connection with the distribution but, as pointed out by Deputy Byrne, many people, the older people particularly, cannot get it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should endeavour by some means or other to augment the number of distribution centres in order to ease the situation.  The present system is not giving the satisfaction that was anticipated in distributing the turf that is available.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="2318" /> I think the first thing Deputies must do if they want to be taken seriously in a matter of this kind is to deal with realities.  It is a very easy matter to go round taking notes of all the inconveniences and even hardships that arise in circumstances like the present, and parade them here, while ignoring the causes of them.  At the beginning of last year it became obvious that there would be a problem, a really serious problem, in maintaining the supplies of domestic fuel for Dublin. The Government decided upon undertaking as a Government enterprise the large-scale production of turf and its transportation into Dublin.  The turf which is being used in Dublin now was produced all over Ireland, from Donegal to Kerry.  Its production there on a large scale involved a degree of organisation of which Deputies have no appreciation whatsoever.  Its transportation from these areas to Dublin was a colossal task, and far more turf was produced than could in fact be transported.  But, from the beginning of last year, turf came into Dublin not merely in quantities sufficient to meet the current demand, but in excess of the quantities required to meet the immediate current demand. All that excess turf was placed in dumps at Alexandra Basin and in the Phoenix Park last year.  For the whole of the period, from the beginning of the turf campaign in 1941, until now, in every week there was as excess importation of turf into Dublin; in other words, the supply coming in was greater than the quantity being consumed. In every week some addition was made to the reserve stocks in the dumps.  But the time was bound to come when the inflow of turf would be less than the consumption, and it would become necessary to go to the dumps in order to meet current requirements. That is what the dumps were for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have spoken as if an arrangement which was possible when the inflow of turf was greater than the requirements could be continued when the position had been reversed.  What were these dumps built up for except for the express purpose of providing turf at this particular period of 1942 when the quantity of turf coming in <Col N="2319" /> would be insufficient to meet current demands?  When there was an excess of turf coming in it went into the merchants' yards.  Many of these yards have railway sidings and there was no difficulty about delivering direct to the merchants' yards the turf required to meet current demands.  Bellmen were able to go to the merchants' yards as they had always done and draw supplies of turf from these yards for delivery to their customers.  But now it is not possible to meet the demands from the quantities being delivered into the merchants' yards. Therefore it is necessary to open up the dumps, and these dumps are where they were put.  We cannot just now take them bodily and shift them to O'Connell Bridge, Spencer Dock, or any other place which might be more convenient.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we should bodily transport these huge dumps of turf which exist at Alexandra Basin and Phoenix Park and put them elsewhere is preposterous.  Not merely would the organisation and transport necessary for that purpose not be available, but the cost of doing it would be colossal. It would add at least £1 per ton to the price of the turf when delivered to consumers.  That is the position I want Deputies to appreciate: that now for the first time we have to go to our reserve stock, these dumps of turf which were created in the period when we could bring in more turf than we were consuming, and use that reserve stock to meet current requirements. That reserve stock has to be taken from where it is.  It is not possible now to create other dumps in Inchicore or any other parts of the city, because the supply of turf is not sufficient to meet current requirements, much less to give a surplus for dumps.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to adopt the suggestion bodily to transport the existing dumps from the Phoenix Park and Alexandra Basin to other localities, will Deputies try to conceive the problems involved?  It is not merely that the difficulty of providing suitable space for the storage of the dumps would arise, but they would have to be safeguarded.  You cannot just put a <Col N="2320" /> dump of turf in the middle of Keogh Barracks, as was suggested here, and expect to find it there in a week's time when you go to distribute it.  The dumps naturally had to be created in places where they could be easily protected, in places suitable from the point of view of dimensions and availability to the rail heads and so forth, as well as the existence there of the equipment which would have to be utilised when the disposal of that turf became necessary.  The Phoenix Park dump will be opened up when the necessary equipment is provided.  It is not there now.  There is no means of weighing the turf to be sold from the dump to bellmen, and until that equipment is provided it is not possible to open up the Phoenix Park dump.  That is being done.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the arrangements which have been adopted heretofore for the removal of turf from the Alexandra Basin dump were not sufficient. It is only during the past few weeks that the removal of turf from the dumps has taken place.  Clearly the organisation necessary for that purpose will be improved as experience shows that improvement is necessary. To-day I received a request from the bellmen's union to have an officer of my Department appointed to meet them to discuss a number of practical suggestions they have to make.  These men are realists, and have practical suggestions to make.  They are not merely talking in terms of generalities. It is obvious that additional provision will have to be made both from the point of view of the expeditious disposal of turf to bellmen and of the creature comforts of the workers engaged in the loading of carts and so forth at the dumps, certainly at the dump in Alexandra Basin.</P>
    <P>I want to express strong resentment at Deputy Byrne's reference to Fuel Importers Ltd.  He referred to it as if it were a private company given a monopoly which has been utilised for private profit.  Fuel Importers Ltd.  is an organisation set up by the Government. It is a non-profit making organisation.  Its board of directors act for nothing.  They get no <Col N="2321" /> remuneration of any kind whatsoever for their services.  They are loyal citizens of the State who have given a great deal of time to the affairs of that company without getting 1d.  in remuneration.  To talk about giving an organisation of that kind a monopoly is to misrepresent the position entirely.  That company was set up by the State and is directed by people who came, without remuneration, at the invitation of the State to handle this very difficult problem of organising the transport of turf to Dublin, its storage in Dublin, and its disposal when required to meet the needs of the citizens of Dublin.  It is not possible to adopt the suggestion to establish subsidiary dumps throughout the city out of the main dumps.  Whatever problems may arise owing to the location of the existing dumps will have to be met in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the only dump opened is the Alexandra Basin dump. I fully appreciate, and Fuel Importers Ltd., fully appreciate, that its location is not the most suitable for many parts of the city, and when the Phoenix Park dump and some of the other dumps are opened the bellmen supplying turf will be in many respects better situated, in the matter of the distances they will have to go from the source of supply to their customers, than they would be in normal times when they were drawing coal from the merchants' yards for sale in the same way.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which I made about parish councils must not be misunderstood. Deputy Byrne said that Clontarf Parish Council was refused a licence.  He was referring&mdash;and I think he knows it&mdash;to a very different matter. Some of the parish councils, just as in the case of certain commercial organisations in the city, wanted to bring in turf for themselves from the turf areas. The Parliamentary Secretary who is in charge of turf production would not give permits for that purpose because, clearly, if the most effective use was to be made of the turf workers in the production areas and of the transport equipment available for taking turf <Col N="2322" /> from these areas, there had to be complete control and co-ordination of all production activities, and if individual groups or firms were enabled to go into these areas to produce their own turf and transport it to meet their own needs, the arrangements he had made to make the best use of the production equipment and transport services would become disorganised.  The turf is now in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of tons of turf are stored here now to meet the requirements of the city, and from that turf we are prepared to give the parish councils in the city, if they wish to avail of it, a supply which they can transport and store in their own areas to meet the requirements of these areas if, due to exceptional circumstances, the ordinary distribution arrangements should temporarily break down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made a remark which indicated that that is being intimated now for the first time.  This is not the first time that it has been intimated. In fact, a number of parish councils in the more outlying districts have already made these arrangements, and if the Clontarf Parish Council, or any other parish council, is prepared to proceed along the same lines, they will be given the same facilities by my Department as the parish councils which have made these arrangements already.  In fact, I think it would be a good plan for these parish councils to make such arrangements, but they must understand that the particularly difficult task of safeguarding the stocks of turf that they buy for storage purposes will be their own responsibility.  They may be able to effect arrangements which will protect the stocks of turf, but I would not like them to undertake to do so without appreciating in full how difficult it will be.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, we are now drawing upon the reserve stocks of turf.  That means that we must go to where these stocks are.  I know that the arrangements in force at present for the supply of turf to bellmen at the Alexandra Basin are inadequate.  I also appreciate, and Fuel Importers, Ltd., appreciate, too, that some arrangement must be made there to reduce the hardships of workers who <Col N="2323" /> are employed at that exposed spot. Fuel Importers, Ltd., have been discussing with my Department the possibility of making some canteen arrangements which will meet that situation. They have been doing that since it became obvious that circumstances were as they are now shown to be, and of their own initiative.  It is not possible to remove that turf in large quantities, from the existing dumps to subsidiary dumps, both because of the cost of doing so and because of the <Col N="2324" /> unavailability of sites for such subsidiary dumps.  In case circumstances might arise where the ordinary methods of distribution might break down temporarily, I invite the cooperation of the parish councils with a view to taking action along the lines already adopted by the parish councils at Blackrock, Foxrock, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and other such centres.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. Wednesday, 25th November.</P>
