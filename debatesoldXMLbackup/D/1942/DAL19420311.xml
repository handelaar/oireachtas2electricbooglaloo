      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether the Northern authorities have expressed their desire to meet the cost of the services rendered in Belfast by the fire brigades of the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities following on air raids in that city last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.  It has been intimated in reply that it was not at any time contemplated that payment should be sought for the services in question, that it is not intended to present any claim, and that the responsible authorities here were glad to be able to render every assistance in their power on the occasion.  I may add that in asking for information as to the expenditure involved the Northern authorities have made it clear that they regard the services rendered by our fire brigades in Belfast as not measurable on a cash basis, and have expressed the hope of being able to repay the services in kind should the need unfortunately ever arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in so far as the investigation might lead to the production of coal.  In our present circumstances the Deputy must appreciate that the difficulties in maintaining coal production are due to scarcity of skilled coal workers and mining equipment. In so far as they can be made available, they can be best utilised where coal is already being worked rather than in the development of new areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will encourage the growing of potatoes for human consumption during the emergency as a precaution against famine; whether in view of the difficulty, owing to uncertainty of seasons and shortage of manures, of ascertaining exactly what amount will be required as human food next season, he will encourage the <Col N="2361" /> maximum production of potatoes; whether he is aware that the most effective means of securing this maximum production is to make it possible for farmers to recover the cost of production by feeding any surplus potatoes to pigs; and, if so, if he will take steps to have pig prices restored to what they were before the last cut in prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a widespread propaganda has been conducted for an increase in potato production for human consumption.  The use of potatoes for this purpose must have priority over their utilisation for pig feeding.  I am satisfied that the existing pig prices will permit of a sufficiently remunerative return to growers for the use of surplus waste potatoes for pig feeding and I am not prepared, therefore, to adopt the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

No superphosphate or compound fertilisers other than the emergency compound fertiliser will be obtainable from the manufacturers.</P>
      <P>With the object of providing for the equitable distribution among farmers of the very limited supplies of emergency compound fertiliser, an order entitled the Emergency Powers (Distribution of Artificial Fertilisers) Order, 1942, was made on the 26th February, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this order a retail distributor is authorised to supply in the 1942 season to an established customer, i.e., to a person to whom he supplied superphosphate <Col N="2362" /> or compound fertiliser during the 1940-41 season, a quantity of emergency compound fertiliser not exceeding 25 per cent. by weight of the superphosphate and compound fertilisers which he supplied to such customer during the 1940-41 season, subject to a minimum quantity of 56 lb.</P>
    <P>A retail distributor may not supply during the 1942 season to any new customer any emergency compound fertiliser in excess of 56 lb., unless he has obtained permission to do so. Application for such permission is required to be made to the Department of Agriculture on a prescribed form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statutory provisions which place upon any person dealing in salmon the onus of proving that such salmon was not illegally captured.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in a recent case in Limerick, a fishmonger was prosecuted for having fish which were taken illegally?  Those fish were purchased from a licensed salmon dealer, and while the fishmonger was prosecuted the salmon dealer who bought the fish was not prosecuted.  Fishmongers buy their fish from salmon dealers all over the country, and it would be impossible to prove who caught the fish.  In the particular case I have mentioned, the fishmonger was prosecuted and the licensed dealer who bought the fish and who sold him the fish was not prosecuted. It would be impossible in that case for the fishmonger to prove his innocence in the transaction.</P>

Considerable numbers of inspectors have been transferred to the compulsory tillage section of the Department of Agriculture and to the turf production scheme, so I cannot promise that matters will get the same attention as they would normally get. At the same time, I am very anxious to attend to matters of this kind, and I will look into it specially.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vote on Account, 1942-43 (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When I listened to the Minister for Finance introducing this Vote on Account for £13,445,000 I was amazed at the paucity of his remarks in dealing with a sum of this magnitude. One would expect a painstaking effort on the part of the responsible Minister to justify in present circumstances this enormous expenditure&mdash;a continuation of a spiral started ten years ago; a sum which indicates further burdens of taxation on people already overburdened, and further additions to the national debt.  The Minister evidently feels that his time is so precious that he can devote only six or seven minutes to discharging his responsibility to Parliament in defending a policy which involves an ever-increasing expenditure.  He was certainly speaking euphemistically when he described it as a respectable sum. It is a sum which involves intolerable burdens, the continuation of which must inevitably cause dire consequences to our economic prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Local Government trying to defend this expenditure.  One is tempted to ask him whether the circular letter that emanated from his Department, and which the local authorities received recently, was a cynical joke.  He has the cheek and audacity to lecture local <Col N="2367" /> authorities on the necessity for economies without first putting his own house in order, and then he comes here and tries to defend a policy of squandermania, extravagance and incompetence. The policy of the Government&mdash;which, of course, is fundamentally wrong&mdash;of giving direct financial assistance to non-productive elements, is each year throwing greater burdens on productive organisations, and is hampering or destroying the possibility of their normal expansion and reducing or retarding their capacity as potential sources of profitable employment.</P>
    <P>While it is undoubtedly a humanitarian policy to make provision for financial schemes to help the poor by direct State assistance&mdash;and this can be justified to a greater extent during the emergency&mdash;it is, from the economic standpoint, not the best method of attacking the problem of unemployment. The promotion of profitable production, even with the aid of State assistance, is undoubtedly the only permanent solution.  We all agree that the cost of administration must be substantially higher during an emergency, but the preparation made by the Government for an emergency of this magnitude is represented by the imposition on the people of the maximum amount of taxation possible from all sources, with the result that, during this emergency, when expenditure must be higher, there is no new source of taxation to tap.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the incidence of taxation on our people, there is the question of value&mdash;the value of the services obtained by the nation for the contributions made by the taxpayer. Are the costs of State services reasonable in our circumstances, or are the Departments of State acting in an extravagant fashion?  Is there overlapping of services or have we redundant Ministries?  Are we getting public services sufficient to justify the burdens placed on our relatively poor people?  Are we aiming at something far beyond our financial capacity, and is our administration moulded on a level higher than we can afford?</P>
    <P>The trend of taxation in recent <Col N="2368" /> years, the number of unbalanced budgets, the soaring national debt involving higher and higher annual charges are questions which deeply concern the Minister entrusted with the custody of the public purse.  After making provision for the defence of the country against the possibility of invasion, our chief concern is the securing of essential supplies and the making of ample provision for the production from our soil, to maximum capacity during the coming season, of essential food for man and beast.  The enormous losses in shipping tonnage, the ever-growing perils of the high seas, our position in the war zone and our isolation in trade, make it of paramount importance to the Government to ensure that our productive capacity is exercised to the utmost.</P>
    <P>Has this been done?  Can we afford to take any risks about our food position? Is our agricultural productive capacity so organised that there is no doubt about the results we are going to get during this vital season?  Is the House satisfied that this vital matter concerning the lives of the people has been, and is being, handled in an efficient manner?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach a short time ago went to Clare and said that they could not be blamed, because they had warned the people.  Does the Taoiseach think that he, as Head of the Government, can evade his responsibilities and ignore the necessity of ensuring that every possible precaution is taken and that a properly organised effort will be made by the responsible Department to see that our maximum production is going to be effective for the coming year?  Does he think his duty ends by merely warning the people that we are up against a tough proposition and that the matter of food production rests solely with the people?</P>
    <P>One matter that ought to be examined is, why was the acreage required to be cultivated last year and the previous year below our expectation? Why was it we did so much worse in our efforts to organise production than Northern Ireland or Great Britain?  Why did we fall so much behind our expectations in that <Col N="2369" /> respect?  Was it due to any fault of our people, to the lack of capacity of our farmers to do the job?  Was it because there was not a will to do the job, or was it due to lack of organised effort to see that the job was thoroughly done?</P>
    <P>I think, during this grave crisis, when we remember the danger to which this country is exposed from the point of view of a shortage of essential food, we have not a proper organisation or a proper machine to deal with the production of essential food.  What type of organisation have we to ensure that we get 25 per cent. of tillage under the compulsory order?  We have no organisation, beyond a few civil servants who are sent out through the country under this compulsory order to inspect lands and inform the farmers that they must do a certain percentage of tillage. Many of them are men who have little or no association with agriculture; they are men taken from other Departments, men who have little or no sympathy with the agricultural outlook, men who are merely instruments sent around to inspect agricultural holdings and to use the compulsory order to its utmost.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we are in such a panicky position at the present time, that we have fines and prosecutions and compulsory entry on lands?  Has the responsible Minister pictured to himself at any time the difficulty, the almost insuperable problem, that farmers in non-tillage areas have to face as a result of lack of proper equipment to deal with an operation that involves 25 per cent. of tillage on big holdings?  Is it sufficient to make a compulsory order, to send Ministers down the country on a drive for food production, to make a general appeal, and for the Government to feel that their responsibility ends there and for the Head of the Government, in a few instances, to blame farmers for lack of patriotism and for another Minister to abuse farmers for hoarding wheat?  Is it reasonable to expect farmers in the non-tillage districts and in the dairying districts of this country to do this work &mdash;men who have no experience of tillage operations, and men who have <Col N="2370" /> no equipment with which to do that tillage&mdash;unless they are provided with the necessary facilities?  Speaking as a tillage farmer, I say that 25 per cent. of tillage of a substantial agricultural holding in this country involves a considerable amount of work and outlay and necessitates a fairly good type of equipment if that work is to be done properly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>This situation was brought home to me last week in a very forceful way, when I saw a constituent of mine from North Kildare, from a grass district, and he shed bitter tears in my presence. In fact, he is a man who owns a big grass farm, who is doing a certain amount of tillage, who lacks the equipment to do the necessary tillage under the compulsory order, who made a sincere effort to hire the equipment that would be necessary to complete the 25 per cent. compulsory tillage that he was bound to do, who was visited by an inspector of the Department of Agriculture, and who was informed that he had got so many days to make a start towards completing that work. He had already arranged for obtaining the equipment, the ploughing plant and so on, necessary to do the work on his farm, but the people concerned had a big amount of work already booked, with the result that the equipment failed to reach him within the few days that were given to him to make a start.  He was liable for 25 statute acres, and because he failed to secure the necessary equipment there was compulsory entry on his land, and 75 acres were taken over under the order and sub-let for conacre.</P>
    <P>Now, I suggested to the Minister for Agriculture, 12 months ago, in this House, that if we were going to do this job satisfactorily, in my opinion, it would be necessary to organise any available equipment that we have in the country for work of that sort, that it was unfair to expect individual farmers to do this work in non-tillage districts where there was a complete absence of equipment, and that it was impossible for them to organise the necessary equipment to do their job. When one turns to the organisation that they have in Great Britain to do work of this sort, and when one reads <Col N="2371" /> of the work of war agricultural committees, the vast organisation involved there in tackling the work of food production, the attention to detail by an organisation of that sort, and the work, even outside of production altogether, of reclamation of vast tracts of scrub-land brought into cultivation of cereals, one begins to realise how much we have fallen down, how far we have completely and absolutely failed on the job, because we have no organisation of any sort to deal with that vital matter.</P>
    <P>To my mind, it will be an everlasting disgrace to this country if we, with a small population of less than 3,000,000, fail to produce the essential food for our people during this crisis, with 12,000,000 acres of arable land, some of which can be counted as the finest agricultural land in the world.  If we fail, we fail, in my opinion, through lack of proper organisation, through lack of proper direction on the part of the responsible Minister and the responsible Department.  We are relying solely on the efforts and the direction of civil servants, who have no practical experience of the work that is necessary if we are to ensure that we will have effective production.  As I said before, when one compares the results of our efforts for the past two years with the results of similar efforts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, one begins to realise how we have failed in that respect, and I think it is grossly unfair for responsible Ministers and for the Head of this Government to get up and attempt to blame farmers for lack of the right spirit in this matter.</P>
    <P>The failure, to my mind&mdash;and, speaking as a farmer, I have no hesitation in saying it&mdash;does not rest with the farmers of this country, but rests with the Government and with the responsible Ministry.  First of all, take the position as it exists.  What sort of organisation have we to deal with credit problems and with seed problems?  We have none.  That responsibility is thrown back on local authorities.  The financing of it is thrown back on local authorities.  Is that as it should be during this crisis&mdash;<Col N="2372" /> pushing the responsibility on to local authorities?  This matter of an expansion in tillage operations of this sort is one that involves a considerable amount of capital expenditure, and surely to goodness there ought to be a central organisation to deal with credit problems and with seed problems. There is no such thing.  Have we any organisation to deal with labour problems, or to tackle the labour problems that are inevitably bound to crop up next harvest owing to the drainage of skilled agricultural workers from this country to Great Britain? Are we going to allow the country, particularly in the non-tillage districts, to be denuded of the men that will be needed to save the harvest?  Are we going to set up any sort of machine or organisation to ensure that there will be ample labour to save our crops next harvest?</P>
    <P>Then, on this question of the price of wheat, we had no end of haggling and cheese-paring on a vital matter that concerned our food, a matter that was essential to the very life and existence of our people.  Why should there be such cheese-paring about it? If the agricultural community, and particularly those who have a conservative policy with regard to the fertility of their soil, are asked to draw substantially on the most valuable asset that they possess, their greatest heritage, the fertility of their land&mdash;if they are asked to draw substantially on that capital asset, then at least the Government should have no hesitation in justly compensating them.  If it is in the national interest that we should draw heavily on that fertility, then these people are entitled to just compensation. There should not have been a question about it.  There is no man inside or outside this House but must admit that a declaration of a reasonable and fair price early last season would have made a considerable difference to our wheat output during the coming season.</P>
    <P>As to the farmers' overhead charges, rates are 100 per cent. higher than they were ten years ago.  You have also many agriculturists in the country hampered by pressure from the Land Commission for arrears of annuities.  I <Col N="2373" /> suggest that some arrangement ought to be made whereby pressure would be eased during this time, when the nation is relying absolutely on the efforts of individual farmers to put their backs into the job and to get the maximum production from their land.  If that extra production is required, it involves extra expenditure, and the money is not at the beck and call and command of individual farmers.  If a farmer has to incur extra expenditure for increased production, that is not the time to bring pressure on him to meet arrears of annuities.  Then we have had growing up in this country during the last 12 months a new demand on farmers.  Many farmers are now being hounded by the officers of the Inland Revenue Commissioners for income-tax. Many farmers who are not liable are being pressed to pay income-tax.  The House appreciates the methods that are adopted by the Inland Revenue Commissioners. Whether you are liable or not the demand is made, and it is your responsibility to prove that you are not liable.  That means that a farmer who can ill afford it must seek professional advice to defend himself against the hounding methods of the Inland Revenue Commissioners.  These are the methods that are being adopted at present, when this country is relying absolutely on the efforts of the agricultural community to produce to their maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>The chief anxiety in England during this production period is to ensure that no agricultural plant of any sort is standing idle.  It was only by extreme pressure on the part of Deputies interested in the supply of kerosene for the operation of tractors that it eventually dawned on the Minister for Supplies that there was something in the case they were making.  It was a menace to have tractors standing idle for days. There is, I admit, an improvement in that respect, but there is room for further improvement.  As I say, we lack the organisation that is necessary. The type of organisation I visualise is organisation by practical men who will have the vision, foresight and practical experience to see where delays occur, where wastage occurs, and where there is failure to use our equipment <Col N="2374" /> to the best possible advantage in the national interest.  Where you have civil servants without any practical experience and without any sympathetic outlook on the problems that confront the agricultural community, there is to my mind a real menace that in this season, which is more vital than ever, the job will not be done thoroughly and efficiently and we will not get the maximum production.  I have no hesitation in saying that the effort is there, the will is there, and the capacity to do the job is there, but the organisation is lacking.</P>
    <P>On the question of equipment, even still we have certain tariffs operating against the importation of certain essential implements.  I think it was a stupid and short-sighted policy that in the last two or three years necessary agricultural implements which could be imported were prevented from being imported by the operation of prohibitive tariffs.  Why have we not an organisation in this country similar to the W.A.C. in operation at the other side? The Minister for Agriculture has a consultative council.  What use is made of that council?  Is it not a fraud, is it not a mere farce, is it not mere eyewash to have such a so-called consultative council; a council which is summoned to meet only two or three times in the year and which is not consulted but informed that certain things have already been done and certain decisions have already been taken?  Is there not some responsibility on the Minister for Agriculture to ensure that any spare equipment we have in tillage districts is organised and made available for people in the non-tillage areas?  Is it fair or reasonable to make a compulsory tillage order and say to a man: &ldquo;You have to till 25 per cent. of your arable land.  It is your job to find the equipment.  It does not concern us whether you have the necessary implements to do that job or not; that is your concern.  If you have not the necessary equipment and are not in a position to find the equipment, we will compulsorily acquire the land and take it over from you and do the job.  It is your look out to see that you get the implements.&rdquo;  I think that is a most autocratic and arrogant attitude for the Minister for Agriculture to take up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" /> At the beginning of the Great War, when we had no up-to-date mechanical appliances, or very few anyway, the Department of Agriculture organised ploughing equipment and brought it from the tillage areas into the non-tillage areas.  I remember distinctly over 20 horses and ploughs going from County Carlow to County Meath to deal with tillage operations in that county.  All that was organised by the Department of Agriculture.  Is it possible that the Department of Agriculture have not profited by that experience of 20 years ago and that they fail to realise or are simply shutting their eyes to the necessity for organising equipment of that sort?  As I said, the greatest anxiety of the war agricultural committees in England is to ensure that there is no wastage or loss in the operation of vital equipment for the production of food at the present time.  There is no directing authority here to ensure that wastage does not occur.  I am confident that there is any amount of ploughing plant standing idle for days and days at a time because we have no organisation to ensure that it is being used to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which a good many people have mentioned to me, and which requires immediate attention, and that is the necessity of organising labour for the harvest next year, and even at the present time in non-tillage districts.  There is a heavy drain on agricultural labour.  A large number of men are leaving the country, and there is a real danger that we shall not have sufficient labour to save the crops next harvest.  It seems to me an extraordinary state of affairs that, in the month of March, we should be getting into a panic regarding the tilling of the 25 per cent. of arable land.  It is too late to ensure that that will be done now.  We are breaking up old grass land which has not been cultivated for 100 years or more.  By putting in a cereal crop immediately after ploughing, the chances of success, in my opinion, are very poor.  The land will lack the mellowing action of atmospheric conditions over the winter.  It is <Col N="2376" /> necessary to aerate soil which has been buried for so many years, and that soil will turn up practically barren, with complete lack of nitrogen.  There is a definite necessity for early turning-over of that land in order to secure reasonable results.  Ploughing of this land at this late hour is almost certain to lead to failure.  That shows lack of direction on the part of the responsible Ministry, and lack of organisation.  Steps should have been taken to ensure that that would be done in good time.  The attention of the farmer should have been directed to the wisdom of that policy. When the work had to be done, it should have been done in good time, so that the farmer would get a reasonable return.</P>
    <P>In the old tillage districts, the greatest handicap we are up against is the lack of artificial manures, particularly sulphate of ammonia.  We have a residue of phosphates and potash, because we have been putting in substantial quantities of these in recent years. But they can only be used if there is sufficient nitrogen in the soil as a plant food.  I am not satisfied that any really serious attempt has been made to secure a supply of sulphate of ammonia.  Imperial Chemicals, who make this product&mdash;a synthetic product &mdash;were simply chock-full of sulphate of ammonia last June and July.  The British Government were of opinion that the Germans had their eye on it and that it might be bombed.  They decided that early distribution of the supply should be made amongst British and Northern Ireland farmers. It was distributed at £10 10s. a ton, less £1 per ton, rebate, for taking early delivery.  The distribution was carried out early last summer.  Such a quantity of sulphate of ammonia came into Northern Ireland that they had it packed to the ceiling.  It came over the Border to our black market at £40 and £50 a ton, although it cost only £9 10s. a ton.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition mentioned the possibility of a trade agreement with Great Britain, pointing out that the British had made an agreement with Portugal and that the Germans had made an agreement with <Col N="2377" /> Turkey.  He might have mentioned also that Russia had made an agreement with Japan.  I cannot see why he should not be able to effect some kind of trade agreement with the British. I am not satisfied that any real effort has been made to arrange such a trade agreement.  Are we to continue to provide the British with essential foodstuffs&mdash;livestock and livestock products &mdash;in exchange for paper money?  Are we to continue to export these foodstuffs in huge quantities without a quid pro quo?  I am not satisfied that a proper attempt was made by the Government to secure a supply of sulphate of ammonia.  Instructing a civil servant at this end to get into communication on the 'phone with a civil servant at Whitehall, or Colwyn Bay, or even the sending of a civil servant across to the other side is not the proper way to effect a trade agreement. Here is a matter which is vital to food production&mdash;a supply of sulphate of ammonia.  We are getting supplies of it over the Border into our black market at a price 500 per cent. and 600 per cent. above the actual cost and we are told that it is not possible to secure a supply of that essential commodity through the ordinary channels.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies told us to-day that he is prepared to give a firm which has gone into liquidation a permit to export certain stocks of whiskey.  I understand that these stocks are considerable.  I have heard the figure of 250,000 gallons mentioned. It is extraordinary that the Minister should be prepared to permit the export of 250,000 gallons of stimulants, which are badly needed by the British, without making any effort to effect a deal on the matter.  The Minister for Supplies told us last week that the continuance of the present ration of flour and bread, with the 20 per cent. reduction, depended on a single, slender hope&mdash;a lucky break in shipping.  The Minister also told us that 30,000 barrels of barley had been taken from the maltsters for the manufacture of flour. Even in to-day's paper there is mention of the shortage of stimulants in Northern Ireland, while there is an acute shortage of stimulants in Great <Col N="2378" /> Britain.  This is due to the fact that the acreage under barley there was controlled down by the W.A. Committee. The price for barley referred to by Deputy Dillon last week&mdash;£5 per barrel&mdash;is due to the fact that the acreage under barley was brought down to the minimum so as to ensure that the maximum acreage would be devoted to the production of wheat.</P>
    <P>With a shortage of stimulants, and the fact that malting barley is not controlled, the price of that barley has soared in England.  The Army authorities, and particularly the naval authorities, contend that men cannot be expected to risk the perils of the sea without stimulants, of which there is a grave lack in England.  We are in a position to supply stimulants.  Are we going to release 250,000 gallons of whiskey without making any condition whatsoever?  Are we going to take paper money for that whiskey, or are we going to take up the attitude that we will have to get sulphate of ammonia or wheat?  On the question of the 30,000 barrels of barley that are in the hands of the maltsters, would it not be a fair business deal to put up a proposition to the British Government that we will convert them into stout and ship it to England in exchange for 20,000 or 25,000 barrels of wheat?  Is it possible that we have not one Minister in the Government with sufficient courage to go across to England to put up a proposition of that sort?  Is it possible that we are going to continue to export all the surplus food we have merely for paper money?  Is it possible that no man in the Ministry has the courage to go across and say to the British Government: &ldquo;If you make some effort to give us a certain quantity of sulphate of ammonia in order to expand production, it will have the effect of leaving us with a bigger surplus of food that we will undoubtedly export in the ordinary way. What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that no proper effort has been made to effect a deal of that sort.  There appears to be no reason why a trade deal could not be effected between this country and Great Britain.  Until an effort is made by the <Col N="2379" /> Government, and by the Head of the Government, to see if that is possible, it is only reasonable to expect that many people will hold the Government responsible for the lack of the essential supplies that would be available if a proper deal was effected.  There is undoubtedly a surplus of sulphate of ammonia in England.  It is a nitrogenous manure, of which there is a real shortage for the purpose of food production. There is going to be rigid control of all artificial manures in England during the coming season, with the exception of sulphate of ammonia. The fact that sulphate of ammonia is exempted from control shows that there are sufficient supplies available. It is a synthetic product manufactured in huge quantities by Imperial Chemicals.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with your permission. We were told by the Minister for Supplies that the present flour ration can only continue if we have a lucky break in shipping.  We are relying on that one slender hope.  The Minister for Supplies may be very fond of a gamble, but I do not think he is entitled to gamble with the food supplies. Deputy O'Higgins referred to the quantity of potatoes available.  We had a very big and a very good crop of potatoes last year.  They were so plentiful throughout the country that <Col N="2380" /> they were unsaleable.  I know many farmers who, for the first time in my experience, fed potatoes to cattle this year.  There is no reason why some attempt should not be made to use up all the potatoes.  Before the war, Germany had an admixture of something like 20 or 25 per cent. of potatoes in flour, which, I understand, made excellent bread.  The British experimented with potatoes last year, and I think have some plant for the manufacture of potatoes for flour purposes.  We have not done anything about it.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why some effort should not be made to use potatoes, by appealing to the clergy to organise classes locally and to get domestic economy instructresses to demonstrate to housewives how such an admixture could be used with advantage.  There is a grave necessity to do that and to appeal to the people for patriotic reasons to use an admixture of potatoes and flour in home-made bread.  An effort to take precautions of that sort should be made now, because it is gambling with the food supplies of the people to rely on the slender hope of a lucky break in shipping.  That is a lucky break that may never come off.  If it does not come off where will we be?  It will then be too late to do anything about it.  I have referred to matters appertaining particularly to food supplies, because it is vital during this critical year to provide some sort of organisation so that maximum efforts will be put into production.  The last two years have shown a lack of that necessary organisation and we are now facing this year with the same outlook.  I am very much afraid of the results if we do not do something like what I suggest immediately.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for Public Services provide for the expenditure in the next financial year of almost £40,000,000.  This sum exceeds that for 1941-42 by £789,000 and for 1937-38 by £9,370,000.  One would expect that this huge increase in expenditure should have ensured that the various State Departments would by now have become attuned to war conditions. One would expect that results commensurate with this increased expenditure <Col N="2381" /> would have been produced long since.  Our bitter experience, however, in the past 12 months or, to bring matters closer still, in the past 12 weeks, I might say even in the past 12 days, has shown that this is very far from being the case.  I have no arguments to offer against increased expenditure <i>per se</i> whether personal, local or national.  I do not hold that increased expenditure is objectionable in itself.  On the contrary, increased expenditure could be regarded as a very healthy sign in normal circumstances but when we find the position to be, as it is here, that increased expenditure is met by taxation in the form of a blitz on the pockets of the poor man and his standard of living for projects which confer no social or economic benefit on the same poor man, the dangers of the situation become apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into matters of detail, which, at any rate, I understand is not permitted on this Vote, I might take the principal items of increasing expenditure&mdash;the Army, the Department of Supplies, and the Department of Local Government and Public Health. I do not want to put myself in the position of levelling barbed shafts of unjustified criticism at the Army Estimate, but, when we consider that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health took his stand almost entirely behind the Army on this Vote, I hope I shall be pardoned if I make one or two brief references to the defence policy.  The Taoiseach and his minions warn us from time to time of the imminent danger of invasion.  That is a danger of which I am sure almost everybody in the country is now quite well aware.  The invasion could take the form of aerial bombardment, the dropping of parachute troops, with the seizure of key points, or of a land invasion, or a combined sea and land invasion. I sincerely hope that the possibilities of the situation are being weighed by those responsible for defence policy, and that the expenditure on the Army, on its training and equipment, is governed accordingly. I hope that we are not in the position that we are buying rifles for which we have no cartridges, cartridges for <Col N="2382" /> which we have no rifles; that we are not recruiting personnel for which we have no equipment, or buying equipment for which we have no trained personnel.  In recent weeks, air-raid shelters are being thrown up around Dublin, particularly in the populous centres.  I am very glad to see that, but if the necessity for these shelters exists now, has the necessity not likewise existed every day during the past few years?  Are we to take it, then, that this is an example of the speed with which the less evident matters of defence are being prepared, or are we to take it merely as an example of the plodding gait of another muddling democracy?</P>
    <P>With reference to the Department of Supplies, I think that even the Minister for Supplies himself, as well as everybody else, must be aware that his Department has been a hopeless failure.  What is the history of the Department?  It existed in an embryonic state for about 12 months before the outbreak of war.  At the outbreak of war, it was born and became a fully fledged Department of State.  It got the blessing of this House and was nicknamed the Department of Supplies.  Everybody was aware, from the very outset of the war, that when the war got into its stride there would be an acute shortage of all commodities which were imported and on which we relied in a general way.  A joint deputation from the Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress urged the Minister for Supplies as far back as October, 1939, to procure, import and store all the supplies of commodities which the country would need.  A golden opportunity existed at that time, and for the first ten months of the war, of doing so.  In fact, a special Department was set up in England to export all the things they could as rapidly as they could to pay for their war effort.  No attempt was made by our Department of Supplies during that ten months to get in coal, wheat, tea, petrol, and the various raw materials that we required for our industry.  In fact, as far as I am aware, the only thing that this Department has supplied since the war started has been statistics.  Statistics, however <Col N="2383" /> gratifying to the Minister, however they may fill the empty heads of some of his supporters, will not fill the empty bellies of the people in his constituency.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Norton quoted the views of a well-known social worker in the city, the secretary of the Women Workers' Union, as to the conditions that existed during the bread crisis. He read correspondence from women living in Patrick Street, Francis Street, the Coombe, Thomas Street, Meath Street, Bellvue Buildings and other places, complaining that they could not get even as much in some cases as one-sixth, in other cases, one-fifth, and in other cases a quarter of their normal supplies of bread but the Minister was petulant and impatient when this information was given to him.  He clearly did not want to hear it, and he indicated that all he wanted to know was what the officials of his Department could tell him on these matters.  I find it difficult to understand, as I am sure do most Deputies, why the Minister did not go over to London during the past 12 or 18 months, and make some effort to get supplies and provide some justification for the existence of his Department; but it is beyond my comprehension altogether that the Minister will not take a ramble round the streets of his own constituency and get an idea of the position, as he certainly will get an idea, if he does so.  He did not like to be told last week that old women, sagging at the knees with hunger, had to stand in bread queues 100 yards long for as long as five hours in order to get a loaf of bread and that some of them had to be carried away in ambulances and brought to our city hospitals. These were unpleasant things for him to be told.  The Minister does not want to know these things, but the sooner he knows them, the sooner will he realise the necessity for taking steps to deal with the situation which is now becoming definitely dangerous.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister told Deputy O'Higgins that the reason for his so consistently ignoring the Dáil and using the radio when he has an announcement in relation to his <Col N="2384" /> Department to make&mdash;and that means, of course, an announcement of some commodity in short supply&mdash;was for the purpose of getting in touch with Pat Murphy.  That was the most expeditious manner of getting in touch with Pat Murphy.  His own memory must be very short, or he must think that our memories are very short, because, about two months ago, in an interview given by him to Mrs. Anthony Eden's newspaper, the <i>Yorkshire Post,</i> he informed every Tom, Dick and Harry in the North of England as to what the bread situation here was.  I do not know whether that was for the purpose of letting the Pat Murphys in the North of England know what the situation was, and of thereby keeping them at their jobs there, or what useful purpose he thought could be served by such an interview, but it is interesting to note at any rate that in that interview the position in regard to the bread situation here was made very clear.  An acute bread shortage was foreshadowed in it and a rationing scheme for bread was referred to.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be content to rely for the time being on the shopkeepers to distribute what bread and flour exist.  The only reason for his doing that is that his Department is hopelessly unprepared.  The fact is that they have not got the ration cards ready, and if they were ready, as they certainly should be, the rationing scheme would go ahead now.  He said that no scheme of rationing will get over a shortage.  That is apparent; we all know that; but I am sure that he will not disagree with the contention that a rationing scheme will at least secure an equitable distribution of what there is to go round.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that on this Vote on Account it might be possible to get some indication as to the policy of the Local Government Department in relation to the school-meals issue.  The only policy adopted by the Department so far has been the purely negative policy of rejecting suggestions of help from whatever source.  Various offers have been made by various people in Dublin of assistance in the initiation of this scheme of giving a hot meal to hungry school children, of whom there <Col N="2385" /> are approximately 30,000 in Dublin. Last week, the Justice Wylie Goodwill kitchens offered their assistance and the Irish Canning Association offered 5,000 ox-tails to help the scheme.  I believe that 20 tons of bones with meat on them are being thrown to rats every day in Dublin for the purpose of making fertiliser, while the Minister for Local Government mouths about the adequacy of a meal consisting of a third of a pint of milk and a dry, unpalatable brown bun.  One third of a pint of milk is about the amount a three months old infant requires for a single meal in the day, in which there are four or five meals.  He makes the point that there is no need for a hot school meal and says that milk is an unrivalled article of diet for children. Nobody disputes the value of milk as an article of diet, but is the Minister so stupid as to make the claim that milk, as a single article of diet, has any advantage over a composite meal of soup, a little meat and mixed vegetables&mdash;a diet which contains the carbohydrates, proteins, fats, mineral salts and accessory foodstuffs which are essential for young children?</P>
    <P>The position in Dublin at the moment in this respect is that a strike is imminent.  The parents of the children are seriously weighing the question as to whether or not they will keep their children from school, and anybody in touch with the situation and knowing the realities of it will have no hesitation whatever in urging them to take that course.  All the relevant facts have long since been put before the Minister for Local Government and he has displayed no readiness or disposition to get on with the job, or to let others get on with it.  Nobody wants his help; all that is wanted from him is the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  In reply to Deputy Byrne, junior, last week, in relation to school meals, he threw out the suggestion that the permission given by the Minister for Education to school managers to extend the mid-day interval by an hour and a half was a solution of the problem.  It is nothing of the kind, of course.  The Minister for Education has not even the gumption to make the order compulsory. He left it entirely to the discretion of the school managers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2386" /> I know how the vote in one particular school has been taken on this matter.  The school manager walked into the class-rooms&mdash;this is one of the few schools which are not prepared to avail of it&mdash;and said: &ldquo;Those who are in favour of staying in until 4 o'clock, put up their hands,&rdquo; and, of course, the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of not staying in and of not extending the interval.  The school principal, a relative of the school manager, interviewed the parents and asked them if they wanted to forgo the bun and the milk.  Of course they said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and the school manager and the school principal decided: &ldquo;The plebiscite has indicated that the children do not want to go home or want the extra hour and a half mid-day interval, and that the mothers do not want them to go home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, everything as far as the operation of this scheme is concerned is ready in Dublin.  Already there are 67 out of 216 schools in the Dublin County Borough availing themselves of the School Meals Act, and up to a few days ago 27,000 meals, consisting of milk and a bun, were being served daily in these 67 schools.  For a very considerable time past, 12 schools have been giving hot meals to 2,300 school children.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health must have been unaware of this when he was advancing his alleged strong moral grounds against the communal feeding of school children.  At the moment, there are 55 schools distributing milk and a bun to 24,700 children.  Fifteen of these 55 schools could be equipped with kitchens to provide meals for 7,400 children, leaving 40 schools and 17,240 children to be fed.  The corporation emergency cooking service is ready.  The scheme could be got going within a period of 24 hours.  I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, will, before this debate closes, indicate what he is going to do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us a Vote on Account for £39,000,000.  This, with the addition of the other Votes, will eventually amount to £44,000,000 <Col N="2387" /> or £45,000,000 or perhaps more, representing an individual tax on every man, woman and child in this State of £15, or, if we take an average family of five, a tax of £75 per family to govern this State.  I wonder do Deputies think it is within the capacity of the country to stand a taxation at this rate.  It is inevitable, of course, that in a period of emergency, such as the present, there should be increased taxation, but long before the emergency period came about taxation here was being increased year by year.  In fact, it was many millions higher before the advent of the emergency than it was when this Government came into office.  The disparity shown in the taxation figures as between 1932 and 1942 does not represent the whole situation.  In fact, the position is much worse than a comparison of these figures would show because there were certain liabilities, such as the land annuities, local loans and other things for which the previous Government was liable, that this Government was happily relieved of. In addition, this Government received larger sums of moneys from customs duties and there is an increase in indirect taxation from tariffs and other protective duties, so that I think I am justified in saying that the disparity as between the figures for 1932 and 1942 is really much greater than that represented on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking in this debate, devoted his remarks almost entirely to the £9,000,000 allocated for defence, and rather taunted members on this side as to whether they could offer any objection to an increase in taxation under that head.  As the Minister knows well, there is no objection in any part of the House to give all the money that is legitimately required for the defence of the country.  I maintain, however, that, leaving aside the large sums required for that purpose, the amount of taxation that is being levied on the people is altogether beyond their capacity to bear or of the country to produce.  Why do I say that?  Personally, I am of the opinion that it is largely due to the policy which the Government have pursued in <Col N="2388" /> the last ten years&mdash;the myth of self-sufficiency. They laboured year in and year out to make the country self-sufficient in everything, but when faced with the greatest emergency this or any other country has known, we found that, instead of being self-sufficient, we were really in a most dependent position for supplies on outside countries.  There is scarcely an article of necessity that we are not short of. This policy of self-sufficiency has not only cost the country innumerable millions but has increased the cost of living beyond all reason, necessitating the provision of immense sums to keep the unfortunate working classes in any degree of comfort and to provide for those out of work.</P>
    <P>It is, however, in relation to the needs of the people and the distribution of supplies that most fault can be found with the Government.  If this policy of self-sufficiency had not been pursued to the extent to which it was by the Government, I believe that the ordinary traders and merchants would, if unhampered by tariffs and Government regulations, have made far better provision to meet the needs of the emergency than the Government have attempted to do. They would, I believe, if left to themselves, have laid in stocks of goods sufficient to tide the country over at least a few years.  The Government have for years been attempting to prove that this country could be made self-sufficient not only in regard to food but to manufactured articles.  The fact, however, in regard to food supplies is that we now find ourselves in the position that there is not enough food for the people although the emergency has only been on us for a year or two.  We find the Ministry almost in a state of panic.  One Minister states that the position is such that we are facing, possibly, a compulsory reduction in the dairy herds and cattle population.  Another Minister says that pigs cannot be raised, as we cannot encroach on the food of the people. The Taoiseach himself, speaking in Ennis, was probably the greatest alarmist of all.  In face of these statements, how can the ordinary person be at all placid in his summing up of the <Col N="2389" /> situation?  The whole country is living on the dole: there is not a class not subsidised, from the manufacturer to the farmer and down to the labourer.</P>
    <P>I believe that we are the victims of subsidisation.  Never an advocate of the policy of extreme subsidisation myself, I feel that we have reaped the fruits of that policy carried on excessively during ten years, until now, in the period of emergency, we find that whatever we require in the way of food and materials necessary for the nation cannot be got without increasing subsidisation. If there are improvements that any side of the House might suggest for the administration of this State in regard to the needs of the people, they scarcely can be brought forward without the added inducement of an extra subsidy.  When the farmers were forced by circumstances to make a supreme effort, during the last year or two, to provide food for the nation, it became necessary that a greater amount of money should be spent in subsidising the products of the farmers, because the peak of expenditure on production was so high&mdash;due again to the policy I have been criticising&mdash;that foodstuffs could not be produced and sold here at a reasonable price without the assistance of the Government.</P>
    <P>When, due largely to the Opposition in this Dáil and the force of public opinion outside, the Government eventually came to the conclusion that a fair price, considering the cost of production at present, should be paid for that essential commodity, wheat, it came too late to produce the quantity one would have expected that price to produce.  As Deputy Dillon said across the House the other day, we have for eight or ten years pursued the policy of producing wheat here and running out the fertility of the tillage lands of people who had been engaged in tillage previously, to such an extent that, when we come to the emergency and need to produce it at an excessive rate, we find that much of the land has become impoverished, as the Government were not able to step in and aid the farmer by providing the necessary manures to feed that land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2390" /> We will be told immediately that, if it were not for the policy of the Government in the last ten years, there would be no tillage now.  Of course, that is rubbish.  The majority of the farmers, even in the non-tillage areas, had some idea of tillage and could start in one year and, with eight or ten months' notice, food could have been produced for the people.  Even now, at the 11th hour, when the Government has seen fit to see that farmers are properly paid in regard to certain essentials, there is great perturbation as to the main item of the agricultural industry&mdash;the dairy produce section. Here again, because of the policy of one subsidy leading to another, it may be necessary for the Government to step in if the industry is to be saved, by an increased subsidy in that direction also.</P>
    <P>I am one of the last Deputies in this House who ought to apply for protection for anything, as I am probably a greater anti-protectionist than any other Deputy, but the vicious circle has worked so far that it has compelled even those of us who had a Free Trade tendency to come in now and demand protection for the particular industries in which we individually are interested. So I say to the Minister that, if our exports of cattle are to be maintained, it is essential that the Government rapidly come to the assistance of the dairying industry.  That is a matter for another debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enlarge on it now.  In regard to the distribution of our supplies, the Government has failed probably more than in any other direction.  At the moment, in relation to the distribution of flour, there are many areas where families of working men have been rationed to such an extent that one might say truthfully that they have been without flour for six or seven weeks.  I know families of workers&mdash;six, eight or ten heads in a family&mdash;which have not got half a stone of flour per fortnight for the last six or seven weeks.  That is something which it is within the <Col N="2391" /> province of the Minister to regulate, as, according to the Minister for Supplies, 80 per cent. of the flour needs of the people is available.  Yet, I do not think any Deputy will say flour is being distributed on the 80 per cent. ratio.  I hope that, before there is another debate on wheat, the situation will have been so arranged that the workers in every district will get a fair crack of the whip in regard to flour.  Personally, I do not believe that will be brought about until there is official rationing, that we cannot expect the retailers to do the rationing in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>The turf supply question is familiar to everyone in Dublin, both in regard to amount and quality.  It is time we should cast our eyes six months ahead and think of the position for the coming year, when transport may be much more difficult for bringing turf into Dublin and other cities.  I hope the Department is seriously considering that aspect of the situation.  We have been taunted often with what happened 100 years ago in this country and I would like to suggest to the Minister that the Government should read and digest the history of what happened 100 years ago, to see what available methods of transport there are besides those we have been used to for the past ten or 20 years&mdash; trains, lorries and other mechanically-propelled vehicles.  There are such things as canals, and I should like to see a greater use made of them in bringing turf to the City of Dublin. Some engineer will say that there are difficulties in regard to this method of transport, that there are several locks between, say, Monasterevan and Dublin and that, without impeding the flow of the water, it would be difficult to get any quantities of turf through the locks.  I have been told that already and that there are other difficulties. I do not know whether that difficulty is real or not but, if it is, I would like to remind the Minister that even that could be got over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time in this country, and much more recently in other countries, people have had to adapt themselves to circumstances <Col N="2392" /> and to transport goods under very adverse conditions.  We are familiar with the system in Canada&mdash; not in connection with made canals such as we have but in very troubled waters, whereby goods were transported for many thousands of miles at one time and, even within my memory, goods were transported at much longer distances along those waterways than we would ever have to transport them in this country.  They were faced with much greater difficulties than those that might impede progress on the canals here.  It was necessary at times to unload the goods, owing to rapids, and load them again.  But the goods were got to their destination eventually.  I see no insuperable difficulties if the will is there to take advantage of the method of transport that we fortunately have in this country, the canals, and, if necessary, we could employ relays of horses.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I hope we will not hear at the end of this year that there is turf in the country but that it cannot be brought to Dublin.  Above all, I would suggest that when the turf is brought to Dublin, the wholesalers and retailers should be compelled, if they have not got the commonsense and interest to do it of their own accord, to safeguard the turf and to preserve it in its original good quality until it reaches the consumer.  I have seen turf dumped in the yards of Dublin, on wagons in open spaces, no attempt being made to build it up or cover it; it was left there for days or for weeks, and eventually reached the unfortunate householder in Dublin in such a sodden condition that 20 boxes of matches would not set fire to it.</P>
    <P>These are things outside the realm of finance, but which arise on this particular Vote, and I hope that when we come to the end of another year we will find that whatever flour is available will be more equitably distributed, and that an effort will be made to get all the turf that is required.  I am quite confident that a method of transport will be found if the will is there to find it.  Even though we are in a period of emergency, we should <Col N="2393" /> look ahead and see what it is possible to do towards rectifying the mistakes of the last ten years, and decide whether we are going to proceed with the present policy of an every-day increase in some subsidy or protection to some manufacturer or the farmer or the labourer, until the vicious circle will be completed and the cost of living will have risen to such an extent that the ordinary person in this country will find it difficult to exist at all.  That is a matter which must be considered.  I am glad that, at last, the Government have come to realise this, and that they have reinstituted the Tariff Commission, which they abolished some years ago, to investigate to what extent protection will in future be used as an aid to industry and agriculture in this country.</P>

I would suggest to the Minister that instead of depending in this matter on a few, and far too few, inspectors to go around and check the acreage, use should be made of either the Local Security Force or the Local Defence Force in this respect.  There <Col N="2394" /> are 40 or 50 young men in every parish who know what land is, who know arable land from non-arable land.  Let them do the job.  Let them get the returns. Instead of relying on district justices and £5 fines, let defaulters be brought before some other tribunal where they can be dealt with properly. We are sick of this.  We had a statement from Deputy Hughes a while ago. He told us about a poor fellow who called to him last week crying because the Department had forcibly entered upon his land.  He was going to make a start to plough in March.  Seventy-five acres were taken off this man. Deputy Hughes comes in with a complaint about his case.  If that man did not know that he had Deputy Hughes behind him, there would be less of this wailing and less of this, &ldquo;Run to Daddy, he will save you.&rdquo;  Fancy coming in here with a story of this poor small farmer who came crying to Deputy Hughes, that he was going to make a start to plough in March. Deputy Hughes comes along and tells us the next moment that that man should have been ploughing last October.</P>
      <P>Probably, if the Department has now taken over and ploughed those 75 acres, as Deputy Hughes states, they will only get half a crop from them. The fault I find with the Department is that they do not adopt the proper attitude in regard to those cases.  I would make it compulsory on every landholder in the country, if in his opinion he will be unable to till his quota, to give notice before 1st November to the nearest civic guard station that he cannot do so, and I would have that land taken over.  In the case of the fellow who did not do that, I would take his land, and it would not be for one year &mdash;it would be for good.</P>

Let them be brought before some tribunal that will deal with them properly and give them imprisonment without fine.  Then we had the old stunt here by Deputy Dillon, who has now gone to his proper place&mdash;the infants' class; the A.B.C. Party.  It is a good job, too, because I think he needs education all along the line, from the infants' class up.  I am glad he has gone over to his proper place.</P>

      <P>He will probably come down with the fall of ground like Deputy Hannigan.  Deputy Dillon told us again to-day about the &ldquo;codology&rdquo; of growing wheat, and he was ably supported by Deputy Bennett, whose constituents have not 10 per cent. of their land ploughed to-day, and it is in a period when our people must either get wheat or starve that all this is going on.  It is in such a period that we have Deputy Dillon attacking the Government. Why?  Because they endeavoured for the past ten years to induce the farmers of this country to grow wheat.  That is Deputy Dillon's complaint now, in 1942, that they did not leave this country in the condition he was anxious to have it in, namely that within two months of the start of the war they would have to walk across to John Bull and say: &ldquo;For God's sake give us bread for our people.  Take whatever you want, ports, manpower, or whatever you like.&rdquo;  That has been at the back of his mind during all the period he was over there as deputy leader of the Fine Gael Party, and we had tillage farmers like Deputy Hughes having to sit behind him and hear him talk about the &ldquo;codology&rdquo; of growing wheat.  This thing has been a sinister move on his part during the past two and a half years, <Col N="2396" /> until at last he had to be sent to the infants' class.  But that this Government did in 1932-33 start educating our people in the growing of wheat, despite the Deputy Dillons and the Deputy Bennetts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what would be the position of this country in August, 1939?  Supposing the war started in August of 1932 how much bread would there be for our people in this country, when we were dependent on the bag of flour Uncle Bull sent across, and we could not even mill it here?  That was the situation we had to work against, and, whatever may be said against the manner in which the Government have used their power from 1939 up to the present, at least they must get credit for this much, that they had 250,000 acres of wheat growing the year war started.  We hear complaints about the scarcity of supplies here.  Deputy Hannigan told us about a special department set up in England to get in supplies.  Supplies of what?  They had a special agent down in my parish last week buying crows at a &ldquo;tanner&rdquo; a time to feed themselves.  They had eaten all the vermin that were in this country in the shape of rabbits.  Anyone reading an English paper knows that they get three eggs a month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, in the first instance, that I thoroughly agree with Deputy Hughes.  I think our cattle should not go to Britain unless we get essential supplies instead.  I think that paper money to-day is worth nothing. The Government should insist on getting essential supplies in exchange for <Col N="2398" /> the food products we are sending out. Sulphate of ammonia is required, and there are other things which are also urgently required.  Nobody is going to tell me that you cannot get them, with the example of the leather trade before us.  When leather was being exported at the beginning of the war, those in charge of that industry went to the Government and said they wanted certain raw materials.  The Department of Supplies thought that raw materials could not be got, but when the leather exports were stopped, unless in exchange for raw materials, the raw materials came.  I firmly believe that we would have very little difficulty in getting essential goods in exchange for our cattle or for any other products we have to send to Britain, products that are surplus here. I do not see why we should not endeavour to arrange that.</P>
      <P>The Labour and Fine Gael Parties seem to be agreed on one thing, and that is that the Departments have fallen down on their job.  We must remember that it is only a few years since those Parties, who now have all those complaints, combined and forced a general election in order to give an increase of salary to the officials of the various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And your Party doubled their number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They forced that general election and we got back again and we did not reduce our numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But you doubled the number of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies in opposition now complain that the officials have fallen down on their job.  Is it because we did not increase their salaries that they fell down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you not double their numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the Departments have fallen down on their job.  There are, however, a number of things that can be rectified.  It is over a year and a half since I called the <Col N="2399" /> attention of the Minister to the position in regard to scrap iron, which was then being exported in large quantities. I know that some efforts have been made to get Irish Steel, Limited, going again.  I should like to know what is the position now in relation to steel and iron, because country blacksmiths find it almost impossible to get the iron necessary for shoeing horses.</P>
      <P>We find ourselves in this predicament, that there are no tyres for motor vehicles, no coal for the railways and when we come to the horses we have not sufficient iron to provide shoes for them.  Undoubtedly, thousands of tons of iron that could have made horse-shoes were allowed out of the country within the past two years.  We should like to hear from the Minister if Irish Steel, Limited, will be operating again and when it is likely they will resume operations.  We had many meetings in connection with that matter and now we want some action.  We want to know when we will come to the period when we can rely on our own industry to supply all the iron and steel the country needs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett made some reference to turf.  The price of turf is a racket&mdash;there is no getting away from that&mdash;and the manner in which the turf is being handled is also a racket. Some three months ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance told us it cost 9/7 per ton to discharge, cart and restack the turf at the Marina in Cork.  I then pointed out that the same job was being done by the South Cork Board of Assistance at the country home at a cost of 2/9.  Since then I got a copy of a tender, dated 28th August, 1941, from a reputable firm in the City of Cork, offering to do the work at 5/5. If a reputable firm was prepared to do the work at 5/5, why was it not given them, and why was 9/7 per ton paid? That is a matter that the Turf Controller should give us some information upon.  Facts are stubborn things, and the facts are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also heard complaints about <Col N="2400" /> farmers and the cost of living.  I am a farmer and, while I agree that prices should be kept as low as possible, I cannot agree that the only people they are to be kept low on are the producers, the farmers.  While every other section of the community will be allowed to make all the profits it likes, the farmer is to be kept down.  I gave an instance some time ago in Cork as regards the position of sulphate of ammonia.  I indicated that it was held over from last year, when it should be sold at £10 a ton, and that it was being offered to farmers at £55 a ton. I gave the Minister the name of the firm concerned and the name of the carter who carried that sulphate of ammonia last November and I indicated the place where he stored it.  We want action and we want to know if it is considered a fair profit to have such a margin as exists between £10 and £55.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to know what is happening.  I further demand that all this black market stuff that is supposed to come across the Border should be stopped.  A lot of the stuff that is being sold as black market stuff is not black market stuff at all.  It is my opinion that a large quantity of the white flour that we see advertised, and that is supposed to be black market flour, is flour milled in Irish mills; it is there milled into white flour and sold as black market flour at 14/- a stone, or whatever is the price that it is sold at.  It is also my opinion that a lot of the tea that is being sold as black market tea is tea accumulated through giving light weight in ounces and half-ounces to the unfortunate poor.  It is high time to stop the black market stuff coming across the Border and to put an end to the abuses I have just referred to.  There should be a penalty imposed on the people who are offering white flour for sale.  There is white flour for those who can buy it and no flour at all for the unfortunate poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let it end.  There is only one way of ending it, namely, prohibit the sale of white flour in this country.  Whatever <Col N="2401" /> we are supposed to gain by way of the cargo that comes in across the Border we lose in the essential supplies that are leaving this country instead.  If a lorry-load of white flour comes in across the Border, there is a lorry-load of sugar or butter that goes out instead of it.  No man is going to tell me that a lorry comes in loaded and goes out empty.  It does not.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like to touch is the position as regards oatmeal.  I was rather interested in that, seeing that the farmer was compelled to sell his oats at 18/8 a barrel and that the price of oatmeal was fixed at £28 a ton.  I met a miller and had a chat with him, and because of the statement he gave me I asked him would he be good enough to put that statement in writing.  He did so, and I intend to read his letter for the House.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Mount Bellew,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Co. Galway,</P>
    <P Just="Right">13/2/42.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The price of milling oats was fixed at 18/8 per barrel (14 stones). The prices of oatmeal were fixed at £28 per ton wholesale and 4/2 per stone retail, anything less than one ton being considered as retail.  In two tests carried out by us we got the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>16 barrels of Potato Oats, 18 cwt. oatmeal;</P>
    <P>10 barrels of Victory Oats, 10 cwt. oatmeal.</P>
    <P>This shows that a miller can with safety give one cwt. of oatmeal for every barrel of oats....  If we could get oats at fixed prices and get the fixed prices for oatmeal we would make the following profits.  In our small mill we turn over 50 barrels per day or 300 barrels per week.  The cost of doing so, wages, etc., is £15 weekly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you are up against in this country.  At present, I believe that the millers are not even satisfied with this profit.  You can buy oatmeal, it seems, at the fixed price, or you could at one time, but now you cannot because they put it into a little package and call it something else and charge what they like for it.  It has gone as far as that, and I suggest to the Minister that it is time (1) that he fixed an economic price for oats, and (2) on top of the economic price of oats that he fixed the price of oatmeal so that that kind of profit cannot be got &mdash;a man with costings of £295 for his week and a profit of £205 a week.  It is time that that thing should stop, and it will have to stop, and the sooner the Government gets to work in connection with that particular thing the better.  The Government should come along in the same way as in connection with tillage and instead of fines let us have imprisonment, and not be sending the boys and girls to jail: send the boss to jail.  Those are matters, however, that need rectification, and need it at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Hughes at great length on the position of tillage.  I do not agree with the version given by Deputy Hughes.  I do not agree, for instance, with regard to pressure by the Land Commission.  From what I have seen done by the Land Commission, I think they are fair enough, and I have never met them yet where they were not prepared to go half-way or even three-quarters of the way to meet any unfortunate man who was <Col N="2404" /> not able to live up to his obligations, and I am sure that any Deputy over there can say the same thing.  It is unfair to the Land Commission that a Deputy should say that they are using the iron hand in regard to annuities when they are not.  It is enough to blame them for the sins they commit without blaming them for the sins they do not commit.  When I have gone to the Land Commission to ask for time for annuitants, I found that they met the cases fairly and squarely, and if there was any fairly decent offer made they were prepared to accept it.  I do not believe that any pressure of that description is being exercised in regard to the payment of annuities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes also dealt with the kerosene situation.  In reference to that also I have no complaint to make.  Whenever I rang up the Department of Supplies, in regard to kerosene, for some person, I found in nine cases out of ten that the supply had been granted.  In the other 10 per cent. of cases I found that the people had not made a proper return as to the kerosene they had already got.  Everybody knows that in regard to commodities which have to be rationed there is an inclination on the part of individuals to get what they are not entitled to.  In the case of one man, about whose supplies I went to the Department, they showed me the return they got from him and said: &ldquo;If you think he should get more, say so.&rdquo;  The return showed that he had only ploughed 17 acres of land with 200 gallons of kerosene.  The trouble with regard to kerosene and other things is that you have a black market operating.  Unless there was a definite emergency reason given, I would put all private motor cars off the road.  Three-fourths of them are being run on kerosene and the other fourth are being run by big businessmen on the petrol they are getting for their lorries to carry essential supplies.  What about the line of cars which I see two nights a week outside the Freemason Hall in Molesworth Street?  Any Deputy who stands outside the gate of Leinster House can see what is going on.</P>

The greater number of the private cars that we see running to-day are being run either on petrol which has been given to businessmen for the carrying of essential supplies on lorries or on kerosene that is supposed to be used for industrial purposes.  There is only one cure for it and that is to put the private car off the road.  With perhaps four or five years of the war still before us there is no excuse for using tyres, which cannot be got now, on such cars.  There is no excuse for the wastage of tyres at the present time by high power and low power cars running around the country.</P>

      <P>No, I would keep on the track.  Deputy Davin is aware that the railway company also own the buses and they ran the two side by <Col N="2407" /> side.  The train started from Cork five minutes before the bus.  It always got five minutes' start so that the bus driver would know the road, as the railway and the road run side by side.  That is the kind of thing which has been going on.  I suggest that we should have an examination of our resources so as to know where we are.  If Deputy Daly wants to thresh next harvest and he has no kerosene to thresh with, it will be very little good for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I allowed the private cars to carry on two months too long.&rdquo;  Deputy Daly would not take that as an excuse. That is the reason they will have to go.</P>

      <P>In certain respects, I do not think that any Deputy here ever listened to a more harmful, a more provocative or a more dangerous speech, taking into account all the circumstances, than the speech which has been made by the Deputy who has just sat down.  I think I would be speaking the minds of most decent Deputies and the minds of the vast majority outside if I were to refer to it as an unchristian speech.  No matter how much individuals in this country may dislike people in other nations, it comes very badly from a Deputy in an Irish Parliament&mdash;the Parliament of a Christian country&mdash; to say from his representative seat behind the Government that he would be glad to see the day when fellow human beings, neighbours of ours, would be driven to eating rats.  I hope this debate will not proceed much further before the most influential spokesman in the Government gets up and repudiates those remarks.  Quite aside from the lack of Christianity and the amount of barbarity that was expressed in those remarks, we must be conscious of the amount of harm and damage which may be done to the country.  That may mean nothing to an irresponsible and uncouth playboy, but it means something to the people of this country.  The people of Britain, the members of the British Parliament, the members of the British Government, decent English men and women and decent Irish men and women in <Col N="2408" /> Britain may not be as closely aware as we are of the hollowness, the emptiness and the irresponsibility of the Deputy. His words, when printed abroad, may be taken seriously and organs and individuals that are hostile to this country may magnify the importance of those words and may stress, in a peculiar way, the fact that the Deputy was speaking from a bench immediately behind the Government.  The mere accident of his geographical position in this House may give added importance to his words in the minds and in the eyes of those who do not know the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is the first occasion on which the taxpayers have been confronted with a bill of this immensity.  We have got to ask ourselves: Whom does it affect? Who are the taxpayers?  What is the explanation?  Times have changed in the past ten years.  Prior to that time, when we spoke of the taxpayers, we spoke of the stronger members of the community.  We referred to people who paid income-tax.  Indirect taxation was practically unknown.  The masses of the people&mdash;the poorer people of the community&mdash;contributed very little to the pool of taxation. Only in respect of beer, spirits, tobacco and a few articles of that kind were the poor tax payers.  In the past ten years, there has been an overwhelming change.</P>
      <P>More money was wanted for everything. More people became taxpayers, as one day followed another, until it is true, I think, to say that, of the increased taxation necessary to meet the increased expenditure of the past nine or ten years, a very considerable amount has been secured indirectly&mdash; by the taxation of the people according to their consumption.  We have now reached a position where an increased bill of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 or £500,000 is not alone the concern of the big income-tax payer but very much more acutely the concern of the humblest and poorest people in our land.  That being so, it is right and proper that an assembly such as this should, in a rather vehement way, examine, inquire and ask the reason for every single increase in expenditure. That is also a reason why Ministers should be strictly honest and very open with both the House and the people when explaining, or pretending to explain, the reasons for vast increases in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health spoke in the course of this debate.  By direct statement and by implication, anybody who had <Col N="2410" /> not closely studied these figures and who was not conversant with the thousand and one currents of increased expenditure in recent years, would be led to believe, by the Minister's speech, that the appalling and alarming increase in taxation was solely attributable to expenditure on the Defence Forces.  That statement is definitely misleading&mdash;so misleading that it goes to the borderline of being a dangerous untruth.  When I got this Book of Estimates and this Vote on Account, I happened to pull down the only Book of Estimates of a past date which I had within reach.  It happened to be the Book of Estimates for the year 1927-28.  Comparing it with the book for 1942-43, I found that the increased expenditure on the Army, as between 1927 and the coming year, amounted to £7,000,000&mdash;an enormous sum, which it will be very difficult to find.  But I found that the total demand, as between that year and the coming year, had gone up by £17,000,000.  So that the Army is responsible for £7,000,000, and forces and factors not in any way associated with the Army are responsible for the extra £10,000,000 to be placed on the backs of the people, poor and rich.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy who is agreeable and willing in a time of danger to take responsibility for every halfpenny of that extra £7,000,000 required for the Army, I am bound to say that a State in hard times should be run like a business or a home in hard times and that, if money which it is difficult to find is required in one direction, there should be retrenchment elsewhere.  Is there anybody in this country capable of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  We can see in a comprehensive Vote, like the Vote on Account, in a very striking and significant way, what never occurs to us when discussing Estimates one by one.  When we discuss Estimates one by one, we see a plausible and, possibly, good case for increasing the amount of money required for each one of those Estimates.  It is only when we get the whole lot in tabloid form that we see the dangerous road we are treading and the disaster that may be at the end of the road for us. A person's attention may be called <Col N="2411" /> in his own home to the fact that in the principal room the furniture is decrepit, the hangings in bad condition and that refurnishing is required. That will cost £100 and he has £100 to spend.  He may be inclined to say that he will go ahead as he will be able to find the £100.  Then he goes down to the kitchen and he is told that the range is antique and beyond repair and that it would be advisable to put in an Aga cooker at a cost of about £100.  There is a perfectly good case for the front room and a sound case can be made for the kitchen.  The man in question may be living on four wheels; he may find that his motor is on the point of breaking down.  His existence may depend on the motor. He is told that if he trucks it in he will get a new motor at a cost of £100.  Any one of these three things, taken alone, is sound expenditure. Meeting the whole three at the same time spells bankruptcy.  That is what is going on here.  When we must of necessity, if only for the amount of mental ease it gives our people, spend more on the Army, we choose that particular time to spend more on everything else.  And Ministers tell the people that the increased taxation is due to the increased cost of the Army.  As between the year this Ministry took over and the coming year the increased cost of public services as shown by the Estimates is about £18,000,000.</P>
    <P>The difference between the cost of the Army as shown in the Book for the coming year and in 1931 is £7,000,000. There is an increase of £11,000,000 outside and clearly distinct and remote from the Army.  The cat around this House in the past used to be social services. To-day it is military services. Neither of these cats is the animal which should be whipped.  Neither of these things is the real cause of the mounting, bounding, demands for taxation.  The real cause and the real explanation is that the brakes are off, that the machine is running away with the men and that the men are running away with the money of the people.  I took a rather hasty glance through the Estimates and a number of the sub-heads, <Col N="2412" /> one after the other, hit me in the eye&mdash;things that could not be remotely associated with either military requirements or social services.  In the two volumes I happened to have&mdash;that for 1927, and that for the coming financial year&mdash;I took a number of sub-heads just to see the trend of affairs.  Take the Dáil itself.  The Dáil and the Seanad cost £98,000 in 1927.  The Dáil and the Seanad, reduced in numbers, will cost £124,000 in the coming year. The difference is £26,000.  That has nothing to do with social services or defence.  I thought of the speeches made in the past, of the cost of Ministers living in luxury and all the rest when I came to the Estimate of the Office of the Head of the Government.</P>
    <P>In 1927, when Mr. Cosgrave was there, when he was accused of running this country on the scale, and following the example, of a wealthy empire the cost of his office was £11,000 odd.  The cost of the office of his successor in this year is £15,000 odd.  It costs £4,000 more to provide a seat in that building over there for Mr. de Valera than it did to provide a seat for Mr. Cosgrave, holding the same office, running the same country with a poorer people. The replacement of just one individual by another represents an increase of £4,000 or more.  The reshuffle, the replacement of one Party by another in this building cost the taxpayers £26,000 more.  Neither of these is a military or a social service.</P>
    <P>We come then to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and we find as between these two years that it costs £4,000 more to run that office than it did before the change of Government.  We find that the cost of the office of the Minister for Finance, this watchdog of the taxpayer, has bounded from £53,000 a year to £75,000 a year.  All in a few years, the cost of that office has gone up by £20,000. With that headline, what is the hope or the use in that office saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to anybody else?  The cost of the office of the Revenue Commissioners, who have only the same number of pockets to pick as heretofore&mdash;perhaps a smaller number to pick than they had ten years ago, seeing that we are dealing <Col N="2413" /> with a falling population and, on the whole, a poorer people&mdash;has gone up from £630,000 in 1927 to £922,000&mdash; an increase of nearly £300,000 a year. The cost of the office of Public Works &mdash;I am not talking of expenditure on public works but on the office of Public Works&mdash;has gone up from £103,000 to £142,000, an increase of £31,000 in the annual cost of running that one office.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission used to cost £10,700 a year.  This year it is costing practically £23,000, an increase of more than 100 per cent.  The cost of the office of the Minister for Justice, which used to be £27,000 a year, has gone up to the huge figure of £45,000.  The courts are the same and the amount of crime, I would say, is less than in 1927.  The area of the country is the same but the cost of the office alone has increased by £18,000 for each year.  The expenditure on the Civic Guards itself has increased by £500,000 as against the year I mention.</P>
    <P>The General Register Office&mdash;not a social service and not a military concern&mdash;has increased from £9,000 to £13,000 an increase of practically 50 per cent. in the running of one office.  The circumstances are the same, the administrative area is the same and the population less.  Expenditure on the office of the Minister for Education&mdash;the office only&mdash;has jumped from £160,000 a year to £189,000 a year, an increase of practically £30,000 in the annual cost of running that office.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the sub-heads I picked out and the total increase in these few sub-heads alone comes to well over £1,000,000 a year.  The cost of every one of these Departments is increasing at the same time as it is necessary to develop and extend social services and at the same time as it is necessary to extend our military expenditure very steeply.  What is the end of it going to be?  Who is going to take responsibility for that?  Is it always a game of double-shuffle, pass on responsibility to the next?  Surely there is some man in Government or some group of men in Government who will say: &ldquo;If expenditure has to be increased in that direction, then it will be curtailed in this direction&rdquo;?  The <Col N="2414" /> fact of the matter is that there is not one of them in a position to say that, when they themselves are wallowing in increased expenditure in their own Departments.  If expenditure in my house has to be increased to the point of lunatic extravagance, I am not the person to utter a word of advice to my neighbour who is going the same road.  The weakness is in the core, not at the periphery, and when there is extravagance and grandiose magnificence on top, right down along the line you will have that headline followed.</P>
    <P>At the same time as it is necessary to find vastly more money for essential purposes to ward off starvation from many homes, to ward off danger from all, we find an orgy of ceremonial extravagance of a demonstrative kind, that was never heard of before or since in this country, and we will not take a lesson from elsewhere. At the present moment, Europe is being tortured and crucified because of the adoration it paid for years back to military splash and ceremonial.  The gun was the god and the man standing on top of the gun was the highest figure in the imagination of the people, and the price is being paid at present.  We have launched out in a most extravagant manner, monthly or twice monthly, on expensive extravagant military displays, costing thousands upon thousands of pounds in money and thousands upon thousands of gallons of petrol.  I was present at such, and I reckoned, by a rough check of the number of lorries participating, what the petrol consumption alone for one of these affairs was.  At a modest figure, I put it down at 20,000 gallons for a grand march past, which meant nothing, which achieved nothing, but which left the country and the trade of the country the poorer by that amount of petrol.</P>
    <P>I do not like saying rough things merely because they are rough, but if we are placidly and quietly to let through enormous Votes of this kind, that bear within themselves evidence of lack of control, evidence of all-round extravagance, I believe we should be false to our own position <Col N="2415" /> and false to the people who are looking to us to express their views.  Not only that, but there must be some team somewhere inside the Government machine which is fighting against this kind of thing&mdash;perhaps, so far, fighting a losing fight&mdash;but if we consider the fight they are putting up worth while, we have to show that we are not afraid to stand behind them and to stand beside them.  Experienced men, trained men, men who understand finance in a way I never claim to understand it, have pointed out, in private, what the end result is going to be&mdash;that if the brakes are not put on at some point on the downhill road, the end result, and a fairly near end, is going to be hunger, famine, unemployment and widespread distress.</P>
    <P>Are we, calling ourselves responsible Deputies, just going to sit quietly in one of the carriages with the engine running away with the train, knowing what the end is, or are we going to stretch out our hand and help those in Government who are trying to put on the brake?</P>
    <P>I said here before that the fellow who is going the path of the rake, so long as he is spending, is everybody's friend.  So long as he is lashing it about, he is the popular fellow everywhere he goes, but the day after the crash he is the joke of the club and despised by all.  The quicker the Government give up being the popular boys and begin doing their job, the more highly respected they will be, and, in the long run, the stronger they will be inside the country.  Weakness is despicable; extravagance is a sin. Extravagance even with your own is a sin, but, extravagance with what belongs to others is worse than a sin. The Estimates for this year have on every page the stamp: &ldquo;No control, no vigilance, no supervision&rdquo;.  That is the stamp which is on every page of this Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>We heard some years ago when we saw enormously increased expenditure ahead of us because of the war, of the appointment of an Economy Committee, <Col N="2416" /> and for a month or two after the appointment of that committee, here and there in Government corridors we saw wise old birds going about and we were told: &ldquo;That is the Economy Committee&rdquo;.  These old birds never laid an egg, or, at least, if they did, the egg was never brought before Parliament.  What became of it? Economy is something which many subscribe to in theory, but in practice it is a most unpopular thing.  Was it that the fear of the unpopularity was such that nothing was done, that the line of least resistance was taken and that it was decided: &ldquo;It is easier to keep on picking the pockets of the people.  We have a censorship now, and there will be very little criticism. Whatever criticism there is will not reach the public.  We can censor the speeches; the papers are becoming smaller; and we can bottle it all down&rdquo;?  It is dangerous to bottle things down.  It was by bottling things down that the power of steam was first discovered.  An explosion took place, and, as a result, we learned of steam and its power.  I do not want to feel that there are any more explosions being temporarily bottled within this country, but the people are being presented with a bill with which it is unreasonable to present them.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was a young man, I marched reverently far back in the footsteps of people like the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, and all these patriotic giants and financial intellectuals, and I listened to the words of wisdom which fell from their lips in many a marketplace and at many a cross-road, at a time when the British administration was in this country, and when the yard of Dublin Castle was big enough to hold the whole lot of the people who were administering the affairs of the whole of this country, and not just three-quarters of it.  I well remember the speeches I listened to &mdash;speeches which aroused not only patriotic but angry feelings in the breast of everyone who listened to them who had a drop of Irish blood in his veins, with their heartrending stories of the way in which we were blistered, bent and broken with taxation <Col N="2417" /> and the way in which we were crippled from carrying on our backs an amount of officialdom which it was far beyond our capacity to bear.  In their speeches they said that if they had charge of our affairs we would have fewer civil servants, fewer policemen, fewer soldiers, inspectors and supervisors of inspectors, and that they would run the country with a fraction of the number of officials in the country at that time; whatever we had in the country at that time, were corralled in Dublin Castle and in the Custom House.  But when we got control of our own affairs, we blossomed out and have not stopped blossoming out since, and as far as I can see never will.  We filled Dublin Castle, we floated out into a bigger Custom House and floated out again into Government Buildings.  These did us for a few years.  Then we grew too big and had to take over half Kildare Street and three-quarters of Merrion Square.  We then went down to Ely Place, and as rapidly as we took over streets we filled the houses in them with officials, inspectors and civil servants of one kind or another. We are still building in a ferocious way to house the next brood that we have in contemplation.</P>
    <P>Where, when, and how are we going to stop?  Either it will be stopped by the Government or it will be stopped, in spite of the Government, by the people.  Are we getting value for what we are spending?  Mind you, it is not always a case of getting value.  Even if a person gets good value for spending more than he can afford, that is the worst value that ever he got.  Even if we are getting good value for the odd £40,000,000 and cannot afford to spend it, or, rather, if the people who are putting it up cannot afford to do that, then we are getting bad value, but are we getting value?  Is any member of the Government prepared to say that we are getting value commensurate with the cost of the new Ministries that we have established? What I mean is, are the people as a whole getting value for an expenditure of over £1,000,000 on the Department of Supplies?  Is it a Department that <Col N="2418" /> has given any evidence of being alert, vigilant, on its toes, and making provision in anticipation?  As far as the people, and as far as Deputies, can see from the activities of that Department it is one that, in a vigorous way, slams the stable door every time the horse has escaped and publishes the fact that now the stable door is slammed. Words, speeches and promises do not constitute supplies.  We were lulled into a sense of security for the first 18 months of this war by listening to fairy-tales from those benches as to all the things that this new Department was doing in the way of accumulating stores, building up supplies, and making provision for the day when the seas of the world might not be as open as they were then.  When the shipping situation got difficult and the overseas line of supplies got whittled down we found we had made provision for nothing.  We found that we were not carrying any more reserve stocks than we carried away back in 1936 or 1937.</P>
    <P>Now there is no good in being extravagant in our criticism.  Reference has been made to coal which is a thing that, in my opinion, would be rather difficult to store in huge quantities, especially if one talks in terms of years or months.  Coal was got at such a short distance away from our shores in the past that I would not be inclined to criticise the Department for not having a huge reserve of it.  But take, on the other hand, tea. No excuse whatever can be advanced for this one-million-pound Department of Supplies, a Department functioning in a little island country like this, not having laid in ample stores of tea.  The Minister knows as well as I do how much tea, in bulk, even an extravagant tea-drinker will consume in a year.  Enough tea to do even the oldest person from the day he was born until the day he died could be stored under the seat in front of him. Tea is a commodity that keeps and that takes up very little space.  There was, therefore, no excuse or justification for not having in a reserve of tea. Nearly the same can be said of other important elements in our life, such as petrol and kerosene.  As regards the things that we are now running <Col N="2419" /> out of, at least four-fifths of them should have been, and could have been, stored within the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke about wheat-growing in the past.  There is no point in arguing now as to whether it was or was not wise to grow wheat as early as 1933.  He is entitled to say: &ldquo;Well, we made the people wheat-minded.&rdquo; Any other Deputy is equally entitled to say that in the first year you grow wheat on land you will get a bumper yield, the next year a good yield, the third time you grow it a light yield, and the fourth time a bad yield.  To argue from that, that we would get three times as much wheat off every acre grown to-day if we had not been growing wheat since 1933 is merely a point of view.  Deputies may be right that it was desirable to make the people wheat-minded.  There is no good in arguing over that kind of thing now, but this is true: that it would not have prevented the growth of wheat, to the extent of one acre, if, in 1938 and 1939, when every boob and blind man could see that war was coming, we had got in ample stocks of flour and had had it stored in the country, at a time when the seas were open and when imported flour was costing very little.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As this is the annual Defence Forces Bill, provision is made at Section 2 that the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts will continue in force for another year, that is, up to the 31st March, 1942.  Several other provisions have been found necessary or desirable during the past 12 months, and I shall explain each of them as briefly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the commencement of the present emergency, a number of officers have been promoted to acting higher rank.  In fact, the vast majority of promotions effected during the emergency have, for obvious reasons, been on an acting basis.  It is, of course, inherent in acting promotion in any walk of life that the promoted person must expect to revert to his ordinary state when the necessity for his retention in the higher position ceases to exist or if he fails to give satisfaction in the higher post, and officers of the Defence Forces who have received acting promotion are well aware that they are liable to reversion at any time. Acting promotions were, however, in normal times of such rare occurrence that they have never been specifically mentioned in legislation, although there is, of course, perfectly adequate provision of a general nature for promotion, whether substantive or acting. The question of reversion from acting higher rank has not heretofore been dealt with by legislation but has been covered by Army Regulations.  In view, however, of the extent to which acting promotions are now occurring, it is considered desirable to make the <Col N="2422" /> matter quite clear, and specific provision is accordingly made for such promotions and for reversions therefrom at Section 4 of the present Bill which replaces the existing legislation regarding the promotion of officers.</P>
    <P>The provision in question is being made retrospective as from the commencement of the emergency.  Similar provision in regard to non-commissioned personnel is made at Section 5. Section 3 defines a non-commissioned officer as meaning a person holding any of the non-commissioned ranks or grades of marine rating set out in the No. 2 Act of 1940 except those of private and seaman.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that deductions may be made from a soldier's pay to meet any penalties, damages, compensation or costs awarded by a civil court before which he has been charged with an offence.  In that connection, there has recently been a number of cases where irresponsible soldiers have damaged civilian property in such ways as by breaking windows.  If these men were tried by courtmartial or by their commanding officers, it would be possible, under existing legislation, to deduct compensation in respect of the damage from their pay.  It is considered, however, that the general principle regulating the exercise of the concurrent jurisdiction of courtsmartial and civil courts in dealing with civil offences should not be departed from. It has always been agreed that where a soldier goes outside military quarters and injures civilians in person or property, the civil courts should deal with him.  It would not accord with the legal conception of the Army <i>vis-a-vis</i> the civil population, ever since the first Defence Forces Act was passed, that civilians seriously injured in person or property should have to seek their redress from courts composed exclusively of military.  As the Acts stand, however, damages or compensation awarded by a civil court cannot be recovered from a soldier's pay.  Section 6 of the present Bill is, therefore, desirable.</P>
    <P>Last year's Act provided that no soldier or reservist would be entitled to be discharged during a period of <Col N="2423" /> emergency.  It has been found administratively desirable to embody in legislation the method adopted in practice of fixing the status of men retained in service under that provision when their ordinary engagements have expired.  This is now being done at Section 7 of the present Bill, which retains last year's provision and also, as a matter of clarification, suspends the operation of certain provisions of earlier Acts relating to the same subject.</P>
    <P>A section similar to Section 8 of the present Bill was included in last year's Act but applied only to officers of the Forces.  In view of the large number of Reserve officers now out on permanent service, it is considered desirable that such officers should be similarly covered.  The new section, which replaces the previous one, provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends Section 17 of the No. 2 Act of 1940, which relates to commissioned ranks in the Defence Forces.  To place beyond any doubt the fact that marine officers will come within the scope of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, which mentions military ranks only, a new sub-section (3) is being inserted.  Apart from the reference to the scheme, the subsection is a repetition of the existing sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the No. 2 Act of 1940.  Two new sub-sections&mdash;(4) and (5)&mdash;are also being added to enable military officers appointed to the Marine Service to be given marine ranks and <i>vice versa.</i>  These two sub-sections are already contained in the Emergency Powers (No. 97) Order, 1941, but are now being enacted in permanent form.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) was rendered necessary by the fact that certain officers of the Defence Forces, who were not specially commissioned to the Marine Service but were transferred to it from the military side, could not otherwise have been given the appropriate marine ranks.  The opposite might also hold and hence the desirability of sub-section (5).</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the No. 2 Act of 1940 which relates to non-commissioned <Col N="2424" /> ranks and ratings is being similarly amended.  The new sub-sections (4) and (5) apply the pensions scheme to ranks and ratings other than the military ranks at present specifically mentioned therein.  The new sub-sections (7), (8), (9) and (10) provide for transfer from military ranks to marine ranks and ratings and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Section 57 of the No. 2 Act of 1940 and Section 8 of the Act of 1941 conferred the right of restoration to their former civil employment on temporary officers, soldiers who enlisted for the duration of the emergency and reserve officers and men called out on permanent service.  These sections were inserted in the Acts to protect the interests of persons giving good and loyal service to the State and the questions have been under consideration as to whether members of the categories mentioned should, in fact, enjoy the State's protection if they fail to give good and loyal service; and whether civilian employers should be forced to take back into their service persons who are dismissed or discharged from the Defence Forces because they have rendered themselves unsuitable for retention therein.</P>
    <P>As a result of such consideration, it is now proposed that the following classes should be deprived of the right of restoration to their former civil employment on ceasing to be members of the Defence Forces:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  officers dismissed with ignominy; dismissed by sentence of courtmartial or dismissed by the President;</P>
    <P>(b)  soldiers discharged with ignominy; discharged by sentence of courtmartial; or discharged for having wilfully made a false answer on attestation, for misconduct or on conviction by the civil powers;</P>
    <P>(c)  unapprehended deserters.</P>
    <P>Many other types of cases were considered, but it was eventually decided to confine the proposal to those types which I have mentioned, and I think Deputies will agree that the proposal <Col N="2425" /> is a reasonable one in relation to such cases.</P>
    <P>Officers are dismissed only for very serious offences.  If an officer proves himself so unfit for retention in military service as to merit dismissal, he has failed in his duty to give loyal and faithful service and has forfeited his right to the protection of the State. In addition, it would be unreasonable to force an outside employer to take him back into his service.  The same arguments apply to soldiers discharged with ignominy or by sentence of courtmartial.</P>
    <P>As regards the other categories, a soldier who makes a wilfully false answer on attestation, necessitating his discharge when that fact is discovered, obtains a contract with the State by false pretences and puts the State to considerable expense for pay, maintenance, equipment and training. He does not, therefore, merit State protection.  Deputies will understand that a soldier is not normally discharged for a relatively harmless matter such as giving a wrong age or address on attestation.  Discharge occurs only in respect of some serious misstatement.</P>
    <P>The position is similar as regards discharge for misconduct.  A record of discharge for misconduct on a man's discharge papers has such an effect on his prospects in civilian life that this reason for discharge is reserved for the most serious cases.  It would be unjust, therefore, to force a civilian employer to employ a man discharged on that ground.  Again, in connection with discharge as a result of conviction by the civil power, a man is not discharged because of conviction of what I may term a &ldquo;noncriminal&rdquo; offence, such as, for instance, breach of traffic regulations. Generally some serious offence is involved so that the arguments already mentioned again apply.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that unapprehended deserters have been included &mdash;these are the persons mentioned in Section 11 as persons to whom Section 119 of the Principal Act applies&mdash;but that there is no reference to apprehended deserters.  The position of the <Col N="2426" /> latter class is that, on being apprehended, deserters are tried by courtmartial and generally sentenced to a term of detention.  They are not, however, on completion of that sentence, as a rule discharged from the Defence Forces, but are required to complete their Army engagement with a period equal to the period of absence and detention added.  It is considered that a soldier who purges his offence and completes his Army engagement, should not be deprived of the right of restoration to civilian employment.  If, however, the circumstances of his desertion are such that, on completion of the sentence of detention, it is considered undesirable to retain him in Army service, he is discharged &ldquo;for misconduct&rdquo; and he would thus, under the present proposal, forfeit his right.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to deal with Sections 11 and 12 in some detail, so as to leave Deputies satisfied that the proposals which they embody are, in all the circumstances, fair and reasonable. Before leaving the subject, I should like to point out that these sections will not prevent an employer from reinstating a former employee, if he desires to do so, but will only remove the <i>right</i> of reinstatement.  If a man is a good man at his work, his employer will probably take him back, provided his offence has not been of a definitely criminal nature.  The sections will, therefore, in practice affect the undesirable character rather than the decent man, and it is with that object of course, that they are inserted.  As I mentioned already, we could have gone much further, but there would have been greater danger of the fundamentally decent man finding himself, through some purely military offence, affected by the provisions of the sections.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 13, it is the experience of the military authorities that the majority of persons arrested by them as suspected deserters admit that they are deserters and nothing is gained, therefore, by bringing them before a district justice or peace commissioner as prescribed in Section 57 of the No. 2 Act of 1940.  It is felt that in the relatively few cases where <Col N="2427" /> arrested persons deny that they are deserters, they should have the right of being brought before a district justice or peace commissioner.  This procedure will ensure against miscarriage of justice and will, in addition, obviate the possibility of subsequent actions for wrongful imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 14 and 15 are self-explanatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that the Minister should still keep those temporary Acts before the House.  I should like to remind the Minister and the Government that when they were on these benches they made the case year after year that a permanent Act should be brought into being, but it appears that the leopard can change his spots.  I suppose the big battalions on the Government Benches can carry this measure whether we like it or not, and all I can do on behalf of this Party here is to draw attention to some of the difficulties, and to the reasons why I think that the House, at this particular stage, should not give the Minister this Bill.  He has given an explanation of some sections in regard to desertion and various other offences, and in making the case I am thoroughly aware of the fact that he was not giving information to the House but was speaking politically to some Fianna Fáil branches and executives throughout the country who had made representations to him about certain points of administration.  I think that is hardly a fair way for the Minister for Defence of this State to deal with a Bill of this kind.  I will leave that matter to his own judgment, but I would ask him to reconsider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters in this Defence measure which require attention but which he has, either purposely or through lack of information, left out. The Defence Force of the country is organised to defend the country against all comers, and, of course, in the carrying out of those duties accidents are bound to occur and casualties are likely to arise.  Within the last year or two, serious accidents <Col N="2428" /> have occurred on manoeuvres, during lectures, and on other essential duties that the Army must perform, but the State has ignored them and imposed hardship upon the dependents of the sufferers in those accidents.  I refer in particular to the very sad event that occurred when a mine was being demonstrated, and due attention has not been paid to the needs or welfare of the dependents of the sufferers in that case.  Again, members of the Local Defence Force, some of them untrained, have had accidents of various kinds.</P>
    <P>I am aware of several cases in which, using blank ammunition, fingers have been lost and arms and legs have been damaged, but the Department of Defence calmly says: &ldquo;Well, there is no regulation under which we can pay anything, but we will consider the matter and an <i>ex gratia</i> grant may be given.&rdquo;  Those people had to go to hospital and have medical attention, and their dependents were not provided for.  I think that, in a Bill of this kind, at a time like this, some provision should be made to meet those various contingencies. Again, for the purpose of properly training the members of the Defence Forces, manoeuvres are essential. Accidents will, of course, occur during manoeuvres and property will be damaged.  When I was in the Army, if we were proposing to go over certain fields, we sent word to the owners and gave them an opportunity to remove their live stock.  If we failed to send out that notice and if an accident occurred, we would very soon get a lattytat from the Department of Defence to know why reasonable precautions had not been taken.  When damage did occur, the Government of that day paid compensation immediately, as I think the Government of to-day should do.  If damage be done, it should be paid for immediately manoeuvres are over.  To my own knowledge, people have written to the Department of Defence in respect of these matters and they might as well be writing to the moon.  That is not fair.  The Minister for Defence must be aware of this.  In introducing <Col N="2429" /> a measure like this, he should take steps to assure the people of the country that, where accidents occur, compensation will be paid.  It is a matter for himself whether disciplinary action against members of the Defence Forces is taken or not.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of compensation to dependents of soldiers who die through accident or other injury received on active service.  I raised this question before on the adjournment in the case of Volunteer O'Grady.  In that case, a court of inquiry was held after the coroner's inquest and the Minister stated that the court of inquiry found contrary to the finding of the coroner's inquest.  That position is unknown to law.  If the unfortunate widow and her family had money to spend, had been well advised and had been able to employ senior counsel to go to the inquest and to the inquiry, she and her children would have received a sum sufficient to maintain them for the rest of their lives, such as they are entitled to get.  The Minister for Defence calmly and blandly informed the House that the court of inquiry found contrary to the coroner's inquest.  He expects every man who is capable of doing so to serve the country at present.  So do we all.  As we are putting that obligation on them, the people of the country assume this obligation to them&mdash; that if anything happens to them, they will not leave their dependents in a state of starvation for the rest of their lives.  Before we pass this Bill, I should like to know from the Minister if he has considered these points at all. I know he is aware of them because of the Volunteer O'Grady case.  I should like to know if, even at this late stage, he does not consider himself in conscience bound to make a payment to the widow of that soldier and any other soldier who has died in similar circumstances.  Similarly, if members of the Local Defence Force lose a limb in the course of active service, the Department will not, I hope, &ldquo;shilly shally&rdquo; for months and leave them to the dole or to the local authority or some charitable organisation.  The Minister should state that this Government and this Parliament will see to it that every person who serves this <Col N="2430" /> country under arms at the present time will be looked after, if anything untoward occurs to him, so far as the Government and the people can do so. We should pledge our word that, if any fatalities occur, in these circumstances, in the forces, the dependents of those who suffer will not be neglected.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy MacEoin was simply making play with the fact that we have come here with a continuation Bill year after year.  He knows as well as I do the necessity for coming here with this Bill.  But I take this opportunity of informing him and the House&mdash;I think I did so on a former occasion&mdash;that the permanent measure to supplant these continuation Bills is ready for production at any moment.  Rightly or wrongly, I believed that the present was a most inopportune time to bring in a permanent Bill.  It would not be permanent, in fact, at the present time. The necessity for making these amendments from time to time proves that. If the Bill which has been ready since 1937 had been brought in and passed, we should now have to make these additions to it.  It would very shortly become what the present Act is&mdash;a thing of shreds and patches.  From that point of view, I think it is desirable that we should continue to bring in these temporary measures until the emergency passes.</P>
      <P>There has been no change whatever in respect of compensation for damage brought about as the result of Army manoeuvres.  I presume that is the matter to which Deputy MacEoin was referring.  It may be that some exorbitant claims have not been granted; that is a possibility, but claims of a character which can be justified are dealt with in identically the same way now as they were in the Deputy's time.</P>

I am not quite clear about the case the Deputy was referring to&mdash;I think it was the O'Grady case&mdash;but all I can say is that the dependents of soldiers who die in the service of the State are compensated and they are dealt with through the medium of a pensions scheme.  In the first instance, the wife and the children are entitled to pension rights, and in the case of dependents they are dealt with through a gratuity which is <i>ex gratia</i>, but there is no question of the widows and orphans of any soldiers who die in the actual service of the Army, not being properly compensated.  They are, in fact, compensated.</P>

I thought it probable that I might be winding up to-night, but it has been conveyed to me that people on the Front Bench opposite think that I ought to say whatever I have to say on the matter now, and I have no objection to doing so.  I think the statement made by Deputy Corry was most uncalled for and grossly improper and should not have been made, but I would not like to place too much importance on anything Deputy Corry would say.  Everybody in this House knows his importance and it is very little.  I agree with what Deputy O'Higgins said about him, that if people knew outside, they would pay very little attention or give very little notice to what he said, but those of us here know what value his statements have and how often he plays the buffoon.  I am sorry he made the statement and I certainly do repudiate the grossly improper sentiments he expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote on Account is an extraordinary Vote. Since 1933 there has been an increase of 50 per cent. in the total Estimates, and I do not think this country is in a position now to bear this enormous increase.  It is true that a great part of it is due to the necessity for increased expenditure upon defence.  I admit that, but I do not think the Government can claim to be free from responsibility in this respect.  When there was a change of Government the policy was adopted of opening the jails and letting out certain people.  Hopes were raised then which have now been dashed because those people have been returned to jail.  Therefore, we have an increase in the Estimate for jails, as well as for the Army and the Garda, three services which Fianna Fáil were most eloquent in promising to cut down to little or nothing.  Unfortunately we know now that that cannot be cut down, but the Government were responsible to a great extent for the necessity for increasing the Votes for these three particular items.  During the emergency, of course, it is easy to find an excuse for increasing the burden on the taxpayer.  But there has not been a year since I came in here in 1933 in which the Government did not find just as plausible an excuse as they have in 1942 for increasing the burden.  Step by step they have continued to increase it until there is no margin of safety left for the nation and we are now at the point when anything may happen.  We have been warning the Government from these benches during all these years that they were recklessly plunging into expenditure and making no effort to economise.  I think that the Government are beginning to realise, certainly the people are beginning to realise, that the burden is more than the country can bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another Department in which there is a considerable increase <Col N="2435" /> and that is the Department of Supplies. I heard the Minister for Supplies speaking the other evening and he was very eloquent about the value that we were getting from that Department. Certainly, there is part of that Vote which provides for an increase in the price of wheat.  That, of course, would be valuable if it had been done in a proper way.  Unfortunately, the Government did not move when there was time to sow plenty of wheat to the best advantage.  In autumn last the Government should have given a decent price which would encourage farmers to grow wheat, but they gave it when it was too late, and I am afraid they will not get sufficient wheat.  The State has to pay the money, but they certainly will not get as much as they would have got if it had been done in time.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £25,000 over last year for the staff of that Department. Before this money is voted, I should like to know what is proposed to be done in that Department with this increased staff and this increased expenditure.  The Minister for Supplies and his Department have done nothing to regularise the position with regard to supplies; either to provide the supplies or to provide for an equitable distribution of such as we have.  While the Ministers of other countries in the years before the war, countries which were in a much safer position than we were with regard to shipping, laid in large supplies of essential foodstuffs and raw materials and looked ahead, our Minister failed to lay in adequate supplies for this country.  Not only that, but he did something worse.  He announced that a shortage was coming and that anybody who could pay for the supplies we had in the country should secure them and hide them, and they did.  Every profiteer in the country was out buying up supplies and hiding them and these people are now creating a black market.</P>
    <P>People who acted on the hint the Minister threw out and created at that time an artificial scarcity by hiding those supplies, are selling them now at an enormous price, so that people who have heaps of money can get an <Col N="2436" /> abundance of anything they want and are getting it, while others can get nothing.  That is a terrible state of affairs.</P>
    <P>What is the function of this Department? We have been asking that question in this House for the last 12 months and we cannot get an answer. I know that it is not fair to expect the Minister for Finance to give an answer to that question.  But I asked the Minister responsible what was the function of that Department and what a person who had a tea card and could not get supplies was to do, and he did not answer.  I asked him what was the purpose of these rationing cards and I got no answer.  I have been in communication with that Department for the last six months and I have got no satisfaction whatever.</P>
    <P>In the district where I live, owing to a certain set of circumstances in connection with the supply of flour in 1940, a number of traders, through no fault of their own, have only a flour quota of about 25 per cent. of what they would be entitled to on the basis of the number of registered customers. The Minister for Supplies knows all about the circumstances in that place, which is close to the Border, and that there are individual traders who have a very small quota.  We had been pressing the Minister and his Department in regard to the matter and, at the end of six months, they did move a little but they did it in an inequitable manner.  In October last they allowed a certain increase in the supplies of flour.</P>
    <P>Certain traders perhaps got sufficient flour, but others did not get half enough.  At the present time there is a general shortage in that district again, and some traders are only able to give about half a pound of flour per week to each registered customer. That is all a great number of people are getting.  I got into communication with the Department of Supplies last week and tried to get an increase for that district, but I did not get any satisfaction.  I have got a reply to-day stating that the matter would be looked into, and that is as far as it went.  That was the position last summer.  In the month of September <Col N="2437" /> I got a reply to a letter I wrote in June.  The same thing is going to start now.  People may starve, so far as the Department of Supplies is concerned; nothing will be done.  Is it any wonder that some of us would protest against voting money to that Department until there is some satisfaction, until at least we get replies to our communications?</P>
    <P>There is only one way of dealing with this matter, and that is to ration all commodities that are scarce.  The Minister tells us that it is impossible to ration some things.  That is ridiculous. He says it is impossible to get ration cards printed and sent out&mdash; that it will cost too much.  I suggest it will cost 20 times as much to try without a system of rationing, to try to deal with individual cases.  That cannot be done.  I suppose that is why this Department is becoming so expensive and that probably accounts for the increased expenditure of £25,000 on staff.  Everyone in the country is writing to the Department of Supplies and the Department acknowledges the letters but does nothing effective.  There is only one way to deal with this thing and that is to lay down a rule and see it is obeyed. In that way everyone will get a fair supply.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a simple remedy the Minister could adopt, if he does not want to ration flour, is to see that each trader gets a proper quota in relation to his registered customers, and that can be arranged through the parish councils, the Gárdaí and the flour traders.  Certain information in the possession of the flour trader could be checked by the Guards and a system worked out by the parish council. That would save the Department of Supplies an immense amount of trouble.  If the Minister does not want to print and send out ration cards, he should adopt my suggestion, because I believe it would be effective and would save a whole lot of trouble.  I am sure the same thing could be done in other parts of the country.  The parish councils, the Gárdaí and the flour traders would be only too glad to co-operate and they could end this trouble once and for all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2438" /> The same thing applies to tea.  There is no proper regulation in the Department with regard to tea distribution or, indeed, several other commodities that are very scarce.  Many people have cards but can get no tea on them, and the Minister for Supplies has no answer to make on this tea question as to why he sent out ration cards. I should like to mention the cases of two people who were dealing with a certain tea merchant for at least 25 years.  He asked them for ration cards for tea, and they applied formally to be supplied by this trader. He supplied them with tea from April last until the 19th February of this year.  On the 19th February he wrote: &ldquo;We regret having to return your tea ration card as our van has ceased to travel in your locality.  Probably you will be able to get your local grocer to accept your card.&rdquo;  He refused to supply these two families; he rejected their cards, but he is still supplying their neighbours.</P>
    <P>If his van was not travelling to the particular district concerned, those people could recognise that as a good reason for discontinuing their supply of tea, because the expense of sending round a van was rather big, and they told him that they were prepared to accept the tea by post and they sent him back the ration cards.  He kept the cards for a month, but sent them no tea by post and eventually he returned the cards saying that he was sorry he could not supply tea.  These people tried everywhere they could think of, but no one would accept their cards.  There are hundreds of people in that position.  They cannot get tea unless they are fortunate enough to be able to go to a black market.  It is not everyone who has money enough to get tea in the black market.</P>
    <P>What are these people to do?  This question has been put again and again, privately and publicly, to the Minister and his Department, but no satisfactory reply has been given.  What are the people to do who cannot get flour?  What were the tea cards printed and sent out for?  In many cases, they are of no value.  Nobody is bound to recognise them, or to recognise the Minister.  It is just like a lot of the <Col N="2439" /> orders made by different Ministers&mdash; there is no regard for them, because there is neither head nor tail to them. So far as these orders are concerned, there is nothing in the way of an equitable distribution resulting from them.  There is no justice with regard to price or fair dealing and nobody will bother about them.  That is an unfortunate state of affairs.  That is why the black market is flourishing and everything is going topsy-turvy, because the Minister will not pay attention to people who try to co-operate and do things in a right way.  Unless Government Departments, and the Department of Supplies in particular, mend their hands they will turn this country &mdash;I really do not know what they will turn it into, but the people will not be good law-abiding citizens; they will not have respect for the law.</P>
    <P>There is very little use in the Minister hoping that the traders throughout the country will distribute commodities regularly.  It is his job to see that they do it.  He should make them do it. In any case, with the best will in the world, and however anxious they may be to co-operate, how can some distributors distribute what they have not?  The Minister's responsibility is to see that everybody gets a supply, whatever the commodity is, a supply related to the number of customers to be served.  It should be an easy matter to arrange that all customers are registered at the various shops.  If the parish councils and the Gárdaí were asked, they would see that registers were supplied.  The Gárdaí would see that everything was in order, that the population was fairly represented and that no one was registered twice.  The Department would then have had no trouble, and it could cut out all unnecessary correspondence, as commodities would be available and everyone would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Of course rationing is the only solution. The next best thing would be to see that fair quotas are given, according to the number of customers registered. Anything would have been better than the present system, or lack of system, that is creating all the trouble.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2440" /> whether he would encourage the growing of potatoes for human consumption during the emergency as a precaution against famine; whether in view of the difficulty, owing to uncertainty of seasons and shortage of manures, of ascertaining what amount would be required as human food next season, he would encourage the maximum amount of potatoes, whether he was aware that the most effective means of securing maximum production is to make it possible for farmers to recover the cost of production by feeding any surplus potatoes to pigs; and if he would take steps to have pig prices restored to what they were before the last cut in prices.  The Minister in reply stated: &ldquo;As the Deputy is aware, a widespread propaganda has been conducted for an increase in potato production for human consumption. The use of potatoes for this purpose must have priority over their utilisation for pig feeding.  I am satisfied that the existing pig prices will permit of a sufficiently remunerative return to growers for the use of surplus waste potatoes for pig feeding, and I am not prepared, therefore, to adopt the Deputy's suggestion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister does not understand the effect of the recent cut in pig prices.  If he did he would have thought twice before carrying it out, and, when it was brought to his notice, he would have paid more attention to those who tried to help him, just as they tried to help the Department of Supplies.  The Minister did not increase the price of wheat when he was first asked to do so.  He increased it when it was too late.  He will also increase the price of pigs when it will be too late, because it will be too late to plant potatoes for sale.  The Minister does not seem to understand the relation between the growing of potatoes and pig-feeding.  I think the best service I can do is to explain that relation for the benefit of the Minister and eventually, I hope, for the benefit of the country.  Who supplies the City of Dublin with potatoes?  Is it not farmers who grow potatoes for sale and not those who grow them for their own use?  Many people grew potatoes last year on the advice of the Minister, <Col N="2441" /> because they were assured that they would have a good market.  They went to considerable expense in doing so. It is a crop that cannot be grown without a great deal of expense.  A very high content of that expense goes in labour, as the crop provides good employment.  It is, in addition, an assurance against famine.  As the Minister knows, it was a prolific crop last year, and those who had a surplus over what they needed for themselves wanted to sell them.  In Cavan potatoes can now be bought at £4 per ton, but they could not be grown under £8 a ton.  Owing to a shortage of manures farmers know that they will be under a disadvantage in growing potatoes this year compared with last year.  People I have been speaking to have halved the acreage they intended to grow since the Minister made the order concerning the price of pigs.  I am not going to grow half as much potatoes as I grew last year, so that I cannot blame others if they do not do so.  I could not undertake to grow potatoes at £4 a ton.</P>
    <P>I remember selling potatoes in Cavan before 1914, and that was a long time ago, for exactly the same price that they are making this year, although it costs four times as much in labour now to grow an acre of potatoes.  People get a quarter of the work done now for the same amount of money.  It should be remembered that some 60 or 70 per cent. of the cost of growing potatoes goes in labour.  For that reason I think the Minister has made a great mistake in issuing his order.  Farmers are not as shortsighted as the Minister.  They have to look ahead and they will not risk growing a crop for such prices. There were fairs held yesterday in two counties on different sides of the Border.  In Cavan bonhams, which are generally sold in pairs, realised £4 5s. and in Enniskillen £9 10s.  The man on the Fermanagh side of the Border got £10 for each acre of potatoes that he grew, and 100 per cent. more out of them afterwards when fed to pigs.  Owing to the cut in the price of pigs farmers find that it does not pay to feed pigs or turn them into heavy pigs. and so have <Col N="2442" /> to offer potatoes for sale at £4 a ton or at 7d. per stone retail in Cavan.  They are not going to be caught the second time.  The Minister should announce at once an increased price for pigs and give some encouragement to farmers who otherwise would not grow potatoes for sale. Farmers in other counties will act in the same way.  That may cause a famine in potatoes next year owing to shortage of manures and owing to the uncertainty of the seasons.  No farmer, unless he is a fool, could grow potatoes under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister is only wasting his breath and petrol in going down the country advising people to grow potatoes under these conditions.  Unless they are fools, they will not do so.</P>
    <P>People are prepared to make sacrifices and to co-operate, but such co-operation will not be forthcoming if the Government takes up the attitude: &ldquo;We are going to insist that you produce so-and-so and we are going to take steps to see that you do not get the cost of production.  We shall compel you to till the land.  We shall take the land from you and jail you if you do not do what we tell you.&rdquo;  Very well, let them do so if they wish.  These people will go to jail; men went to jail in this country before for less cause, but this sort of bullying will not compel the farmer to do something which he considers is against his best interests.  If you want the farmers to produce food, you must do as is being done on the other side of the Border and let them get, at least, the value of that food when it is produced.  People are not going to be bullied or frightened in this way; they would not be Irishmen if they were.  I hope that in this matter the Minister will do the right thing, that he will do it in time and not do it when it is late, as in the case of wheat.  Deputies on the other side of the House know what I am talking about and I think they should put the position to the Minister for Agriculture, for he never seems to understand what is fair or right with regard to the farmers.  The policy, apparently, is to trample upon the farmer and the worker upon the land.  It is no wonder they are being driven off the land. <Col N="2443" /> They are flying from the land and they will continue to fly from it.  Now they are being told that they will not be allowed to leave the land and that they are going to be clapped into jail. Of course they will not be put into jail but the country will go hungry, and that is much worse.</P>
    <P>While there is so much of a difference between prices on both sides of the Border, is it not obvious that we, on our side of the Border, are selling our produce 50 per cent. less than the world price?  When you compare the position of the farmer with that of the industrialist, you find that the industrialist is getting at least 50 per cent over and above world prices, whilst the farmer for his produce is getting 50 per cent below world prices. That means that, taking world prices, for every £100 worth he produces the farmer gets £50 whilst he has to pay the industrialist £150 for every £100 worth of commodities which he has to purchase.  In other words, value for value, he has to pay three times as much as he gets.  Then we wonder why people are going off the land.  Is the Government, by their policy, not doing everything in their power to clear people off the land?  I wonder what they intend to turn this country into? Are they not making a desert of all the rural areas?  That is what their policy has brought the country to.</P>
    <P>What the Government is actually doing is coining the sweat of the farmer and the agricultural labourer and putting it into the pockets of the profiteer, because it is not the consumer who is getting the benefit of the control of farm produce.  There was no reduction in the price of bacon when the price of pigs was reduced nor was there any reduction in the price of oatmeal when the price of oats was controlled.  People are able to buy oats in the black market and manufacture it into oatmeal in circumstances which make it impossible for them to do anything but profiteer.  The same remark applies to the bacon curers.  They are converting pigs into bacon, and the Minister has so arranged matters that they can put huge profits into their pockets.  They <Col N="2444" /> cannot do anything else.  It is a terrible state of affairs that the big men are allowed to become bigger while the poor men are becoming poorer.</P>
    <P>It is about time that ceased.  In a time of emergency like this, when all are called upon to make sacrifices, there should be justice all round.  The people who are the backbone of the State, who have grown food to support the State, should not be persecuted at this time.  It is only a few months ago since members of the Government went round the country and from every platform they were singing the praises of the farmers because they produced so much food.  I think the farmers deserved such praise, but now the Government refuse to pay them for that food, by making orders to turn the money that should go into the pockets of the farmers into the pockets of the profiteers.  Recently, we had a visit from the Taoiseach in County Cavan and he expressed confidence that the farmers there would do their part all right.  The farmers there are anxious to co-operate with the Government, but they, on their part, want co-operation and a lead from this Dáil. They ask that the Dáil should give them that lead.</P>
    <P>I observed a few days ago that the Bishop of Galway had asked the Government to give a 100 per cent. lead to the country and, on the other hand, he asked the country to co-operate with the Government.  I hope the Government will give that 100 per cent. lead.  I should like to read a letter which I received recently from the organised farmers of County Cavan:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. McGovern,</P>
    <P>I am directed by my executive committee to request that you take steps to give effect to the following resolution adopted by them:</P>
    <P>`That in view of the fact that Ministers and Deputies have toured the country telling the farmers of their duty to produce sufficient food for the nation, and in view of the sacrifices farmers are making to do this, especially without the aid of artificial fertilisers, we <Col N="2445" /> suggest that Ministers, Deputies, Senators and all highly-paid officials should set a headline to the rest of the community by foregoing half their salaries during the period of the emergency.'</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">P. REILLY,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a reasonable request. Of course they do not threaten to put us to jail if we do not accede to it, but I think it is up to us to set a lead in the matter of making sacrifices, because the farmers are asked to make enormous sacrifices.  I think that at least those who call for sacrifices from others should make some little sacrifice themselves.  Deputy O'Higgins made a very strong protest against the increases in expenditure, and I hope the Minister will look seriously into this matter, if the Government is anxious for the co-operation of the people and wants sacrifices to be made.  Sacrifices are at present being made by every class down the country, especially by the Local Defence Force and Local Security Force.  All these people are giving up their time, their only desire being to serve the country. What are we doing?  Are we worthy to represent these people?  I think that, if we are, we should give them a lead and follow the advice of the Bishop of Galway.  I would ask the Government to give a lead and I hope that we shall get an assurance that something will be done to give effect to the demand which I have just read.  While Deputies may not be prepared to go the length that this resolution suggests, I would suggest that we should at least revert to the position we were in before salaries were increased.  Then we could with some moral force go out and ask other people to make sacrifices. We should get out of the glasshouse before we begin to throw stones at others.  When Ministers and the Taoiseach threaten people with jail, unless they are prepared to market their produce at less than the cost of production, I think it is up to these Ministers to give a lead.  They should be prepared to make sacrifices themselves <Col N="2446" /> before asking others to do so at the peril of going to jail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister, in introducing this Vote, or at least his colleague, the Minister for Local Government in the contribution that he made to the debate, would have adverted to some very notable and disturbing features of our life at the present time.</P>
      <P>I would have expected that we would have had from the Minister and his colleague some reference to the mass emigration from this country which has taken place for the past couple of years&mdash;emigration on a scale and under circumstances that have scarcely been equalled or known since the time of the famine.  Surely that emigration is a frightful indictment of conditions in this country at present? The Minister and his colleagues must surely have heard of all those pitiful pilgrimages to the railway stations of mothers and sisters, brothers and children, bidding good-bye to people leaving this country to take up employment in England.  They must have heard of all the bread-winners who have gone on that trek to get a living, and it is not enough for anybody here or outside to say that large numbers of people have left this country for a brighter life, a more varied existence, in another country. Anybody desiring to face the facts knows the new conditions that people leaving this country have to face and there can be but one reason for it&mdash; the reason that poverty has been driving them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely 20 years after this House was set up, that is a frightful indictment of conditions here, and while we are discussing a vast sum of money here this evening, as we discussed it last week, in connection with our public services, it is very notable and very significant to find a blank silence regarding the matters I have mentioned on the part of Ministers in their contributions to this debate. Not alone are the bread-winners whose wives and children are left in this country going, but thousands of <Col N="2447" /> young marriageable men are leaving the country, and, at the same time, the schools are being closed and amalgamated for want of pupils and teachers are being degraded in their positions because they have no children to teach.  Surely that is such a disturbing state of affairs that it might have merited some attention in this House?  It has got a good deal of attention already from social workers and it has got a good deal of attention from the authorities of the Church in this country, who regard it as a very menacing position.</P>
    <P>What answer has the Government to give in regard to this very alarming position?  What is their attitude to it? Somebody said, on an occasion some years ago, that it was a natural sort of thing that we should always have emigration.  Do the Government think that it is rather a convenient way of solving unemployment to export our unemployed people and to allow them to become absorbed for the moment in whatever war employment is available in Great Britain?  Have they now any thought for the situation that is likely to arise when all people in that position are bound to return to this country to take up the threads of their existences here again?  What frightful problems will such a situation bring, and have our national leaders anything to say about it to-day?  I should have expected that the Minister for Local Government, who was so vocal last week, would have told us something about this matter, and, before this debate closes, we ought to hear some official statement on the attitude of the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet to this very disturbing and very alarming position.</P>
    <P>I should have expected, too, that we would have heard in the course of this discussion some recantation of this disastrous low-wage policy with which the Government has been so consistently associated.  Emergency Order No. 83 is the child and creature of the Minister for Finance.  It was first heard of in the Budget statement made by him, and anybody who desires to face the facts of the moment must admit that this anti-wage Order No. 83, <Col N="2448" /> this notorious order, has been entirely condemned by the circumstances that have arisen and that have been proved since it was put into force.  So great has been the clamour against this order, so manifest has been the injustice of this order, that late in the day the Government have been compelled to make some kind of watery and miserable attempt to reduce its operations by adopting the old device of referring its operation to a commission for examination in the light of hardships created in certain employment. What answer has the Minister to give to the inequality of a position which causes road workers in Cork county, who, in the opinion of the chairman of the Cork County Council, an honoured member of this House, do not earn more than 24/- a week, to be refused a very modest increase granted to them by that council, while the banking institutions of the country, with their millions in profits and dividends, have been able to get virtually whatever they demanded in the matter of increased charges from the people?</P>
    <P>How can the Minister justify such a position?  How can this self-styled poor man's Government justify such a position? How can they justify a position in which they have permitted the Electricity Supply Board, a semi-State concern, to charge increased prices for electricity, in many cases being paid by people in whose wages they have refused to permit any increase, because very many of the consumers of electricity are people who are victims of Emergency Powers Order No. 83, while, on the other hand, these people are bound to submit to the terms of an order which precludes any increase in their wages?  The newspapers have been permitted to increase their charges.  The profiteers in this country have, in large measure, gone unchecked, while the poor are being plundered, in many cases, in the price of commodities sold retail.  I want to say again that the Minister ought now to have the decency, as he was the author of this order and the person who introduced it in this House, to take the earliest step&mdash;the generous step&mdash;of completely withdrawing it, and of seeing <Col N="2449" /> that some measure of justice, as regards a reasonable increase in wages, must be permitted in view of the height that living costs have reached.</P>
    <P>There has been no reference, in the statements made from the Ministerial Benches, to the widespread unemployment that we have at the present time. Even allowing for all the people who have gone out of the country, our unemployment problem is increasing daily, and there is insecurity, to a most alarming degree, in whatever employment remains.  There is all this miserable, degrading and depressing situation surrounding the labour exchange queues and the pilgrimages to them to obtain assistance.  There are all the signs of decay in the whole national life of the country in that particular respect.  We have no evidence and no indication that there is any policy to meet that situation.  The Government must stand condemned&mdash; completely condemned&mdash;in the eyes of any honest or just section of the people as long as that condition of affairs remains.</P>
    <P>A position of that kind is causing, as it inevitably must cause, tremendous discontent in the country.  We see the working people getting steadily poorer. The position of the people who are drawing the only income they can get &mdash;from the labour exchanges&mdash;is becoming steadily more unenviable.  A teacher, speaking at a meeting of the school attendance committee in Cork City yesterday, said that for the first time in many years he saw a number of children coming barefooted to his school, and in the weather that we have had over the last few weeks.  He said the only remedy for a situation of that kind was to make an appeal to the children in more fortunate circumstances to give their worn boots or shoes to those who had none.  Another remedy he suggested was that the children who came to school with bad boots should take them off and dry them at the school fire and remain barefooted while attending class. Apart from the fact that a number of the children came to school with boots, the position of others revealed a condition of poverty that this teacher had <Col N="2450" /> not seen for some years.  Surely, this House cannot be insensible to a situation of that kind.  There is no good in talking in this House or outside of it about national unity, or in invoking shibboleths of that kind as long as we have this frightful injustice of inequality and insufficiency of the things that go to sustain life amongst large sections of our people.</P>
    <P>It is a disturbing and annoying situation to find that, while large numbers of our people are steadily being reduced to a more degrading degree of poverty, the records of this House contain a fairly large list of Government retainers, who are attached to commissions or boards or bodies, and are supplementing their allowances as members of the Oireachtas by fees drawn in that particular way.  I say that is a bad symptom at the present time, and that the Government are pursuing a wrong and a dangerous road in allowing a situation of that kind to develop: in allowing it to develop on the Turf Board and on the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and in allowing the same situation to exist in the case of the Agricultural Wages Board and of other organisations. I hope that, at least, we will have some gesture to indicate the ending of a situation that is a source of widespread comment in the country, and that is causing a good deal of discontent and dissatisfaction amongst people who are in very straitened circumstances at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health asked us to suggest where economies might be made and dared us to touch the Defence Estimate in our search for economy. I suggest to him that he might examine into the question as to how far his colleague, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, justifies his existence in this House.  I say it is ridiculous and absolutely ludicrous, in a small portion of this country, that we should have at the present time an office known as the Office for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  I think that if the Government had any sincerity or any desire to minimise in any way what the Minister for Finance so <Col N="2451" /> modestly described as the respectable sum of £13,000,000 when applying to the House for this Vote, that that would be stopped.  I think that at the present time in Great Britain, the headquarters of a vast Empire which is at war all over the world, there is no office of a Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  I certainly think that no defence whatever can be made for the retention of an office of that kind.  The fact, I think, cannot be questioned that whatever functions are discharged by the Minister in that office could be well and adequately discharged by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I observe that while there is a large decrease in the amount provided for unemployment assistance, there is an increase of about 50 per cent. in the amount to be afforded to the Tourist Board for the coming year.  I would have no objection to expenditure on matters of that kind in normal times, but at a time when we are told that transport may have to come to a standstill in a short time, I think expenditure of this kind would seem to require more justification than has been offered to the House for it.  The amount in question is not very considerable, but it is a strange sort of expenditure at the present time.</P>
    <P>I desire to add my plea to what has already been said by other Deputies, that some straightforward effort should be made for a trading agreement with Great Britain in regard to certain commodities.  I would like to know what policy the Government have in this connection.  Have efforts been made within the last 12 months to find a basis for a trading agreement in regard to the exchange of commodities? How often have they been made, and would the Minister say whether we are going to have an announcement that an effort of that kind will be made again in the immediate future?  I think there is a very good case for it. I believe there are many members of the House who have yet to be convinced that some useful ground could not be covered in that connection if a genuine effort were made, and made in the right spirit&mdash;with the desire to reach results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> There are many other matters that one might touch on, and that would be worthy of discussion, but I will conclude by asking the Minister to tell us what the official policy is in regard to the widespread emigration from this country, in regard to the continued low-wage policy in this country, in regard to the repressive measures that have been taken against wages in this country and, generally, in regard to what is apparent to anybody who wants to face the facts&mdash;the complete absence of any national lead from the Government in a time of national emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on the subject of supplies, particularly in reference to supplies of cotton, linen and canvas cloths.  There is a serious shortage in the country at the present time.  I in no way connect the Minister for Supplies with that shortage, but intend to put forward a few suggestions which may be helpful and may ease the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the war, in the cotton and linen industry, we had 2,000 people employed directly in weaving the necessary cloth.  At present there are only 1,000 and they are on half time.  Before the war, our supplies came from Ulster, Lancashire, France and the United States.  To all intents and purposes we are getting no yarn, either cotton or linen, from Ulster; we are only getting 15 per cent. of our pre-war supplies from Lancashire, and none from France, leaving the United States the only place open.  Last January the Irish Linen and Cotton Manufacturers' Association put forward a suggestion&mdash; they asked for accommodation of 100 tons per month in the bottoms of our ships, so that they could carry on the machinery and re-employ 1,000 men who had been paid off.  100 tons per month at that particular time would have re-employed the 1,000 paid off and continually employed the 1,000 engaged at present.  Unfortunately, however, since that date in last January, the supplies from Lancashire have been still further reduced, so that the position now is that, if the Government give accommodation for 125 tons per month, the Irish Linen and Cotton <Col N="2453" /> Manufacturers' Association will have their figure brought up to the pre-war standard of 2,000 men.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the linen and cotton trades, the clothing manufacturers, shirt manufacturers, sack and bag manufacturers, shoe manufacturers, mattress makers, the wholesale and retail drapery trade, the transport concerns are vitally concerned. The fact of the matter is that the wholesale clothiers, if they do not get linen and cotton cloth for linings and trimmings, cannot carry on, and in that trade alone there are 12,000 employed.  In any case, as a temporary measure, I strongly suggest that the wish expressed by the Irish Linen and Cotton Manufacturers' Association be granted, namely, that they be granted a tonnage in our boats of 125 tons per month.  I only suggest that as a temporary expedient.  There is a better solution.</P>
    <P>First of all, however, I want to emphasise one fact and one peculiarity to the industry in this country.  In England the cotton trade is completely isolated from the linen trade&mdash;in fact, in every other country except ours, the linen industry has no connection with the cotton.  In this country, the linen and cotton industries are dovetailed. In one loom they may be weaving linen and in the next one cotton, and possibly in the next loom it may be half cotton and half linen.  In the strict sense of the word, that means there is no such thing as a pure linen industry or a pure cotton industry, as you can either switch your machinery on to linen and stop any production of cotton, or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Last year, we sent out of this country the produce of 16,000 acres of flax.  We are giving a guarantee that we are going to send the produce of 25,000 acres of flax this year, and in return we have not yet got any promise from the Northern manufacturers or the British Government that we are to get any linen yarn in return.  I suggest to the Government that they take control of the produce of that 25,000 acres of flax, which, when converted, would give 2,810 tons of linen yarn.  Then we could bargain with the Northern <Col N="2454" /> Government or with the British Government for a supply of 1,500 tons of linen yarn.  If we get the 1,500 tons of linen yarn, we could keep all our looms going and keep the pre-war figure of 2,000 employed, with a definite gain in materials to the wholesale clothing industry, to the sack and bag people and to the other industries I have mentioned. Now, the permanent solution of this problem is that we install a preparation plant and a spinning plant for linen yarn to spin at least the very coarser yarn styled eights and right up to No. 36.  The fine yarns could be imported as they form only about 25 per cent. of the trade.</P>
    <P>Coming down to the bag and sack industry, we find ourselves in a very serious position, due to the shortage of jute.  We used to get our raw jute from Calcutta and the House will quite realise the difficulty of getting jute from Calcutta at the moment.  It is practically out of the question now. We have a substitute, and that is linen. If we use the coarser fibres of the linen yarn, we can get it spun, possibly, by Messrs.  Goodbody, as the linen industry and the jute industry are closely related.</P>
    <P>I think, with a few adjustments in the machinery and a few additional machines, Messrs.  Goodbody would be able to produce all the coarser linen yarns we need for sacks and bags.  I admit that, in normal times, the linen bag would be dearer than the jute one, but I venture to say that, at the moment, the linen bag is no dearer than the jute on account of the scarcity and the impossibility of importing jute.  I suggest that we use our coarser linen fibre for the manufacture of substitute bags for jute bags.  The same would apply to ropes and twines.  Flax can again be used as a foundation in these cases, to replace sisal or other fibre used in the manufacture of ropes and twine.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to deal with is that of wool.  We have two large establishments in this country manufacturing worsted yarns.  These two firms are fully equipped and have installed combing and preparation plants.  Wool from Australia and New Zealand is <Col N="2455" /> generally used in the worsted industry in this country, but we have a certain percentage of South Down wool and finer qualities, which could be used by Mahoney's, of Blarney, and Dwyer's factory in Cork.  I suggest that the finer qualities of wool be not passed for exportation until examined, graded and certified that they could not be used in those two Cork factories.</P>
    <P>About a year and a half ago, I had reason to speak on a very important matter&mdash;the installation of a plant which would produce potato flour.  I spent at least three-quarters of an hour elaborating the importance of installing such a plant, showing that it had been installed in England and that 25 per cent. of potato flour could be mixed with the wheaten flour.  I again repeat that we have a certain amount of machinery in this country, and that we could at least steam potatoes.  We may not have the drying plant but we have the crushing plant, and I suggest we should pay particular attention to that.</P>
    <P>One other suggestion is this, which I mean to be helpful.  As I visualise the future, I believe this war will last for from four to seven years, and I think that transport as we know it to-day will not be with us in four or five years' time.  We will be forced back on our own vehicles, and we should see that the native timber for building railway trucks, wagons and carts is preserved.</P>
    <P>I have only one comment to make, having listened to a few speeches made in this House.  I have known Deputy O'Higgins for a long time.  I was astonished at the speech he delivered, especially in regard to the manner in which he dealt with the subject of defence. I cannot understand how he can justify his attitude to-day on the subject of defence with his position on the Defence Conference.  I would ask the Deputy from Cavan who spoke about the agricultural prices prevailing in Ulster in comparison with the agricultural prices here, to compare the price of wheat in this country with the price paid in England.  Possibly <Col N="2456" /> he would not then be so severe in his criticism.  I do not want to be patting anybody on the back.  Probably I criticise the Government more than any other Deputy on this side of the House, but I do say that, in 1939, a Government that had 275,000 acres of wheat grown deserves to be patted on the back, and that the farmers deserve much more to be patted.  If we had adopted the policy outlined by certain Deputies ours would be about the most humiliating position any nation was ever placed in, namely, that of living in a land that could grow wheat with any country, while we had to beg wheat from a country that was absolutely steeped in war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies have referred to the alarming increase in this Estimate, and I would like to add my voice to theirs because, there is no doubt about it, there has been a gradual and progressive increase in these Estimates over a series of years. One thing I think the Government have overlooked is the precarious position of a very great number of taxpayers. There are people who draw a certain proportion of their income from abroad.  Many have lost that income. There are others, representing all sorts of interests, whose position has been profoundly changed.  People who have been paying taxes now find themselves in the position that they do not know where they are going to find the money for the taxes.  I think the Government have not paid sufficient attention to that matter when framing the Estimates that are now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the wheat position.  At the present time there appear to be three factors that have upset the wheat calculations, and I am surprised that the Government have not told us quite frankly what has produced the difficulty.  I understand the estimated supply represented a shortage of 100,000 tons&mdash; now reduced to 80,000 tons.  Surely the person who made the estimate for the Government ought to have estimated it on a conservative basis.  It is very difficult to understand how such an error could have crept in.  We have heard that some of the farmers are feeding grain to their stock.  I do not <Col N="2457" /> claim to have very much knowledge about farming, but I did ask one farmer about it and he admitted that and said, &ldquo;We could not leave our beasts to starve.&rdquo;  I wonder did the Government consider the possibility of that occurring?</P>
    <P>Another factor which apparently has cut down the supply is the unfortunate strikes that occurred in the ships that are bringing goods from abroad. I do not suppose the Government should be blamed for that, but they ought to look into it very closely.</P>
    <P>The present system of rationing for many commodities is most unjust and most inequitable.  Some traders seem to have customers and no supplies; others have supplies and no customers. Is it any wonder, with such a system in vogue, that a lot of goods seem to get into the black market and are retailed back to the people, having passed through several hands? I do not know whether they are camouflaged as having been brought in over the Border or what it is, but certainly anybody who is prepared to pay two or three times the ordinary price can get anything he wants.  It seems we would all agree that the most just and the most equitable way, when supplies run short, is that some rationing system should prevail whereby people would get commodities according to backs and stomachs, and not according to purse.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to turf.  We had a long explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on the turf question. We were practically told that it is only people who bought turf from a coal merchant in the city here who would have any remedy for bad turf.  A lot of the turf got through the parish councils has been very poor, and I would suggest to the Minister that some effort ought to be made during the present national emergency to get turf on a proper basis as a permanent fuel in this country.  What is wrong at the present time is that most grates or ranges that are constructed for burning coal will not burn turf satisfactorily, especially wet, unsuitable turf.  I would suggest to the Government that they should try to produce <Col N="2458" /> a supply of good turf that would, at any rate, be a great deal drier than the turf we get at present.  Otherwise, it simply means that when coal is available you will not be able to dispose of turf, even if you put money on top of it, or if you were to give it away.</P>
    <P>Turning to the industrial side, I think everybody knew there was a war coming.  The Government knew that, too.  As to where and when and how, I think they were perhaps no more at sea than some other people.  The laying in of stocks was an elementary precaution. To my mind, the Government were faced with a radical change in their policy, which they were very slow to make.  We had been going through a period when the Government, very properly, were trying to promote a number of industries.  To support those industries, they put on tariffs and quotas and import licences.  Before import licences were granted, letters had to be obtained from the manufacturers to the effect that they could not supply the goods.  That, during the period when the industries were being fostered, was probably very commendable, but there came a time when a radical change was called for. Most of the industries that had been established could manufacture only at a certain rate.  That rate was certainly not calculated to supply the demand of the distributive section in the country who were trying to lay in stocks.  The position was that there was a manufacturer or a small group of manufacturers in each of the industries.</P>
    <P>They were manufacturing only at a very slow rate&mdash;perhaps, to be fair to them, I should say a peace-time rate. England was still an export market, and supplies could be got from there and from America.  The distributive section was faced with quotas and import licences.  The consequence was that proper stocks were not laid in. Comparing this war with the war in 1914, the position is that, while we have more manufacturing capacity, the distributive capacity was not made use of to the fullest extent, so that I am afraid we lost on the swings what we gained on the roundabouts.  Another point in that connection is that, although the Government has now taken <Col N="2459" /> off a number of those restrictions, nobody seems to know for how long they are off.  Are they off for the duration, or for a period after that, or what is the position?  Probably the Minister will tell us that he cannot make up his mind.  Well, if he cannot make up his mind, the people who are endeavouring to supply the country's needs cannot make up their minds either, and I suppose the country will have to do without a whole lot of things in regard to which, if the Government gave a clear lead, it would be in a very much better position.</P>
    <P>I should like too to refer to the fact that the Government seems to wait until the very last moment to do anything. We are told that the wheat is there, and, as a measure of precaution, the barley in the hands of distillers and maltsters is not allowed to be used, causing great dislocation in that particular trade.  The Deputy who preceded me talked about potato flour. Nobody seems to know why the Government did not make some experiments with putting potato flour into the bread.  We do not know what the objections are, and the Government ought to tell us.  We have a surplus of potatoes, and at least potatoes would be very much better than nothing.  We heard some of the farmer Deputies complaining that the potatoes ought to be taken off the farmers' hands. Surely, by this time the Government ought to have made up their minds as to whether the wheat can be&mdash;I will not say &ldquo;adulterated&rdquo;, that is an unfortunate expression&mdash;mixed with potato flour.  At the earliest possible moment they ought to find out whether that is practicable, because certainly it would result in a very substantial improvement of the situation.  When the alcohol factories, were put up, surely somebody ought to have foreseen that, in a time of crisis like the present, we might have to eat the potatoes instead of making alcohol out of them.  Another extraordinary matter is that it is only a short time ago since we gave a sort of blessing to the idea that the Electricity Supply Board should use peat for generating further supplies of electricity.  If the <Col N="2460" /> Electricity Supply Board were at present in full blast supplying electricity from one of the bogs, I can imagine that an agitation would be very soon in progress to get that stopped, and to go back to something that is leaving the country without giving any notice at all of its departure, namely, the water of the rivers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that, when we used to export cattle from our grass lands, we heard many complaints about the uneconomic use of those lands.  Now, we are exporting men, women and cattle.  I think some of the people of this country would be in a very bad way were it not for the substantial remittances sent back by those who have gone across the water.  The Government have set up a Department of Supplies and they seem to be congratulating themselves that everything possible has been done to get supplies. Let me take the analogy of a business firm and compare this country with a business firm.  After all, this country is just an aggregation of businesses. What would one think if he heard that a firm, say a manufacturing firm, had only two possible sources of supply left and that the purchasing agents or the directors, whatever you like to call them, who were in charge of the business, had quarrelled with both those sources of supply?  That is the position of this country.  I think the Minister for Supplies never saw the people who hand out the goods on the other side.  I do not know how far that applies to America, but certainly it is neither good for business nor for the country.</P>

      <P>I was not a bit surprised when the Minister indicated that there will be increased taxation. What is the hall-mark of the Fianna Fáil policy all during its period of office except increased taxation? How can we expect a reduction of taxation when we have so many wild, extravagant and foolish policies carried on by the Government?  Most of their proposals have brought heavy taxation in their train and we are now reaping the harvest of all their foolish ideas. We are now landed in a vicious circle and I believe that the present Ministry <Col N="2461" /> are not able to take us out of our troubles.  They have got us into a vicious circle of red tape and to unwind us out of it will require the efforts of greater men than we have on the Front Bench opposite.</P>
      <P>One thing is certain, and that is, that it has been proved that doles and sops never made a nation of free men. We have learned much since we got control of our affairs and I hope we have forgotten a good deal, too; I hope we have forgotten a good deal of what was said in the past.  I hope the lessons we have learned will bear fruit in the minds of those who so foolishly brought about the blunders of the last ten years.  Unfortunately for this country, it has been run not as a small State but as a budding empire.  It would seem to me that the Government took their ideas from the people across the water, with the result that we are up to our ears in want and misery.</P>
      <P>Many of our present troubles are due to the Government's very foolish extravagance in trying to imitate others.  They seem to have forgotten that the historic Irish nation should be well able to lay its own foundations without looking outside its shores for any ideas.  Is the Minister satisfied that his ideas to-day conform to the ideas that Arthur Griffith and the other Sinn Féin leaders of 25 years ago preached?  He sits over there a sadly disillusioned man.  I agree that many good things have happened since this State came into being, but at the moment we are fast going down the slippery slope, largely because of the incompetence and the lack of vision of the people who now occupy the Front Benches of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my firm conviction that nothing but a revolution will alter the existing conditions in this country and put us back on the road we aimed at years ago.  I hope that revolution will not be a bloody one.  I believe such a revolution could be brought about, but big men will be required to fill the gap and such men are not on the Government Benches to-day.  We need a big upheaval to bring our expenditure back to a reasonable plane and to reduce taxation to a level in keeping with the ability of the people to pay. It is time that we realised that we are <Col N="2462" /> on the wrong road and that we have reached a national crisis.</P>
    <P>Honesty is being killed in the struggle to survive.  Money never made a nation; it is the spirit of the people that counts, but unfortunately for our country money seems to be the whole consideration and at the moment nothing else counts.  The poor are being overlooked and the wealthy people are to-day in the saddle, and they are as firmly entrenched as they were 25 or 26 years ago.  Does not that prove that we who took part in the national struggle have definitely failed to do what we set out to achieve, and that is to make the Irish nation free, independent and Christian?  What have we to-day?  Is it not a fact that instead of being a healthy, Christian nation, we are nothing but a nation of racketeers and place-hunters?  The whole national effort has been set aside and the survival of the fittest seems to be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a better spirit amongst the people.  A large number of our young people are as irresponsible as they can be.  Some of them do not give two hoots what happens to the country so long as they can get something for nothing or something at the expense of someone else.  Pleasure-seeking is the order of the day.  All round the country we never had a more irresponsible spirit than we have to-day.  Comfort and pleasure are the aim of all.  That is the position at a time when the country is confronted with a situation of the most serious description.</P>
    <P>There has been too much bungling on the part of the Government, too much hypocritical nonsense preached and no proper headline set by the men at the top.  All that is required is an honest endeavour, hard work and a definite lead by the Government and, indeed, by the whole Dáil.  We are asking the people to do this, that and the other; we are telling the farmers that if they do not till their land it will be taken from them, but all the time we refrain from giving them a proper lead.  Was there any lead given by the Government?  There was not. What did we do to show that we were genuine in our appeal to the people? <Col N="2463" /> We imposed heavy taxation on people who have been taxed to the hilt for years.  We have put heavier burdens upon them.  We brought them into a struggle with an Empire and we found ourselves in misery.  Then the Government made a patched-up peace and we were told it was a great victory. We were told we had whipped John Bull.  The fact was that we were really lashing our own farmers and the welts are on their backs to-day and will be there for many years to come.</P>
    <P>In my opinion an honest dictatorship would be far better for this country than a bungling Government. Although I hate the idea of dictatorship, I think such a thing would help to take us out of the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves to-day. I appeal to the Taoiseach to form a new Ministry, a decent Ministry. We find it difficult day after day to keep our patience with a Minister such as the Minister for Supplies, who does nothing but bungle.  When a Deputy asks for information here the Minister snaps at him and then tells him things which he knows are deliberate nonsense, all in order to evade his responsibilities.  Many of our people are over-burdened with misery and many of our young people are leaving the country.  They are flying almost into the face of death and yet they prefer that rather than face the position at home.</P>
    <P>In order to save agriculture the Government will have to float a national loan.  What does anything matter if the nation goes down?  What can money do if misery and famine stalk the land?  We must feed our people. It is the duty of the Minister for Finance to put our farmers in such a position that they will be able to supply the requirements of the nation and so save the people from extinction through starvation.  Go, at least, and float an honest loan, and if you do not do that, at least take the burden of rates, rents and taxes off their shoulders for the present agricultural season.  We are asking these people to do so much at such cost to themselves, and does not everybody know that what we are <Col N="2464" /> asking them to do is entirely beyond their capacity?  Of course, the city mentality is to say: &ldquo;Do not mind the farmer, he is too damn well off, and we always knew it.&rdquo;  I think, however, that it will be found now that the shoe will pinch in another direction.</P>
    <P>The farmer is as patriotic as any other man in this country, but he has seen too much place-hunting and racketeering going on in this country during the last eight or ten years, when he was the butt of every Tom, Dick and Harry, when he could not get even the cost of production, and when he had endless rates and taxes imposed upon him, and the sheriff put at his door because he had not the money to pay and because he was not able to borrow it.  He could not go to the bank and get the money.  Those are the people to whom we are crying and sighing now, begging them to take us out of the rut.  They have often taken us out of the rut before, and, thanks be to God, they will take us out of the rut now and produce the food that is required for the nation, but you will have to pay the farmer, and if you do not pay him you will not get the food, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>It is only right to tell the Minister that he is treating the farmers meanly and rottenly.  As regards the wheat position, I say definitely and without fear of contradiction that one of the most unhappy sights to be seen in the country at the present moment is the small amount of wheat that has been sown all over the country.  Why is that?  It is because the Government spent six months quibbling and niggling about an increase of 5/- a barrel for wheat.  Then, when the season was almost out, the Minister said that he would give the farmer what was wanted.  The time to have done that was last August, so as to give the farmer a chance to make his land ready for tilling, but there was not the slightest effort to do that until it was too late.  You have all these inspectors from the different Departments going down the country, prying and seeking out who was doing this, that, and the other, but the farmer always did his job right and he did his job right without any need for inspectors.  If you <Col N="2465" /> pay the farmer a reasonable price, he will produce the goods, but you will not pay him, although you pay everybody else.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Government should recognise that the people are up in arms against them and that they are fed up with them, and the people who are most incensed against the Government are the people who were formerly their loyal supporters.  Go down the country to your political clubs that you think so much about, and ask the members of those clubs what is the position to-day, and they will soon tell you that you are living too damn well-off in Dublin.  I see that in a case of national emergency in the City of Dublin people are to be evacuated down to Meath.  Around my own part of the country a large number of people are to be shipped down there, although we have not enough for ourselves, and there seems to be no provision for supplying them with mugs, tea, or anything else.  That is the type of government that would sicken anybody, and it is the type of government that will land us in the lurch in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There is only one hope for this country, and that is to give back to the people some of the responsibilities that you took from them eight or nine years ago.  Go back to the parish council, go back to Muintir na Tíre that the great Father Hayes has founded.  Give the people of this country full responsibility and do not be niggling and quibbling about it.  If you give them back their full responsibilities you will not need the services of all these place-hunters who are seeking jobs.  The parish councils will do the job, if you give them official responsibility, signed by the Government.  Do not be asking people to resurrect this, that, and the other kind of thing.  That is no use.  You must give back their responsibility to the people to settle things in their own way.  Father Hayes's Muintir na Tíre organisation is showing the light, and it is the only hope of this country. Why, then, are the Government sidetracking it, and why are they afraid to face up to this matter?  If you give to the parish councils the responsibility which is rightly theirs you will raise in <Col N="2466" /> the hearts and minds of every young and old man in this country the proper spirit.  At the moment, the only idea they have is to survive as best they can, but give them the responsibility of doing something for themselves and there will be a new life and spirit in them, the spirit that animated us 25 years ago to do and dare all to save our country, the spirit that brought us through terrible times, and we to-day are a glorious and a free people because of that spirit, and not because of money.  We fought a revolution without a penny, and fought it in poverty and misery.  There is a revolution here to-day also, and I ask this Government and this House to give the people back their responsibilities, and to ask them to do for themselves what we here cannot do for them.  Let us ask them to tackle the job themselves, and I am certain that they will do the job much better and be more hardworking and self-sacrificing in the doing of it than as a result of anything the Government may do.</P>
    <P>We are giving money to all classes of place-holders to-day, and all that these people want is just to hold their jobs and to see if the jobs are pensionable. These people do not want a temporary job; it must be a permanent job, and pensionable, if possible, and every Department of State has brought in a horde of new officials, with the result that half the people of this country are living in luxury and grandeur at the expense of the other half, whom they are holding down and who are a far grander people, namely, the agricultural community.  Why are our farmers' sons coming up to Dublin and going across to England?  It is because they cannot get a living in their own homes. Is it not a shame for any Minister to shout about nationality and patriotism when these things are allowed to happen?  Why did we fight, and what did we win freedom for?  It was thought that we would be able to bring our people back to the land from the large cities and from England and from America, so that they could be placed on the land of this country.  What is wrong with the land?  The thing that is wrong is that you have taken away the reserves that left us happy in the <Col N="2467" /> past.  In former days every farmer had a nest-egg in the old stocking; he had that even in the worst days of the British regime.  What has he to-day? Nothing but bank debts.  Was it for this that the great Pearse died?  What would he think, if he could only come back here and see what has happened, and see the great, noble nine on the Front Bench opposite sitting there smiling, with their big high powered cars, their large salaries, and pensions when they go out of office?  I say that I am horrified and disgusted, but I am proud that I am able to stand here in an Irish Parliament and say what I want to say.  I am disgusted with these people over there, who have fooled the finest type of people in this country, the agricultural community.  They formed political clubs and so on all over the country, but out of these has come misery, and out of that misery will come revolution, and out of that revolution will come the Irish-Ireland idea that we fought for and that our comrades died for.  It is the Irish people by themselves who are saving this country, and not the Government. If you do not give a lead to the people, then get out, and, if you do not get out, the Irish people will put you out.</P>

      <P>In the course of the discussion on this Vote, the rights and interests of various sections of the community have been stressed by various Deputies.  The claims of the farmer, the worker, the industrialist, the consumer have all been stressed and put forward.  I should like to say a few words on behalf of the unfortunate taxpayer, because, whatever the future may hold for this country, if the financial policy of the Government, as embodied in this Vote on Account and outlined in the Book of Estimates that has been put into our hands, is given practical effect to, there can be no doubt that the taxpayer of this country is going to bear a crushing and crippling burden in the coming year, and we will probably find ourselves in the position that, head for head of the population of this country, we will be over-taxed to an extent greater than the ordinary individual in Great Britain is taxed at <Col N="2468" /> a time when a great Empire is fighting for its very existence.  We will find ourselves in that position without any return for our money.  It is that aspect of this Vote on Account that I wish to stress because there is at least an opportunity at this time to warn the Government against their policy of further and increased taxation. When the taxpayer is spoken of, of course most people think that it is the income-tax payer that is referred to.  For all Governments the income-tax payer has been fair game. He has been pursued and harried by the present Government and their officers during the last ten years in a way that, I suppose, no Government in any country have pursued taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on a Finance Bill some years ago I made an appeal to the then Minister for Finance to deal fairly with income-tax payers, for the reason that, if the ordinary people who pay taxes were assured that they would get a fair deal in the matter of their income tax and in the manner in which it was extracted from them, there would be a better chance of encouraging the growth of a spirit amongst taxpayers so that they would perhaps, not gladly or cheerfully, but at all events willingly pay their taxes honestly in the belief that the burden was being properly and fairly spread amongst all sections of the community. Now I think that the present Government have regarded that section of taxpayers known as income-tax payers as fair game, because they are politically of no importance to them.  If we are to have an increase in the income-tax this year, as was foreshadowed some time ago in a speech by one of the Ministers, then I think we will have a very serious situation indeed.  When I speak of the incidence of the burden of income-tax, I am not speaking on behalf merely of that comparatively small number of people in the community who do pay income-tax, but of the general taxpayers who indirectly pay income-tax. Practically every section of the community, from the old age pensioner up to the richest member of Fianna Fáil, <Col N="2469" /> pays income-tax, however disguised it may be.</P>
    <P>The last Government were attacked at every cross roads because they reduced the old age pension.  The present Government are far too astute politicians to reduce the old age pension directly, but anybody who has experience of people trying to get their old age pensions knows the methods adopted by the present Government to extract taxation from the old age pensioners. Every device of an administrative kind is resorted to in order to create a fictitious income for those people who have claims to old age pensions.  For that reason I say that even old age pensioners have to pay their income-tax.  It is not merely that the ordinary group of citizens who do pay income-tax will have an increased burden to bear directly, but the unemployed will feel the impact very heavily indeed in further increased taxation.</P>
    <P>Whatever the future may hold for this country, it is quite clear that there will be a very serious increase and a greatly accelerated increase in unemployment in the forthcoming months. A businessman told me yesterday that he could not see how his business could last under present circumstances more than the next two or three months.  The Government have recently developed a new technique, a technique of pessimism, and over the radio, in speeches in the country, when they do make speeches, and in the Press, when they do manifest themselves in the Press, they are full of gloom and pessimism and they call on the people to make sacrifices.  I may say, in parenthesis, that our people have readily responded to every appeal made to them by the Government and by other Deputies in this House to make sacrifices in the period of emergency through which we have gone.  A tribute ought to be paid to the poorest section of the community who have put up with the greatest hardships at the hands of the Government during the last few years.  But when they appeal to the people to make sacrifices, they themselves ought to give the lead in the matter of sacrifice, and I think it can be stated without the possibility <Col N="2470" /> of contradiction that the Government have made no single sacrifice in connection with the effort to keep the country going.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Book of Estimates which has been circulated, we find that there is not a single item in the entirety of that bill for nearly £40,000,000 where any effort has been made, or, at least, any substantial effort, to effect any single economy. They are running this State in the same way as Fianna Fáil ran it after they came into power, running it solely for their political ends.  At a time when we are facing the worst period of the war, every single service created by the Fianna Fáil Government in order to curry favour and gain votes is still being run at the expense of the suffering taxpayers.  The Government that asked poor people to do with half an ounce of tea per week, that asked them to put up with less bread and with increased unemployment, have made no single contribution to the general sacrifice that is asked of the community.</P>
    <P>We have had an appeal made here by Deputy Cosgrave, supplemented eloquently this evening by Deputy Murphy, that a genuine effort should be made to enter into a trade agreement with Great Britain.  Have the Government made any sacrifice of their political faces in that connection in order to secure that very desirable end?  Have they not rather tried to &ldquo;cash in&rdquo; for political purposes on the anti-British feeling that is fostered by some people in this country? There is only one way in which such a treaty, call it what you like, a trade treaty or other treaty, can be made between this country and Great Britain.  There is only one way in which the advantages we have to offer to Great Britain can be &ldquo;cashed in.&rdquo; There is only one way in which we can save this country in the forthcoming period of stress and strain, and that is by some members of the Government&mdash;if possible, the Head of the Government&mdash;taking their political courage in their hands, meeting English Ministers face to face and making a bargain for the benefit of the country.  There is no use in sending <Col N="2471" /> civil servants.  When we were the Government we had experience of the futility of bargains between civil servants on both sides.  No conclusions, or no agreement advantageous to this country, can ever be reached in that way.  It is only on broad political lines, by Ministers on one side facing Ministers on the other side across a table to settle the big issues and the broad claims and to decide the advantages that have to be given and exchanged, that anything can be obtained.  Do you think that sacrifice would be made by the Government? They ask poor people to make sacrifices, to do with a little tea, a little sugar, less bread, and practically no fuel while facing continued and continuous unemployment.</P>
    <P>The present Ministers would not sacrifice their political future or the votes they might lose.  If they had the courage to go to England to face English Ministers across a table to gain a trade treaty it would be of advantage to this country in a time of strain, stress and emergency.  We have had it pointed out in the course of the discussion by Deputy Cosgrave, by Deputy O'Sullivan and by Deputy O'Higgins that the staffs of Government offices have been largely increased. It will probably be the experience of Deputies who do not belong to the Government Party that not a single person was able to get a temporary appointment in Government Departments unless backed by Ministerial influence in the claim for such an appointment.  The taxpayer is paying for votes for Fianna Fáil in a time of war, and is being asked to bear a burden which he is unable to bear. Ordinary people are asked to make sacrifices, which they would willingly make if it were for the nation's good, and would more willingly bear if they knew that all sections of the community were bearing their share.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that has been exercising my mind for some time past, as one who is not in any way an expert on finance, is the extraordinary fashion in which the British people are giving their savings to the British Government for the prosecution of <Col N="2472" /> their war effort.  I have not heard of any single appeal to the Irish people from any Minister in this Government to exercise thrift, or to give their savings to the Government.  All that this Government knows how to do is to spend, and to get money from the people to spend.  There has been no effort to create either an opinion or a situation in which thrift could be advocated or fostered.  I presume that at some time or other this war will end and, when it does end, we will be in the position of having bankrupted this country, having no assets in the way of savings to fall back upon.</P>
    <P>The grasping hand of the Government is ever out, but there is no scheme by which the money of the country could be placed at the disposal of the Government, in such a way that it will be there in the form of savings, or that it will be spent or used by the Government for necessary purposes during the period of the emergency, and be available afterwards to the people in a time of further want.  We are going to have, as far as I can see in the forthcoming year, nothing but increasing and crushing taxation, with no constructive policy, with no effort whatever for thrift, or to spread the burden equitably between various classes of the community.</P>
    <P>Side by side with increased taxation we have this country a happy hunting ground for people who are making fortunes surreptitiously in the black market.  I know that it is very easy to exaggerate the activities of people operating on that very fertile soil, now popularly known as the black market, but from what has been brought to my notice by businessmen, the position appears to be this, that in every essential industry, and in every business that has been trying to carry on in very difficult times, it is practically impossible to get supplies, and will be completely impossible to get any supplies in the next few months, from ordinary sources.  I think Deputy Dockrell stated to-night that on the other hand people could get supplies of anything they wanted in the black market.  That is the position and it is being fostered at the expense of ordinary traders who pay rates and <Col N="2473" /> taxes.  There are people now going into business who were never engaged in business in this country.  I am told that there are people coming down from Belfast to exploit the needs of business, industry and trade.  People engaged in the motor trade are having a very stiff and a very difficult time. They are trying to keep the industry going in order to keep employment going, but I am informed that individuals who have no connection with the motor trade are purchasing motor cars at what are known as &ldquo;list prices&rdquo; from the motor trade.  Motor traders cannot sell motor cars under the list prices without incurring certain penalties from their Federation, but private individuals can charge three, four or five times the list prices to people whose business makes it necessary for them to have motor cars at any price.</P>
    <P>The same is happening with regard to motor tyres.  Motor tyres that were bought at comparatively low prices, for £3 or £4, are now being offered for sale at £20.  One individual told me within the last few days that a proposition was put up to him, in the stress in which he found himself in connection with a truck for which he wanted tyres, that it would cost £200 or £250 for tyres to keep that truck on the road.  I wonder what the Government are going to do about that situation.  They have done nothing so far.  If one looks at the newspapers it will be seen that they are full of advertisements for that class of article.  If the Government are going to shift taxation on to the people, if they are not going to bring about unemployment&mdash;and they will undoubtedly bring it about if they increase taxation any more than it is at present&mdash;and if they are going to call <Col N="2474" /> on the people to make further sacrifices, then they should give a lead and a headline in the way of sacrifice.  The first thing they should do is, either to take the Book of Estimates and to go through it, not with a pruning knife, but if I might mix the metaphor, to cut right into it, and to cut down all schemes that are not essential, in order that expenditure could be cut down instead of increased.  In that way ordinary people would be enabled to face the difficult situation which now faces them, and unemployment would not be increased.  People who never knew what unemployment was might not then be faced with the grim spectre that faces them, unless something is done in the way of economy on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>Speaking at a dinner which was held in the early part of December last, the present Minister for Supplies gave his point of view with regard to the war in this sentence: &ldquo;Between the irretrievable past and the unknown future lies the unattractive present&rdquo;.  It is proper on an occasion like this to examine how far the Minister who made that comment is himself responsible for seeing first of all that certain of the defects of the past were unretrieved, how far he is responsible for making the present so unattractive, and how far he is deficient in his duty in not being able to put before the House some better forecast of the future than he has done.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, March 12th.</P>
