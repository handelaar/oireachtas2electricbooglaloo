      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether any decision has been come to in the matter of 91 Donore Terrace, Claim No. 411/1191 (5); and when the money will be paid over to the occupier, who is at present living in a flat pending a decision.</P>

      <P>Two applications under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, were lodged with my Department by the owner of the premises referred to in the question.  The first application was lodged on the 13th January, 1942, and related to the contents of the house and expenditure on alternative accommodation.  An offer of compensation in respect of this application was made on the 26th May, 1942; the offer was accepted and payment was made on the 19th June.  The second application&mdash;which was concerned with the damage to the premises&mdash;was not lodged until the 28th February, 1942.  It is at present under examination and will be disposed of as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in regard to the second application but it is not a question of damage.  There is a hole left there in which there are a few bricks and some mortar which might or might not belong to that house or a <Col N="486" /> house 50 yards away.  I should like to suggest that the claim is one in respect of a total loss and the Minister should be able to make up his mind fairly quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a demand exists amongst the farmers in South Sligo, in the neighbourhood of Tubbercurry, for the drainage of Tubbercurry river and the lands adjacent to it; that a considerable area of land along the banks of the river is for long periods under water to the depth of six feet when the river overflows its banks; that the condition of the river prevents neighbouring farmers from draining or fencing their lands; that, owing to <Col N="487" /> flooding at Allyara cemetery road and the unsuitability of the bridge there, the road leading to the cemetery is often under water up to the height of the cemetery wall; and whether, in these circumstances, he will take steps to carry out the drainage scheme proposed by the landholders of the locality concerned.</P>

      <P>The river to which the Deputy refers was included in proposals for the drainage of the River Moy and its tributaries, but these proposals were deferred on the setting up of the Drainage Commission.  As has been indicated in the Dáil on several occasions recently, the carrying out of future drainage schemes must await the enactment of legislation arising out of the report of the Drainage Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">

      <P>Supplies of asbestos slates are very limited, but the applicants for housing grants to whom the Deputy refers should be able to obtain other roofing materials of which adequate quantities are available.  No part of the small stocks of asbestos slates held by the Departments mentioned can be allocated in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that the Dublin coal merchants are selling wood logs to small shopkeepers at 60/- per ton, which price does not permit of the shopkeepers retailing at the fixed price of 4½d. per stone; and whether he will arrange to have small shopkeepers supplied from the merchants <Col N="488" /> at the same price at which the bellmen purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Dublin coal merchants are selling firewood at 60/- per ton retail, which is the maximum price fixed by Order.</P>
      <P>Owing to the position in regard to supplies, it is not practicable to place on these merchants the onus of supplying small shopkeepers at wholesale prices.  While I appreciate the difficulty of such shopkeepers, desiring to retail firewood, in locating alternative sources of supply on more favourable terms, this is the only course open to them at present.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the existence of difficulty in regard to the supply position does not justify the sale of firewood at prices in excess of those fixed by Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin (for Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he has inquired <Col N="489" /> if that portion of the income-tax which is deducted from the wages of Irish nationals employed in Great Britain under the post-war credit system will, in fact, be refunded to such workers if and when they return to this country; whether he is aware that Irish workers receive no credit when they return to Ireland for the contributions which they pay into the British Unemployment Insurance and National Health Insurance Funds; and whether, in view of the latter fact, he will state the result of any representations which he made in regard to the income-tax deductions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question I have no reason to believe that the portion of income-tax which is deducted from the wages of Irish nationals employed in Great Britain will not be credited to these workers after the conclusion of the war whether they are in Great Britain or returned to this country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, reciprocal arrangements exist between this country and Great Britain under which National Health Insurance Benefit may be paid to residents of this country in respect of contributions paid for them in Great Britain, but there are no such arrangements for the purpose of Unemployment Insurance.  The position with regard to Unemployment Insurance is that benefit may not be drawn by a worker on the basis of contributions paid by him except while he resides in the country where the contributions were paid.  Efforts have been made from time to time to establish reciprocal arrangements for the purpose of Unemployment Insurance so that workers returning to this country might get benefit on the basis of contributions paid in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa.</i>  In this connection, I have nothing to add to the reply given to a Dáil question on this matter on the 20th November, 1941.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will say what arrangements he has made with regard to the distribution of supplies of binder twine to retailers for the coming season; and whether farmers will get their full requirements for the harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not control the distribution of binder twine, but is collaborating with the distributors of the commodity to ensure that the distribution of available supplies will be as equitable as possible.</P>
      <P>Retailers of the twines, in the aggregate, are being provided with 75 per cent. of last year's sales of the twine.  The Emergency Powers (Unused Binder Twine) Order, 1942, restricts the use of binder twine to mechanical binders, and it is hoped that this restriction will result in an increase in the amount available for actual harvesting operations sufficient to meet substantially the requirements of farmers for the coming harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer questions 9 to 13 together, as they relate to the same object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This post of chief medical adviser to the Department was not filled by promotion because, in view of its outstanding <Col N="493" /> importance from the point of view of the public health, it is desired to secure the services of the best person available, whether already in the Civil Service or not.</P>
    <P>The conditions of appointment to the position were determined after full consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service Commissioners. The qualifications laid down differ materially from those prescribed on the occasion of the last vacancy in the post, firstly as to professional qualifications and secondly as to age. As regards professional qualifications and experience, it was deemed desirable to prescribe a higher standard than previously and that standard was fixed without reference to the qualifications of the existing medical staff.</P>
    <P>As to professional qualifications: Each candidate must: (a) be a medical practitioner of not less than ten years' standing and be registered in the Register of Medical Practitioners for Ireland; (b) possess one or more higher professional qualifications; (c) possess a registered diploma in public health or an equivalent degree in sanitary science or State medicine; (d) be of high administrative capacity and have comprehensive knowledge and practical experience to enable him/her to advise on all matters concerning preventive and curative medicine and other functions of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in relation to the administration of public health in general.</P>
    <P>As to professional experience: Each candidate must possess: (a) satisfactory administrative and organising experience; (b) varied practical experience, which must include (i) satisfactory practical experience in general public health work, and (ii) satisfactory practical experience in one or more of the following&mdash;General practice, hospital work, dispensary district work under a local authority, laboratory work and research.  When returning their completed application forms candidates are requested to give particulars of any published work issued by them dealing with some branch of medical science.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> As regards age, I may point out that a civil servant who has served ten years may retire or may be required to retire upon reaching 60 years of age.  In order that he should have pensionable status at 60 years of age he must be appointed before reaching 50 years.  Bearing not only this consideration in mind, but also the desirability of leaving the field of competition as wide as possible the maximum age limit was fixed at 48 years.</P>
    <P>As to the members of the medical staff of the Department who may be eligible or ineligible to compete for the position, the holding of the competition rests with the Civil Service Commissioners, and it is the only body who can determine the eligibility or otherwise of candidates desiring to compete for the post.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what is the present position at law in regard to the soldiers' and sailors' trust houses; what is the position in regard to the ownership and <Col N="496" /> the payment of rates concerning them; and what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the introduction of proposals for legislation for the purpose of regularising the occupancy of the houses in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to judgements of the Supreme Court, particularly the judgement of the 4th March, 1937, in Casey and Others v. the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust.  Briefly summarised, that judgement decided:</P>
      <P>(1)  that the trust was not entitled to charge rents to meet the cost of maintenance and organisation;</P>
      <P>(2)  that the trust was a public eleemosynary corporation and that the ex-servicemen had no estate in the land, equitable or otherwise, but were put into occupation at the will of the trust and were tenants at will or tenants by sufferance of the trust, which was charged with the duty of administering the trust of its lands for the benefit of all ex-servicemen.</P>
      <P>(3)  that, as already decided in the Leggett case, the ex-servicemen in occupation of the cottages were not bound to pay any rent in respect of the occupation of the cottages and, accordingly, letting agreements made were void so far as they purported to create legal rights and duties, but that the ex-servicemen were in occupation of the cottages as statutory tenants at will and were entitled to the benefits of, and were subject to, all the provisions of the Labourers Acts which were incorporated in relation to the statutory tenacies.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to Section 56 of the Local Government Act, 1941, which makes the occupiers of the houses provided by the trust liable for the payment of rates thereon. The occupiers of such houses which do not come within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1926, were always liable for payment of the rates on the houses occupied by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, <Col N="497" /> I have nothing to add to the answer given to the Deputy's question of the 21st March last.</P>

      <P>I am aware that it is proposed to erect a spinning mill in the County Donegal Gaeltacht, and that it is proposed to use home-produced wool in the mill.  My Department has for a number of years been locating imported rams in County Donegal with a view to improving the foundation stocks of sheep in the county in conformation, type, hardiness and quality of the wool.  In selecting these rams, <Col N="500" /> special attention is paid to fleeces, bearing in mind that the first requisite of the fleece of a mountain sheep is its ability to protect the sheep from the inclemencies of the weather.  It is proposed to continue these measures, and I am satisfied that the best policy is to improve the existing breeds which experience has proved to be suitable for the conditions prevailing in the county.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £61,812 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1943, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
      <P>This Vote shows a net increase of £2,921 as compared with last year. There are more or less normal increases under some sub-heads, offset to some extent by decreases under others; but, generally speaking, the net increase is more than accounted for, firstly, by the new Legation at Lisbon, for which provision is now made for the first time in the annual Vote and, secondly, by the increased provision made under sub-heads A (4) and B (3)&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones. Postal communications have become so uncertain, and subject to such lengthy delays, that it is necessary to use telegrams for communicating with the representatives abroad about matters which would normally be dealt with by ordinary correspondence.  I do not think there is anything more I need say at this stage on the details of the Vote. If Deputies have any points to raise, I will try to deal with them when I am replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of this Department has so many different aspects that I am never quite sure which of them I ought to refer to when I am moving the Vote. I suppose the principal function of the Department, apart from the conduct of negotiations and correspondence with other Governments and work of that kind, might be said to be the protection of our citizens abroad&mdash;looking after their interests and helping them when they are in difficulty and in need of advice or assistance.  So far as this <Col N="507" /> aspect of the Department's functions is concerned, the war has, of course, created an entirely new situation. Things which the Department would never be asked or expected to do in peace-time have to be done now.  I might, perhaps, refer to some of these new activities, partly because Deputies showed some interest in them during the debate last year and partly because, as these services are there for the benefit of the public if they require them, it is useful to draw attention to them from time to time.</P>
    <P>We all know, of course, that there are very few countries in which you will not find at least some of our own people.  That is true of Europe as of other parts of the world, though not to so large an extent.  For example, there are over 600 of our citizens registered at the Legation in France, over 450 registered at the Legation in Italy, and so on.  As I think I mentioned last year, we have had news of nearly 200 Irish people in the Channel Islands alone.  We may forget sometimes that, if we living in this country have so far been mercifully spared immediate experience of war and its sufferings, many of our people living abroad have not been so fortunate.  They share the difficulties and hardships of war and invasion with the populations of the countries in which they are living. Many of them have lost their employment. If they were dependent on annuities or on income from investments in belligerent countries, their means of livelihood are cut off.  Even if they wish to return home, it is in most cases impossible for them to do so.  For most of them, the ordinary means of communicating with their families and friends in this country no longer exist.  By themselves, they cannot get news of their families or their families of them; so that, in addition to the other difficulties they have to face, there is the element of constant anxiety.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that anything the Department and our representatives abroad can do to help in such cases is small in relation to the degree of hardship usually involved.  If anything <Col N="508" /> can be done, they try to do it.  Take, for example, the question of news. Anybody who has a relative in a war area abroad of whom he has lost track, owing to evacuation or some other reason, or about whom he is anxious owing to lack of news, has only to get in touch with the Department and the Department tries, through our representatives in the country concerned, to trace the missing relative and get news of his health and welfare.  Similarly, as regards Irish citizens living abroad.  If, for example, they have had to evacuate their homes, or if the places where they reside have been the scene of hostilities, and they want to let their families here know where and how they are, they get in touch with the local representative and their families are informed of their whereabouts and safety through the Department.  Advantage is taken of this arrangement to quite a large extent.  Over 3,000 inquiries have been dealt with since the outbreak of war. For reasons which I explained in the debate last year, it takes a long time to get replies to some of the inquiries but, as against that, the number of cases in which it has been impossible to get any news at all is comparatively small.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of financial support, the effect of the war has been to leave many of our citizens living abroad, particularly in European countries, without money or the means of getting it.  Very often it is a case of loss of employment.  In other cases, it is a result of the breakdown of ordinary communications and the interruption of banking and financial relations. Many of our citizens in Belgium, France and elsewhere, who had been living abroad on pensions or the income from trust funds or investments in Britain, found themselves almost overnight without a penny.  Patients in clinics and sanatoria were left without means of paying for their treatment, and students in colleges could not pay their fees.  A procedure has been provided to cover such cases.  The arrangement is that the Department receives or collects the pension or income or remittance, or whatever the nature of <Col N="509" /> the payment may be, at this end, and, subject to a fixed monthly maximum, adopted to conserve foreign exchange and secure uniformity of treatment, the amount is paid out to the recipient by our representative in the currency of the country concerned.  The same procedure is used to enable people here to meet payments, such as rent and rates, necessary to preserve their right to property abroad.</P>
    <P>If any of our citizens abroad are found to be wholly destitute&mdash;with no means of their own and no relatives able to contribute to their support&mdash; then, unless repatriation arrangements can be made, recourse is had to sub-head B5 of the Vote and a grant sufficient to prevent total destitution is made by the local representative. Judging by the extent to which use has been made of it, the procedure I have just described has also, I think, been of some advantage.  It is in more or less regular operation in 275 cases. Over 1,350 individual payments have been made through the machinery provided, involving in all more than £25,000.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of the position of our citizens in those places abroad involved in the war, I might perhaps refer to two other points. First, as regards repatriation.  The Department receives many inquiries as to the possibility of arranging the return to this country of Irish people living on the continent and elsewhere. Now, wherever the circumstances of the case admit, the Department and the offices abroad do what they can to arrange repatriation by trying to obtain the necessary travel reservations&mdash;which are often very difficult to get nowadays&mdash;approaching the authorities of the countries on the route for transit visas, and so on. During the year, Irish citizens have been repatriated in this way from North Africa, France, Sweden, Italy and other continental countries.  In fact, arrangements have just been completed for the return, within the next month or six weeks, of about 45 of our priests and clerical students from Rome, and most of them are already on their way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> But the repatriation solution is not always possible.  Many of the people concerned, mostly governesses and people in posts of that kind, have been living abroad so long that to leave the places in which they are living now would be tantamount to leaving their homes.  Most of these people were warned by our representatives before the present situation developed at all, to return to Ireland if they could possibly do so, but they preferred to remain where they were and that is still their feeling.  In other cases, the difficulty is the lack of the necessary means of transport.  In time of war, accommodation for passenger travel is not only extremely limited, but subject to all kinds of priorities in the grant of which the authorities concerned give their own citizens first preference. In the majority of cases we are dependent on what the authorities of other countries are willing to do to help.  What I would like Deputies and others interested in cases of this kind to appreciate is that, if the circumstances of the case admit of it, the Department does its best to arrange repatriation, and that, where repatriation cannot be arranged, the difficulty is usually some factor outside our own control, such as inability to obtain the necessary visas or travel reservations.</P>
    <P>The second point is this.  I think I may say that, generally speaking, the treatment of our citizens abroad by the local authorities has been in accordance with what we are entitled to expect, and that the rights of our people as citizens of a neutral state have been generally recognised and respected. There have, of course, been cases in which the representative has had to intervene with the authorities.  In time of war, strangers easily become an object of suspicion, and carelessness in talk or behaviour, or even indiscreet associations, may soon lead to an expulsion order, if not something more serious.  Our representatives abroad are expected to see that the rights of our citizens are properly respected, and from time to time they have had to make representations in cases of this kind.  By and large, however, we have had little cause to complain, and, where representations have had to be made in particular cases, they have <Col N="511" /> been satisfactorily met.  I think I may say the same as regards property and contract rights.  For example, at the outbreak of war a number of Irish firms had outstanding debts due to them from firms on the continent.  The Department undertook the collection of these debts and, generally speaking, no difficulty has been experienced in collecting them.</P>
    <P>What I have been saying, of course, applies only to countries in which we have a representative.  Where we have no representative, things are more difficult.  I was asked last year about the possibility of repatriating some of our citizens, principally seamen, who were stranded in Sweden.  Mainly owing to the good offices of the Swedish and British authorities, some of these have since returned home and others are due to leave shortly, if they have not already actually arrived.  In that particular case, however, I think it is true to say that the long delay which occurred might have been avoided if we had had a representative on the spot.</P>
    <P>That is a handicap with which we are faced now as regards the Far East.  We all know that China and the Far East generally are a great field of missionary endeavour and that, wherever there is missionary work to be done, you are likely to find Irish nuns and priests.  We do not know exactly the number of our citizens in the Far East.  As Deputies may have seen by a recent announcement, we are taking steps to get the information. But the number must be appreciable, and in relation to these people we are facing all the difficulties to which I have referred as applying to our people on the continent, with the difference that in the case of the Far East we have no representative on the spot to assist in dealing with them.  I am not arguing, now, that we ought to have had representatives in all these places.  What I am saying is that the absence of a representative is a great handicap in trying to look after the interests of our people in places like the Far East, and that people should bear that circumstance in mind if, for example, it takes along <Col N="512" /> time to get replies to the inquiries which the Department is asked to make.  Then there is the extent of the territory involved.  For example, there are Irish missionary houses not only in widely-separated areas of China, but in Burma, Hong Kong, the Philippine Islands, Rabaul in New Guinea, and other places which nowadays are much in the news.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we have been trying every possible way of getting news of our people in these areas.  There seem to have been some initial difficulties and a few of the earlier reports I received gave ground for some anxiety; I am glad to say, however, that the latest information I have speaks of the people concerned as being in good health and carrying on their work as well as the circumstances permit.  One report I received through an official source was to the effect that about 45 of our citizens in Hong Kong&mdash;lay citizens, not religious&mdash;were in urgent need of funds.  In this case, I had an approach made at once to the Irish Red Cross Society.  The society, with its usual prompt generosity, made a grant of £1,000.  We have already transferred this fund to Hong Kong and made arrangements, under Irish control, for its administration on the spot.  For the reasons I have referred to, the case of our citizens in the Far East presents special difficulties; but Deputies may be assured that no effort will be spared to maintain communication with them and to do whatever is possible to help them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another of the Department's current activities about which Deputies will probably wish to know&mdash;that connected with war graves on our territory.  Deputies know, of course, that in a number of cases aircraft belonging to the belligerents have crashed on our territory and their occupants have been killed.  From time to time also, the bodies of members of the armed forces of other countries who have met their death at sea are washed ashore on our coasts. The Government decided some time ago to make itself responsible for the burial arrangements in such cases, for maintaining the graves in a neat and <Col N="513" /> scemly condition and placing on them a temporary cross indicating the name and nationality of the deceased.  The appropriate financial provision is made under item 97 of the Vote for Works and Buildings.  The work of maintaining the graves and erecting the temporary crosses is done by the Office of Public Works.  The work of establishing the identity of the deceased, recording the location of the graves, settling the particulars to be inscribed on them and informing the relatives, is done by the Department of External Affairs in co-operation with the proper authorities of the countries concerned. Any personal property found on the remains is handed over by the Department to the diplomatic representative concerned for eventual return to the relatives.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is fitting that the State should undertake this responsibility and that these graves throughout the country will command the respect due to men who die in the service of their country.</P>
    <P>The questions and activities about which I have been speaking arise more or less directly out of the emergency. But, of course, much of the ordinary work of the Department is carried on unaffected by the war conditions.  One example is the work in connection with the estates of deceased persons which is so frequently referred to here in the annual debates on this Vote.  During the year, our consular representatives handled over 1,800 estates, and the amount of money which accrued to Irish beneficiaries was considerably more than 600,000 dollars of which over 133,000 dollars was distributed through the representatives and the Department. It is interesting to note that the total amount distributed to Irish beneficiaries from estates handled by the Department in the five years 1937-1942 was over 2,000,000 dollars, and the amount distributed by the Department was 606,000 dollars odd.  The total number of estates handled was over 9,000.</P>

      <P>Before the question is put, and as the Taoiseach's statement is concerned more or less with the <Col N="514" /> routine activities of the Department, I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the officials of the Department for the courtesy and zeal I invariably experienced at their hands in many matters that were brought to their notice during this year.  I think the Taoiseach can congratulate himself on the fact that the Department is served by a very excellent staff of officials, who handle the matters that they have to deal with promptly, and handle them in a very sympathetic and understanding way.</P>
      <P>I have had occasion to approach the officials of the Department, and notably the secretary, on many occasions, to bring problems of a very irritating and complex character to their attention, and nevertheless received the greatest possible sympathy and understanding. I must say that the matters that I brought to their attention were handled expeditiously, sympathetically and understandingly, and invariably the Department exhausted all its resources in endeavouring to bring them to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The political work of the League has almost entirely ceased in the general disruption produced by the world war. In so far as circumstances allow, however, it is continuing its social, economic and humanitarian activities. The League and the International Labour Office have become somewhat dispersed and the work is being done partly in Switzerland and partly in the United States.  The work is also being done in Canada.  The work is divided generally between European and non-European developments, Geneva being the centre for Europe and Princeton for non-European developments.  Some <Col N="515" /> of the ordinary work of the League is being continued, for example, the work of recording the incidence of epidemics has gone on without interruption and the weekly record is still being published. The main work of the League officials at the moment is the study of the problems which will arise during the post-war reconstruction period. Transport, growth and distribution of population with their economic consequences, the effects of migration, standard of living, agricultural resources, etc., are some of the questions being studied.  It is true that these important subjects form the basis of study projects, rather than of actual investigation, which will naturally take considerable time to bring to a conclusion. International assistance of refugees will have to be resumed on a vast scale after the war.  Minority problems are also likely to loom up.</P>
    <P>A little reflection will show that some great central organisation such as the League&mdash;apart altogether from its now suspended political activities &mdash;will be essential in the post-war world.  The reactions of international upheavals on the internal life of States, even those removed from the centres of disturbance, are becoming constantly more serious, and all the Governments in the world have come to recognise that active co-operation between States in social and humanitarian as well as political matters is essential even for the internal life of each individual State.  Some organisation to effect this co-operation will be necessary.</P>
    <P>No doubt there was much in its origin which made it difficult for some States to accept the League wholeheartedly, but it is still a definite international organisation in being, and it is far easier to give it a character satisfactory to all States than to attempt to set up a completely new organisation.  It is especially important for small States like ours to have a rallying centre for mutual help and consultation.  One cannot easily forecast the rôle of the small States in the post-war world, but it is more <Col N="516" /> likely to be a genuine force in co-operation with other small States than as an isolated unit.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely unwise for us to abandon this international organisation just because its fortunes are not too bright at the present moment. Membership is relatively costly and immediate returns are not very obvious.  But, taking the long view, the League of Nations and the International Labour Bureau should be regarded as likely to serve a great world purpose of immense importance to the individual State, and in that background the expenditure involved may be regarded as justifiable.  The amount is relatively trivial.</P>

      <P>I should like to know whether the voting of this money, of which I entirely approve, indicates a change of policy seeing that no payment was made last year. Regarding the International Labour Office referred to by the Taoiseach, I endeavoured to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when dealing with his Estimate, some information as to why it was that, in the discussions that took place at the International Labour Congress held in New York last October, our representatives took no part at any time in the discussions that took place.  The Taoiseach is aware that, in the acting director's report which was presented to the conference, there was a rather complete summary of tendencies, economically and socially, in the world at the present time, and particularly a summary bearing on the lines of possible developments post-war.  The statement was a very important one. It was presented by a very distinguished Irishman, Mr. Edward J. Phelan, and even from that point of view alone it did seem to be an extraordinary thing, with two representatives at the congress, that there was <Col N="517" /> no word at all from them on the report.  If there is any country in the world that is given the opportunity to try to see whether all the high aspirations of the people who sent representatives to the International Labour Conference in New York, were all moonshine or not, this is the outstanding country.  We are not active in military operations, but we have supply difficulties of one kind or another.  If the suggestions on social and economic developments post-war, which were set out in the report, and discussed at great length in New York, are ones upon which the efforts of democratic people ought to be concentrated, in order to bring any kind of social security to the people, we ought to have something to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very unfortunate, in a world struggling with frightful difficulties, while still maintaining the banner of hope and, I may say, of faith, that at such an important conference as took place in New York, and in discussions of the serious subjects discussed, an Irish voice was not raised.  If we look back on any of our great declarations at historic moments, if we look back on the declaration of 1916, or the declaration that we issued as a democratic programme when this State&mdash;I do not know whether I should say <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>&mdash;was set up by the people in January, 1919, all the aspirations that are now being spoken about by the peoples of one country or another are enshrined in some way in these declarations.  Our own history during the past 20 years has, perhaps, hindered or cut across the satisfactory development of these ideas, but they are ideas that were in the hearts of our people during all the tense moments of their national existence, during our lifetime at any rate, and I think that they are burning there to-day and that the circumstances of to-day are driving us more and more to pay more practical attention to them.  In these circumstances, I suggest that it is unfortunate that no Irish voice should have been raised at that conference, and I should like to hear from the Taoiseach why that was so, whether he has any report from <Col N="518" /> our representatives at that conference, or whether he has anything to say to the House with regard to that report.</P>

      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Mulcahy, I think I cannot usefully add to what the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to say when he was dealing with this particular matter on his Vote. Deputies will very easily understand what the position is at the present time.  These meetings were held in one of the countries that was at war&mdash; I do not recall, at the moment, if it was actually at war just then, but at any rate it was on the point of war&mdash;and from the very nature of things it became inevitable that a lot of the discussions and debates at that conference took a highly political character. What I mean by saying that they took a political character is that the whole question of the war&mdash;its issues, and so on&mdash;was raised indirectly or directly.  It was not possible for us, at the time, to send a Minister from this country, and I think it will be admitted that it was very difficult for civil servants, at that distance, to be able to interpret so accurately the attitude of the Government in all these matters as to be able to take the responsibility of entering into a debate and expressing themselves in connection with it.  I think that the position of our representatives there was very difficult, but the fact that they were there at all showed that we were interested, and the fact that they did not take part in the discussions is not to be interpreted as meaning that any matters of importance to us did not have their fullest attention or that they did not communicate with us.  As a matter of fact, they did, and the matters that were discussed there, and the attitude of that particular organisation, of course, will be present to the minds of the people who are doing their planning here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only say that the matter was one of extreme difficulty for our representatives. It was impossible, in advance, to give them such complete instructions as would cover every contingency that might arise, and I think it would be unfair to ask them to take part in discussions or debates on <Col N="519" /> matters of such delicacy as were involved there.  That is the reason that they did not intervene in the discussions with the same degree of vigour, so to speak, as they did on other occasions.  On other occasions, our representatives played a very important part in all these international conferences, and took upon themselves more than their share of the burden of the consideration of the various problems that arose, but this was a case of extreme difficulty for the representatives of a neutral State, particularly when it was not possible to have a Minister present.  I should like to say that I was very glad to note, in connection with another Vote, that the work done by the officials of the Department is so much appreciated.  I want to say, for myself, that it would be quite impossible for me to be responsible, as the head of that Department, in addition to my own, if it were not for the fact that we are so fortunate as to have in that Department particularly excellent officials.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £12,600, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March 1943, for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>A sum of £6,400 has already been granted to meet the expenses of the bureau by means of the Vote on Account.  The total provision this year is £19,000, as compared with £12,000 last year.  The increase in the total estimate is due to the additional amount, £7,250, of the Grant-in-Aid provided under sub-head B, off-set by a reduction of £250 in the provision for incidental expenses, sub-head A.  The increase under sub-head B is due, of course, to the extended scope and variety of the bureau's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> In dealing with problems arising from shortages of supplies, the bureau, working under the general supervision of my Department, has devoted most attention to difficulties which seemed likely to be overcome by short-term researches or investigations.  Experimental work has been carried out as required, in some cases in university laboratories either directly under the supervision of a member of the bureau or of an outside investigator, and in other cases in collaboration with an industrial firm.  Special staff has been appointed where necessary.  Detailed reports have been prepared in regard to each completed investigation and these reports are available to the firms or industries likely to be concerned.</P>
    <P>The main part of the bureau's experimental work has dealt with fuel problems, including the manufacture of turf charcoal as a fuel for mobile producers and other purposes, the use of peat for town gas manufacture, and the efficiency of mobile producers.</P>
    <P>It was decided, following some preliminary experiments and a number of consultations with those who had previously studied the problem, that the best method of producing turf charcoal was by carbonisation in vertical retorts.  The urgency of the problem prevented full examination of the carbonisation conditions on a small scale, and the bureau accordingly decided to proceed at once with the design and erection of a full scale experimental plant.  Two full-sized retorts, one of fire bricks and the other of cast iron, are now being erected at the Turf Development Board's bog at Turraun.  It is hoped that the experiments on this plant will be sufficiently advanced before the end of the coming season to enable decisions to be reached in regard to the production of turf charcoal on the large scale.  The bureau has also undertaken an investigation of the production of turf charcoal in portable kilns, a method which might prove more adaptable to a rapid increase in production under emergency conditions.</P>
    <P>Experimental work on the use of wood and peat for gas making was undertaken by several gas works <Col N="521" /> throughout the country to meet difficulties in the supply of gas coal.  The problems involved were discussed between representatives of the bureau and of the industry, and full-scale experiments were carried out by the bureau at the Kilkenny Gas Works to decide on the proportion of peat that could be mixed with coal in the horizontal retorts used at most of the smaller gas works without serious alterations to the installations.  It was found that up to 40 per cent. of peat could be used in the charge fed to the retorts.  A report on the experiments was made available to the industry, and the results discussed with the managers of the various gas undertakings. The bureau has also assisted in experiments at Limerick, Dundalk and Dublin, in the use of peat for gas production in vertical retorts.</P>
    <P>When the bureau commenced work a large number of different types of commercial producer was being introduced embodying a large variety of special devices, many of which had been developed abroad to meet conditions other than those obtaining in Ireland.  The bureau decided to develop a laboratory test in which the operation of the producer and gas filter could be studied under conditions closely resembling those of practical use, but without the inevitable variations due to weather, traffic and the like which render the correlation of road test results very difficult.  This test is now in operation and is being used to study the behaviour of the different fuels now available.</P>
    <P>Some of the gas filters now in use on commercial plants have proved inefficient in service and instances of exceptionally rapid deterioration of motor truck engines from this cause have been investigated.  Attempts have been made to develop an electrostatic filter but difficulty has been experienced in adapting the laboratory instrument to use on a lorry.  An experimental wet filter washing the gases in soda solution and in used lubricating oil has given promising results in service, but the consumption of oil proved rather high.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> In the course of an investigation in regard to the possibilities of the manufacture of certain supplies required for the match industry, some supplies were produced on a small scale in the laboratory, and a method was worked out for the production of potassium chlorate from kelp on a commercial scale.  The investigation was not pursued as the industry decided it would not be possible to embark on commercial production owing to difficulties in obtaining the necessary plant and other supplies.</P>
    <P>Successful results have attended investigations in regard to supplies of refrigerants.  Early in July, 1941, several creameries were being obliged to curtail their operations owing to an interruption in imports of compressed carbon dioxide for replenishing their refrigeration plants.  After some initial experimental work it was found possible to generate, purify, compress and supply to the creameries, over a period of five weeks, about 85 per cent. of their normal demand.  The plant was then installed at a creamery where another ton of compressed gas was produced.  Limited supplies of imported gas later became available, but the bureau's plant was kept ready to be put into operation in case further interruptions in supplies occurred.  In addition to providing the creameries with an essential material, this work enabled the bureau to give useful advice to a number of mineral water manufacturers and other industrialists who desired to manufacture carbon dioxide for their own use.</P>
    <P>Although no interruption occurred in imports of compressed ammonia, which is also required for refrigerating plants, it was decided that arrangements should be made for the home production of this gas.  A generating and compressing plant, sufficient for the country's essential needs, was designed and erected by the bureau, and this plant will be kept in working order against a possible emergency.</P>
    <P>To ensure supplies of essential disinfectants the bureau investigated the home manufacture of formalin.  Following laboratory investigations and <Col N="523" /> experiments on a pilot plant scale, a plant was designed and erected at Riverstown Distillery, with the co-operation of Irish Alcohol Factories, Ltd.  This plant, which is sufficiently large to meet the country's requirements, has been operated by the bureau's staff for a few weeks, during which time three tons of formalin were produced.  Arrangements have now been completed for Irish Alcohol Factories, Ltd., to take over the plant for commercial operation.</P>
    <P>Experimental work arranged by the bureau resulted in the development of processes for the preparation of sulphonated oil and sodium sulphide from indigenous materials.  The results of the work have been made available to the tanning industry, which required these materials.</P>
    <P>The bureau has undertaken a number of investigations on the manufacture of various organic acids to meet shortages of imported tartaric and citric acids required by the confectionery and other industries.  Preliminary experiments on the production of tartaric acid have indicated that there is little likelihood of producing this acid from available materials on the scale required.  A process was developed for the production of phosphoric acid which can replace organic acids for some purposes, and following an examination by the Department of Industry and Commerce of the possibilities of commercial production, one firm succeeded in making arrangements for importing the supplies required. Investigations in regard to the production of citric acid, lactic acid and mucic acid are proceeding.</P>
    <P>Following experimental work conducted by the bureau on the production of oil from fish, the possibility of the production of fish oil on a commercial scale is being examined by the Department of Industry and Commerce in conjunction with the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>The bureau is investigating the possibility of obtaining home supplies of sulphur for use on existing plants for the manufacture of sulphur dioxide and <Col N="524" /> sulphuric acid.  Experiments designed to concentrate pyritic ore from a dump at Ballymurtagh, County Wicklow, were not successful, but it is hoped that a higher grade ore can be obtained by mining.  Experiments are in progress on the production of sulphur from spent oxide from gas works.</P>
    <P>Aluminium sulphate, a chemical of importance in water treatment and the manufacture of paper, and now in short supply, has been successfully manufactured in the course of large scale experiments carried out under the auspices of the bureau.  The product has been found satisfactory for the purposes required and the possibilities of commercial production are now being examined.</P>
    <P>Invert sugar solution, prepared from beet sugar by a simple process, has been found to be a satisfactory substitute for medicinal glucose for oral or rectal administration.  On the completion of the bureau's experimental work, the Department of Industry and Commerce made arrangements for the manufacture, testing and marketing of this commodity by a firm of food manufacturers.  Further experiments showed that by taking special precautions a solution of invert sugar suitable for intravenous injection could be prepared, and it is hoped to have this material manufactured on a commercial scale.</P>
    <P>Experimental work carried out under the auspices of the bureau resulted in the development of a method for estimating fat in milk using the moderately concentrated acid manufactured in the country in place of the imported acid normally employed.  This result will prove valuable if the imported acid cannot be obtained.</P>
    <P>A number of other investigations involving experimental work which the bureau completed during the period under review may be briefly referred to.  It was found possible to carburise steel to produce blanks suitable for the manufacture of table knives.  Formulae were developed for the preparation of creosote disinfectant and of <Col N="525" /> axle grease using indigenous materials in place of imported resin oil.  A method was worked out for the production from oils available in the country of fatty acids required in rubber manufacture. The bureau assisted in an investigation which has resulted in the manufacture of zinc oxide on a commercial scale.  An apparatus for the rapid testing of moisture in wood was developed for an industrial firm.  The conditions were determined for grinding wood charcoal to manufacture tablets required in churches.  Assistance has been given in the development of substitutes for oil and size in the textile industry.  Investigations have been commenced with a view to manufacturing carbon black for ink and paint manufacture, improving the short wave broadcasting station at Athlone and providing home manufactured supplies of certain essential medicaments.</P>
    <P>Some of the bureau's investigations have not achieved the results desired. A study of the drying of peat by electroendosmosis showed that while the water content of raw peat could be reduced to below 70 per cent. by this method, the consumption of electric power would render the process impracticable on the large scale. Methods for the storage of yeast for baking were worked out to meet a possible emergency resulting from interruptions in transport, but it was considered preferable to arrange for the accumulation of reserve stocks of sodium bicarbonate at various centres throughout the country.  Trials with substitute baking powders for use in home baking were not successful.  It was not found possible to recommend suitable denaturants for petrol to render stocks incapable of being used by enemy forces.  Preliminary experiments on the bleaching of beeswax without the use of potassium bichromate were dropped when the firm interested in the process obtained plant for the recovery of waste chrome salts.</P>
    <P>The number of technical problems arising from supply difficulties which were examined by the bureau was very great, but it was frequently found possible to give useful assistance to industry <Col N="526" /> without special experimental work.  Some inquiries could be dealt with from the experience of one of the members or staff of the bureau, or by consulting the technical staff of some of the many firms with which the bureau has established close contacts. Help was also given by furnishing digests of technical literature prepared by the Library and Information Bureau of the Industrial.  Research Council.</P>
    <P>Technical advice covering a wide range of subjects has been given to Government Departments.  Much time was devoted to discussions with officers of the Department of Local Government and Public Health and of the Department of Supplies and with representatives of the professional and commercial interests concerned in regard to the accumulation of stocks of certain essential medical supplies.</P>
    <P>There is close co-operation between the various Government Departments and the bureau, and also between the bureau and the authorities of the universities and technical schools. Thanks are due to a large number of industrial firms, scientists and private persons who helped the bureau in the solution of problems.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,012 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1943, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; and No. 38 of 1938).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that a sum of £5,000 has already been granted by means of the Vote on Account.  The sum now asked for is required to complete the total of £15,012 which is the estimated expenditure for the current year.  Last year the Estimate was for the sum of £13,767 and there is thus a net increase of £1,245.  This increase <Col N="527" /> occurs mainly in sub-head A and is primarily due to the fact that the post of director of the Government Information Bureau was filled on an acting basis during last year by an officer seconded from the Wireless Broadcasting Service, whose salary was borne on the Vote for that service.  In consequence of the definitive transfer of that officer to the post of director provision has now been made in this sub-head for his salary, £900 and bonus thereon.  A further small proportion of the increase is due to normal increments in the salaries of the staff of the Department.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head B&mdash; Travelling Expenses&mdash;is the same as for 1941&mdash;42 and previous years.  The provision under sub-head C&mdash;Incidental Expenses&mdash;is £30 less than 1941&mdash;42 and is based on the experience of previous years.  The provision under sub-head D&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones, £270&mdash;shows an increase of £20 due, in the main, to a percentage increase in the cost of telephone charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters of major importance that, in the judgment of this Party, fundamentally affect the whole economic structure of this State and because of the significance of the one and the reactions that the other must inevitably have on the whole future economy of this country, we feel this opportunity should be availed of to bring to the notice of the Taoiseach, in his dual capacity as head of the State and Minister for External Affairs, consideration of these matters, so that the Dáil and the country as a whole may hear from him in unequivocal terms what, in fact, is the true position and what his policy is with regard to them.  The matters I refer to are, first, the question of our power to bargain and, secondly, the fact that one great branch of Irish agriculture, the pig industry, has been permitted to die, and another, the dairy industry, to decay to an <Col N="528" /> alarming extent without any effort being made to save either one or the other.  We are of opinion that these are matters of such vital import to the whole community that they should command the immediate attention and consideration of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies on the Vote for his Department made reference to these matters in the following terms as reported in the Official Report, Volume 87, No. 4, column 1633:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, by going to London to discuss matters of trade, and assuming that discussions in London could be confined to matters of trade, supplies from Great Britain could be improved then some indication of that fact would have been given during the many official contacts with the administrative heads of British Departments.  No such indication has been given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that the obvious reply to that is that they were quite satisfied with the type of trade they were getting from this country, that we were prepared to give them all our surplus agricultural produce and, to a great extent, take a credit in their books at the other side.  Further on in the same column he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no point in disguising the fact that in present circumstances our bargaining power is practically nil; our production of bacon and butter has fallen to the point where there is no export surplus, where in fact it is inadequate to supply even the whole of our own requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the exports of two well-known commodities of Irish agriculture, namely, bacon and butter, have disappeared, as the Minister has pointed out, we feel it right to express the view of many people in this country that there are still left with us weapons to bargain with. I feel that the Minister who made such a statement is responsible for a very grave indiscretion and has earned the severest censure of this House.  A great many people were amazed at the <Col N="529" /> stupidity of such a statement being made in public when they considered the advantage the British were likely to take of it in the future, and our neighbours must have regarded it as a matter of much importance when they gave such prominence to it in the B.B.C. news. I think the House is entitled to full and frank information on this whole question of bargaining; what efforts have been made to bargain, what use is being made of our present exports as a bargaining counter, through what channels did representations pass, and why did not the Government consider this matter of sufficient importance to warrant the sending of a Minister or Ministers on such an important mission.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, referred to this matter again when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In point of numbers and in point of value, our main cattle trade is in store cattle, that is in exporting what is in fact a raw material of the British agricultural industry, store cattle which go on to British farms, there to be fattened.  Because of the scarcity in feeding stuffs in Great Britain, they announced that they would have to restrict the importation of store cattle from us.  It is not that the British are so anxious to get them, the position is the reverse; their circumstances require a restriction upon their movements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I should like to ask the House what is the position with regard to the cattle industry and what is the position in regard to the type of cattle that the British require.  I suggest that it is a total misrepresentation of the actual position when he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because of the scarcity of feeding stuffs in Great Britain, they announced that they would have to restrict the importation of store cattle from us.  It is not that the British are so anxious to get them, the position is the reverse: their circumstances require a restriction upon their movements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some officials of the British Ministry of Food came across some time ago <Col N="530" /> and entered into a price arrangement with officers of the Department of Agriculture here with regard to the price of cattle and the price of fat cattle for export to Great Britain was arranged, one might say, almost on the basis of last year's price, notwithstanding the fact that the price of British beef has been raised by 6/- per cwt.  The price of British beef to-day is 76/- per cwt. for best grades and the price of Irish is about 57/-, or 11¾d. a lb.  Between the price of British fat cattle and the price of Irish cattle converted into beef in England after a two months' stay, there is a difference of 5/- per cwt., leaving a margin of about 13/- per cwt. between the value of Irish fat cattle landed in England and the value of Irish store cattle converted into beef in England after a stay of two months there.</P>
    <P>I want to make this position clear. The policy of the British Government at the present time with reference to the export of store cattle from this country is contrary to what the Minister for Supplies represented here the other night.  It is not because they are short of food, or that there is any restriction whatever on the export of store cattle, or any restriction on the export of fat cattle.  It is because the British have very considerably increased the amount of land under cultivation. They have increased the cultivation of their arable land by 6,000,000 acres.  The Minister of Agriculture boasted about that figure recently. From the huge amount of land under cultivation in England&mdash;some 6,000,000 acres of an increase compared with what they tilled in pre-war days&mdash;they expect to reap a huge fodder crop. Their root crops are quite promising. They are already looking for stores to consume that huge fodder crop and root crop.  Those stores will be converted into beef in British stalls and they will be used for the purpose of producing farmyard manure, which will go back into the land in Great Britain in order to preserve the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect that the British, with their foresight and vision, took into consideration.  They considered it <Col N="531" /> would be good policy for them to secure a difference in price between Irish stores and beef, so that we would be forced to adopt a policy of exporting our cattle as stores and not as fats.  That would enable them to utilise their fodder and root crops and so produce ample supplies of farmyard manure in order to preserve the fertility of British soil.  Are we, by allowing the machinery of the Civil Service to operate, going to permit the British to force on us a type of trade suitable to their own economic requirements without any regard to its reactions on our agricultural economy, or will there be any attempt on our part to secure, in the goods that are available there, a <i>quid pro quo</i>?</P>
    <P>The House is aware that recently the British lifted the ban on the export of young Irish cattle, any cattle that had not two prominent teeth.  What was the implication behind the lifting of that ban?  The greatest problem that the British have in the matter of food requirements is the production of sufficient milk.  The British Minister of Agriculture has given precedence to the production of milk.  A well-known authority on British agricultural matters, Mr. A.G. Street, writing in <i>The Farmers' Weekly</i> on the 24th April last, in reference to &ldquo;Dairy Cows for 1945,&rdquo; with this as a second heading: &ldquo;It's impossible to get a milk production increase without them... but where are they to come from?&rdquo;  said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The great concern of the authorities to-day is the provision of an increased supply of milk for next winter...  Therefore, there are only two ways to increase next winter's milk supply.  Firstly, to increase the number of autumn calvers by importation from Ireland; secondly, to see to it that the available autumn calvers find their way into the hands of the most efficient dairy farmers in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down in the same article he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again, if autumn calvers cannot be imported from Ireland, dairy stirk heifers can be.  Every extra stirk <Col N="532" /> heifer that is bulled next Christmas will mean a definite increase in the milk supply for the winter of 1943, and every arable farmer can somehow manage to see a bunch of bulling heifers through next winter.  He may not want to do this, but if milk is now&mdash;and is likely to continue to be&mdash;a munition of war, it is difficult to argue against his being compelled to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same man, writing again on the same subject on the 19th June, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This week I have been asked to mention something that is puzzling some of my friends.  Apparently, under existing regulations, no beast can be imported from Ireland unless it has moved its first two broad teeth.  This rules out the bulling dairy heifer, 15 to 20 months old. Not only does this age make the best dairy cows, calving at 24 to 30 months old, but it is impossible to guarantee the older heifers from Ireland as being barren.  In fact, somewhere about 60 per cent. of them always come over in-calf but with no dates.  Would it not be possible to permit the importation of young Shorthorn dairy heifers that have not moved their milk teeth, and retain the present ban on beef cattle &mdash;Hereford, Polled, and all steers?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Very shortly after that was written the ban was lifted on all young cattle here. The House will appreciate that Mr. Street advocated the lifting of the ban on Shorthorn cattle only, the type of cattle suitable for dairying purposes, and that the ban should be held on Hereford.  Polled and all steers.  The British Government, in lifting the ban, were not so bare-faced about it as Mr. Street suggested they should be.  They lifted the ban on all young cattle from this country.  In effect, that means that the British intend to pick the plums of our herds for the purpose of supplying basic stock for their dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I do not cavil at that.  I think our attitude should be to make every possible effort to supply them with the type of stock they need.  What I do suggest is that, as that is the type of <Col N="533" /> stock that we can supply, we should use it as a bargaining weapon and get some goods of which we are short as a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  The British can get wheat and bacon in Canada, beef and maize in South America, wool, chilled lamb and mutton and butter from New Zealand and Australia; but there is only one country where they can get basic stock for dairy purposes, and that is Éire.  We hear the Minister for Supplies saying that our bargaining power is nil.  We permit the British to lift the ban on the importation of our stock for the purpose of replenishing their herds, without consultation with us. We have not made any effort to utilise that situation.</P>

I am putting it to the Taoiseach that that sort of situation ought to be used and exploited to the full extent and I suggest to the Taoiseach that that is not being done, that we have simply sat down and permitted the British to bring in regulations and orders to suit their particular economy without adverting to the reactions of such orders on our agricultural economy.  I admit I have no experience whatever, but from what I know and from what I have read about deals made in the past, I do not think the British are the type of people who have always looked for their pound of flesh without giving anything in return, and in this case I am satisfied that a proper approach has not been made in the matter, and I say that civil servants are not the right channel through which to make it.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may ask what supplies the British have that might be made available to us.  I am quite satisfied that they have stocks of sulphate of ammonia, a most essential raw material for agriculture, which this country requires to-day.  We know that last year supplies of sulphate of ammonia went into the North of Ireland and that it came over the Border into this country, into the black market, in hundreds of tons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at £50 a ton, when the normal price was £10 a ton.  Is it possible that that situation can continue? Is it possible that the British have that surplus stock and that they cannot make available an allocation of sulphate of ammonia to this country? That is the one artificial manure that is not rationed in England at the present time.  Other artificial manures, phosphates and potash, are rationed. There is one commodity that they have an ample supply of as far as artificials are concerned and that is nitrates.  We want to know what is being done to secure an allocation of the supply that is available there.  The Taoiseach wants to know what should be done <Col N="536" /> about it.  I say to the Taoiseach that we should say that we are prepared to make available all the heifers of the type they are looking for that we can, and that, furthermore, we are prepared to breed the type of heifer that is essential for the British dairying industry and to ensure that our people will produce the right type for export purposes and, at the same time, that we should ask what considerations are we going to get for that.  Are we not entitled to some consideration?</P>
      <P>Let us turn to the other side of the picture, to which I have referred already, namely, the fact that two of the greatest branches of Irish agriculture are dying, in fact, you might say one of them is already dead.  I might say three branches of Irish agriculture, including eggs and poultry. No attempt has been made to preserve the pig industry and the dairy industry during this emergency.  We know that, as far as the pig industry is concerned, we have now available in this country less than 40 per cent. of our requirements and it is very doubtful whether we will produce this year sufficient butter for our own requirements. When you remember that these industries stood the storms of world upheavals and economic reactions for many years, and political controversies at home, and that they are now, as far as exports are concerned, things of the past, it is a very sad commentary on the present position of Irish agriculture.</P>

Our butter exports in the same year, 1931, were worth £2,086,035; eggs in shell exported were worth £2,227,452&mdash;making a total, in round figures of £9,000,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach what are his plans for the future of this country.  Evidently we <Col N="538" /> have no plan to deal with the emergency position here, with the great branches of Irish agriculture that we permitted to die a natural death without any attempt being made to save them.  What is going to be our position in the post-war period?  What is going to be our position if in the post-war period we are not permitted to touch our sterling assets?  Supposing, and it is quite on the cards, that the British Government say that owing to the fact that they have enormous financial commitments in the post-war period, they will have to freeze our sterling assets.  They may say: &ldquo;We are prepared to honour these debts, but we cannot honour them for a period of years, and any trade that takes place at present between the two countries must take place on an exchange of goods basis, goods for goods.&rdquo;  What position will this country have to face, in the event of our exports having dropped to a very low level?  If we have to purchase essential commodities or the raw materials for our industries, and that we must export native products in order to procure these essential supplies and raw materials, if the wheels of industry are to continue, are we going to permit the disappearance of such native products to leave us in a position in which we shall have not any commodities to export should a situation of that kind arise?  I think it is time that this House should get full and frank information from the Taoiseach on questions of this sort, whether it is necessary in his opinion that these commodities which this country is so well endowed to produce should be permitted to disappear from production, so that we may find ourselves in a situation in which we will not be able to export commodities of that sort in exchange for essential commodities and raw materials for our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, Sir, that we cannot compete at the present time with the Canadian price so far as bacon in the British market is concerned.  The Canadians found themselves at the beginning of the war with a huge surplus of wheat and substantial supplies of maize.  The normal market for the sale of that wheat and maize was cut away by the operation of the blockade.  Having <Col N="539" /> vision and foresight, and a keen appreciation of what was going to happen during a war of this sort, they decided to convert this surplus grain into bacon.  At the very inception of the war, they offered to supply huge quantities of bacon, something like 7,000,000 lbs. a week, to the British market and they made a deal on that basis at a price with which it was completely outside our power to compete.  It is, however, quite on the cards that Canada as a source of supply of bacon for the British market may disappear to a very great extent after the war is over because then the world will be faced with a starving population in Europe. The huge stocks of wheat in Canadian granaries at the present time will be required to feed these starving people and it will be more profitable for the Canadians to revert to their former position, under which they were able to supply the finest wheat in the world to European countries.  In such a set of circumstances as those, this country should not find itself in the position of being unable to make available any supplies of bacon to the British in any shape or form or to any other countries which might sorely need supplies of bacon when that time arrives.</P>
    <P>I think now is the time to examine all these problems.  It is a time when we should look ahead, when we should plan and lay the foundations, particularly for our agriculture and agricultural production during the post-war period.  It seems to me that in all these matters the policy of the Government is a negative policy.  It is a policy of drift, a policy of incompetence, a policy of failure, a policy of despair.  They have complacently permitted some of the finest young men of the nation to be exported without making any effort to lay the foundations for a better, a more scientific and more intensive method of agricultural production by eliminating all waste ground and bringing into production every possible acre that could be made available in the country. The planning and the organisation of that sort of post-war economy, in our opinion, should be done now.  The foundation for that post-war economy must be laid now if we are going to <Col N="540" /> survive.  We are entitled to ask the Taoiseach what examination has been given this problem, what plans have the Government in respect of this problem, what efforts are being made at the present time to plan ahead against the situation that as far as we can possibly see may develop in post-war Europe.  We are anxious to hear from the Taoiseach what he has to say on the matter.  If he has any information to give to the House, we shall be glad to hear it.  I invite his views on this most important and most vital subject.  I think the time has come, as I have said, when that sort of preparation must be made and any information the Government can give the House should be made available now.</P>

      <P>I thought that this was the Vote for Agriculture judging by the way Deputy Hughes spoke. Deputy Hughes is in the very happy position to-day of carrying out the old policy of blowing hot and cold.  He complained about the type of cattle that Britain is buying from us, that she buys to suit herself.  Then he says we should step in and make a bargain. There is one way of doing it, but Deputy Hughes kept very carefully away from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Hughes was asked whether he was prepared to advocate the prohibition of the export of that live stock, he very wisely kept silent.  I think the people of this country have rather vivid memories of the shouts from the benches opposite: &ldquo;Give us back our markets,&rdquo; when on another occasion this Government thought it right that money which was leaving the Irish farmers unjustly to be paid over to Britain in annuities should be held by the Government of this country.  We know what happened then.  If this Government stepped in in the morning to prevent the farmers from getting the best price they could for their cattle&mdash;by prohibiting their <Col N="541" /> export&mdash;we would very quickly have the same howls again and the same cries of: &ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes went on to deal with the pig and dairy industries, which he said had gone wallop.  He is the very man who told us to-day that he is prepared to sell bacon to Britain at 62/- a cwt. &mdash;that is the price Britain will pay for the bacon exported to them&mdash;or to sell butter to Britain at the rate of 4d. a gallon for milk at the creamery; that is the price Britain is prepared to pay for butter.  Let us face this thing frankly.  Show me the farmer who is prepared to do either of the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a market enough here at home at the present time for everything we can produce on our land.  Feed our people; that is remedy No. 1.  I gave an instance here a short time ago of the reason why there is not the same production of bacon at present that there was pre-war.  If Deputies took the trouble &mdash;it would not take them ten minutes &mdash;to walk down to the library and study the figures there, they would not be coming in here to this House with nonsensical statements.  The imports of maize, maize meal and cotton meal into this country in the year 1938 were 500,000 tons.  On the basis of 25 per cent. compulsory tillage, the increase in the acreage of oats and barley last year was only 267,000 acres.  Take it that every acre produced a ton, which it did not, that gave us about 50 per cent. of the grain that we previously had for feeding pigs and cattle and poultry. Have we tried to increase it?  For two days last week we had Deputies opposite hammering at the Government because they insisted that a man who did not till his 25 per cent. should be fined and properly fined. You cannot blow hot and cold on this <Col N="542" /> job; if we want sufficient production in this country to feed our own people we must not only till 25 per cent. of our land but we must have compulsory tillage of 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>And I suppose he realises that you cannot fatten the same number of pigs on 267,000 acres of oats and barley as you could on 500,000 tons of maize meal previously.  Deputies over there who come along with shouts of this description to-day are the very same Deputies who were on their feet last week protesting because the Taoiseach insisted that a man who refused to till the required amount of land should have a proper fine imposed upon him by the district justice. Where is the good in that kind of thing?  Is that the co-operation we are going to get?  Let us be sensible, and face this matter as we should face it. First of all, we want bread enough in this country to feed our people during this emergency.  My only fault with the policy here is that we have not compulsory tillage of a sufficient acreage, and, secondly, that we have no proper policy in regard to forcing the people to till a sufficient amount. <Col N="543" /> The land should be taken from them if they will not use it.  I am speaking as a farmer from a county where 40 per cent. of the land is under tillage. We can do more if it is wanted, and we were not waiting for any Compulsory Tillage Order to make us do it. We produced enough wheat in Cork County this year to feed five counties. We are doing our job there.  For two days last week I sat here listening to Deputies opposite shouting about the fines, and about the poor men who could not till.  Then they come along asking why the Taoiseach has not bacon for export at 62/- a cwt., and why he does not make a bargain with the British.</P>
      <P>The one way of making a bargain is by having a weapon with which to meet them if they are not ready to make a bargain with you.  Have Deputies opposite the pluck to stand up here now and say: &ldquo;We will prohibit the export of those young cattle out of the country unless Britain sends us sulphate of ammonia in exchange&rdquo;? I saw a notice last week to the farmers of Northern Ireland telling them that in the coming season they would get only one-sixth of the sulphate of ammonia they got last year.  That is the stuff which the British are going to make us a present of, or give us in exchange for our cattle&mdash;something that they have not got for themselves. What is the good in talking nonsense? Furthermore, no farmer within ten miles of the Border will get any sulphate of ammonia except on the certificate of the district inspector that he has land and will put it into it and will not send it across the Border.  That is the commodity which Deputy Hughes thinks we should get from Britain in exchange for our cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in closing one's eyes to things.  Let us face the position frankly.  I am as anxious to see artificial manures coming in as any man alive.  I know the necessity for them but you cannot take breeches off a Highlander.  I do not see how you can get artificial manures from Britain if she has not sufficient for herself and I cannot see any farmer engaging in the export of bacon to Britain during this <Col N="544" /> emergency at 62/- a cwt.  Deputy Hughes told us that we could not hope to compete with Canada in the production of pigs.  That is his latest.  After the war, he said Canada will go back to the production of wheat and maize. A lot of things will happen after this war which will open the eyes of Deputy Hughes, if I am to be taken as a prophet.  I do not believe that the market across the water will be of much use to Deputy Hughes or anybody who thinks like him after the war.  That is why I am anxious to see all the industries we have maintained here and why we should, if possible, even during the emergency, build up other industries to give employment to our people and to provide a market for our produce.  It will be the only market we will have when this war is over, although we might get away with a year or two on the continent immediately after the war.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke in the same old strain&mdash;keep the old farmer one jump ahead of the bailiff.  That was the policy of the British Government and that is the idea behind their prices&mdash; the price at which maize will come in and the price at which the pig will go across.  Deputy Hughes thinks we should export agricultural commodities to Britain so as to import from there the raw materials for our industries. That is what is at the back of his head.  As I asked Deputy Belton last week, how long is the Irish farmer to be a hewer of wood and a drawer of water for the rest of the community?  It is time that position was changed.  If those industries require raw materials, let them do as we do&mdash;export a share of their industrial products to pay for the raw materials they require.  Do not have the blooming old farmer doing all and every twopence-halfpenny jackeen from the city sneering at him and telling him that everything he produces has to be subsidised.  Less than three years ago, over £750,000 was paid in subsidies on butter going across to Britain in order to keep our dairy herds here, provide Britain with cheap butter, and enable material to be imported for the industrialists.</P>

      <P>That was the only way&mdash; by taxing you to feed them cheaply. Now that that is not being done, we have Deputy Hughes and other Deputies like him howling.  The price of bacon here is about 80/-.  In Britain, it is 52/-.  Are we to produce for that price?  If any fellow from the town wishes to try that game, I will give him a couple of pigs, but I would not go in for it myself as a farmer.  Deputy Hughes's idea is that this country should always be the fruitful mother of flocks and herds for Britain.  I never believed in that and I do not believe in it now.  I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but when I came in I thought it was an agricultural Vote that was being discussed. When I heard the heresy preached from the other side, I had to intervene. These are the people who object because the Government insists on 25 per cent. of the land being tilled. They know that, this year, we are short of bacon, even for our own needs, because we did not grow sufficient grain to fatten the pigs.  That is at the root of the shortage.  Any Deputy who so desires can get the figures from the Library.  He can get the figures of the imports of maize meal and cotton meal in 1938, the last normal year. He can get the amount of barley and oats grown that year and the amount grown last year.  Let him remember the 100,000 tons of bran and pollard representing the residue of the wheat, which residue we have not now.  Let <Col N="546" /> him, then, consider what is necessary to provide the people with enough bacon and poultry for their own needs and come in with me and advocate 40 per cent. compulsory tillage, the land to be taken from the fellow who does not comply.</P>

      <P>There was a time when I used wonder whether Deputy Corry was not the indiscreet mouthpiece of the Government.  For the past 12 months, I have been somewhat doubtful about that.  Consequently, I am not as ready to give consideration to Deputy Corry's speeches now as I was in the past, when he used come out rather bluntly with a number of things which were in the Government's mind but which the Taoiseach was a little more discreet in publishing to the Dáil.  I do not know if he regards Deputy Corry as his mouthpiece any longer or whether he agrees with a number of the doctrines propounded by Deputy Corry this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I rose to speak because of the failure of a number of Departments of Government and because of a piece of very subtle and persistent propaganda which is being widely indulged in throughout the country by supporters of the Government.  Everybody is familiar with the statement, coming from many supporters of the Taoiseach: &ldquo;We admit that the Minister for Supplies is making a mess of his job; that as a result of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, agriculture is on its last legs; that nobody can get any satisfactory replies from the Department of Local Government and Public Health; and that the staff of the Land Commission is so depleted that it cannot do anything.&rdquo;  In fact, all the Minister but one or two are severely criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody&mdash;including some of the Deputies here&mdash;is familiar with the formula that the Ministers are no good but the Taoiseach is all right.  I cannot subscribe to that particular doctrine, though it is clever propaganda, I admit.  I believe that the Taoiseach is fully responsible for the failure of his Ministers.  No more severe criticism could be passed on the head of any Government than that the <Col N="547" /> Ministers whom he has appointed and for whom he is responsible are now objects of general criticism from practically every Party.  It is to that that I would like to call attention.</P>
    <P>I wish people would disabuse themselves of the particular delusion that the Head of the Government can be separated from the blunders, mistakes and incompetence of his Ministers.  He cannot.  The fact that he has Ministers of that kind who have mismanaged things in a fashion altogether unexpected&mdash;even by their opponents&mdash;is the severest criticism which could be levelled against him.  I will say this for the Taoiseach&mdash;as far as I know he has always stood over the conduct of his Ministers, and he has not countenanced the particular type of propaganda to which I refer.  He has taken responsibility for their mistakes.  I put this to him and to the House: either he saw their continued blundering and took no steps to see that they should do their work properly, or he did not see their blundering.  In either case, to my mind, he stands condemned as the head of a Government.</P>
    <P>How many people in the country, independent of Party, are satisfied with the conduct of, say, the Minister for Supplies, or the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and these are two of the most important Ministries in the State at the present moment?  I take these two Departments as typical.  There are some Departments at which criticism is not levelled; and one or two Departments more or less run themselves, and are, therefore, not in a position to make many mistakes.  In regard to these two Departments, where really solid hard work had to be performed, and where initiative was required from Ministers, can anybody honestly pretend that these Ministers have performed their tasks as they should, or that they have shown initiative in facing problems?  I am not going to discuss&mdash;it has been discussed already&mdash;the result of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture; but here is the position as revealed by Ministerial statements: many of the important branches of agriculture have collapsed and have no future <Col N="548" /> before them.  The Taoiseach must be aware that one of his Ministers stated that the cattle trade had no future, that it was practically dead, certainly as an export business.  With all respect to Deputy Corry, I ask how we are to import raw materials for agriculture or for industry in the narrow sense of the word, unless we export something else.  Another Minister proclaimed that the dairying industry was dead and, quite recently&mdash;perhaps the Taoiseach's attention was drawn to it&mdash;at a meeting held in Limerick, independent of any Party bias, one of the principal speakers&mdash;who was, and still is, I believe, a strong supporter of the Taoiseach&mdash;gave it as his deliberate opinion that it was the policy of the Government to destroy the bacon trade&mdash;that is practically what the statement amounted to.  That same man, a big bacon curer, giving evidence in court on oath, stated that he was a member of the bacon board, that he knew a certain price had been fixed as a maximum price for pigs, to the fixing of which he had agreed, and yet he had given a higher price. When asked why he did so, he answered that he was compelled to do so, as he now killed only a couple of hundred hogs per week; where previously he killed a couple of thousand. Therefore, on unimpeachable evidence &mdash;statements from two Ministers and from a man who cannot be accused of any political bias against the Government&mdash;we have it that some of the principal branches of agriculture are, if not dead, at least moribund.</P>
    <P>I put that to the Taoiseach as a very serious situation, which requires the attention of the whole Government, and especially his own attention.  More than once in this House we have advocated that the Government should turn their minds to these things and make an effort to envisage the policy of the country when peace comes&mdash;what the position in agriculture will be and if that collapses, even from the despised export point of view of which Deputy Corry speaks, what will become of our secondary industries, no matter how important they may be?  That problem requires care.  Does anybody who has watched the course of events for the <Col N="549" /> last couple of years under the direction of the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture expect that that problem will be fully and squarely examined and tackled?  That is the problem that faces us all.  Let anybody consider the lack of policy and lack of foresight of which we have continually complained here in the last three years.  We must assume that the Taoiseach is fully satisfied with the conduct of those Departments.  They are of vital importance at the moment and, to a certain extent, may be of great importance in the future.  Yet what is their history?  Lack of foresight all the time, in regard to practically every one of the larger commodities. No wonder we are short of certain things.  There has been blunder after blunder, each blunder surpassing the previous one.  When efforts were made to point out these mistakes, what was the general attitude?  It was: &ldquo;Well, yes, granted, mistakes were made in the past, but that is past, what are you to do at the moment; face that, with the situation we have got now.&rdquo;  I have listened to that plea time after time here&mdash;&ldquo;with the situation we have got now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The result has been that bigger blunders were made by the very same men in the next couple of months.  If they get away with their blunders without criticism, they are encouraged; and the Taoiseach who has been sponsoring such a course of conduct shows that he does encourage them to make bigger mistakes. There is no effort, it seems to me, on the part of that Minister either to get a grip of the situation or to do anything but indulge in propaganda, and no effort on the part of the Taoiseach to get him to do his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy Corry referred to the matter of negotiation and bargaining.  I do not know whether the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Supplies or what particular Department was responsible for such negotiations <Col N="550" /> as took place, but if anything like the same spirit was put into these negotiations as, for instance, was behind the recent clothes Order, could anybody be surprised that no satisfactory result was achieved?  It is all right to browbeat your own people and to treat them with contempt, but when you are trying to make a bargain with other people, you are not in that happy position.  It is because I completely repudiate the slogan that the Ministers are no good, that one is worse than another&mdash;that is not fair to all of them, but it is what one hears&mdash;but that the Taoiseach is all right, and because I think that slogan misses the real responsibility of Government I am opposing this Vote.</P>
    <P>A crisis did come upon us, and I fear that what happened was that, for one reason or another, Ministers left matters largely in the hands of civil servants.  It was not the business of civil servants to meet a new crisis of that kind.  The Civil Service is an excellent machine, fitted for many things, capable of doing many things and of doing many things well, but it is not a responsibility which any Minister should have thrown on the shoulders of his Department.  The policy and the initiative in a crisis of this kind should come from the Minister. He can get advice, if he likes, from his Department, but especially in a new crisis of this kind he was the man to give the impetus and to give the guidance to the Department.  I may be wrong, but I certainly have the feeling that in this crisis Ministers rely too much altogether on the Department and thrust on them a task which should not fairly have been thrown upon them.</P>
    <P>No matter how long the war lasts, or how soon peace comes, we are facing a particular situation, and it seems to me that if the Taoiseach does not get his Ministers to accept their responsibilities in full seriousness, even though we may, as we hope, avoid the disaster of being pulled into the war, we may face dangers which will not be so catastrophic but which will certainly be very great.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention <Col N="551" /> to take part in this debate, but the fact that one or two matters in which I am interested were discussed induces me to add my few words. Deputy Hughes referred to the statement of the Minister for Supplies that our bargaining power is practically nil. He went on to argue, and I agree with him, that we possibly could have made efforts to bargain in the past few years for better terms than those which were secured, and he suggested that now there was an opportunity to make a trade on the young stock of this country against goods from England. That is the matter to which I want to refer.  I think Deputy Hughes selected a rather inappropriate subject to point his moral when he selected young heifers.  There is a tendency at the moment in England&mdash;from our point of view, a rather dangerous tendency&mdash;to purchase young dairy stock from this country.  Our agricultural industry as a whole is practically dependent on the existence of a strong and healthy dairying industry here, and at the moment that industry is in the rather unfortunate position that the output of butter has been considerably reduced in the last few years, until we have arrived at the present position in which it is scarcely probable, and, in fact, I would say, altogether improbable, that we shall have sufficient butter for our home needs this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is bad enough, but the diminution in our dairy herds will have far greater adverse effects on the nation than a mere shortage in our butter supply during the coming winter.  If our dairy herds continue to diminish as they are diminishing, one can envisage what our agricultural exports in a few years' time will be, because, for years past and at present, they are mainly direct or indirect items of the dairying industry.  Butter will likely be short this year and store cattle inevitably short in years to come.  I believe that bad as the butter position is this year, it will be infinitely worse next year. Since the British have allowed young stock into England, there is at the moment an intense sale of the very best of our young dairy stock&mdash;young <Col N="552" /> dairy heifers and in-calf heifers.  I am not advocating that the Department should stop it.  I do not believe they can stop it, nor do I believe it would be right to stop it, if they could, unless they could in some way recoup the farmer who has to sell that stock; but I am pointing out the effects it will have on our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly being purchased at the moment&mdash;I sold them myself in the last week&mdash;young dairy heifers at war prices, at prices which the dairy farmer as such cannot afford to pay for dairy cattle and, to my mind, it will be almost impossible for the ordinary dairy farmer who is short of dairy stock next spring, as many of them will be, to make good the shortage. He cannot afford to do so.  The economic position of his industry will not afford it.  Young dairy heifers&mdash; two-year-old heifers in-calf, which are immature dairy stock from our point of view&mdash;are at the moment making anything from £26 to £30 or £31 each.</P>
    <P>Again it does not require any great effort of imagination to think of the price of dairy cows next spring, or of the chance of the ordinary dairy farmer purchasing cattle at such a price.  It cannot be done.  The whole future of dairying and of agriculture, because it is dependent on the dairying industry, is in a parlous position.  I cannot refrain from making reference on every possible occasion to this aspect, that some arrangement should be made to prevent the decay of the industry.  I do not want to go into the agricultural position now, because this is not an Estimate that deals with agriculture, but every Deputy who spoke made particular reference to dairying and to the export of dairy heifers.  I do not advocate definitely that if we are to bargain we should bargain on the basis of dairy heifers.  I am against that.  On the other hand I cannot argue that the Government, as Deputy Corry suggested, should put a ban on the export of dairy heifers.  I say that we dare not do so, but by some inducement farmers should be urged to keep their dairy heifers.  The inducement must be on the lines that <Col N="553" /> Deputies on this side have argued for a considerable period, that dairy farmers must be put in such a position that they can economically produce. The Taoiseach is the head of the Government, and this question has certainly such an important bearing on our economic position, that he should turn his brain to it.  If we are going to preserve an agricultural export industry of any sort in the years postwar, it is incumbent that we should keep our dairying industry going because, to say the very least, there is every danger that it may be nonexistent in five or six years if the present rate of reduction continues.</P>
    <P>There must be an inducement by the Government now or during this winter to encourage dairy farmers to keep the best heifers.  I am not referring to monetary encouragement or grants to purchase heifers, because a man might be induced to buy heifers at an uneconomic price, and that would not be good business.  I do not advocate that. I do not think there is any advantage in persuading a dairy farmer who wants two extra cows to buy them if it would not pay him to do so.  That would not be sound business.  There must be an attempt by the State to resuscitate the dairying industry.  I pointed out in other Votes, that until the production of butter, which is an essential part of the dairying industry, is made an economic prospect, the decay of that industry will go on with all its ill consequences.  In the first place there will be no exports of butter.  I do not think we have been exporting butter for some time.  The position is that we will have no butter here.  I wonder if the House realises how serious the position will be next autumn.  I am familiar with some creameries, and the fall in their supplies this year has seriously perturbed the managers, who have practically made up their minds that unless there is a sudden change for the better there will not be sufficient butter to carry us over the next nine months.  That is something serious to contemplate but it will be much more serious for the future of our agricultural industry which, willy nilly, is bound up with the success or failure of the dairying industry. <Col N="554" /> I ask the Taoiseach, as head of the Government&mdash;as his partner seems to have failed in the effort&mdash; responsible for the prosperity of the various sections of the community, and of our industries, to take a special interest in this problem, so that our primary industry will be put in such a position that it will flourish in the post-war period or, at least, enjoy average production.</P>
    <P>It is well for people to realise now, that after the war conditions all round will probably be adverse, and that it will be very hard for this country to carry on.  It is now that an effort must be made if we are to be ready to face post-war conditions.  Some Deputies said that we should not accept British credit, and that if we export goods we should get goods in return.  The average farmer is prepared to take John Bull's I.O.U.  He is quite satisfied to do that.  Whether he is a dairy farmer or any other class of farmer, if he has anything to sell that he cannot dispose of here, and sells it to John Bull he is prepared, if he cannot get goods from John Bull, to take John Bull's I.O.U. as he is quite satisfied that it will be paid some day.  He may be wrong.  Many Deputies will argue that he is wrong for various reasons, but I am quite content to throw in my lot and to rely on the judgment of the ordinary farmer.  To my mind we are definitely bound up economically with Britain.  I do not think anybody realises that more than the members of the Government.  They made drastic efforts in the last ten years to get outside the economic relationship with Britain and could not.  I do not think any other set of men in their place will do so to any great extent in years to come.  Willy nilly we are bound up economically with Britain. I am afraid that we failed in the last few years to build up the greatest volume of trade that could be built up with that country, because the greater the volume of trade between the two countries, the greater will be the prosperity of both, and the better the relationship between the two peoples.  Let us, at least, when we are talking of the economic conditions of this country, get away from the trash that British credit is worth nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I do not want to go into any other matter except that to which I have referred. I am primarily interested in the agricultural industry of this country.  I am intimately concerned, myself, in the dairying industry, but I think that other Deputies in the House, who are members of the agricultural community, but who are not members of the dairying industry, can be quite certain in their minds that if the dairying industry goes under, it will have very serious effects on agriculture generally.  This is a matter that must engage the attention of the Taoiseach himself.  As head of the Government of this country, he must realise that an industry which is in such grave peril as the dairying industry of this country is in requires very drastic efforts to resuscitate it.  On a previous occasion I suggested that a committee should be set up&mdash;I said on that occasion that I was prepared to accept a committee, even, of Deputies of this House&mdash;to go into all the circumstances of the dairying industry in this country and consider it with open minds with a view to putting forward the best suggestions that they could for a solution of the problem.  I am quite certain that such a committee could arrive at a solution.  One of their suggestions might be&mdash;and I think it is going to come to that in the end&mdash;that there must be an economic price paid to the dairy farmer for his product.  If it is not done, then you are going to have what is now a rapid decay in the dairying industry becoming a complete runout.</P>
    <P>In connection with any barter arrangement that the Government may enter into, as I said already, I do not think you should try to make capital out of the export of our dairy heifers.  They will be sold, of course, and I do not want to stop anybody from selling them, because the farmer must sell something, but we should endeavour to persuade the farmer to keep his heifers so as to provide the raw material for the larger industry which should be there, and which we all hope will be there, in the coming years.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on this motion, but I take it that in any case Deputies who take even a passing interest in the present position of the country may be excused if, on a Vote of this kind, they refer again to matters that might have been dealt with previously on Estimates for the different Departments concerned.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that a certain amount of confusion is being caused in the country as to who is responsible for the things that are being done wrongly, or who is responsible for doing whatever planning is supposed to be done by the Government elected by the people of the country.  I read the local papers pretty carefully every week&mdash; the papers that circulate in my own constituency&mdash;and for some months past I notice that the people who are authorised to speak on the local bodies for the present Government Party, whenever a discussion arises in connection with the present position or with the effect of the different emergency Orders that are issued from time to time, are constantly blaming&mdash;and I can produce the papers to prove what I say&mdash;civil servants for the effect of these emergency Orders.  During a discussion, on a recent occasion, on the effect of Emergency Powers Order, No. 166, I noticed that leading spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party referred to this matter at a meeting of the Offaly County Council&mdash;one of them is a member of this House&mdash;and blamed &ldquo;the Civil Service brass hats&rdquo; for the policy enshrined in that Order.  Therefore, it is imperative, on an occasion of this kind, when we are discussing the Vote for which the head of the Government is responsible, that the <Col N="557" /> head of the Government, who is the Taoiseach, should make it clear to the House and to the country whether it is or is not the civil servants, or whether it is or is not the Ministers, who are responsible for implementing Government policy and for the issue of the various Orders under the Emergency Powers Acts.</P>
      <P>Now, the main responsibility for the state of affairs that exists in the country at the present time must be placed at the door or doors of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is also the Minister for Supplies, and the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been given charge of a Department and of the responsibility for finding a solution for our unemployment problem. The Minister who is now in charge of that Department informed us here in the House, many years ago, that he had a detailed plan for the solution of that problem.  I realise that when that plan was prepared the Minister did not take into consideration the situation with which the country is now confronted, but is it to be understood that the only solution for the problem of unemployment that is now before the country is the policy of emigration?  How many thousands of our able-bodied citizens were allowed to leave this country during the past 18 months or two years while, at the very same time, these people were required to produce more food and fuel for the country?  It is a terrible state of affairs, it is true&mdash;and we will see it carried to a greater extent as time goes on and as the harvest approaches &mdash;that the best class of rural workers to be found in this country were, during the past 18 months, leaving the areas where they were most badly needed.  If there has been a shortage of turf workers in any of the turf-cuting counties this year, it is due to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues in the Government made it possible, by their policy, for the people to leave the country when they should have been induced to remain at home.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is also responsible for the Wages Standstill Order, which has a good deal to do with the fact that such large numbers of our people are leaving this country.  They are leaving because they are unable to get the wages to maintain themselves and their dependents here at home which they are able to get in another country under war conditions.  Many of the able-bodied rural workers who have left this country in the last six months were able to go to England, with the permits given to them by the Government, and get three times the amount of wages they were offered here at home.  The issue of that Wages Standstill Order has caused a good deal of irritation amongst our working-class people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently admitted in the House that he was responsible for the chaos that we have in our transport industry.  The remarkable thing about that is that the Taoiseach, when speaking here on an amendment put down by Deputy Norton to the Emergency Powers Bill, did not appear to realise the seriousness of that problem &mdash;the effect which our uneconomic system of transport is having on the price the poor people in our cities and towns have to pay for fuel.  The Taoiseach spoke in a rather heated way, and charged the leader of this Party with going down to the country and telling the turf workers that they were not getting enough wages, and of coming back to the city and telling the poor people who have to pay 64/- a ton for turf that the price they are being charged is a scandal.  He challenged the members of this Party to indicate how that price of 64/- per ton could be reduced.  Is the Taoiseach aware&mdash;if <Col N="559" /> he is not he should be&mdash;that one-third of the mileage covered by the lorries taking turf from the turf-cutting counties to the cities is light running?  That costs something.  The cost of it has to be added to the price charged for the turf to the people in the cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to argue this on the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Perhaps I should explain what I mean by giving an example to the House.  Take the case of a lorry that is carrying four tons of turf.  The distance from the bog in the turf-cutting county to the city is 84 miles.  When loaded, the consumption of petrol is calculated to be ten miles to the gallon.  Transport experts calculated that the light running consumption is 12 miles to the gallon.  Therefore, there is a petrol wastage of seven gallons when the lorry is returning light from the city to the bog.  That means £1 or £1 1s., so that the wastage of that amount of petrol, on the return journey, has to be added to the price charged for the turf to the poor people in the City of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>While we have that wastage going on, we have at the same time thousands of tons of traffic here which the railway companies are unable to carry owing to the shortage of coal or some other necessary fuel. Why, in the name of goodness, cannot we have some central system of control that would eliminate that wastage? The 12,000 lorries operating on the <Col N="560" /> roads, when they come to the city with a load of turf, have to return idle. Why could not some system of control be introduced which would enable the lorries to take back a load to their own areas?  That would save the cost of petrol and, in fact, would enable the lorries to earn money. Instead, we have this wastage of petrol, the cost of which has to be added to the price which the poor in our cities have to pay for the turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to answer Back Benchers who probably have never given any consideration to this aspect of the question.  I would advise them to bring the matter up at their Party meeting next Thursday and ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to look into it.</P>

      <P>Is not that a very intelligent question to ask?  I suppose the only excuse that can be offered for it is the Deputy's ignorance of prevailing conditions in the city.  I want to assure the Deputy I do not mean that in any offensive way.  If we had in existence some sort of central control in regard to our transport system, we would not have this wastage of tyres and petrol at a time when, to use the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, this shortage of tyres and petrol is likely to lead to a major economic crisis.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy not answering the concluding speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  I am raising a question which was not properly dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I am asking the head of the Government, who appointed the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to tell the House whether anything is being done by that Minister, or by the Government as a whole, to put these things right. <Col N="561" /> If, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a shortage of tyres and petrol is likely to lead to a major economic crisis, can we be told what is being done by the Government to prevent that crisis coming about? Something, at any rate, should be done to deal with that situation before the crisis actually comes upon us.  I am merely referring to the matter now in order to make it clear to the Taoiseach&mdash;he challenged Deputy Norton to show how the price of turf could be reduced to the poor people of the city&mdash;that if the light running of lorries on the return journeys could be eliminated, it would, in my opinion, reduce the price of turf by 5/- a ton as a minimum.  In some cases, the reductions would range from 7/6 to 10/- a ton, according to the distances travelled by the lorries in taking turf from the turf-cutting counties to the cities.</P>
      <P>I had high hopes, when Deputy Flinn was put into the position of Turf Controller by the Government, that he would face up to the position of finding the necessary number of men required to provide fuel for our people during the coming critical six or 12 months.  I understand that 60,000 workers will be required to do that over a period of four or five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion that took place in the House some days ago on the appropriate Estimate, we were told that the maximum number of men employed at that time was 23,000.  On that basis it looks as if we are going to have a shortage of turf for the people during the coming winter and spring of next year.  Who is responsible for that state of affairs?  Does the Taoiseach put the blame for it on civil servants as some of his supporters in the country are, apparently, endeavouring to do?  Can we be told if there is a Cabinet Committee sitting for the purpose of dealing with this problem?  I suggest that it could be solved if given proper consideration by people who understand it. There has been a good deal of contention, and rightly so, in connection with the scandalously low rates of wages which are being paid to turf workers.  This has led to a considerable <Col N="562" /> number of persons refusing to take up that kind of employment.  Last year we had a good many men employed cutting turf for the Goodwill Fuel Company, the Irish Hospitals' Trust, and for co-operative societies.  I could cite one case that I have personal knowledge of myself.  If my statement is challenged I can give proof.  This was the case in which workers were employed by the Goodwill Fuel Company cutting turf in my constituency at £3 15s. a week.  As a result of an Order issued some time ago by the Turf Controller, those workers have been prevented from taking up that employment this year at that reasonably good rate of wages, and have been ordered by the Turf Controller to take up work with the county surveyor at 33/- a week for a 48-hour week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Deputy deal with that wage on the appropriate Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the matter now to suggest that the Emergency Powers Act has been used for the purpose of enforcing industrial conscription upon certain classes of workers in the turf-cutting areas, with the result that the number of men who could be employed on turf cutting, were it not for the issue of these ridiculous Orders made by the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues, could be considerably increased.  I think the production of turf could be considerably increased were it not for that kind of interference by the Turf Controller and for the fact that he was endeavouring for a long period, and failed in many cases, to impose that standard rate of wages on the workers in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a discussion this evening in connection with the agricultural position.  Some explanation must be given by somebody some time, whether the Minister for Agriculture or the Taoiseach, as to why in this agricultural country there is at present such a shortage of bacon, butter and eggs, and why we have such a high percentage of our people unable to buy these commodities even at any price. <Col N="563" /> The reason they are unable to buy bacon, butter, or eggs is because of the very low rate of wages which prevails over the country as a whole, and particularly in rural areas.  But the position is likely to get worse instead of better, so far as I can see.  The position of the pig industry is very serious in my constituency and the same thing applies to the dairying industry, which is gradually disappearing. Who is doing the planning or thinking in connection with these matters?  Is it civil servants in the Department of Agriculture or is it a Cabinet Committee?  It should be done by the Ministers elected by the representatives of the people in this House to do the job.  But the job is not being done, or the position would not be as it is to-day.</P>
    <P>The question of supplies has been discussed in this House over a period of four days, and all I want to say is that, if the Government had given financial assistance to the big industrial concerns of this country at the beginning of the emergency, the supplies position would not be as bad as it is to-day.  The Government, and the Minister responsible particularly, relied entirely upon private enterprise, and it is because they relied upon private enterprise and failed to give industrialists the necessary financial State guarantees that the supply position is serious to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one other matter, which may be regarded as of minor importance.  I am raising it because it is evident that the responsible Minister has failed to take any notice of the complaints made to him, both directly and here in the House, from time to time; and that is the question of what is the Government policy in connection with alien penetration.  I have been informed that representations have been made to the Minister for Justice by bodies like the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association and other bodies that the question of alien penetration is not being dealt with on proper lines.  The Taoiseach is well aware, as every Deputy must be aware, that within a <Col N="564" /> week after the outbreak of the war thousands of aliens came to this country and are rambling around this country ever since doing better for themselves than a big number of our own citizens and getting many privileges, so far as I know, which our own citizens apparently are not getting.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the policy of the Government in connection with the question of alien penetration and what is the procedure generally followed in dealing with the admission of aliens into this country, either directly from outside countries or by way of the Six Counties.  I was informed during the last few days that an alien arrived in this country some time ago <i>via</i> the Six Counties and succeeded, under false pretences, in getting a number of contracts of a valuable kind.  The alien concerned was unable to carry them out, but having received the contracts he passed them on to other people to get the work done.  I think there is pretty good reason for suspecting that some of these aliens are getting privileges to which they are not entitled.  I took note of a statement made by the Taoiseach when introducing the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs.  Dealing with this matter he said: &ldquo;Strangers become the object of suspicion,&rdquo; and that is generally true so far as these aliens in this country are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a tight grip held by the Government over aliens here and over their activities. I should like to have an assurance from the Taoiseach, who I am sure understands this problem very well because of his acquaintance with it as Minister for External Affairs, that if legislation cannot be tightened up to keep these aliens under a better system of control, something will be done, at any rate, to compel them to make public their activities and the influence which they exercise in the business life of this country.  Is the Taoiseach aware, for instance, of the thousands of shops in this city and other cities with Irish names over the doors where Irishmen have no influence whatever?  I have <Col N="565" /> been shown a list of shops in a number of streets in this city with such names as Murphy, O'Sullivan, and other well-known Irish names, where the business is actually being carried on by aliens. I think the legislation should be tightened up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is legislation in existence which, if administered properly, would compel these aliens who are carrying on business in this country to operate under their own names so that everybody would know who they are.  All I am suggesting is the tightening up or more efficient administration of existing legislation.  I have come across some of these aliens in connection with the administration of business concerns and, speaking for myself, at any rate, I want to say that they are bad employers, and introduce a very bad influence into the business life of this country.  I do not want to go any further into the matter than to appeal to the Taoiseach to look into it and to see to it that any legislation at present in existence for keeping effective control over aliens coming into the country and over their operations while in this country with the goodwill of the Government will be administered as effectively as it possibly can be in the interests of the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am availing of the Taoiseach's presence here to say a few words in connection with this Vote. In the first place I want to refer to the dairying industry.  I am aware that representatives of the dairying industry met the Taoiseach some time ago and put every aspect of the case before him, and that recently a deputation met the Minister for Agriculture and put before him new facts in connection with the whole problem.  A good many people are very concerned about the condition of the dairying industry and its decline.  I do not intend to go into figures, but we know what the condition of the pig industry is.  In country towns at present you cannot get bacon. Is the dairying industry to be allowed to get into the same position?  The country cannot do without the dairying <Col N="566" /> industry and, apart from the dairying industry, it cannot do without the young stock.  I know it has been the policy of the Government to restrict bacon and butter production because they did not want an exportable surplus as they did not consider the price in the export market was sufficiently attractive.  That is quite true; it was not attractive.  The price paid to-day for bacon and butter does not cover the cost of production.  This year the farmers are supposed to get 7d. a gallon for the milk which is converted into butter.  The British farmer can get the equivalent of 1/6 a gallon for his milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately, or unfortunately, he has not to export it to another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the British farmer, the milk is not converted into butter.  What is being paid to our farmers for milk does not cover the cost of production and one of the results of that is that our young stock are being exported and farmers are turning their attention to other forms of agricultural industry.  The farmers are certainly cutting down the numbers of dairy stock.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to review the situation before it is too late.  He should endeavour to see that a better price is given to dairy farmers.  Anybody who understands the dairying industry is aware that it involves hard work, late and early.  People in the towns and cities can have their half-days, but those engaged at farm work have to be on the farm at all hours of the day. They have not a 9-hour day or 6-day week; they have to carry on, day in, day out.  The farmers should get a more attractive price for milk.  If they do not, the dairying industry will go down like the pig industry.  The Government should take some action before the dairying industry reaches the stage at which we see the pig industry to-day.  There is not much likelihood of the pig population reaching normal figures for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain matters troubling the producing elements among the agricultural community. The Taoiseach was rather <Col N="567" /> quick on the up-take when Deputy Hughes was speaking.  I should like to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the statement that we are going to export our Shorthorn heifers.  If we are, I suggest that we should estimate their value properly and those animals should not be allowed to go over as ordinary stores.  I am not saying that many of those animals are going to be exported.  As a matter of fact, the population of dairy Shorthorn heifers is limited.  For a very long time the Shorthorn was not so much in favour, except in a few areas.  Generally in beef-producing areas the Whitehead and the Polly were in great favour. Now there will be a demand for the dairy Shorthorn and, if we are going to export it, it will have some bargaining power.  I do not say that we should export it&mdash;I am not dealing with that aspect&mdash;but if we do, it will have a definite bargaining power.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Supplies did not elaborate his statement that our bargaining power is nil.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will be a little bit more hopeful in that respect.  I can foresee a very gloomy situation.  We have not enough bacon or butter and there are not enough eggs.  I doubt if we have sufficient of these commodities to meet our own requirements.  If we even eliminate the people mentioned by Deputy Davin, the people who are not able to buy, those who are able to buy will not be able to get the goods.  I know shops and even chain stores that cannot get bacon.  I wonder how anybody can visualise the future with composure?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that we have practically lost our foreign investments, that we cannot put our finger on the £170,000,000 that we had in foreign investments.  I should like the Taoiseach to explain how we are to get over that difficulty. I regret that I was not able to take part in that aspect of the discussions on the Central Bank Bill.  If the £170,000,000 that we have invested abroad is to be frozen for the time being, how are we going to plan for post-war developments?  That is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry gave some useful <Col N="568" /> figures.  Before the war we imported 500,000 tons of feeding stuffs.  He said that, in addition, 100,000 tons came from milling offals of wheat.  I would be prepared to put that figure at 200,000 tons.  That represents 700,000 tons of feeding stuffs that we have not available now. Our increase in barley and oats, if we average the crop at one ton an acre, gave us about 250,000 tons, not much more than one-third of what we have lost.  From the start of the war I have realised that our main agricultural problem was, not only to make good the human food but to make good the live-stock food, because live-stock food becomes human food in the shape of bacon, eggs, poultry, beef, butter, etc.  I think there was bad planning in regard to this matter, for which the Minister for Agriculture is responsible to this House.  The Government did not apply itself to the task and say: &ldquo;We must get it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am going to show the Taoiseach the flaw in it.  We want 650,000 acres under wheat, but farmers can comply with the Tillage Order without growing a grain of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they grew, I think, 585,000 acres this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying we should not do it, but I am arguing that there was not proper planning.  The Government should plan for an acreage under wheat to produce enough bread, for an acreage under crops that will provide feeding-stuffs in substitution for the 700,000 tons they lost, and for the maintenance of the live-stock population. Because of their neglect to do that, we are to-day without bacon, without butter or, at least, without <Col N="569" /> sufficient quantities of butter, without eggs and, according to the Minister for Supplies, because of the neglect to maintain the live-stock population, the Government have lost their bargaining power.  I could rake up, as I have done before, the point that artificials were not stored here.  In a long war, I think if artificials were stored here they would deteriorate to a considerable extent and a time would come when they would be exhausted.  We have to rely on whatever substitute we have for artificials in this country.  I do not know if we have any.  Our only mainstay is farmyard manure.  That is where the value of live-stock comes in. If we cannot keep up a sufficient supply of farmyard manure, no matter what effort we make, no matter what area we put under the plough, the law of diminishing returns will operate and a time will come when, no matter what effort we make, our production will decline.</P>
      <P>I want the Taoiseach to think this point over: the key to the problem of food production is the maintenance of our live-stock population and the production of sufficient farmyard manure. The Taoiseach may not be a practical farmer, but he can put this to any practical farmer friend of his&mdash;that one acre properly tilled and manured is worth ten acres scamped over.  We have only one source of supply now, namely, live-stock.  I remember reading a speech delivered by the Taoiseach, I think at Tullamore, a year or two ago, in which he said if it comes to a choice between the people and the live-stock, the live-stock must perish.  In a sense, yes, and in a sense, no.  That question is one that would face a besieged garrison.  A soldier might kill his faithful horse in order to get a square meal for his comrades and himself, but that is the last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not that the purpose of that speech&mdash;to get the people to do exactly what the Deputy is advocating?  Was it not the point that if they did not produce food for the live-stock and if there was only a certain amount of food left, what was left would have to go to the humans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, no.  They said you must put 25 per cent. of your land under the plough for this year, but a farmer could sow white turnips in 25 per cent. of his land, and what good would that be?  He would be within the law.  We could grow too much potatoes and not enough wheat; we could grow too much wheat and not enough potatoes and oats.  I think the Taoiseach was quite right, and that it was his duty, to interfere with the farmers so that the land of this country would be used for the production of food.  We are on common ground there.  But why not go further and plan what the nation wanted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that money was wasted and that there was too much public service given to this business of allotments.  Of course, it was good political stuff.  You need never have any anxiety about cabbage and potatoes and little things like that.  There will be always enough of them grown here.  The food problem here was in relation to wheat, oats and barley and there was no provision made for putting any percentage of our land under wheat, oats and barley. There was provision made for 25 per cent. of the land to be tilled.  I want to put this question to the Taoiseach: having 20 per cent. of tillage last year, was there enough wheat, oats and barley?  We were short of wheat, short of oats, and short of barley both for feeding and for brewing.  There is a shortage of stout and porter at the present time because there was not enough barley and there is a shortage of the by-products of brewing which are used as feeding stuffs for dairy cows and which, around Dublin, constitute one of the principal feeding stuffs for dairy cows.  There is a shortage even now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was a mistake to aim so low.  It was a mistake to aim at just enough wheat to give us a 100 per cent. extraction loaf.  We should have aimed <Col N="571" /> at a 70 per cent. extraction loaf and, if we got that, we would have saved 200,000 tons of feeding stuffs, so vitally important for the production of milk, pork and bacon.  If we did not reach our goal, like throwing the rings at a racecourse in the country, if we did not reach the high mark at which we threw the ring, we would catch in something before reaching the bottom.  If we aimed at enough wheat to give a 70 per cent. extraction loaf, no matter what happened, we would get enough to give us a 100 per cent. extraction loaf.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin, who has spent all his life dealing with transport, was discussing transport when I entered the House.  Deputy O'Sullivan singled out two Ministers who, in his opinion, have not acquitted themselves with distinction in their ministries&mdash;the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture.  A year ago I was one of a deputation from the Dublin Corporation to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government on the question of food and fuel.  The discussion was not long in progress before we all agreed that the food position was fairly satisfactory and gave nothing very much to worry about, but that the fuel position was bad and was causing the Government great anxiety.  That was a year ago.  At that time the Taoiseach informed us that the Government was getting in 1,500 tons of turf into Dublin and Dún Laoghaire per day, and that Dublin and Dún Laoghaire were two places about which the Government were anxious at that time. They saw great difficulty in supplying these two places with fuel.  There is less petrol to-day, less coal, and, I think, less reserves of fuel in both Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  Transport forms the bottle neck of the whole position.</P>
    <P>I should have said that the Taoiseach got a request from the Borough Council of Dún Laoghaire to receive a deputation about the food and fuel position&mdash;the Taoiseach smiles, but I do not know why this matter should be a subject for laughter&mdash;about a fortnight ago and he has not granted that interview yet.  This morning I got a letter from a man in Wicklow in which he <Col N="572" /> says that lorries are sent from Dublin to Brecknock, at the base of Lugnaquilla. The double journey, there and back, is 100 miles and the lorries each bring back four tons of turf.  The same Ministry refuses to give petrol for the transport of wood to Dún Laoghaire, although three journeys could be covered and on each journey six tons of timber could be carried, if petrol sufficient for a haul of two miles were made available.  It is calculated that it would take 14 gallons of petrol to bring four tons of turf to Dún Laoghaire from the district which I have mentioned, whereas 18 tons of wood fuel could be brought to Dún Laoghaire with a similar quantity of petrol. The Minister for Supplies will not give 14 gallons of petrol to bring 18 tons of wood to Dún Laoghaire but he will give 14 gallons of petrol to bring four tons of turf there.</P>

I am not bringing before his notice any class of timber belonging to any particular person.  I am dealing entirely with the use of petrol and I say deliberately that the Ministry of Supplies has given 14 gallons of petrol, which is used to transport four tons of turf to Dún Laoghaire, while it refuses to give a similar quantity which could transport 18 tons of wood fuel there.  If petrol is our life blood at the moment, so far as transport is concerned, then I submit that is a waste of petrol. I am not going to say what should happen to the Minister concerned, but I am bringing it before the Taoiseach's notice, and the suggestion he has made satisfies me.

I do not want to prolong the debate, but the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, raised an interesting point when he said that our surplus population who go over to work in Great Britain get slips of paper in payment for that work but are prevented from buying up the food there, so they come back here and, with those bits of paper, buy up our reserves of food here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this consideration to the Taoiseach, because it really ought to be a matter of Government policy.  We are to hold those elections this year under difficulties never previously experienced in the lifetime of most of us.  There will be no transport available for the purpose of bringing voters to the polling booths; there will be no transport available for the purpose of bringing speakers to the different meetings; there will be only limited paper supplies available for the purpose of making appeals to the electorate.  All those difficulties will be capped by a new system of local government which, if anything, is likely to damp enthusiasm on the part of public-spirited people to serve on local councils, because complete control of most matters is in the hands of county managers.  Those are difficulties which, I think, will result in persons having very little interest in the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable, therefore, that the elections should be held under such circumstances as will induce the maximum number of electors to record their votes.  The difficulty about holding those elections on a week-day is that most folk at that time of the year will be attending to their own private business.  Local elections which are not enthusiastically carried out will probably produce a kind of deadening of conscience in respect of the necessity to vote.  I should say, therefore, that an ordinary week-day poll would not be a good poll, and you might get an unrepresentative result. The 15th August is a Catholic holiday, a day upon which many people would, in any case, be absent from their business, particularly in the rural areas. That is a day upon which people in the rural areas will come into the towns to attend to their religious duties.  Unless there is some difficulty which I cannot comprehend and cannot at this stage foresee, I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he might give consideration to the question of holding the local elections on that Catholic <Col N="578" /> holiday, which, in rural areas and in some small provincial towns, is virtually a day of abstention from work.</P>

      <P>Yes, but at that stage and up to now we believed that we would get an opportunity of knowing the date.  We have not got that opportunity and, if the House adjourns this week, we will have no opportunity of expressing any further opinion on the matter.  I would urge the Taoiseach to give careful consideration to the desirability of selecting that date for the holding of the local elections.  It is the date upon which we are most likely to get the greatest number of people to vote.  Having regard to the difficulties which are confronting us at the moment, insuperable difficulties, apparently, in regard to paper and transport, even the advantages which would accrue from holding the elections on that date would help in some measure to outweigh the disadvantages flowing from those unusual circumstances.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 36, at the end of Section 8 to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) by the insertion after sub-section (8) of the following sub-section that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(9) Whenever a person is convicted of an offence in respect of <Col N="579" /> which any Order, made by virtue of sub-section (6) (A), is in force at the time the offence is committed and is awarded punishment either by way of fine, imprisonment or fine and imprisonment under or in accordance with such Order and such person appeals to the Circuit Court the judge of the Circuit Court on the hearing of such appeal may, though affirming such conviction, if satisfied that by reason of the trivial nature of the offence or by reason of extenuating circumstances such punishment should be remitted, varied or reduced, remit, vary in any way or reduce to any degree such punishment and generally make such order as may be necessary for the purpose of doing justice in the case before the court and shall in every case in which the fine or imprisonment is reduced below the minimum specified state in the order of the court the extenuating circumstances or the circumstances which reduce the offence to one of a trivial nature.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of this measure, if not on the Second Reading, mention was made of the consideration by a Minister of State of the sentence that would be imposed on a person under this section.  It is an unusual section in many respects.  In the first place, it gives power to the Government to make an Order, whenever and so often as they think fit, fixing what is called a minimum penalty in respect of particular offences.</P>
    <P>To fix a penalty, described as a minimum penalty, is really to fix a maximum penalty, because the discretion is taken from the court.  A penalty of not less than a specified amount must, on conviction, be imposed. All the court has to do is to fix the penalty in accordance with the Order made by the Executive. That being the situation, this amendment proposes that there should be an appeal <Col N="580" /> to the Circuit Court.  An appeal of this nature is not without precedent.  In a previous statute to correct certain abuses, a very severe penalty was provided.  But the statute gave authority to the district justice to exercise his discretion as to whether the case was serious or trivial.  If the justice considered that it was a serious matter, the person convicted had a right of appeal to the Circuit Court. Alternatively, if counsel for the State or the Attorney-General considered that it was not a trivial case, and the justice had decided to the contrary, it was open to the State to appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The advantage of this amendment is that it keeps the administration of justice within the ambit of the court. A person is tried in open court; he is convicted in open court; he appeals from that decision to another court and the case is there tried in open court again.  Compare that situation, which this amendment seeks to establish, with the situation in which appeal is made to the Minister.  The Minister does not sit in court; he may, or may not, hear evidence; he may remit, or decline to remit, the penalty and he need give no reason for any action he takes.  That is an undesirable situation.  It is quite true that the Executive has power to review the sentences of the courts, but it is not desirable or advisable that they should indulge in that function. If they do, it leaves the charge open that, if a person has influence, he may exercise it in this regard.  It is very undesirable that that should be the keynote of our legislation.</P>
    <P>So far as this measure is concerned and so far as the objects which it is designed to ensure are concerned, it is very desirable that prosecutions should take place in open court.  It is still more desirable that any remission, arising out of a reconsideration of these cases, should be the result of proceedings in open court.  There is no reason why it should not.  There is every reason why it should.  Any Minister of State has quite sufficient work to do without reviewing or reconsidering cases previously considered by the <Col N="581" /> court.  There may be an exception to that.  Additional evidence may, for example, be forthcoming but it would be a sad thing if an impression were to get currency in the country that, no matter what the decision of a court might be, it would be possible to have that decision varied and convictions, perhaps, remitted by Ministers.  One of the first things that will happen as a result of declining to permit the courts to consider the penalties in those cases will be that people will get it into their minds that it will not matter what may happen in the courts if one has sufficient influence to have the case reconsidered in the Ministerial chamber.  That would be highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan sought to get some material on which to base a case for this amendment and he gave notice of a series of questions which would enable him to appraise the events of the past few years so far as these cases are concerned.  To our mind, this is a very serious break with the ordinary, established administration of the law. It is no excuse for the Government to say that they are really determined to wipe out black marketing.  One has only got to inquire from any citizen outside as to what his experience has been and what his knowledge is of black marketing to get the answer to that statement.  One has only got to look at the reports of prosecutions in the newspapers to see how negligible their number has been in this connection. A Minister, in the course of his statement on this measure, said he did not expect that there would be one prosecution out of 20 offences.  In other words, 19 persons out of 20 would have a full fling in connection with black marketing.  I venture to say that the Minister would have been much more correct if he had referred to one prosecution in a thousand.  That would be more in keeping with the view outside. So far as the putting down of black marketing is concerned, no body is more anxious that that should be done than the Party on these benches is.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied that it will be accomplished by this method and we have said so.  Here we have simply increased the penalty.  When the <Col N="582" /> penalty was small there was an easy method of effecting a prosecution and securing conviction.  It is said that it has absolutely failed.  If a minimum price of £100 is to be the minimum penalty, is it likely that the number of prosecutions will increase?  Will that stop the black marketing?</P>
    <P>One of the ways I suggest for dealing with a matter of this sort is to satisfy all the people of the country that the administration of the law is above reproach, that the courts are open to everybody for fair consideration of every man's case, that political influence or influence of any other sort or kind does not operate and will not be allowed to operate in the courts, that the matter is considered and decided on the evidence before the court and that there is no such thing as a star chamber.  They must be assured that consideration of a claim against a man, or of a man's appeal, is held in open court with the fullest possible publicity, and that there is fair play and justice for everybody.  It is in these circumstances that we have put down this motion, which we hope would mitigate to some extent the unfortunate tendency disclosed in this new section.  What would be, to our minds, a very serious abuse of power would be corrected.  The administration of law and of justice should take place in the courts, and this House should be against any star chamber consideration of appeals or remissions, or anything of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any half-way house possible in this case.  As I pointed out on the last day, the idea of introducing minimum penalties was accepted by the Government only after the fullest possible consideration.  The fullest weight was given to all the considerations that have been mentioned here since the Bill was introduced.  We must do our utmost to safeguard the community in the present emergency.  As I have pointed out, if justices give an indication of the public appreciation of the gravity of offences by imposing penalties which appear&mdash;on the surface at any rate, having regard to the seriousness of the situation&mdash;as trifling <Col N="583" /> penalties, there is no use in our trying to impress the public with the seriousness of the offence, and there is no hope that, by public opinion, we will deter those who want to make money out of the present situation.  The idea of making it possible for the Government to prescribe, by Order, minimum penalties in certain cases is considered helpful, in the opinion of the Ministers responsible&mdash;whether it be the Minister for Supplies, in regard to black marketing, or the Minister for Agriculture, in regard to agriculture.</P>
      <P>The first idea of which we must disabuse ourselves is the false notion that we are prescribing here a definite minimum fine of £100 in all cases.  We are not doing anything of the kind.  We are making it possible to have the Government make, by Order, a suitable minimum penalty relating to the offence, in such cases as they think it advisable to prescribe such a minimum fine.  We are saying that, no matter how grave an offence and no matter how they may be disposed to increase the minimum penalty, they cannot go beyond £100.  That is one thing we must be clear about.  They may consider that the offence is one in which the minimum might be much less&mdash;we do not know at this particular stage; they have to decide that&mdash;and all we say is that they cannot go beyond £100.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the whole merits of this matter, as we debated them already on the Second Stage of the Bill to a certain extent, and still more on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>The point in this particular amendment is to introduce the Circuit Court as a court of appeal.  The example of certain licensing provisions has been quoted, but if we go back to find out how that has worked, we find that, as far as the State taking the appeal is concerned, it was absolutely a dead letter.  This is one of those examples where you must have the whole or none at all.  You must have the minimum fine prescribed and it must be the duty of the court to find whether or not the offence was committed, with no option to go below the minimum prescribed, but with permission to go <Col N="584" /> well above the minimum if the case is sufficiently serious.  When the minimum is fixed, as it will be for some cases, and where it appears that the minimum is far less than should be awarded for the crime committed, I hope the court will not hesitate to go well above the penalty.  I hope that the suggestion that the minimum would be the maximum will prove to be absolutely unfounded.</P>
    <P>In a time of crisis like this, the safeguarding of the community as a whole is a task which has to be appreciated by the Government, and they will, by fixing the minimum, indicate their opinion of the least punishment that should be given for a definite class of offences.  If there are cases which deserve far greater penalties, I hope that the justices will go up to the maximum prescribed by legislation.  We feel that this is a matter for appreciation by the Government, and that we cannot leave it to justices&mdash;whether district justices or Circuit Court judges &mdash;to express their appreciation of the public need and public danger.  As I have said several times&mdash;and this is one of the arguments, of course, against the Bill&mdash;if there should happen to be an occasional case in which there are such extenuating circumstances as would, in fact, justify a mitigation or diminution of the fine, it will have to be dealt with in the usual way in which such cases are dealt with.  The recommendation for mitigation will go to the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I do not at all see this crop of appeals coming forward, because if, notwithstanding the publicity there has been about the black market, there are people who are found guilty of overcharging, or otherwise using this time of emergency for their own private advantage, I hope the Minister for Justice will be particularly severe, and will not reduce the penalties, unless he is absolutely convinced that the circumstances of the case were such as to involve a grave injustice, if the penalty were not reduced.  When speaking about grave injustice, we must remember that, on the one hand, it is the community who must be protected, and, on the other, the individual <Col N="585" /> who, as a member of the community, ought to make it his business, in a time like this, to co-operate in the general interest.  If, either through negligence or otherwise, he does not do so, the needs of the community are to be put above his particular interest.</P>
    <P>I admit that there may be occasional cases of grave hardship&mdash;although I think they will be very few&mdash;and I do not know that you could even speak of injustice in such cases.  It is a very nice point as to whether, when the interest of the community as a whole has to be safeguarded, if a certain hardship, not intended or designed by the community, but which is incidental to the measures which the community must take to safeguard itself, arises in relation to a particular individual, you can speak of injustice, but I will say that, if there is a hardship which those responsible, the Legislature, would, on consideration of a particular case, think too great, the only representative of the Legislature left in such a case is the Minister for Justice, because we would undoubtedly fall between two stools otherwise.  We would have, in respect of cases in which big money was being made, all the expense and delay of appeals, and, finally, we would have a position in which the public need was to be estimated by a judge, rather than by those who have the responsibility for estimating that public need, namely, in the present circumstances, the Government.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a purely emergency measure.  I think that, in the ordinary law, there are a few precedents for this type of proceeding.  I have said that we are not at all anxious to have it, but the position in relation to the public need is such that we think the possibility of the few cases of hardship, which, in the long run, can be dealt with by way of mitigation by the Minister for Justice, ought not to be held sufficient completely to deter us from this line of action.  I am sorry that I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a case of the Government, in very difficult circumstances in which not only the assistance <Col N="586" /> of everybody but the intelligent outlook of everybody in the country is required to carry on, to get us through our difficulties and to deal with any objectionable practices that prevail, in which the strength and intelligence of the people as a whole are required to settle the matters complained of here, carrying instead of realising that fact, into this particular realm that which has been wrong with them all along: they have no confidence in anybody in the country to do anything.  There is no confidence in the judges or justices to estimate the gravity of a particular offence, or its reactions on general public policy.  Deputy Costello, on the Committee Stage, dealt very fully with the objection to the new principle of the Bill, that is, the principle of minimum penalties, and I do not want to discuss that matter further in view of the downright statement of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, however, did say that the appeal in this matter would be to the Minister for Justice.  I should like to know if that is so.  There are very many matters affecting various Departments which are likely to be covered by this, and is it a fact that the Minister for Justice will be the person who will sit as judge of these cases in which there is an appeal, who will examine the facts and consider any mitigating circumstances, or will the Minister for Agriculture deal with matters affecting agriculture and the Minister for Supplies with supplies? Is it the position that the Minister for Justice, before coming to a decision, will have to refer these cases to the Government to get the Government's view?  Is this a matter in which the Government, not trusting anybody to do his own work, will also not trust the Minister for Justice to do his?  Will these cases be considered from the point of view of justice and the particular cases, or will the Minister for Justice, in his examination of these matters, be subject to the opinion and the direction of the Government, or of any particular Minister, such as the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Supplies?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has suggested that there is not a <Col N="587" /> Deputy of any Party who would not be behind the Government, in the particular circumstances prevailing, in ensuring that the people generally will have a sufficiency, so far as it can be provided, of food, in ensuring the provision of as many of the essentials of daily life as can be provided and the proper distribution of these essentials. Every Deputy will go that distance and will make every effort to support the Government in that respect, but this section we seek to amend is obnoxious to a great many people, and from the speeches of the Taoiseach, I think he is not greatly enamoured of it.  Some of us have suggested that it is not essential that the powers of considering extenuating circumstances should be taken away from the justices and, looking at it in another light, it is not at all good for the country that we should set up a principle here that under any circumstances the justices should be limited in their discretion or jurisdiction. That is the main objection which some of us have to this section.  The amendment is an attempt to mitigate the evils we see in the section and an attempt to provide, if we cannot get our own way and have the section deleted, that matters in dispute shall be submitted to another set of judges to decide whether the justice, in the first instance, was right in considering extenuating circumstances when deciding on the penalty.  I think it right that there should be some arbiter other than a Minister in that respect, and it is on that ground the amendment is put forward.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked whether the Minister for Justice is to be the Minister to decide such appeals as may come in.  In law he is, but naturally, in coming to a decision in cases such as this, he would want to get as much information as he could before coming to a decision, and naturally would communicate with the Minister in charge of the particular Department affected.  If it affected the Department of Supplies he would get in touch with the Minister for Supplies to find out what he had to say.  It would be the same if the Department <Col N="588" /> of Agriculture were affected.  On the other hand, there is full and complete responsibility on the Government for policy as a whole.  You could not carry on as a Government, if there were violent conflict between two Departments, without having some method of adjusting and settling it.  I do not think anything like that will arise, but if there were very definite and rather strong differences of view between two Departments&mdash;although the Minister for Justice is responsible&mdash;and the situation developed to such an extent that it interfered with the general harmony that should exist amongst members of the Government, then it would have to be settled in the way in which these things ordinarily are settled.</P>
      <P>There is a variety of ways by which differences of that sort are adjusted. Sometimes the head of the Government might be brought in with a view to adjusting the differences and, at other times, if he were not able to do that, then it might be a question of having the matter definitely decided by the Government.  That is assuming that things were going to get into a very bad position indeed.  The responsibility is with the Minister for Justice, and where any case occurs, he will have, so to speak, to exercise his judgment by getting all the facts and satisfying himself that in the particular case in question the mitigating circumstances would justify him in running counter to the general view that had been expressed either by Supplies or some other Department, in regard to fixing a definite minimum fine for a definite offence.  I should add that if he had representations from justices he would naturally take these into account.</P>

In the Deputy's view &ldquo;default&rdquo; might cover not only the date but the act, or it might cover both.  That was not the view taken by those who drafted the measure.  It is a question whether that view is right or not.  We are in the position now that we can remove the doubt. I am grateful to the Deputy who raised it in that particular way.  It escaped my personal notice, but I think it is desirable, if there is any possibility of doubt, even though it might be held by the Department that the courts would hold in only one way, that we take the opportunity to put all doubts at rest, and it is for that purpose I have introduced the amendment to separate the act which is to be performed from the date.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the remarks of the Taoiseach with regard to the position that the Minister for Justice holds now, I think we might leave the Minister for Justice out.  Apparently decisions are going to be taken on questions of policy and not so much on questions of justice.  It only shows the position we are likely to get in a <Col N="590" /> measure like this, and we must let time show exactly what that position will be.  I want to draw attention to a very remarkable use of the Emergency Powers Act that has just taken place, in order to ask how far the use of that Act is likely to go in this direction. Emergency Powers Order No. 194, dated July 7th, provides that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person by legal proceedings (whether instituted before or after the making of this Order) in any court or by any other means (a) to enforce or attempt to enforce any contract to which this Order applies, or to recover or attempt to recover damages for any breach or alleged breach by Irish Steel, Limited, of any such contract, etc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of the Order is that no action can be taken against Irish Steel, Limited, for any arrears of salary, any arrears of fees, or any arrears of commission of any kind that may be due by Irish Steel, Limited, nor will it be possible for anybody with whom Irish Steel, Limited, has broken a contract to take any legal proceedings either to get a contract carried out or to recover any money due under a contract, or to recover any money that may be due as a result of any debentures or debenture stock which they held, and generally that Irish Steel, Limited, shall not be brought into court on any matter connected with any contract or anything they owe.  A number of things have injured credit in this country, but that does not come under the Emergency Powers Bill and cannot, I suppose, be referred to now.  Is there anything more likely to injure credit with regard to industrial or commercial concerns than to have the Government utilising the Emergency Powers Act to step in in the case of people who either have debentures, fees or salaries owing to them, or who have contracts of any form, and to find themselves prevented suddenly from getting their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument may be that this is a very important concern and that the security of the people as a whole has to be guarded.  Surely it is likely, even during the emergency, that industries of one kind or another will be looking <Col N="591" /> for credit, and will have to get credit if they are to carry on, and if the security of the people in other directions is to be made certain.  What likelihood is there of people readily investing money which is likely to be affected in this particular way when the more important the industry is the more likely is it that the Government will take such an interest in it as to come into the picture in this way?  This is a most remarkable and a most unanticipated use of the Emergency Powers Order, apart altogether from the machinery used.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to have some kind of an explanation of why this Order is used, and that we ought to have some kind of an idea as to whether this is a type of thing which the Government feel that they are likely to have to use in any other cases, because, if so, then this should not be slipped out as one of the many hundreds of emergency and sub-emergency Orders that are finding their way into our hands and that may or may not be read.  I think that the Order is a very remarkable one and that it is proper to call attention to it here and ask for an explanation of it and a comment as to what it implies in regard to Government policy or Government action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in protest against this Order. Years ago, in industrial life, when a company came out they floated ordinary shares and preference shares, and then, if they got into difficulties, they floated a debenture and that was very often considered sharp practice by some of the people who held ordinary and preference stock; but one of the things which a debenture, in return for a very low rate of interest, had to recommend it was its absolute security. Are the Government going to come along and add another step to that scale and do away with the security of the debenture holders?  One of the securities of the debenture holders is, or was, that the whole concern could be sold up in the debenture holders' interest.  That might <Col N="592" /> seem to be a very harsh way of doing business, but it was part of the debenture security and bond.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach, what are the extraordinary circumstances in this case which prevent the debenture holders being allowed to take any remedy that they think they may have in their hands?  Let us say that it is the case of an ordinary commercial concern which has got into difficulties. If the law were allowed to take its ordinary course, the concern, probably, would be sold up by the debenture holders and purchased by somebody at market value.  Why can not the Government do that in this case and have a proper arrangement? Why should something extraordinary and outside the ordinary course of the law take place?  It is a most undesirable precedent.  Mind you, expressed in its simplest form, it is cheating the previous debenture holders of something which they possessed or thought that they possessed.  I should like to put that aspect before the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in this Order they say that by this provision&mdash;whether you call it a moratorium or whatever you like to call it&mdash;the debenture holders will not be allowed to exercise their rights.  It is put down in this Order that this will not take place with any subsequent issues of debentures.  How far are the ordinary public going to rely on that?  Expressed in its simplest form again, it means: &ldquo;I cheated you once but I will not cheat you again if you put up the money a second time.&rdquo;  I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that this is a horrible practice.  Mind you, I could understand that, in the case of an emergency, the interests of the debenture holders might have to be swept aside.  If the interests of the country suggested that they should be swept aside.  I would certainly be prepared to recommend it, but this is merely a case of taking their money from them and then preventing them from realising any more.  I wish to add my protest in regard to this matter.  It seems to me to smack very much of the emergency powers, referred to earlier, in connection with an individual who may commit an offence for which, by the <Col N="593" /> time he is tried, there may be quite a different penalty.  Now, apparently, capital is brought under the same principle: that the money is put up on one understanding, and then, before the finish, quite another set of circumstances have arisen.  I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms against such a practice.</P>

      <P>I am not protesting against the ruling of the Chair in that connection, but I do say that this is a matter of very great detail.  I know that the question of getting a steel mill going for the production of steel in this country has occupied the attention of successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce.  I think it was actually when the present Minister for Supplies was formerly Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was occupying his attention.  Then, when the present Minister for Local Government was Minister for Industry and Commerce it occupied his time, and finally it has occupied the time of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The importance of getting steel produced in this country is clear to everybody. There was a mill that was in a position <Col N="594" /> to supply a certain amount of steel, and it was desirable that the public interest should be served by getting that mill going.  There was a lot of detail in connection with the affairs of the company, and so on, which needed very careful examination, and the successive Ministers were trying to get some way in which they could get this disentangled.</P>
      <P>Finally, with regard to a trade loan, it was essential that a trade loan would, in fact, be used for getting the mill going and not for some other purpose. It is in order to protect public money that this particular Order has been made.  It would take a considerable time to deal with this particular case and to put all the facts before the House.  I do not want to deal partially with it.  If the matter came up on an annulment motion the House would have a full opportunity of hearing what the Minister had to say, and I have not the slightest doubt that when Deputies had heard him they would be satisfied that the measures which he has taken through this Order were necessary.  I do not feel that, at this stage, I should go into the matter. I would require a certain amount of notice to get all the details.  If the matter were to be debated properly, and if all the details were to be presented to the House, you would need, I think, to have that done by way of a motion.</P>

      <P>I should like, in view of the importance which planning is now playing in the life of the nations which are affected by the world's military conflict and of the importance it is recognised to have in the post-war period, to raise with the Taoiseach the desirability of planning immediately in order that we may escape the worst ravages of the war and may, by projecting our vision into the future, be able to lay plans which may ensure that after the war we are not left far behind under the new orders and new systems which have already heralded their coming.  The most vital problem is, of course, to plan for to-day, to try to succour our people from the hardships which are inevitably being inflicted on them by the unplanned system of the society in which we live.  The Taoiseach, when in opposition, used to be a firm and ardent advocate of the necessity for the establishment of an economic council.  A short acquaintance with the Government Council Chamber, and a short tenancy on the Government Front Bench, apparently sufficed to induce him to throw completely overboard his earlier and, I think, more sensible affection for the establishment of an economic council for the regulation of our national life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was convinced at one time that a nation in our circumstances needed an economic council and an economic G.H.Q.  If he had remained in opposition he would have been an ardent advocate of the necessity for the establishment of an economic council, but, having attained the eminence which membership of the Government Front Bench gives, he has completely abandoned his earlier enthusiasm and, apparently, evolved a complacent point of view on the whole question, a complacency which was expressed by his belief that each Minister was an economic council in himself, and that his officials were, in fact, the G.H.Q. staff of the economic council.  If that has been the position during the past ten years, it was surely <Col N="597" /> the position during the previous ten years, because in the first decade of our separate national existence we had Ministers, and we had civil servants who acted as the implements of their policy.  It cannot be denied that the Ministers from 1922 to 1932 had as many tedious and difficult problems to deal with as the Ministers from 1932 to 1942.  For the Taoiseach then to pretend that Ministers represent his desideratum in the matter of the establishment of an economic council, and that their staff represent what he had in mind when he talked about a G.H.Q. staff, is simply to ignore the realities of life in this country.</P>
    <P>Early on in the emergency situation we urged, by a motion in this House, that in order to plan adequately, to survey the nation's potentialities and to devise ways and means by which the worst evils of this crisis could be overcome, an economic council should be established, but the Taoiseach apparently was satisfied that there was no necessity for it in present circumstances. One has only to scratch the surface of our economic, industrial and agricultural organisation to realise the vital necessity for the establishment of an economic council in present circumstances, but so much valuable time has been lost, and so much havoc wrought to our economic, industrial and agricultural structure that one might well be forgiven for doubting the utility of establishing an economic council in present circumstances. While I agree that very much valuable time has been lost, I think, nevertheless, the circumstances of to-day dictate the necessity for some scheme of planning even in the time now left at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the course of this debate and in the debates on other Estimates to the very serious situation which is developing in respect of the supply of butter and bacon.  It seems extraordinary that in a country such as this, with 14,000,000 acres of arable land, with an area under tillage less than that of any other country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 acres.  Here, for the purpose of satisfying the nation's requirements in the matter of tillage, we impose&mdash;and that only in the third year of the war&mdash;an obligation on our farming community to till 25 per cent. of the arable land.  The Taoiseach will know, of course, that that is a lesser percentage of arable land than is tilled in any other country in Europe.  The Taoiseach will realise, if he compares the tillage statistics of other countries, that 25 per cent. represents a very small contribution by us to the tillage of arable land as compared with the position in other European countries. But, notwithstanding the fact that we have 12,000,000 acres of arable land, we find to-day a very serious shortage developing in respect to the supply of butter and a very acute problem developing in respect to the supply of bacon; developing, so far as bacon is concerned, until I fear that by the end of this year we will have a black market in pigs as we have in many other commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have a very serious fuel problem in this country, a problem which is mirrored in the fact that very little coal is coming in, that we have an abundance of peat which is capable of being cut and used as a substitute for coal in many instances; but the whole problem of winning turf for our people is handled in such a manner that we have less people cutting turf this year than we had last year, even though we are getting in less coal this year than we got in last year.  The inadequacy of the number of people working on the production of turf is bad enough, but the whole problem is seriously aggravated by a serious shortage of the necessary transport to convey turf from the turf areas into the non-turf areas.  My fear is that in respect of turf we are likely to face a very serious position over this winter because of the shortage of supplies of that fuel for use by our people in the non-turf areas. Indeed, the manner in which the whole <Col N="599" /> problem has been handled does not reflect any great credit on those responsible and, I think, fully justifies the pessimistic speech which we heard from the Turf Controller when speaking on an Estimate in this House recently.</P>
    <P>In respect of unemployment, no one can deny that a very serious problem is arising in a very intensified form in our midst.  There is a serious shortage of raw materials, which might have been obviated if we had only planned to meet the war situation in time, which might have been mitigated if we had only utilised State credits for the purpose of financing those who desired to import materials before the war or in the early days of the war.  That is a problem which we might not have met yet if we only had the good sense to establish State import boards in 1938, 1939 and the early days of 1940 to buy the raw materials which our people needed, even if these were sold through a State trading house to the industrialists who needed them.  If would have been far better to take the risk of establishing State trading boards to import raw materials for resale to industrialists than the risk which we have taken of seeing large numbers of our people thrown out of employment, not because nobody wants the goods which they are capable of producing, but because the raw materials to make the goods are not available at present in this country.</P>
    <P>The twin brother of unemployment, of course, is emigration.  We have the humiliating spectacle of seeing tens of thousands of our people drift to the Six Counties and to Britain in the past 18 months seeking the employment which they cannot get here.  If we had been able, by planning, to deal with the raw material situation, if we had planned in such a way as to switch a certain number of people&mdash;not all, because it would not be possible to switch all&mdash;who have lost their industrial employment to schemes of public works, we might very well have avoided some of the worst evils of unemployment. But there was no provision of employment schemes which would absorb our <Col N="600" /> disemployed industrial workers.  Instead, we sat down helplessly, issued permits to our people to go to Britain and to the Six Counties, where labour was at famine prices, and we are now relying solely on the British industrial and agricultural market for employment to rescue our people from the physical sufferings which they would be compelled to endure if they had continued to live in a state of involuntary idleness in this country where miserably low pittances represent the State's effort to provide those people with sustenance through a period of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that if you take these few items alone&mdash;the scarcity of bacon in an agricultural country, the now annual shortage of butter, the scarcity of turf, the difficulty of transporting turf, the falling-off in the number of persons cutting turf, the unemployment problem in its present intensified form, and the large-scale emigration from this country, they constitute problems which we might have made a better effort to grapple with.  Even now there is need for planning.  While I feel sure that the Taoiseach will claim for his Government that their powers of perspicacity in this matter transcend the visual powers of every other Party and every other factor in the State, I suggest to him that, while that piece of egotism is permissible now and again, he might very well soft pedal in his admiration of these faculties during the crisis through which we are passing.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Taoiseach on a previous occasion that men and women of goodwill, with a bent for planning, with zeal for serving the nation, with a desire to substitute service for profit, could be found in this country who would be willing and anxious to give of their best in order to evolve a national life here that would give us an organic economic structure capable of withstanding much more firmly the ravages of this war than the frail economic structure which is tempering the economic winds to our people. Even on this Estimate, I should like to ascertain from the Taoiseach whether he does not consider it worth <Col N="601" /> while giving further consideration to the question of establishing an economic council which, in the time now at our disposal, might at all events evolve some type of planned economy which might save our people from many of the hardships that I feel sure will be inflicted upon them if we continue the present policy of drift, drift, drift.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the most urgent problem is that of planning to sustain our people, to keep body and soul in our people while the present economic blast lasts.  But, of course, one has to think of the future.  When this war ends we, a small neutral State, in a very perfunctorily developed industrial and agricultural position, will be face to face in competition with nations which have highly mechanised and industrialised themselves.  They will have learned during the war the lesson of doing things on a gigantic scale and, when you think of the achievements of some of them in this war, of the mighty efforts they have made, the seemingly insuperable opposition and difficulties which they have overcome, you begin to realise that these people may be relied upon to bring titanic energy to the solution of their post-war problems.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for a small nation such as ours to compete with that type of mammoth attack on such social and economic problems as present themselves in other countries.  But we ought to be doing some thinking; we ought to be contemplating our conception of life in the post-war world. While we need not imitate the ideologies of other countries, at least we as a Legislature ought to make sure that in our plan of what is due to human dignity our people will not lag behind, whatever may be the lot of people in other countries.  It does not seem to me that the Government have given any thought to post-war planning.  So far, not a single member of the Government has revealed his thoughts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No member of the Government has indicated what the <Col N="602" /> Government's post-war solution will be.  Maybe the Taoiseach realises that he will not be the head of the Government in the post-war period, and therefore it would be premature to be thinking out plans which may never be implemented.  I suggest he ought to take a chance and some Department of the Government, aided and abetted by men and women of goodwill from outside if necessary, ought to be applying themselves to the preparation of schemes calculated to ensure that the energies of our people after the war will be utilised in the creation of additional wealth in their own land, and that our conditions of living here will be at least as good as the conditions of living in other countries.</P>
      <P>It is not often we can get the Taoiseach into the House to tell us his views on these complex problems, but an opportunity presents itself now and I trust that the Taoiseach will take the nation into his confidence and tell us, firstly, whether he intends to plan at all for the remainder of this emergency and, secondly, whether his Government, either on their own or through some other agency, are contemplating any plans which will stand the nation in good stead when the emergency has passed.</P>

      <P>We might have been spared a little probing into the situation here to-day if Mr. Collin Brooks, Editor of <i>Truth</i>, addressing the N.U.I. Club in London last night, realised a little more how ignorant were the people to whom he was talking. I see by the <i>Irish Press</i> that he said: &ldquo;I need not emphasise the object lesson which Europe has had in the philosophy of the State which Mr. de Valera has applied to Éire.&rdquo;  It would be a great illumination to some of us if he could accept that the people to whom he was talking did not know all about that, and if he had set out to emphasise it a little bit.  I have been watching the Taoiseach and some of his associates for a long time, and I have never been able to find out that they had any philosophy of State.  I feel that the object lesson which Europe has given us is a thing which should be very easy to learn.  We do <Col N="603" /> not seem to have any signs of learning very much about it, particularly about picking up any philosophy of State.</P>
      <P>I support the motion put forward by Deputy Hughes for much the same reasons as he submitted.  He pointed out how some of the very fundamentals of our economic structure were being neglected and that the Government were actually throwing up their hands in face of the existing situation.  I feel that even more important factors of our national and economic life than the dairying industry and the pig industry are being utterly neglected.  I think we ought to have some kind of common approach to see where the strength of this State and the people lies and how we have to safeguard that strength and develop it.  I think the safety and the strength of the State lie, first of all, in the people.  Notwithstanding all the talk there is about unity, about concentration on very important matters such as our defence and our policy with regard to keeping out of the war, I do not think our people were ever as dissipated and lacking in strength as they are to-day.  They even lack what some people might call the philosophy of State.</P>
      <P>This country has gone through a very peculiar experience.  We had a great national movement that was split in 1922, and that has reacted in such a way that there has been no normal development of political thought among the people who split, and there has been no chance at all of any normal development of political understanding among the generation that grew up under that, and we find ourselves in a position to-day in which, through various influences, not all of a military nature, our national well-being and our future are threatened.  As Deputy Norton points out, very large numbers have had to go away.  That might be no serious blow if there was a strong State and a unified and uni-minded people at home.  First of all, we have to take into consideration how our people are being treated with regard to serious matters of policy, and then how we are looking after the foundations upon which our national intelligence and our national economic life rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> There is nothing being done in any kind of systematic way to instruct the people as to the main lines upon which our economic thought ought to run. There are, in fact, no serious divergencies of thought&mdash;there could not be.  Anybody looking at the facts of Irish life, no matter what class or rank or political outlook he may have, would have to be aware at once of where our economic strength lies, but there is no approach at all to unity of thought on the things that really matter, the things that are the very foundation of our strength.  In the same way there is really nothing being done to make the electorate feel that they are the strong basis upon which our national institutions rest.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching local government elections.  It must have been the end of May when the Government decided to introduce a Bill postponing elections.  It was introduced into the Dáil and printed on the 2nd June.  It was the 30th June before, as an accompaniment to the Bill postponing local elections, we were told in a debate here that local elections were going to be held in a few months. Then, a week after, we had the whole story that local elections were going to be held in August.  My only objection is that they have been postponed so long.  But just think of the way in which the electorate is being treated. The last local elections were held in 1934&mdash;eight years ago&mdash;and, although the elections were contemplated as early as the end of May, the first time the people are given any notice about it is on 30th June, and a week later they are told that they are going to take place in about six weeks time. Anybody understanding the people and their conditions and the history of this country with regard to local government would certainly feel that they were deserving of more consideration than that, particularly when the Minister for Local Government impressed so much the fact that the circumstances of the time are such that you cannot very well give the people all the information they might require, and that you cannot get in touch with the electorate in the way in which you ought to get in touch with them.  Certainly, <Col N="605" /> there is there no philosophy of State that takes into consideration the people, and how the people as an organism can be got to think and to act.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are in the last year of the present Parliament's life. The normal life of Parliament is five years.  The electorate have to carry out their function of electing a Parliament and have the responsibility of then going ahead with their work, leaving Parliament to do its work. They have the duty of appraising the Parliament in its first, second, third and fourth years, and, in the fifth year, have an opportunity of deciding whether the policy of the Government suits them, and of indicating in what direction changes should take place.  I think that is sound and reasonable, and I can think of no other period more suitable.  In the early days of the State, trade returns were published every year, reviewing the year's trading. By 1930, I think, the Government and the Statistics Branch and other Departments concerned came to the conclusion that a yearly review gave no very satisfactory picture of the position, and was not a very satisfactory basis for argument.  From that time, trade returns were published as trade returns every year, but every fifth year there was a full review of the trading situation which gave a satisfactory and interesting survey of the trend over those five years.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the electorate had an opportunity at the end of every five years of deciding their position, and how they were going to act.  We are now in the last year of the normal life of this Government, and I think the country deserves to enter a period in which there will be a steadier way of administration, and a steadier method of presenting the problems that face this country, and in which the policies that should be adopted for the present and the future can be decided in a systematic and reasonable way, without exaggeration by fears, without futile hopes.  We have very serious problems to face, and very serious things to think out.  We ought to face them in a systematic way, and to say <Col N="606" /> to ourselves that, whatever may be the position that will arise next year, we can face that position.  We ought to let our electorate know that, sometime in the beginning of next summer, they will have the responsibility of reviewing the situation and electing a Parliament. In the meantime, let the Government act in a responsible way.  Let them act in the way in which they would act if they were facing an election not only for the sake of getting a judgement in regard to what has happened in the past, but to put forward constructive proposals, and let their ability be reflected in the type of administration that they will be carrying out as a Government in the next 12 months.  Every Party in the country should act in the same way, and every one of the various bodies that are interested in various sections of our economic and social life.  But in approaching that situation, we have to confess that, at the present moment, the Government is not standing on firm ground.</P>
    <P>I have been repeatedly asking the House to consider what other countries are doing, and what they are thinking about.  We can have hopes, and we can have fears with regard to the future, and we see them expressed in various ways.  The Taoiseach to-day indicated that, in his opinion, the Conference that took place in New York of the International Labour Organisation was very largely concerned with the war.  I contest that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>The attitude towards the questions was one that was based on a war situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were delegates who went there from countries engaged in the war, and at least one of them had to declare that he was irritated beyond measure by all the talk he heard about reconstruction, but, that when he was able to get over his irritation, he welcomed it.  A very substantial part of the report of the Acting Director was related entirely to future policy.  However, on the question of hopes and fears, I just wish to take two sections here.  The hopes can be summarised in that part of the <Col N="607" /> Acting Director's report where he suggests a social mandate, after a summary of the tendency in the world for some years past, and a summary of the hopes of the various countries at the present moment, including the statement I have indicated before from the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time&mdash;Mr. Lemass.  However, the hopes can be summarised in what was suggested as a social mandate by Mr. Phelan, the Acting Director.  I am quoting from column 2522 of the Dáil Debates, where I mentioned this before.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The formulation of such a social mandate would constitute a general declaration of international social policy and would give the International Labour Organisation a programme to implement, completing it with all the detail necessary.  It is not difficult to outline in a certain logical order the main points and principles which such a mandate should cover.  They are:</P>
      <P>1.  The elimination of unemployment;</P>
      <P>2.  The establishment of machinery for placing, vocational training and retraining;</P>
      <P>3.  The improvement of social insurance in all its fields and in particular its extension to all classes of workers;</P>
      <P>4.  The institution of a wage policy aimed at securing a just share of the fruits of progress for the worker;</P>
      <P>5.  A minimum living wage for those too weak to secure it for themselves;</P>
      <P>6.  Measures to promote better nutrition and to provide adequate housing and facilities for recreation and culture;</P>
      <P>7.  Greater equality of occupational opportunity;</P>
      <P>8.  Improved conditions of work;</P>
      <P>9.  An international public works policy for the development of the world's resources;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.  The organisation of migration <Col N="608" /> for employment and settlement under adequate guarantees for all concerned;</P>
    <P>11.  The collaboration of employers and workers in the initiation and application of economic and social measures.</P>
    <P>I take that as expressing the hopes. Now come the fears.  In the discussion which took place, Mr. De Vries, South African workers' delegate, argued that &ldquo;the post-war problem of wide scale unemployment is not being tackled with enough vigour, probably because there is so little unemployment to-day and an existing wishful belief that nothing will happen.&rdquo;  Following that Mr. van den Tempel, the Netherlands Minister of Labour, associated himself vigorously with the same view.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before long the problems of social security and unemployment will become, more than ever, the centre of general interest in social policy.  There is ample reason to fear that, immediately after the war ends, almost all Governments will be confronted with these problems in their crudest form.  Temporarily, new difficulties will be added to old ones.  The prospect of such overwhelming difficulties is not only a subject for theoretical and statistical treaties; what is needed now is to draft a series of practical plans.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. van den Tempel elaborated his view in a resolution, which the conference referred to the governing body, containing a recital that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;by reason of the demobilisation of the armed forces, the closing down of war industries, the increased employment of women during the war, the disruption of normal economic life and the decreased buying power of many nations which have played an important part in international trade relations, there might during the period following the war be an unemployment crisis of the gravest character, to counteract which it is necessary to take timely measures for the maintenance of employment by promoting economic recovery and securing the resumption of international trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Here we stand between hopes and fears of that particular kind.  We can neither build up our hopes nor face the fears with any kind of feeling of confidence in ourselves or in our people, unless we know the ground we stand on.  Here we must stand on the education of our people, on a sound basis for our agriculture and a sane outlook on industry and who is going to run and control industry.  Let us take education. Where do we stand if we are asked are we seeking an educational basis for our national being at the present time?  During the discussion on the Estimate for the Minister for Education, I again raised the question of the overcrowding of Dublin schools. I was shocked to find that you could have an infant class in the City of Dublin, under one unfortunate teacher, with 111 children in it, and some further classes with 90, 80 and 70 in them.  I was twice as shocked to get the answer: &ldquo;Oh, that only happens from April until about July.&rdquo;  What kind of foundation of an intelligent nation can we have if in a fairly substantial percentage of the schools in the City of Dublin&mdash;the number of classes in which there were over 50 children reached to something like 30 per cent. of the total for certain types of pupils&mdash;overcrowding of this type is permitted?</P>
    <P>What kind of national discipline can we have when we consider that as many as 5,000 boys leave the primary schools in the City of Dublin at 14 years of age annually, and that a gap intervenes between that educational period, part of which has been spent under the circumstances I have described, and the time when they can obtain employment?  Remember that the attempt to restore the Irish language through the schools has also been operating in that period.  There is, as I say, a gap between the period when they leave school and any possible prospect that may exist of their getting employment.  That gap may extend for a couple of years.  How can we say we are building up any kind of discipline or any kind of intelligent nation capable of any constructive effort under conditions of that kind?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> While we have that position we have our training colleges empty.  We have the young people who could be very easily going through these training colleges rusting and idling in the country.  Within the last month or so two domestic training colleges, having between them something like 45 vacancies, held examinations for girls. There were about 500 girls from various parts of the country anxious to get into these colleges to be trained in domestic economy.  Only 45 out of the 500 could get in and here we are, with so much leeway to be made up in the proper domestic training of our people, and all that it means for both social happiness and national economy, turning away from our schools to-day 450 girls anxious to get that training and ready to pay for that training.  It is only a sample of the kind of waste that is going on in other directions.</P>
    <P>Surely we could come to a decision to try to strengthen the educational foundations upon which our State rests.  Surely there is nothing to interfere with that.  It may be said that there is the question of money to interfere with it, but, again, we get back to what I mentioned before, the attitude which other countries have taken up&mdash;that there are two scourges, war and unemployment; that, since 1930, unemployment was a very different thing from what it was before, and that if the countries which are now engaged in a self-annihilating war had given, ten years ago, half the attention or half the effort to facing the social problems that unemployment created, we would have happier countries and a happier world, instead of the self-destroying world we have to-day.  When we were called upon to strengthen our military defences here, we had to find money and we found it.  One of the things that we must ask ourselves to-day is this: are we to let our young people grow up in this country to face both the wastage and the dangers of education of that particular kind, or will we make a sacrifice to build up our national strength there?  There is no place that we can build up our national strength except we build it up there.</P>
    <P>When I look at the points set out in <Col N="611" /> the suggested social mandate in the report of the acting director of the International Labour Office, I ask myself on which of those 11 points should we begin to work now.  Only a few stick out; the elimination of unemployment; the establishment of machinery for placing, vocational training, and re-training; a minimum living wage for those too weak to secure it for themselves; the improvement of social insurance in all its fields and in particular its extension to all classes of workers; and the institution of a wage policy aimed at securing a just share of the fruits of progress for the worker.  We begin at the elimination of unemployment.  We know that, as we are to-day, and with the plans and machinery that are at work towards it, it is not possible to offer or to promise employment to every one of our people who has been looking for it.  Lack of materials of one kind, lack of services of another kind, all operate to prevent its being possible to offer employment to everybody who is looking for it to-day.</P>
    <P>We cannot promise that some of the people who are in employment to-day will not be disemployed next week or the week after.  When that is the position with regard to employment, then we can hardly except to begin, in a systematic way, the improvement of social insurance in all its fields, because you want to have a strong employment basis upon which to build that up; nor can you very well begin at this stage the institution of a wage policy aimed at securing a just share of the fruits of progress for the worker, although you can move towards that.</P>
    <P>You are driven back to this, that there is only one point where we should begin fully to operate, and that is the establishment of a minimum living wage for those too weak to secure it for themselves.  If we were driven to it, we would say that we are doing that at the moment, but we are not doing it in a systematised way, nor are we doing it in a way which makes it easy for the person getting that money to take it; at any rate, it is not given in such a way as would stimulate the people's <Col N="612" /> courage or their confidence in themselves. In September last year, the Minister for Finance produced an Order to cover personal injuries from bomb damage.  Under the Order, a man who was permanently disabled, and had a family of no matter what size, could except only 30/- a week from the State as compensation.</P>
    <P>When that was challenged here, the Minister for Finance resisted the challenge.  He did come to different conclusions afterwards, and has recently issued another Order.  Under the new Order, a man who was permanently disabled will get 57/6 a week, if he has a wife and five children.  The new scale of compensation allows 30/- for the man, 7/6 for the wife and 4/- for each child, that is a total of 57/6. But, in Great Britain as from February, 1942, a disabled man would get 37/6, with 9/2 for the wife, 7/1 for the first child, and 5/5 for every subsequent child, making a total of 75/5. Even forcing up the idea that the Government had in September last year as to the scale upon which a man of that kind would be compensated by the State, and bringing the figure up to 57/6 under the new Order, we are still 17/11 below the English figure. I do not know why we should be 17/11 below the English figure.  However, a certain amount of progress has been made.  But when we come to deal with people who are unable to provide for themselves, particularly if they have a large family, we are forcing them under present circumstances to go to the poor law relief.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions we ought to face this question: do we in this State stand for educating the children of this State and for looking after people who are unable to support themselves, and particularly for looking after families who are not able to maintain themselves?  There is no Party in this House, and I do not think there is any vocal body of opinion outside, who would not say, emphatically, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to those things.  They would say that the resources for doing those things have to come out of the country, and everybody would have to agree.  But we are not doing those things systematically now, and we will <Col N="613" /> not do them systematically unless we take some of those things as a challenge just as big and as aggressive and as urgent as the war challenge is to other countries, and unless we energise ourselves to tighten up our organisation in dealing with those matters, and so order our administration generally as to reduce the overhead costs of dealing with those things. If we do accept that challenge, then we will have to face the challenge of finding from the production of this country the resources for doing those things.  The production that will enable us to do them can only come from our agriculturists on the one hand and our industrialists on the other.  But there we find that Government policy or lack of policy is throwing production both in agriculture and in industry into such a position that the agriculturists and the industrialists do not know where they stand.</P>
    <P>If we are to educate and support our people, those who are engaged in agriculture must know clearly along what lines they have to proceed as regards better education and systematising their overheads and their way of doing business.  Nothing said from the Government Benches at present is doing anything but confusing and disintegrating the minds of our agriculturists. They are told, one day, that the dairying industry is gone and, on another day, that the pig industry is gone.  Every second day, the policy which reacts on the live-stock industry is changed without anything, apparently, being done to try to prepare, by foreknowledge, the farmers involved. It seems to me that the agricultural industry should be developed on certain lines.  I have sat down with farmers representing various branches of the agricultural industry.  All branches of that industry are supposed to have divergent interests.  I never found that, after serious and systematic discussion, one could not get almost complete unanimity on the general lines of policy that should be pursued.  So far as the discussion of general agricultural policy throughout the country is concerned, there is no direction.  We cannot afford to continue in that position.  If we must <Col N="614" /> educate and maintain our people, that should be a challenge to us here to face the productive side of things.  We should face that side of things with the understanding that it is only the farmers can achieve what we want and we should see that there is suitable understanding and co-operation between parliamentarians and workers in the agricultural industry as to how that industry should be maintained and developed.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, the situation is almost worse.  There is a growing tendency to interfere departmentally with the people who control and develop industry.  I do not know whether the Order we were furnished with to-day dealing with Irish Steel is another sample of greater aggressiveness of intrusion on the part of the Government into industry or not.  In various important branches of industry, instead of the controllers being consulted about what is to be done, action is taken departmentally which reacts on them.  We have that manifested again in the commercial life of the country, as exemplified by the attitude the Department of Supplies took in regard to the drapers, when they had to handle some matters seriously concerning them.  In all that interference, the person whose interest should most be safeguarded is the person who is most injured&mdash;the consumer.  Unless we concentrate on the consumer and his wants, we shall not have either agriculture or industry run efficiently.</P>
    <P>I support the motion of Deputy Hughes, because I think that neglect on the part of the Government goes farther than the dairying industry, the pig industry or anything that Deputy Hughes mentioned.  I think that there is no appreciation of the fact that politically, socially and economically this whole State rests on the people. Unless there is an ordered attempt to unify the people's thoughts on these matters&mdash;a thing it would not be hard to do&mdash;our national strength will be dissipated.  That is as regards the political side.  On the educational side, I think that, unless we place before ourselves some challenge, as big and as important as the challenge of war is in other countries, on things that, as Christians and patriots we ought to <Col N="615" /> challenge ourselves, we are simply going to drift and waste as a people during the present emergency.  We shall meet the dangers that the Dutch Minister for Labour describes with a weak political, and economic body which will not be able to resist the diseases which will effect it.  There ought to be a systematic attempt to get our people to think about these things.  We are doing very little thinking on them here.  Even if we were doing a considerable amount of thinking about them here, unless we got the people in the country to think about them, we would have no resolution or success in dealing with them.</P>

      <P>I am sure that every Deputy is aware of the position of the dairy farmers.  If the Government fail to assist them to continue dairying, it will be a very bad job for the country. Without the dairy farmer we cannot produce live stock.  If he is not assisted, in some way or other, to carry on his industry, then it will go the way of the pig industry.  It is going that way already.  I heard a great deal of talk about the export of dairy heifers. The only way to stop the export of dairy heifers is to put the dairy farmer in a position to compete with the exporter.  If that is not done, our cattle industry will be ruined.  I am sure that the experience of the past two or three years has taught members of the Government that this country cannot get on without producing cattle. Some time ago that would have been called a west-British view and the person who advocated it would be called a &ldquo;bull-pusher.&rdquo;  He would be told that we should put men on the land instead of grazing cattle.  It is necessary however to produce, at least, sufficient butter for our own people. The feeling in the country is that we will not this season be able to supply our own needs.  When Fianna Fáil got into power, I remember a back bencher of that Party getting up and thanking God that the people would get no more Chinese or American bacon, that they would have plenty of good Irish bacon. What is the position to-day?  They are <Col N="616" /> not getting even the smell of home-produced bacon.  Very soon, they will not be able to get Irish butter.</P>
      <P>Now that we have no artificials, it is necessary for the farmers to be encouraged to stall-feed more cattle, to feed more pigs and to keep up the fertility of the soil.  If you do not put something back into the soil the fertility will be lost and there will be no crops. Coming up to Dublin in the train to-day, I saw some fields of wheat where there is only grass growing.  To my great surprise, I find that most of the wheat is scutch grass.  Along the side of the railway from Wexford to Dublin, in places where wheat was sown for the last two or three years it is a total failure this year.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I asked a question about the British prices for stall-fed cattle and for lambs, and I was surprised that an intelligent man like the Taoiseach should make a laugh about it, asking what I was talking about. I explained here that it was impossible for the farmer to produce lambs to go to the British market at the price offered.  The British want our produce, and I suggested that the Minister for Agriculture and another Minister should go over to make a trade agreement with them.  They should say that we are in a position to supply them with food, but that we want something in return.</P>

      <P>Our markets are gone now.  I remember the Minister for Finance saying we would whip John Bull and &ldquo;Thank God, that market is gone for ever.&rdquo;  I do not care whether the market is in Hong Kong or Jerusalem and I do not want the market specially in England, but we should go where there is a market.  An agricultural country like this must have an export surplus of some kind in order to have imports.  It is time that the Government awakened to the fact that this is not an island for Robinson Crusoe and Friday.  There are many of the necessaries of life <Col N="617" /> which we cannot produce, and we can obtain them only by having an export surplus.  The Government have their backs set against the farmer and agricultural worker, and have been persecuting them in every way.  The farmer must get a fair profit for his labour and the agricultural worker must be paid for the work he does.  It is deplorable to see people leaving the country day after day, and going over to England to look for work.</P>
      <P>We were told before Fianna Fáil came into power that this was to be a land of milk and honey, that there would be both bread and work for everybody, that the population would be doubled in one year.  What really happened?  The first thing we did was to start an economic war and to smash the farmer.  The Taoiseach has told us of the work done for the farmers, that he has halved the annuities; but at the same time he placed the farmer in a position in which he was unable to pay.  The Taoiseach told us that the money was not legally or morally due to England, but after robbing the farmers of this country, he gives £10,000,000 for the annuities.  Surely, there is neither sense nor reason in that.  We must have mixed farming in the country, and if we cannot get a market for surplus stock, it is down and out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the pig industry last year, no man who knows the situation that pig feeders are in would take in pigs.  In my constituency there is a decrease of at least 60 per cent. in pigs in the last two years.  The majority of pigs in Country Wexford are bought by liveweight and the fixed price live-weight for pigs last November and December was 83/- per cwt. for pigs up to 16 stone; after that there was a cut of 10/- a cwt., up to 17 stone; and after 17 stone the price was cut by 23/- a cwt.  These useless pigs were eating the food required for the next batch and the men who had pigs in November had to sell in January.  I see that many consumers in the city, when they went to buy bacon, found it was all sold at one price and there was no such thing as second or third grade.  I would ask the Taoiseach, as head of the <Col N="618" /> State, to help the producers of this country.  Without a market for our surplus produce abroad and a fair market at home, production is bound to cease.  It would not be fair to ask a man with the right type of dairy heifer not to export, but if the dairy farmer is put in the position to compete with others, everything will be all right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the real cause of the decline in pig feeding is the way the Government has handled the situation.  Last February the price of bacon dropped suddenly from 8/- to 10/- a cwt., at a time when feeding stuffs were scarce and when the price should have been raised by 10/-.  It seemed to be the deliberate policy of the Government to make farmers give up feeding pigs.  There is a rumour that the Government is going to reduce the price of pigs still further, in order to stop farmers feeding wheat to them. If they go on with things like that, in an industry that is the poor man's industry, it will mean the end of the small farmers and the bacon industry will be killed altogether.  The Government should do away with the Bacon Board and give this industry a free run, with a free price, and then the price will not be a fabulous one.  I saw last Thursday that bacon was 2/10 a pound.  No man on 23/- a week, with a family to feed, could pay 2/10 a pound for bacon.  If the Government does away with the Bacon Board and lets the price of pigs seek its own level, people will get a good price for bonhams and there will be hundreds of them in the country in no time. Nothing increases as quickly as the number of pigs, and if the prices are good there will always be a supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is treating the dairying industry in the same way.  I heard it mentioned in the House to-day that we should stop the export of heifers.  I would warn the Government seriously not to interrupt the export of cattle in any way.  If they want to improve the dairying industry and have plenty of butter, they should give the dairy farmers enough for their milk.  It is a shame and a disgrace to see the way it is treated.  I am not <Col N="619" /> engaged in dairying, but I cannot understand how farmers can exist when they are getting only 7d. a gallon for milk, when other farmers get so much more in the towns.  They could not carry on an industry at that price.  If the Government want to stop the export of heifers, they should give the dairy farmers a good price for milk and that will soon stop it.  There must be something radically wrong with the cow position.  I never saw third calving cows as cheap as they are now.  A nice show heifer, after calving, may fetch a good price, up to £30, but one with its udder down to the ground loaded with milk would not get a good price.  There must be something radically wrong there.  Most of the cows after calving are very flush and are not sold for dairying because the price is one which the dairy man cannot afford to pay.  They are milked out that morning and sold for meat, and if the dairying industry was in a proper condition, that would not be happening.  It is not a matter of the export of cows.  The whole secret of it is the failure to give the dairy man enough to make a living on in respect of the manufacture of butter.</P>
    <P>With regard to prices, Deputy Keating said that there should be a better price for lambs and the Taoiseach asked what would happen if that better price was not secured.  In the matter of negotiations, it is officials who are going over and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am sure that you will get a very much higher price if you explain to the person to whom you are selling an animal how much it cost to produce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wrong line to take.  I take it that the Taoiseach or one of his Ministers would not go over as an ordinary man would go into a fair.  He would go over with figures in his possession to show how it cost the farmers so much more to produce meat and such things than last year.  Farm labour is higher; freightage on cattle is higher&mdash;all these things are much higher than they were last year.  We are getting a little less this year.  They argue that we are getting more, but we are in reality getting a little less because we are suffering this year from <Col N="621" /> the increase we got last year.  It is not right that beef should be 57/- a cwt. to-day and that, in mid-October to mid-November, it should come down to 46/- or 47/-, which represents £5 or £6 a head for cattle.  That is the time the poor man sells his cattle, and this is supposed to be a poor man's Government. The poor man must clear his stuff then and he is to get 10/- to 15/- a cwt. less in October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not see any Minister going over.  If I send my workman to a fair to sell a beast, I do not think he will do as well as I would do, and any man who gets another person to do his business for him should not be in business.  That is the business way of looking at it.  If the Minister for Agriculture wants other men to do his business, he is not doing his business properly.  I think we are being treated badly, but I would not advocate trading our cattle to such a great extent for other goods, because that is a dangerous thing to do.  They are the only things we have to export, and experience shows that if you interfere too much in these matters, you will do harm.  Some Deputies argued that the export of heifers should be stopped, but to do so would be unfair to the people who have these heifers.  The way to deal with the dairy industry is to give the dairy man enough for his milk, and, in addition, in order to ensure that you will have dairy shorthorn heifers, give a bigger premium for the shorthorn bull.  There is a high premium available at present, but I suggest that it be doubled.  If a man who is getting £20 a year now gets £40 a year for keeping a shorthorn bull, he will keep that bull and you will have a certain number of extra cattle in the country. The poor man wants to keep to the white-headed bull because it matures <Col N="622" /> six or eight months before the others, and I suggest that the best way to ensure that there will be shorthorn heifers in the country is to double the premium for the shorthorn bull.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is the prohibition of the export of horses.  I do not understand why that prohibition was enforced, but it imposes a terrible hardship.  There are many small farmers who reared horses for two or three-year olds and thought they would get the good price which is now available.  That price is not available to them, however, because the Government have stopped the export of horses, on the grounds, I am told, of their being required for agricultural work.  I know enough about the country to know that there are too many horses working, although the poor farmer is now prevented from getting £70 or £80 for his good strong horse.  He can go to a stud farm and buy an old mare for £10, or maybe £5, which will do his work.  That man is losing £70 or £80, and what is going to happen when all the &ldquo;clips&rdquo; come out in October and November?  All our small farmers have nothing but the strong, hard animal to sell and they are dependent on the money they get for these animals, and if that prohibition on export is kept in force until November, you are going to have a holy war with the farmers, because all these &ldquo;clips&rdquo; will be left on their hands.  I urge the Government to reopen the export of horses because there will be enough horses in the country to do the work required.  The farmers are not fools; they will look ahead and see that they have enough horses.  The prohibition of export of horses is a mistaken policy, in my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I mentioned on the Local Government Vote but of which I do not think any notice was taken, that is, the condition of the roads.  The farmers and ratepayers of the country are paying for the roads and they cannot use them, although nothing is being done in that respect.  Deputies on all sides of the House spoke on this matter on the previous occasion, but nothing is being done in regard to these roads.  A <Col N="623" /> farmer who wants to draw his turf home is unable to do so on account of their condition.  I know one instance of that, between Drumree and Collinstown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to some of the last speakers urging the Taoiseach to interest himself in the price of agricultural produce at the other side of the Channel, but I want to ask the Taoiseach to stay at home for a short time, and to tell some of the business community what the post-war policy of the Government is, and what situation they are facing.  It may be said that that point was raised on the Estimates for the Department of Supplies, and the Department of Industry and Commerce, but although he mentioned something about artificial manures, and about a sulphate of ammonia plant being established after the war the Minister carefully abstained from giving any guide to the business and manufacturing community as to what was facing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the attitude of the Government as, probably, they will say that they do not know what the situation will be, but if the Government do not know, and if the people do not know, the result will be that nothing will be done.  Possibly that is the worst thing that could happen, because many <Col N="624" /> manufacturing firms and others could, if they were quite sure of what the conditions were going to be, make very considerable plans now.  The Government for a number of years have gone in for a policy of protection.  Up to a certain point that suited this country and, probably, if some of the grosser mistakes and abuses are left out, that policy has worked well.  Certainly in the case of any industry that is producing anything, and that can continue to do so during the present emergency, that is all to the good, but since the war broke out, I suggest that the Government have ceased to operate the protective duties, but just too late to allow supplies to be got in.  The position is that these duties have been suspended. Nobody knows whether they are in cold storage for good or not.  I cannot imagine that they are.  What is to be the position of anybody trying to make plans now to restart or to extend their activities after the war?  I hope the Taoiseach will realise that if the Government does not know what the position will be, the rest of the community will do nothing.</P>

Although we require the labour of every man to produce the essentials of life for the community, we have not the necessary labour within the country. For one reason or another we have been allowing the best of our people to emigrate, and to seek employment elsewhere, despite the fact that they were urgently needed here. Surely, the most disappointing feature of the economic situation is the position of agriculture.  The fact is that we require essential foodstuffs&mdash;bacon being one of the most essential&mdash;and though for many years we exported large quantities of bacon to the British market, we have not at present sufficient to supply our own needs.</P>

      <P>We are in the very fortunate position that we are immune from the devastation that would result from actual involvement in the war. We are one of the few States in that position.  It is a fortunate position, and one upon which we may congratulate ourselves.  Nevertheless there is one thing that is as important as <Col N="626" /> escape from involvement in the world conflict, and that is preservation of the human population by the provision of essential needs.  If we fail to provide our people with essential needs in food, clothing and fuel, then we will never be able to congratulate ourselves on our escape from involvement in this world conflict.</P>

      <P>That is apparent to everybody, because our people would suffer very severely, not only actual physical dangers, but also the economic dangers which would accompany involvement in the war.  We all agree upon that.  Seeing that we are immune from the conflict, why should this country be compelled to suffer the economic consequences that nations involved in the war are suffering, when these consequences could be avoided?  If they could not be avoided, nobody has raised any point about it.  The fact is that the emigration of our people to Great Britain has created a shortage of labour here for the production of food and the fact is that we are short of many essential foodstuffs.  That could have been avoided if we had planned with more foresight, and if we had put into effect more energetic methods.  It is, therefore, upon the head of the Government that responsibility for such failure must rest.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
