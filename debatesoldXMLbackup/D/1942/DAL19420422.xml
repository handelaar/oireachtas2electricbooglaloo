      <P>I am aware that there have been increases in the prices of wearing apparel in common with the prices of many other commodities, but I am not clear as to what exactly the Deputy means in the second part of his question.  The fact is that no restrictions have been imposed or reimposed recently on imports of wearing apparel but, on the contrary, the customs duties chargeable on imported wearing apparel have been reduced by Order to 25 per cent. ad valorem (37½ per cent. ad valorem full rate).  The object of this Order is to facilitate the importation of clothing whenever feasible while at the same time protecting as far as possible the collection of revenue which, in the case of clothing, has always been a substantial item in the revenue account relating to customs duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the current price paid for hen eggs in County Monaghan is ? per dozen, and whether he will take steps to effect an increase in this price in view of the prices being paid for eggs in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part, egg prices payable to producers are affected by the prices received for exports.  There is no prospect of an increase in producers' prices in the near future, but the position will be watched with a view to securing an improvement as soon as it becomes possible to do so.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Dáil for permission to take all stages of this Bill to-day.  It is a very minor measure, and can be circulated at once. The reason for the urgency is that the Bill must be law before 1st May, that is it must have passed through the Dáil and Seanad.  The Seanad is meetting to-day, and I understand is likely to complete the business on its agenda to-day.  They are willing to take this Bill after their business to-day, whereas, if it did not reach them to-day, it would involve another special meeting of the Seanad for the purpose.  It is a Bill to confirm three Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, none of which I think can be regarded as important.  They are minor Orders.  I would ask the Dáil to facilitate me by agreeing to take this Bill at, say, 6 or 7 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which I am anxious to know from the Minister is whether it is his intention to feed the people of this country before sending anything out from this country to other countribs.  In the course of his opening speech the other day, he said that if we had 20,000 cwts. more of butter, we could do with them, but I know that for the period of the last four months over 62 tons of butter were shipped from the port of Cork, and, knowing that the people here are not able to get butter, I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is his intention to pursue that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I listened with great interest to the remarks made by several Deputies about milk, and when one considers that in this country we drink sixteen-twenty-fifths of a pint of milk per day per person as against one and a half pints per day in Sweden and America, and a larger amount in other countries, one wonders what the mind of the Government in relation to milk is.  I am pretty familiar with the position in Cork, where for a few years what is known as a milk board has been operating. The price paid for milk for distribution in the city to the milk board producers is 1/0½d. per gallon, and, for distribution they get an extra 7½d.  I know that within six miles of the city milk is being sent to the creameries at a price of 6d. or 7d. a. gallon, and I often made inquiries as to whether anything could be done with a view to supplying the people of the city with a reasonable supply of milk which they would be able to purchase.  I find that, during the 12 months ending last December, of the milk sold by the milk board to these retailers, over 75,000 gallons were sent to the university dairy and sold there for something like 7d. per gallon.   That, of course, is termed by some people surplus milk which they could not sell in the city, because the minimum which the poor people have to pay is ? a gallon; but, strange to say, that same milk was sent day after day for a year, to the amount of 75,133 gallons, to the university dairy and sold there for 7d. per gallon. To me, our milk boards are nothing less than restriction boards which impose fines on producers if they sell milk at less than these prices.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood in relation to the payment of a fair price to the farmer.  From the meagre knowledge I have of farming, I am quite satisfied that no man could produce milk to-day at 8d. or 9d., not to speak of 6d. or 7d. a gallon and we are not opposed to giving the farmer a proper price and the standard of living he is entitled to have.  No man who was not supplying milk to Cork City prior to the introduction of the milk board can now supply the citizens with milk.  If he does so, he is fined; but, notwithstanding that regulation, we <Col N="893" /> find surplus milk being sent to the college for 7d. a gallon for which 1/0½ was paid by the retailer, the retailer getting 7½d. a gallon for distribution, so that the man who produced it got less than the man who distributed it. That is obviously a situation which requires remedying, and one which the Government should take very strong measures to rectify.</P>
    <P>On the 23rd of last month, the Taoiseach, addressing the Country-women's Association, made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reference to milk consumption, the subsidising of butter exports always seemed ridiculous to him.  If they were to double their milk consumption, there would be no surplus butter to export and if prices had to be subsidised, the subsidies would be strictly for the good of our own community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anybody can subscribe to that, but one would imagine that it was an ordinary man in the country who made that statement.  That statement came from the Leader of the Government, but I am rather surprised that he did not follow it with the query: &ldquo;What is the remedy?&rdquo; Why is he not stopping that situation?  If we were to go back over the past three or four years and make up the total of the subsidies paid in order to give butter to the English people, we would be more than surprised. There is no good in telling people to drink more milk if we do not give them the purchasing power to buy milk, and if we read some of the reports of the medical officers we shall find a good indication of what is wrong. It is that the people are not able to buy it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan last night, speaking on somewhat the same lines, advocated greater consumption of milk and gave reasons for doing so.  There is no good in talking loosely about people drinking more milk, if they are not given the power to buy milk, and I wonder do we ever try to realise how much milk and butter a man in receipt of 10/6 a week to feed, clothe and shelter himself can buy, or how much milk and butter an unemployed man with five or more children in a country town who <Col N="894" /> gets 14/- from the State, without a voucher, can buy, or how much a man in a city or big town who gets a maximum of 23/- per week for himself, his wife and five or more children, with five vouchers, can buy.  It is about time we faced realities, and dealt with the question of giving people the means to purchase milk rather than discuss why we should subsidise butter.</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning I was travelling to Dublin by train, and at Knocklong and Charleville quite a number of men entered the train on their way to England.  One out of the number sat alongside me.  He told me he was going to England and that he was 49 years of age.  I asked him what he usually worked at and he said that most of his time he worked with farmers and he also worked on the roads. He told me that he had ten children and, as, he could get only 14/- a week at the labour exchange when there was no work to be done in his district, he thought the best thing to do was to go to England.  Everyone of us here should realise the significance of that.  Here is a man who is rearing ten children for the State, who has worked, on the land and also worked for the county council on the roads, and his only hope now is to go across to England in order to earn enough to keep himself and his family. These are the things we should be considering rather than the subsidising of this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>Instead of having a milk board operating within an area, the Government should create a national milk board that will give the farmers an economic price for milk.  I know what it is to buy milk.  I am purchasing milk from a farmer and I know the difficulties experienced in milk production.  The farmers have to get up early every morning and work hard; they have very little time for a holiday, and I am satisfied to give them any price they demand for milk because they are doing a national service&mdash;they are producing food for the nation.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know what the Government intend to do for agriculture in the immediate future.  The <Col N="895" /> Minister gave us a detailed explanation of what was done during the past year.  I think that if we continue to deal with agriculture as we have been doing we are likely to be hungry.  I am not satisfied that sufficient land is being tilled.  I am aware that big fields that should be cultivated are not being sufficiently tilled. We have not tackled the question of allotments as we should have.  I have already made representations to the Minister on this matter.  I have advocated the acquisition of land for plotholders in Cork.  Quite a number of unemployed people there are anxious to get allotments, but when we asked that certain steps should be taken to enable them to obtain plots, we did not receive much encouragement. No real effort was made to enable those men to acquire plots. We should devote more attention to tilling the land and enabling the people who are prepared to till to do so and in that way get as much food as possible out of the soil.</P>
    <P>The people who are at all times anxious to till and produce the greatest amount of food are the small farmers. I am satisfied that they are badly handicapped through lack of credit. They have no machinery or equipment; they have not adequate housing accommodation for their pigs or poultry; they have not the necessary capital to put their holdings into a proper state of production.  It was indicated here some time ago that if the farmers obtained money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation they would have to have two securities and pay 6 per cent. interest on the money received. If a farmer got a loan of £100 he would pay back £160 over a period of 15 years.  My suggestion is that the Government should issue money to the small farmers free of interest for a number of years.  If some effort along that line is not made, we may be faced with difficult times within the next two or three years; many people may go hungry, all because the small farmers are not in a position financially to cultivate their holdings properly.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what the people of <Col N="896" /> the next generation will think of us. We have any amount of boards, including milk and marketing boards.  It regard them all as restriction boards. We hear a lot of talk about bacon. How many of the working-class people are able to buy bacon?  In Cork some time ago one of our Ministers told us that he did not see much hope for the agricultural community.  One thing he did advocate was that the wages of industrial workers should be reduced so as to bear some relationship to the wages paid to the agricultural community. Is there any reason why the agricultural workers should not have £3 a week?  What is the reason they have not got it?  Is it because they are unorganised, or the victims of circumstances?</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the whole position of the agricultural community is due to our capitalistic system.  We have a large number of small investors and a small number of big financiers, directors of insurance companies, directors of banks, gamblers in currency, and moneylenders, who do nothing at all in the way of actual production.  These are the people who are dominating the administration and the legislation in this country.  There is no inclination to change that system. I suggest that if more attention is not paid to the requirements of the working classes, they may very soon overthrow that system.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister what steps he will take to see that our people will not go hungry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone into the third day, and I think that it is a very good sign.  It indicates that Deputies are beginning to realise what an important position in our economic life the agricultural industry holds. For a great many years Deputies representing urban constituencies, Deputies out of touch with rural life, did not attach sufficient importance to agriculture. Perhaps it is by reason of the shortage of essential food stuffs, due to the emergency through which we are passing, or perhaps it is for other reasons, that the industry is now being placed in its proper perspective.  My quarrel with the Department of Agriculture <Col N="897" /> is that its outlook generally is not from the correct angle.  I think the attitude of the Minister and the Department towards the agricultural industry should be that of a friend, philosopher, and guide.  That is not their present attitude.</P>
      <P>Speaking as an agriculturist, and understanding the problems of my neighbours, I think the Department's outlook is more that of the schoolmaster or the warder.  That should not be so, because the agricultural industry is so important that it requires much careful, skilful and friendly attention. In addition, I do not think the Department realises that farming is as much a business as any other undertaking carried on in any part of the world. Perhaps, it is more of a business in this way: that the farmer has to look ahead and has to plan a whole year in the future.  Some businessmen only have to plan their future from month to month or, perhaps, for six months ahead, but the farmer has to plan for a year ahead and sometimes for two or three years.  He has to carry out a certain course of conduct and planning in connection with his business.  Yet, it is the farmer's business that suffers most from outside interference.  Once it has been decided that a certain course should be adopted towards a certain destination in order to bring about a certain state of affairs in his business, it is very hard, then, when he is half-way through with that course of conduct, to have to meet with regulations from the Department of Agriculture which put his business completely out of gear.  For instance, he may have been fattening pigs with a view to getting a certain price and to be dealt with at a certain weight, and then he suddenly finds that that is changed entirely.  To use a phrase from another industry, it is like throwing a spanner into well-oiled machinery, and no business can be carried on and not suffer if that kind of thing is going to happen.  The farmer should be left alone as much as possible, and he is not being left alone at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that the Department has to bear in mind with regard to <Col N="898" /> this industry of agriculture in our country is that there is a twofold problem. First of all, there is the present problem of producing the maximum amount of food during this emergency, and then there is also the problem of dealing with the future position of the industry.  You cannot separate the two parts of that problem, and I think that there is a great deal too much stress placed upon the present position, and not enough regard had to the future position. For instance, so long as the returns of corn crops can be made large enough for a particular year, it seems to me that the Minister and the Department sit back and that both the Minister and the Department then feel satisfied having got a big yield.  But I do not think the Minister and his Department are paying sufficient attention to what is going to happen in future.  I think that that is a very serious aspect.  It is an aspect that has been generally appreciated by all sides of the House here, however, so far as I can gather from listening to the speeches that have been made during the two days that this discussion has been going on.</P>
    <P>Some of the speakers here yesterday mentioned that this country might have to turn over to intensive farming as against extensive farming in the near future.  I think that perhaps we do not realise that with the increased requirements of tillage, with the fact that a quarter of the arable land of this country, and perhaps more, is being tilled at the moment, we are more than half-way already towards what is known in the text books as intensive farming as against extensive farming. But we are only half-way in one respect, and what we have to realise, and what I think the Minister and his Department should realise and foster, is that if you are going to increase tillage to the extent that we have increased it&mdash;in other words, if you are going to intensify tillage operations on the land you must also, to a corresponding extent, increase live stock, cattle, pigs, and so on, and increase other products of farming, because you must intensify the other end, and doubly so by reason of the absence of <Col N="899" /> artificial manures and the importance of having farmyard manure at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now, my two real quarrels with the Department are, first of all, that it has not a benevolent enough outlook on the agricultural industry, and, secondly, that it has its mind altogether on the present and not sufficiently directed towards the future.  Some mention of credit, or credit facilities, has been made in this debate.  It is always being mentioned in this House, and I know that there are wide differences of opinion on the question of whether or not there should be increased credit facilities for the farming community.  I have always advocated increased and better credit facilities for those who have the responsibility for working the land in this country, and such facilities are doubly necessary now when more has to be got out of the land. In order to get the maximum out of the land, you have got to put into it brawn, brains and skill, plus money or credit, and if you leave out the fourth item you will not get results.  Increased credit facilities are the duty and function of the Government.  It is the duty of the Government to provide credit facilities, but certainly the credit available at the present time is not sufficient to produce the best results from our land.</P>
    <P>I think also that we are inclined to be a little bit too conservative with regard to the crops that are fostered in this country.  The great problem of the future, when all those people who have left the country will come back again, will be how to absorb them into useful employment.  They will not find sufficient employment on the land unless there are subsidiary industries depending upon the land, and I think there is a great future in this country, as there must be in every agricultural country, for the development of certain sidelines of produce. I refer now to the canning and bottling of vegetables and fruit.  That can become, and should become, a very big industry, indeed, in this country. It is only a few years now since the canning or bottling of fruit and <Col N="900" /> vegetables reached such a stage that the average person cared to cat bottled, canned or tinned fruit and vegetables, but it has reached such a state of high technical efficiency at the present time, in those countries that go in for it, that sometimes it is very hard, in the midst of winter, to distinguish between canned and fresh food of the vegetable and fruit variety.  In some cases, as in that of asparagus, some people prefer the tinned asparagus to the fresh variety.</P>
    <P>Now, without having to dig down into the soil for minerals, we have the opportunity of producing an abundance of the raw materials for such an industry. If we were to turn to this matter of bottling or canning such goods, I submit that we have the raw material here to keep all our surplus population in productive and useful employment, because those are the types of goods that can be exported or can be used at home.  Perhaps, in dealing with that class of goods, I am thinking more of the future, when times are better and the emergency has passed, but I think it is something that the Department should have their eyes upon and in connection with which they should be experimenting.  There are peas, beans, and various other things that, apart from the question of providing such raw material, are of very great use to the land.  Experts tell me that such vegetables send back to the land the necessary nitrogen that is generally supplied in some of the artificial manures and that, far from doing the land any harm, they would be doing it a great deal of good.  I know that certain people, in a big agricultural way in this country, are already going in for these lines and selling their products to existing factories in this country, but I do not see why that branch of our agricultural industry should not be expanded. I do not see why we should not have very large fields of asparagus along the coast, as it grows in similar climates and on similar soil along the east coast of England, and is grown there for canning also.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well for the Department to bear the two points I have <Col N="901" /> made in mind: first of all, to be a little bit more fatherly and sympathetic to those who have to produce the food in this country; and, secondly, not to think altogether so much in the present, but to have an eye on the future so that the land may profit, and that when this emergency passes we may find we have an industry well geared and running efficiently, producing the raw material needed to put into employment those of our population who cannot find direct employment on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. W.J. Broderick Mr. W.J. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W.J. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the futility of direct recrimination and will content myself with making a few comments on what has been the effect of the Minister's cereal policy of last year.  The delay that occurred in the fixing of a reasonable price for wheat has left us in the position in which we find ourselves to-day when we are threatened with a ration of six or seven ounces of bread.  I remember telling the Minister from this side of the House, in connection with the fixing of prices for oats and barley, that in my opinion he had not sufficient force in the country to compel the law in that regard to be obeyed.  Although the price of oats was fixed at 18/8, I am told that in Kerry it is being offered for sale at 44/8.  The price of barley was fixed at from 28/- to 30/-, and we know it has been making 44/-.  The position, therefore, is that the Minister's policy has been effective only in handicapping every law-abiding citizen and trader who desired to conform to the law.  That is a position that ought to be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in rising to speak is twofold. First, I want to suggest to the Minister ways and means which would facilitate the farmers in planting their crops, and, secondly, in saving them.  I was not at all convinced by his reply on the distribution of free seeds until such time as they were collectively grown with the prices deducted when delivered.  I see no insurmountable difficulty in carrying out the suggestion that was made to the Minister. His reply was that to segregate different classes of wheat might give <Col N="902" /> trouble.  I think it is generally held throughout the country that those who are engaged in this business have been reasonably well compensated for their national efforts&mdash;some people would say more than compensated.  To segregate the wheat and make it available for farmers should not present any insurmountable difficulty.  The seed could be supplied to the farmer and the price collected when the crop was delivered in the following year.  I see no difficulty in that, except, it be a disposition on the part of some people not to co-operate with the rest of the country in the production of essential food.</P>
    <P>The next point is the provision of tractors.  The supply this year has been insufficient.  The shortage of petrol and of crude oil may account, to some extent, for that.  I understand that in Northern Ireland the Government there hold a substantial number of tractors so that anybody who finds a difficulty in getting one through the normal channel can get supplied by the Government.  They are not supplied free nor do I suggest that they should be supplied free here. Beyond all, the essential thing for us is to produce food.  The position is that the people with a cereal tradition who would be anxious to conform to the Minister's desire to increase our food supplies were not numerous enough to produce all that is needed in the present emergency, with the result that new unbroken land had to be entered upon in areas where there was not sufficient machinery to meet the requirements of the increased tillage drive.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of many other men, it was the duty of the Department of Agriculture to see that this machinery was made available.  If the two points I have made with regard to the provision of seeds and of tractors be attended to during the coming year, it will mean that the work of increasing our food production will be greatly facilitated. I think the Minister on a former occasion did make the point that it was the duty of the local authorities to attend to these matters.  It is hardly fair for the Minister to pass on <Col N="903" /> what is a national obligation and necessity to the local authorities.  The provision of tractors is a really important matter so far as the production of food is concerned.  What the Minister should concentrate his mind on now is the making of provision for the saving of this year's harvest.  Some people may say that I am raising this question rather early, but knowing how slow Government Departments are to form organisations, and the long time it takes to convince them of the absolute necessity of doing a thing, I am putting this forward now so that the Department will have time to consider it.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that many of our young men have left the country, and that a good many more have answered the national call and joined the Army. I am not exaggerating when I say that the majority of those left at home are the elderly men and the women and children.  In the opinion of many it would be beyond their power to save the coming harvest.  If Providence blesses us with a fine harvest, no doubt strenuous efforts will be made to save it, but in my view a big national effort will be required to complete the work, especially in view of the numbers who have left the country and are still going.  The only way I see of making certain that the harvest will be saved is for the Government to organise some of the young men in the Army to help in the work.  The majority of them have come from the country, and I am sure would prove experienced helpers.  I am sure there will be no disposition on their part not to desire to co-operate in what is, after all, an urgent necessity.  I would remind the House that the other elements in the community are likely to suffer more from a bad harvest, or a lost harvest, than farmers, who will manage to get a sufficiency for themselves and their families.  Those other elements have to depend on the surplus, so that I cannot imagine there will be any objection on the part of men who have pledged to give their lives for the defence of the country to lend a hand in saving the harvest.  What work could be more <Col N="904" /> vital than the safeguarding of the food supplies?  This is clearly a time when all sections of the community should be prepared to do their very utmost to see that the crops arc planted at the present time and saved in the harvest. I do not want to be taken as an alarmist, but I have the conviction that if there is not co-operation between all elements in the State in the saving of the harvest, we are going, I fear, to meet with disaster in this country.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to have it sown; it is equally essential to have it saved. There is no other possibility of saving it but by mobilising the entire forces of the country.  I do not wish the forces of the country to be engaged to the detriment of labour.  My suggestion is that where labour is not available or is not sufficient the Government should co-operate in saving the harvest.  I think that is only reasonable.  When they know how vital it is and when they know that the food supplies depend on it, I do not think there can be any objection to that.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider the points I have raised as to the provision of seeds and of the necessary machinery for the sowing of the seeds. Experience has taught me that we will have a lot of very indifferent sowing this year because we have not the necessary machinery, and if we do not get the oil that is required we will have a lot more indifferent crops.  I want to have that safeguarded against next year.  Many men were disposed to grow more wheat if they could get the seeds.  There was a great difficulty in getting seeds and the cost of the seeds was enormous.  If a man wants to plant 20 barrels of wheat his capital outlay will not be returned to him for many months.  That is a severe strain on the limited resources of our agricultural community.  Surely it is the duty of the State to help in that matter. Then there is the question of the provision of tractors in a national way for the coming year.</P>
    <P>For the present year, as so much depends upon it, the forces of the State ought to be organised and made available where necessary to help in the saving of the harvest.  The Minister <Col N="905" /> may say that it would be very difficult to arrange machinery for that.  I do not know whether it would be considered presumptuous to make a suggestion.  I might, however, point out that in every area in the country there is a parish council which is in touch with the community and usually the best elements in the locality go to make up the parish council.  They are aware of the conditions of every agriculturist in the area.  An organisation could be set up by the Ministry in connection with the Army, if they wished.  The parish council could make representations on behalf of local farmers who found it difficult to get labour to whatever organised authority you have.  In that way you would have, in my view, the simplest form of co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that I have refrained from any criticism of his responsibility for the present situation and of the delay in giving reasonable prices.  As I said, nothing is so futile as useless recrimination. I am pointing out to him now the necessity for the provision of labour for saving the harvest in the coming year, and, secondly, the necessity for considering means by which sufficient crops will be sown next year.  We have often been told about the necessity for being self-sufficient in this country.  We ought now to have a reasonable, <i>bona fide</i> co-operative movement to make the country self-sufficient.  Except we adopt some means such as I have suggested I cannot see any hope in the future either of sowing sufficient, crops or of saving them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to impress on the Minister the necessity for having some advisory committee to look into the question of our agricultural policy for the future.  We all know that after the war conditions will be very different from what they were before.  I think it would be a great benefit to the country if the Department of Agriculture set up such a committee, composed of people who know the ins and outs of farming so that we may be ready when the war is over. Things are advancing in the world and <Col N="906" /> our farmers, if they want to make a living after the war, will have to change their way of going.  Deputy Childers mentioned yesterday that he foresaw a time when the English would not take our cattle in the way they arc at present exported.  After the last war a lot of people thought that too and people put money into the Drogheda dead meat factory and other factories.  Afterwards they saw that it was a mistake.  A lot of people at present are beginning to think that after the present war it will be necessary for us to have a dead-meat trade. My opinion is that we should concentrate upon having good store cattle for the English market after the war, because we never could capture the dead-meat trade in competition with the Argentine and other countries.  If we got into the dead-meat trade anybody in the cattle trade knows that there would be certain cliques in England and the price would be raised 1d. now and then dropped 1d.  The store cattle trade is the natural trade for this country so far as any commonsense farmer can see and if we concentrate on that I do not think we will be ousted out of the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the tendency of the English Department of Agriculture is to concentrate on more milk.  I am told that any farmer who produces a cow which will give milk will get a subsidy of £10.  That will tend, so far as I can see, towards the breeding of an animal that will not be any good for the British farmers to feed.  It will be more of a milking strain.  If we concentrate on good store cattle, I think it would mean that our farmers would get the benefit of the British market, because I know the English farmers, no matter what happens, will turn to Irish store cattle.  If a County Meath farmer buys stores in the County Meath they will not improve very much on his land.  If, on the other hand, he goes to Galway and buys store cattle there they will improve on the Meath land.  In the same way, if an English farmer buys an English store beast, it will not improve as much for him as an Irish store beast would.  No matter what Deputy Childers may think, the English farmer will buy Irish stores <Col N="907" /> in preference to any others.  After the last war Canadian stores were brought into England and a number of people invested in farms in Canada on that account, but they lost on them because the British farmers continued to buy the Irish store cattle, as they would pay best.  I think the Department of Agriculture should concentrate on improving our store cattle.  They are very good at present.</P>
    <P>The milk scheme of the Department is all right.  At present they are concentrating on the Shorthorn breed. They are trying to breed a dual-purpose beast for milk and beef.  I think the Department are going on the right lines, but that they are not giving sufficient encouragement in connection with that.  They are not giving a sufficient subsidy to keep the good Shorthorn bulls in the country. The foundation of all our stock is really Shorthorn.  Every beast in the United Kingdom comes from the Shorthorn. At present the tendency is to breed whiteheads and blackheads.  Whiteheads are all right, but if you keep on breeding them you will get a small beast which will not be suitable for everybody.  The whitehead is good for the small farmer because it comes to maturity six or eight months before others.  That is why the Department should give a bigger subsidy for Shorthorn bulls.  They should give more in order to make them keep the bulls in the country.  The Department should see to it that there are enough Shorthorn bulls in each locality.  It is through the Shorthorn heifer we will be able to keep our store cattle trade with England, and I think the Department should concentrate more and more on getting the Shorthorn breed.  I would not agree with Deputy Childers that we are going to lose the British market.  I say that we will not lose it if we concentrate on the Shorthorn breed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I think the Deputy misunderstood me.  In actual fact, I was referring to store cattle and not to dead meat at all.  I was suggesting <Col N="908" /> that the British, after the war, would demand an improvement in the standard of store cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was referring to a standard joint. Deputy Childers also gave some statistics as to the number of cattle per acre.  I think he mentioned three acres to the beast.  If you feed only that many cattle you will not get much return from the land.  I would say a sheep and a beast to the acre, and you would require good land to do that.  In Deputy Childers' speech, generally, there were many points that should be looked into.  He talked about a post-war policy for agriculture.  We are in a changing world, and things will be very different after the war.  The Department has a lot of inspectors at the present time, and they should be asked to prepare some scheme for reseeding the land after the war.  After the last war most of the land was allowed to go wild, and that should not be allowed to happen again.  I think it would be a great benefit to the country if the Department would prepare some scheme for reseeding, even if they had to give free hay seed in order to put something back into the land.  Agriculture is the principal industry of the country, and it is the industry that is keeping the country going at the present time.  Were it not for the stored-up fertility of our soil we would not be able to feed our people now. After the war, we must try to put the land back into the same state that it is in now, and if necessary try to store up fertility for a future time.  If we had not stored-up fertility in the land at the moment the people of the cities and towns would be in a bad plight. Any money spent on putting our land back in a fertile condition after the war would be money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is fair to accuse the farmers of holding up the wheat.  There may be isolated cases where that has happened, but the farmers as a body should not be branded with that accusation, and I think it was very small of the Government to summon farmers in a few cases for feeding screenings of wheat to cattle.  It was just as if they wanted to shift the blame from themselves. <Col N="909" /> We all know very well that, when the city man hears about one farmer giving wheat to pigs, he concludes that farmers generally are holding up the wheat and feeding it to animals.  That is not so.  The wheat is not there; the return was not in it, and it is not fair to place the blame on the farmers in that way.</P>
    <P>I want to say that in my opinion the farm improvements scheme was the best scheme ever started in this country.  Deputy Childers congratulated the Government on it yesterday. I think I myself was the first to mention such a scheme in this House. Three or four years ago I referred to the desirability of an improvements scheme such as they had in Northern Ireland.  We are now following on the same lines, and it is one of the best schemes ever introduced in this country, because it helps the farmer to live on his own land instead of going out and working on the roads.  Under that scheme, numerous small farmers are now doing useful work for the country instead of having to go out and work on the roads.  I think the scheme should be further developed, and that more money should be allotted to it each year.</P>
    <P>There are many different views on the question of the germination of wheat.  I heard of people who tested the wheat for germination in November, and it was tested again in February, when the germination was not half what it was in November.  I asked whether the wheat had heated, and I was told that it had not.  The farmers should be given some information on the subject, because at the moment they go to the expense of sowing a field of wheat, thinking it is the best, and it does not grow. That has happened in a few cases.</P>
    <P>The Department should fix the price per acre to be charged by tractor owners for ploughing.  I know a few farmers who were not in tillage, and who are not very well off, and they were victimised badly by the tractor owners.  It may be said that they should have had horses, but they had not the horses and were not in a position to get them.  They had to hire <Col N="910" /> tractors, and were charged 30/- per statute acre.  I think that is exorbitant. I understand that in Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture fixed the charge at 23/- or 24/- per statute acre.  The charge should also be fixed here, so that the farmers will not be victimised.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the price of beef and mutton.  I believe the Department did all they could to get the price increased, but as far as we can see the price of beef this year is a ¼d. a lb. less than it was last year.  I think the Government should press very strongly to get the price of beef fixed at least 1½d. a lb. higher, because freight charges and so on have increased. The Irish fanner is getting 14/- or 15/- a cwt. less for beef than the English farmer gets.  It is the same as regards eggs.  The price of eggs to the Irish farmer is not right. He has to take ? a dozen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are ? in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The English farmer gets 3/1 a dozen for any eggs he produces. I think the price should be increased here, because the farmers are going in for egg production a lot now, and the Department encourages them to do so by giving grants, for poultry rearing. I do not think they should be asked to throw away their eggs at ? a dozen when the English farmer gets 3/1 a dozen.  There should be some re-casting of the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to petrol, I realise that the situation is not very hopeful, but the farmers are in the front-line trenches and some scheme should be devised which will make provision for them.   Not every farmer may want petrol, but certain farmers cannot do without it, and some scheme should be devised&mdash;a scheme of committees which would look into each individual case, for instance&mdash;by which these farmers would get a certain amount. I have a letter from a lady, an invalid, whose brother lives ten or 15 miles away from her.  He is not very strong either and he has other business as well as farming and I urge that some provision in the way of discs should be <Col N="911" /> made for such people.  If petrol is available, a scheme should be arranged to provide, firstly, for the farmers and, secondly, for the cattle traders going to fairs.  These people could be given special discs, and the scheme could even provide for three or four men going in one car with special discs to enable them to get to fairs.  There are numbers of fairs in country districts and hundreds of farmers will be victimised if they cannot send their cattle to those areas where prices are good. They will have to sell their cattle at a couple of pounds less when there is no competition and it is a matter which the Department should look into.</P>
    <P>Another matter on more or less the same lines is that of the train service in an important county like Meath. The whole centre of County Meath has been left without a train.  There is no passenger train from Kingscourt to Dublin, so that the whole centre of the county is left without a service. There is a bus which runs at midday, but that is the only service through that area, from Summerhill down as far as Lucan.  The train came into Mullingar yesterday, but could not take a passenger from Mullingar to Dublin.  I know one man who had business in the market to-day who could not get to Dublin by train and who had to hire a car which cost him £3 in order to get here.  There is one partial solution which might be adopted.  There are numerous goods trains coming up and I suggest that the railway company be asked to put a carriage on to these trains. It may mean a journey of ten or 12 hours, but people will get up here eventually and would be greatly helped.  As I say, the journey would be somewhat lengthy, but people would get here eventually.</P>
    <P>A further point is that the train leaving Dublin at present is not suitable. The train into Dublin arrives at 5 o'clock in the evening and the train in the morning leaves at 10 o'clock, and I suggest that that departure time should be put back two hours, which would not greatly inconvenience anybody.  The townspeople <Col N="912" /> could do their business in the morning and catch the train back at 12 or 12.30.  Instead, under the present arrangement, they lose three days.  If the hour of departure were put back as I suggest it, would mean the loss of a day less.  I impress on the Minister the necessity for setting up some scheme of post-war agriculture. We are in a changing world and we know the value of our land at present and we are anxious to see that land in the same state of fertility later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to touch at all upon the many complaints that could be, and have been, made by the farmers against the Government.  More than once I have asked the Government&mdash;and I do not think it necessary to repeat it&mdash;to cooperate to the fullest extent with the farmers in their efforts to supply the country with the necessary food.  I feel that they have not done so, but, as I say, I am leaving that problem.  I speak really as a person without anything approaching expert knowledge of the matter, but with a certain amount of fears, a person who would like to emphasise some of the remarks made already as to the problems which will face this country&mdash;problems some solution of which must be found by the people and by the Government.  I might divide them into two classes: some immediate problems which must be solved, and solved possibly to a certain extent by hand to mouth methods, with nothing very radical or permanent, because it is quite possible that the causes which give rise to these problems are passing causes and that, therefore, a passing solution may be all that is called for, and on the other, hand the much more difficult problem, the problem that will not yield to purely temporary measures but a problem which this country will undoubtedly have to face and which has been mentioned by more than one Deputy, of prevision of what we, whose principal industry is still agriculture, are likely to have to face after the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take one example of the first kind.  So far as my information goes there is, for instance, a danger that, unless something fairly drastic is done, <Col N="913" /> and done quickly, the dairying industry may collapse.  If it collapses, it will be exceedingly difficult in the period after the war, when conditions may be in some respects more unfavourable, to restore it.  I can quite see the point of the objection that from the Ministerial side has been made to subsidising, but there are times when subsidising may be absolutely necessary to prevent a collapse, and, though something may be said against a policy of the permanent subsidising of any industry, a crisis may occur in an industry which may make quick dealing with it there and then very necessary.  You cannot afford a long term solution; you have not time for that; you must save the thing while it is still alive, because, once it dies, how can we make it live again?</P>
    <P>What has perturbed me always about our subsidising and our general policy of tariffs, which is a method of subsidising, is this: if you take one industry after another, including agriculture, how are you to subsidise every industry and out of what are all these industries &mdash;practically every one in the country&mdash; to be permanently subsidised?  That is a problem.  What we have largely done up to the present is to subsidise other industries&mdash;secondary industries, important industries, if you like&mdash;and that has apparently made it more difficult for us in times of crisis like the present to come to the assistance of the main industry.  Much as some of the members of the Government may be inclined to shy at the idea of coming to the aid of farming at the present time by means of subsidies, I think they should re-examine the question if they feel any compunction about that, because what may or may not be sound policy spread over a number of years may be absolutely necessary in a time of crisis and in a time of exceptional conditions that may last only for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>Such problems are distinct from the problem of what this country may have to face after the war.  I am not convinced that a radical alteration and a readiness to face a radical alteration may not be necessary.  I remember a long while after the last war the difficulties <Col N="914" /> that farming had to face.  There were times in which a man living in this country and living in Europe had to ask himself whether farming could be made an economic business.  I am not speaking at the moment of the very exceptional man who will make a success of any business he takes up, in practically any conditions: I am speaking of the average farmer, and you will have to take the ordinary average farmer just as you take the ordinary average shopkeeper or labourer or industrialist, and you will have to shape your plans for him.  The problem is one that confronts not merely us, but the whole of Europe.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may remember that the former Minister for Agriculture, the late Mr. Hogan, was continually dinning into our ears certain figures.  I quote this merely as indicating that there is a terrific problem as regards farming and agriculture before every country in Europe.  The late Mr. Hogan was continually dinning into our ears the difference, measured from 1914, between what the farmer had to pay out and what he got in.  The figures he put before us were somewhat like these.  He said that, compared with 1914, the farmer's income, the price he got for what he produced, increased 40 per cent., and his outgoings increased 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the year 1928 I was in Munich, in Bavaria, and I was speaking to some of the Ministers there.  We were discussing the general economic situation of that particular country.  We here might regard it as rather an industrialised country, that State of Bavaria as it then was.  On the other hand, they looked upon it from the German point of view as being essentially an agricultural community.  I was rather taken aback when one Minister said to me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Well, you see, the difficulty farmers have to face here is this. In comparison with 1914, their income, what they get for their produce, has advanced only 40 per cent., whereas what they pay for the necessaries of life and for the farm has advanced 60 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> Exactly the same problem was facing the people there as was facing the people here, with this difference, that he told me an alarming fact, so far as the farmers there were concerned practically every farm in the country at that time was mortgaged&mdash;a thing from which we did not suffer to such an extent.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has followed the investigations set on foot by the League of Nations knows the various crises through which agriculture went in the period following the last war.  There were periods in which, apparently, several countries that depended on agriculture were on the verge of collapse, just as many of those that depended on industry were on the verge of collapse.  I find, listening in occasionally to the radio, that the post-war agricultural problem is earnestly engaging the attention of many of the Governments in Europe at the present moment.  They do recognise that a radical change will take place.  I might, without going into details that might give rise to controversy, direct the Minister's attention to certain things in some recent radio statements which I heard.  I heard a charge made &mdash;I am not going into the question whether there was any foundation for it or not, because that is not what I am interested in&mdash;that Germany intends, after the war, to make a distinction in regard to agriculture, to have higher types of agriculture and lower types, lower in the sense of requiring less technical knowledge, less labour&mdash;generally speaking, agriculture of a poorer type.  It was stated that the more subject peoples would be forced to go in for the lower type and that Germany would keep to the higher type on her own land.</P>
    <P>That same distinction was made at a meeting of representatives of different States-that took place in England. It was suggested that there were certain forms of agriculture that were not remunerative, were not economic, and that it would be necessary that the future agriculture of the European countries would have <Col N="916" /> to be orientated along proper lines. I do not know the value of these suggestions. I merely wish to draw them to the notice of the Minister and his experts.  After all, it is not the ordinary man who has a knowledge of farming in this country for the last 20 or 30 years who will be able to cope with this.  He will be able to give a certain amount of advice, but I fear there is a situation arising in which something more than such valuable experience as he has will be required if this country is to make agriculture pay in the post war period.  The problem was fully recognised at some of these gatherings to which I refer.  Again, the distinction was made, and it was exactly the same distinction&mdash;along the same lines &mdash;as to the types of agriculture, between what is for agriculture a paying proposition and what is not, what is a higher and what is a lower type.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that we started to take an interest in these things.  After the war we shall have to face the problem of agriculture without any Party feeling, away from any Party prejudice. We shall have to face an entirely new and exceedingly difficult problem.  It is important that the Minister should get the best advice from those who are in a position to give it.  I do not hold that anybody can speak with perfect confidence, or anything like it, but at least there ought to be people who can speak with more knowledge of our agricultural future than others.  It should not be aquestion of Party politics.  It is exceedingly difficult for any person who has followed the trend of agriculture and prices, either in this country or elsewhere in Europe, for the last 20 years, to convince himself that there is a prospect, even without the present war, of making farming pay.  What it will be when the changes that must follow the present war begin to have their effect, I sometimes tremble to contemplate.  It is our main industry, it will remain our main industry, and we cannot afford to let it collapse.  We must, if we can, put it on a sound footing in the years that follow the war.  For the moment, temporary expedients <Col N="917" /> may be sufficient and they will be necessary, but they will not be sufficient to deal with the post-war period and the post-war problems.  We may have to deal with the question of organisation in a way that we have never contemplated up to the present time, and I think that not merely will we have to do that, but I should not be surprised if other European nations may have to do it also.</P>
    <P>It is a matter, as I say, that ought now to engage the attention of the Minister and at least of a section of the best advisers that he can get.  I often think that a lot of the criticism of the farmers that we listen to is quite useless, even harmful.  My experience is that they work hard, as hard as, and very often harder than, the ordinary businessman, the ordinary shopkeeper or the ordinary industrialist.   The farmers work quite as hard as any of these people; in fact, I might say that they work harder than most people except, perhaps, the higher civil servants. However, leaving these aside, they do work hard.  I admit, as I said at the beginning, that there are some people who under any circumstances can make any business pay, but they are not average people, and it is for the average man that you have got to legislate.  There may be an absence of what you would call business sense on the part of the ordinary farmer.  He does not use money as a businessman would use it, and you may have to get a number of farmers out of that particular habit.  They should be gradually got into the idea of using money for the improvement of their farms.  More co-operation between different farmers may be absolutely essential.  If we are to have, what we do wish to have, the continued existence of small farms in this country, then I think that, to meet a situation that is likely to occur after the war, you will have to have closer co-operation between these small farmers.  How that will be brought about, again, is a matter for the Minister. There must be a change in the mentality with which we approach this problem.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that at the present moment when, remember, money is <Col N="918" /> cheap&mdash;cheaper than at any time, I should say, since this State was set up, or if not cheaper, at least it should be cheaper&mdash;the investment of money in the improvement of land and farming would seem to me to be an ordinary business proposition, if you can only secure that it is used in a businesslike way.  Delay in that matter may bring about a crisis which will make our post-war problem all the more difficult. We may be able to stagger through the immediate period of the war without a general collapse, though unless measures be taken certain portions of the industry may collapse even during that period.  I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that danger, especially from the point of view of the dairying side of the industry. Expedients may be necessary for the moment to keep the industry alive, but, above all, I would ask the Minister and his Department to face now the problem of the post-war condition of farming.</P>
    <P>To make farming a paying proposition seems to me to be an extremely difficult job.  It is highly likely, just as happened after the last war, that a number of non-European countries, that are not now in such close connection with Europe, may be brought into closer connection, and that will make our problem all the more difficult. It is, therefore, all the more necessary to tackle our problem at the present time, to try to save the industry as it stands at the moment, and to take the necessary steps, so far as expert advice is available&mdash;and I think it is only expert advice that is useful for this purpose&mdash;to prepare for the problem of the future as well.  These are the main remarks I have to make on this particular Vote, and I have only made them because I am perturbed about that particular problem of the future.  Other countries that can rely more on what are generally called industrial products may not have the same problem, but we certainly will have this problem and it behoves us to face it and to face it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had recently two public statements, from the Minister <Col N="919" /> for Agriculture, on the one hand, and from, I think, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the other hand, dealing with the agricultural industry in this country.  The Minister for Agriculture informed an audience &mdash;I think it was in Cork&mdash;that the dairying industry was not likely to be very prosperous in the near future, and that he saw very little hope for it.  If he were correctly reported in the Press, I think that was the substance of a sentence in the speech he made there in the university.  Recently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was reported as having said that he saw very little future for the live-stock industry of this country.  Now, if those two statements are to be taken as indicating the impression of the Government regarding the agricultural industry in this country for the future, it does not look to be very rosy.  One wonders what is the agricultural policy of this country at the moment.  Apart from steps that may be taken, hurriedly, perhaps, to deal with immediate needs, presumably, looking over the events of the last ten years, one might be inclined to look more at the statements that have been made regarding what is Government policy than at the results.  But if we take the results, they, as far as one can learn from what has been said in this House, amount to this: that there was a change over in agricultural policy since this Government came into office in 1932, and the Government went in for the development of a tillage policy in this country. Now, the tillage of this country is recorded in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> as corn, roots, greens, flax and fruit; and, starting off with 1931, we find that there were then 1,425,000 acres of tillage. That varied, in 1932, to 1,423,000; in 1933, to 1,455,000; in 1934, to 1,496,000; in 1935, to 1,591,000; in 1936, to 1,621,000; in 1937, to 1,592,000; in 1938, to 1,568,000; and in 1939, to 1,492,000.  Now, apart from a rise dating from let us say, 1934 up to 1938, the development of tillage in 1939 meant an addition of 70,000 acres, if the returns be correct&mdash;67,000 acres, since one figure is 1,492,000 and the other is 1,425,000.  Now, if that is the <Col N="920" /> result of the policy, obviously somebody has been very much mistaken.</P>
      <P>Let us take the other side of it.  We have had returns showing the numbers of persons engaged in agriculture over that series of years, and these show that in 1931 there were 562,000 persons employed.  Somewhere about the year 1934 an alteration was made in the manner in which those figures were taken out, so that persons who had no interest in having their names returned had an added interest in it from that year.  It is only right that that should be mentioned because the disposition has been to put the figures up, and they went up for no particular reason except the one I have given. They went up in 1934 from the previous year by nearly 30,000.  Now the influence of that has been to have a bigger return.  In 1940 the number of persons employed in agriculture was 543,000, almost 544,000, and last year the number was 555,000.  In other words, the sum and substance of the policy adopted in respect to agriculture, if there was a policy, has been to reduce the number of persons engaged in the industry.  I did not give the number of acres under tillage in 1940, but I propose to do so now.  The figure for 1940 is 1,845,000 acres, and for 1941, 2,236,000 acres.  There were 13,000 more persons engaged in agriculture in 1941 than in 1940, although the area under tillage increased by almost 2,000 acres.  It is plain from those figures that the tillage policy as such added nothing whatever to the number of persons engaged in agriculture. If we go a step farther, it is obvious from the development of land division in the country that if the number of persons who acquired holdings or extensions of holdings in that period&mdash;a development which, if we take the returns as being correct, was carried out at a very heavy cost in certain cases, in fact, generally&mdash;be taken it, too, added nothing whatever to the number of persons engaged in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I listened to a Deputy on the far side speak of the value of land and of the great increase in it that had taken place in recent years.  As I did <Col N="921" /> so I was reminded of the lines in the <i>Deserted Village</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;III fares the land to hastening ills a prey</P>
    <P Just="Center">Where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan has said we are now in a rather difficult period of the world's history.  We have had experience of the slump which hit the agricultural industry at the conclusion of the last war.  Occasionally, one hears statements to the effect that it is not likely we are going to get much consideration in the British market in the future.  Well, one thing at any rate is quite clear from the events of those last years, and that is that there is no alternative market now.  We are not likely to hear anything in the future about an alternative market, either from election platforms or in this House.  That bubble is burst once and for all.  It is a great pity, because as long as it was not tried it was there at any rate for bargaining purposes. If we were talking to the other people and trying to make a bargain with them it could be used, but that is gone now.  The reserves are gone, and everyone is now in the front line.  As regards the future, one of the compelling things put forward against us is our position of neutrality.  We read in the newspapers that in London recently there was very cordial appreciation there of the Danes&mdash;that compliments were extended to the Dutch, the Belgians and the Norwegians. But at the present moment there are far more people of Irish extraction in the army, navy and air force of our neighbour across the way than there are of all those peoples put together.</P>

      <P>Why is it then, when an ordinary business bargain is to be made between the two countries, that we would not be in as good a position as any of those belligerents.  I hope that, in addition to the blunders that have been made in connection with public policy&mdash;industrially, economically, financially and agriculturally&mdash; we are not going to have added to <Col N="922" /> them a general dose of the inferiority complex over this country.  We are told on occasion that we have made great preparations for the emergency that we are passing through.  What preparations did we make?  We started to grow wheat and to extend tillage during a number of years in which we imported less superphosphates than we did in the years when we had not got that extensive tillage political push.  What we did import was made more expensive for our farmers by reason of that political push. In addition, they got less for their products, while their land was not in as good heart as it needed to be for the emergency.  As well, we had tariffs placed on agricultural machinery and so on.  The policy of the Department of Agriculture during those years should have been, &ldquo;help industry as much as you please and at whatever cost you like, and let the people of this country bear the cost of it, but do not let it fall upon the agricultural industry.&rdquo; The development of the manufacture of Irish implements should have been carried out by means of subsidies.  It should have been done by some other means than of asking those who were never so badly remunerated for what they had to sell to bear the cost of it.  That was the position of farmers over that period, and they should never have been asked to bear the cost.  Never within living memory, nor even within the memory of our fathers, was the return for farm labourers and farmers as bad as it has been over the last eight or ten years. To expect an improvement in the position of either class during a period of low wages and of low incomes one would certainly need to be in a very optimistic frame of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's address at the Cork University he referred to the milk yield of Irish cows and compared the yield with that of New Zealand, particularly the north island, and some countries on the Continent. To my mind there does not seem to be any good or sound reason given for the low milk yield in this country.  It should be the business of the Department to endeavour to increase that yield in every way possible. <Col N="923" /> There does not seem to be any good reason why we should not have any winter dairying here as they have in other countries.  It may bo that the climate in New Zealand is more suitable for all-the-year round dairying than is our climate, but surely Denmark is not better situated in that respect than we are.   One of the causes alleged by at least one expert for this low yield in this country is that our cattle are not either sufficiently fed or sufficiently well fed.  If anybody in this country should have knowledge of that it is the officials of the Department of Agriculture.  That should be their business.  The person who made that statement is, I believe, a doctor of science, a man who has had some experience of agriculture and who is closely in touch with the agricultural developments of the last 20 or 30 years.  If it is possible to increase the yield of our cows we might solve this question of the dairying industry. It is a matter worth while considering. I suggest to the Minister one experimental method of trying it out.  There are various agricultural colleges in this country.  Why not buy from farmers cows which have a low milk yield, if there is no other way of doing it, and in one of those colleges see if, by any special method of food rationing and so on, it is not possible to increase the yield and, if it is not, demonstrate the desirability of getting rid of those animals which have a low yield and which are a loss not only to those who keep them but to the country?</P>
    <P>I will not go into the question of the desirability of pushing the store cattle trade.  It appears to me that the policy of the last ten years has practically killed, or has done its level best to kill, the fat cattle trade.  But, speaking more as a business man than a man having any knowledge of farming, I think that is a great mistake if we are really bent on increasing our tillage. Obviously, the crops obtained from tillage could not be better employed than in feeding cattle.  We ought to get the price for them, rather than to have middle-men coming in.  It is desirable that there should be a market for store cattle here to be turned into <Col N="924" /> fat cattle; otherwise we will be left with only Scotch and English buyers, and, of course, they can regulate their own prices.</P>
    <P>We have had experience during the last few years of what are called licences for various purposes.  So far as agriculture is concerned, there were licences for the export of cattle, and they are now available, we are told, for the export of cows.  Will the Minister look into the question of the price paid for cows at Irish fairs or in the Dublin market, and what is the ruling price in England of those animals?  If the information given to me is correct, the price here varies from £30 to £40, while the price in England is from £60 upwards.  If that gap is traceable to the right to get a licence, or anything like that, it is the Department's business to settle that question.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard from farmers that notice was given suddenly regarding a reduction in the price of pigs.  I wonder what kind of religion is practised in the Department of Agriculture or if there is any religion practised.  I know of no religion which gives the right to persons to steal money from others, and that is nothing short of stealing. If there is a desire to cut down the future output of pigs, notice should be given that on such and such a date in future the price will be so and so. When a man has spent money on producing a pig and is entitled to get his return, do not attempt to rob him of what he is entitled to by reducing the price now.  That is common robbery. People can have no respect for the laws of any country that permit such a thing as that.  You have no right to do it.  You have no right to try to train farmers according to the opinions of mathematicians in a Department by doing a thing like that.</P>
    <P>On looking up the Estimate, I found that tillage which was undertaken last year by the Department was estimated to cost £2,276 and that the sum that they expected to derive from the money so expended was £1,920, a loss of about £350.  Will the Minister give us some information as to what the exact situation was last year?  There <Col N="925" /> is a difference this year.  It is estimated that the expenditure will be £4,675 this year and they expect to receive £3,600.  In both of these cases there is a big loss.  Farmers are entitled to expect at least that the Department of Agriculture in their excursions into tillage would not incur a loss.  We would like to know if that means an anticipated loss of £1,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister dismissed in very few words the token item in this year's Estimate of £5 or £10 under the heading of diseases of animals, mentioning that there was a very big expenditure under that heading last year in order to deal with the foot-and-mouth outbreak. He merely mentioned that, under sub-head N (1) last year, there was provided a sum of £470,000 for the purpose of compensation under the Diseases of Animals (Ireland) Acts, 1894 to 1938.  That was entirely devoted towards the foot-and-mouth outbreak.  I want to say a few words on that.  First of all, there ought to be reconsideration of those cases in which compensation was withheld from certain farmers.  In one of those cases which was brought under my notice the farmer himself was ill at the time.  Illness is rather a common excuse; it is nearly always put forward. In this particular case the man had a manager.  The case was brought before the courts and the manager was fined £100.  When the compensation fell to be awarded, the Minister withheld something like £500 from the farmer. The farmer has since died.  It does not usually happen that, following an excuse of illness, the patient dies, but it did happen in this particular case, proving the truthfulness of the defence that he was really ill at the time, and, being unable to look after his farm, paid another man for doing so.  The case came before the court and the court inflicted a fine of £100.  It is quite true that the Act says that, notwithstanding a fine in the court, the Minister can withhold payment. There were no grounds, in my view, for withholding that sum of money in this particular case, and there may be other cases of the same sort.  The trouble is over now.  With <Col N="926" /> the help of God, we will not have it any more, and those cases ought to be reconsidered without the heat which was engendered by the terrible infliction which the country had to endure at that time.</P>
    <P>In the second case to which I want to refer, it was brought to my notice that, due to an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease on a farm, a considerable quantity of crops of great value had to be destroyed.  It would appear that the case against compensation for the loss of those crops which were destroyed was that there was no provision in the Act for it.  It is too late in the day now to be putting forward excuses of that sort.  The Minister can put in another item to this heavy Estimate providing for an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment in cases of that kind.  The crops had to be destroyed.  Obviously, if cattle suffering from foot-and-mouth disease were at a hayrick, nobody in his senses would think of feeding that hay to other animals.  The same thing applies with regard to mangels and other crops of that sort.  It was an obvious duty on the part of somebody in authority to have them destroyed, and, even if the authorities did not ask for their destruction, the farmer himself would be very well advised to have them destroyed.  But he should not be at the loss of them.  There is a case in all conscience for the insertion of an extra item in the Minister's Estimate to make provision for compensation in this case.  I am also informed that the compensation, towards the end of the period, was small; that it had relation to the prices ruling prior to the foot-and-mouth outbreak. The person who was compensated, while he might be compensated in respect of the then value, found when he was endeavouring to restore the size of his herd that he could not purchase anything like the same number of animals.  Consequently, he was not able to get back into the same economic position which he was in prior to this outbreak.  It was enough to have an unfortunate man visited by this affliction, with all the attendant disturbance and destruction, and we should not have complaints of that sort <Col N="927" /> arising now that the whole thing is over.</P>
    <P>The last item to which I want to refer&mdash;I mentioned it here quite recently on the Central Bank Bill&mdash;is that in the final report of the Banking Commission, a fairly elaborate exposition of the plight of the farmers, particularly the smaller men who needed loans, was very fully set out.  I want the Minister on some occasion, through some section of his Department, to look into the question of those farmers who are indebted either to the banks or to the Credit Corporation.  The Credit Corporation is no longer a useful proposition in this country.  To my mind, the sooner it is wound up the better.  It is not by any means as good as the banks.  The banks have lent £12,000,000 to the farmers, while this corporation, which was set up at considerable cost, lent £1,000,000.  I do not know what the banks got from it. According to some reports and returns which I have had, they made fairly generous settlements with certain people, but I have never heard of a generous settlement with the Credit Corporation.  It may be that the Credit Corporation must work to get the last penny out of the people.  If that is so, I am surprised that all those scribes who devote so much time to condemning our banking system here should expend so little of their genius in explaining how it would be possible for a bank to squeeze the last fraction out of a struggling people.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, the final report of the Banking Commission sets out the approximate number of farmers who have money to their credit in the banks.  The number&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;is somewhere about 130,000, and they have, or had some four years ago, about £37,000,000 to their credit, that is about an average of £300.  On the other hand, there were about 125,000 farmers who were indebted to the banks to the tune of approximately £12,000,000.  That is only a small sum per head&mdash;something about £100.  It is in that group that I am advising the Minister to get a section of his Department <Col N="928" /> interested.  They are almost equally divided as far as numbers are concerned, 125,000 and 130,000, but if, in respect of that smaller division, there is in this country a lack of production due to lack of credit, it is a national loss.  That concerns every one of us.  It is our business to put an end to that national loss as soon as possible, in the interests not only of that section of the community which will benefit directly but also in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I suggested one rather simple method of settling that question.  The real difficulty about it is that this new institution, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, has to get up its own staff, and has to make inquiries as if it were a new bank.  The banks have been dealing with that in their branches in different parts of the country, and have a fair knowledge of the people.  The expenses involved in making an inquiry regarding three £5 advances to a branch of the bank would be merged in the expenses of the branch, but, in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the expenses of three £5 loans in any part of the country would probably exceed the interest on them for a year.  The suggestion I made to the Minister for Finance was that there might be an extension of Land Bonds, the amount being added to what the tenant farmers are already indebted to the Land Commission of, say, five years' purchase of the annuity&mdash;not in all cases, but in those cases in which the Land Commission was satisfied that there was a fair prospect of its being repaid.</P>
    <P>I should like the economists, the expansionists, and all other people embraced in that delightful expression &ldquo;money reformers&rdquo; to pay attention to this.  Credit to some people is a great advantage, not only to themselves but to the entire community; credit to other people is a danger to them and a loss to the community; and that is why I speak of a body that will not entail any further expense in connection with the distribution of whatever credit it may be desired to afford, in respect of which there should be an indication that it was not to be had <Col N="929" /> for the asking, but was to be had in necessitous cases from which good results would flow.  The Minister has heard for three days the general views of the House on these questions. Whatever differences there may be in regard to politics in this country, there is a general disposition now, and only now, to find a good, sound agricultural policy.  If the Minister will give us evidence of his <i>bona fides</i> in that matter, he will find considerable co-operation, but it must be on the basis that the agricultural industry is to benefit and that it is not a question of politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer a few remarks particularly on pig production, and I want to say at the beginning that I think the attitude taken up by the Department with regard to pig production for the last five or six years was fairly sound, in this way, that the price of pigs was increased with a view to encouraging producers to keep up production at a time when production had more or less fallen off.  That was done for the purpose of making production cover the whole 12 months' period.  What do we find this year?  If we look up the advertised prices, we find that on 14th February there was a sharp cut in pig prices.  Compare that with the attitude of the Department in the same month last year when there was a sharp increase in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter for pig producers, for those people who have gone in for pig production and have made arrangements to make the greater part of their living from it.  They went in for improved qualities and did everything to comply with the regulations which are designed with a view to extending pig production over the 12 months.  This action has been taken at a time when there was very little reason for it.  It has been said, although I do not agree, that pigs were being fed on wheat.  That may be the case in some few instances, but the percentage of people who used wheat for pig feeding was very small, so far as I know.  That may be the reason for the Department's action, but, to my mind, the pigs were not fed on wheat.  They <Col N="930" /> were fed on potatoes, on oats and barley, and, to a great extent in my county, on milk and potatoes.  Having no local market for their milk, the only alternative was to feed the pigs on what is called skimmed milk, the better milk being kept for human consumption.</P>
    <P>However, at a time when the people had made arrangements to go into pig production, when they had the breeding sows and the stock of pigs necessary for going into pig rearing in February, March, April, May and June, we find a reduction in price. What is the extent of the reduction? Prior to 14th February, the price was 112/- per cwt. and, in addition to that, I am informed that the pig dealers were getting a bonus which brought that price up to anything between 116/- and 120/- per cwt.  The price fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board up to 14th February was 112/-, but, on 14th February, we find that price reduced to 106/- for No. 1 grade; from 105/- to 98/- for No. 2 grade; and from 95/- to 80/- for No. 3 grade.  That reduction took place at a time when people had their stock and were ready to go on with the work, with the result that everything was more or less held up.  The pigs were ready for sale and people expected to get a certain price for them, but found that they could not get that price.</P>
    <P>A more serious thing happened in December and I cannot understand why it happened.  In my district of North Mayo, we had three fairs&mdash;on 15th, 17th and 19th December.  The pig dealers attended those fairs and could not get a market for the pigs they brought there.  As a matter of fact, at one of the fairs, no pigs at all were bought.  There were at least 500 pigs at the fair and there was not a man to buy a pig.  Fortunately for some of those men, I happened to be on the spot.  I got in touch with the Pigs Marketing Board, which relieved the situation by allowing the local factories to take over these pigs.  That was a critical time to hold up the sale of these pigs.  Rents and rates were due and they wanted some money for Christmas, and, but for the fact that the situation was relieved in the way <Col N="931" /> I have stated, those pigs would have to be brought home, which would have had deplorable results in the district.</P>
    <P>The price of pigs was reduced, as I say, on 14th February.  Has the price of bacon been reduced by the bacon curers?  I say it has not.  The price of bacon has increased.  If you look up any week from 14th February to 18th April, you will find increases in the price of bacon.  People come in to buy a lb. of bacon or a piece of bacon and they ask why the price of bacon has not been reduced when the price of pigs has been reduced, and it is a matter on which it is very hard to satisfy them.  I say that it is wrong that the price of pigs should fall while the price of bacon increases.  Farmers generally feel that there should be a good price for bacon, that there should be no difficulty in getting a good price for any surplus bacon we have for export.  The people all have the feeling that in England bacon and other types of food are required and we should be able to get a good price for anything we send there.  Knowing the price at which bacon is sold here, knowing what we have to pay for the bacon we buy for home consumption, I would like to hear from the Minister what price we get for the bacon we export.  We know that the bacon that is exported is of better quality than what is retained for home consumption. We export only select sides. The greater portion of what we use at home is heavier in quality, stouter, fatter; it certainly is not of the same quality as what we export.</P>
    <P>As regards pigs, I believe there is a great danger that if pig production is allowed to decline in this country, it will be difficult to revive it.  My experience of the farmers is that if they go off producing any class of food, or any animal, it will be very hard to get them hack to it.  That has been proved here already.  Some five or six years ago the pig producers got into the habit of producing a certain class of pig, a stout pig, and it was very hard to get them back to the production of what is called the proper bacon pig.  After a year or two they did get back to the <Col N="932" /> production of that type of animal, and we again had a good quality pig.  I feel that it would be a great mistake to do anything that would in any way affect the pig industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the big tillage schemes that have been, and are being, carried out all over the country. The farmers generally have taken off their coats and, from daylight to dark, they are working on the land in order to produce food for the nation.  We expect to have huge crops of wheat, barley and oats.  There is no use in anybody thinking that we can get grain crops one year after another for three or four years.  We must be prepared to have some rotational crop.  The only rotational crop that will suit the country and that will be a help to everyone is the potato crop.  If we arrange to have a potato crop next year or the year after&mdash;and in all probability we shall have to do that&mdash; where will we be if pig production has declined?  We shall have a surplus of potatoes and perhaps we may have a difficulty in finding a market for them. If we have not a good pig population, where will we stand?</P>
    <P>I believe that everything possible should now be done to encourage pig production.  If it is allowed to decline in certain counties, there are many people in those counties who will find it difficult to get an alternative means of existence and we shall have many more looking for unemployment assistance than we have at the present time.  In my county there are numbers of people who depend for a livelihood on the raising of pigs.  They usually raise three sets in the year and that means a nice income&mdash;£25 or £30 coming in three times a year.  If that industry declines, many people in Mayo will not be able to pay their rent or rates or meet their ordinary bills.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan referred to the price of eggs.  I know that the price of eggs is controlled and our export is also controlled and we accept the bargain that was made.  As regards the way the whole thing has been managed&mdash; the regulations for exporting eggs and the general conditions affecting the <Col N="933" /> egg industry&mdash;I am satisfied that everything possible is being done. Those connected with the arrangements for purchasing and exporting eggs are to be congratulated.  The whole scheme is a success from every point of view.  I should like to refer to the collection of eggs, particularly in the remote areas.  The petrol shortage will undoubtedly affect the lorries that have been used for the collection of eggs.  Under the regulations the eggs have to be marketed within a certain time.  That raises a difficulty from the point of view of collection and I suggest that the Minister should use his influence in the direction of obtaining a supplementary petrol allowance for those people who have been accustomed to make weekly egg collections.  Many egg producers live in remote areas and it was customary up to this to collect the eggs at their doors.  The same applied to many small shops in country districts.  If the petrol shortage has the effect of preventing that regular collection it will have a serious effect on egg production, and incidentally a serious effect on the quality of the eggs.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to arrange for a small supplementary allowance in order to facilitate the collection of eggs.  Perhaps he would go even half-way, so that there will be no inconvenience.</P>
    <P>With regard to the price of cattle, it is true that fat cattle produced in this country are selling at 14/- a cwt. less than English fed cattle.  That is not as it should be.  The best quality beef is produced here; Irish cattle are fed on the best land and they are exported in fine condition, yet when they reach England they are sold at 14/- a cwt. less than British produced beef.  I think that condition of things should be altered.  Perhaps the matter could be raised with the British Government and some bargain made.  If we do not get the full 14/- we might be able to come within a reasonable distance of what is paid for the English animal.  I think that 14/- a cwt. is too wide of a gap.  There should be some remedy because, as matters stand, it is really almost throwing our produce away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> On the subject of oats, I remember when the fixing of a price for oats was discussed last May or June.  At that time I suggested there should be a minimum price for oats and barley.  I believe that the manner in which the price of oats was fixed last year disorganised the whole situation.  The farmers and everybody held on to their oats, with the result that no oats were sent to the mills, and now there is not a grain of oatmeal to be got in any town that you go into.  There was really a racket.  One man with a licence was tied down to a fixed price, while others were going around with no licence at all and could buy at any price they liked, and other people could get none.  There seems to be a regular clamour for oatmeal and flake meal everywhere.  It simply is not to be got.  The whole thing seems to have been badly managed, and, certainly, if there is to be a fixed price for oats and barley this year, the thing should be done in a different manner from the way in which it was done last year, because if there is not a change to a different system I am afraid you will have the same thing repeated next year.  I hope the Minister will consider the whole matter carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal at the moment with what is the most important question we have before us and what, I take it, is the most important duty of the Department of Agriculture; that is the question of the coming harvest and how it is to be dealt with.  As far as I know, there is a very big increase in tilled land in my constituency.  One would expect, of course, and I hope it will be the case, that from that tilled land we shall have a greater volume of food, but a farmer has to take a very long view of things, and last year's faults are now beginning to react.  In a county like Meath nobody could presume that we would have, rapidly, sufficient power to deal with the question of tillage and I am afraid that we had not sufficient power last year or, if we had, it was not used economically or in any sort of an organised manner. Owing to the threshing by tractors, land could not be ploughed for wheat <Col N="935" /> in time and, consequently, a very small proportion of October seed wheat, or winter seed wheat, was sown.  The result was that the bulk of it remained over until the month of February. People made an attempt to sow it in December, and the December sowing seems to be reasonably good, but the February sowing and the later sowing are not what we would call hopeful. In fact, there are a good many places that clearly indicate failure, and a good many people are sowing that down with spring wheat.  That was due entirely to the fact that power was not available to plough the land in the month of October.  Accordingly, it is a question now of seeing what way that can be done next year and how we can have sufficient power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an idea that we had sufficient power, but I have certainly satisfied myself that we did not use it properly and that it did not get a fair chance. There were a few instances where farmers had horses that were quite equal to ploughing but who hired a tractor to do the ploughing instead of using their horses, and thereby deprived a man, who had not any horses, of the chance of having his land ploughed.  Those were very small faults, and it was only very occasionally that that happened.  I am going to make the statement definitely that the Department of Supplies did its utmost to supply paraffin oil, but its utmost was not sufficient. The method was not right.  There were too many idle days for the tractors in County Meath, during which the tractors were hung up.  I know of cases of the owner of a tractor going in nine, ten and 15 miles to Navan to look for paraffin oil, and then being disappointed.  That meant that he lost his day.  The same thing happened with regard to spare parts.  Take the case of an energetic young fellow who, with very limited capital, purchases a tractor, with rubber wheels.  The tractor worked nicely while the weather was fine, but as soon as the weather became damp the tractor skidded and was useless and hung up because the man had not the price of spikes to enable him to work in damp weather. <Col N="936" /> As a result of those things a great number of days were lost, and I say that that was because of a want of proper organisation and of credit facilities.</P>
    <P>In the coming year, all that will have to be looked to.  If the harvest this year is heavier than last year's harvest, there will be no wheat sown at all until February.  In fact, few farmers will sow winter wheat in February but will wait and sow all spring wheat.  Another aspect of that is that winter wheat is found to create a greater amount of scutch than spring wheat, but the real difficulty arose from the fact that the farmers had not got sufficient power to deal with the harvest and prepare the land for the next crop.  With regard to the rapid distribution of paraffin oil, I see no reason why the petrol pumps should not be used for that purpose.  They would be convenient to the farmers who want to get paraffin oil quickly, and these people could keep working while looking for the oil.  It was the number of days lost that made the big difference, plus the fact that we had not power enough to do the threshing.</P>
    <P>A number of people engaged in the collection of grain have asked me what is to be done with regard to storage capacity or have any steps been taken, or are they to be taken, to improve storage facilities.  That was a big question last year and it led to a certain amount of waste in a good many cases.  There were many parcels of wheat left at railway stations last year in a rather damp condition, with the result that that wheat was very often lost.  Storage accommodation is one of the most important items that we have to consider and men who buy wheat have been talking to me with reference to this question within the last day or two and want to know if anything has been done about it.</P>
    <P>The next thing I should like to deal with is the question of the collection of eggs.  When this petrol shortage arose last month a great number of people were left with eggs on their hands for well over a week.  I think that interfered with the recent Act. However, these eggs had to be collected <Col N="937" /> and, after a week or so, they were collected, but there is a great number of places where they cannot get more than a weekly collection and, as the summer comes along, it is likely that a good many of those eggs will become defective.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture has taken the necessary steps to see that the collection system does not break down.  In many districts these eggs are collected by what are called travelling shops. These people used to come along with vans but, of course, they are now off the road and the result is that a great number of people are compelled to hold over the eggs.  They cannot manage to get them to the local markets because many of them have no conveyances, and those who have horses are using the horses in other and more important work.  Accordingly, that question is one that should be considered, at any rate, in certain counties.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Deputy O'Sullivan's talk on the future of agriculture, and also very interested in the statement he made that agriculture had been depressed in more countries than this.  That, unfortunately, is the case, but I think Deputy Cosgrave was inclined to believe, and to try to get us to believe, that this was the only country in which that depression had taken place and that it was because of the change of policy here that was brought about during the last nine or ten years.  I do not know whether he meant that, but, somehow or another, I read it that way&mdash;that they had two different opinions on the matter. However, Deputy O'Sullivan's opinion, of course, is quite correct.</P>
    <P>It is not easy, I take it, now to try and visualise what is going to be the position in this country when the war is over.  There is no doubt that during the last 30 years the big ship has done a lot of harm to our agriculture, but it seems to be disappearing very rapidly now.  I cannot tell whether the big ships will be replaced or not.  If not, the farmers may hope to enjoy reasonable prosperity for some time to come. We are very short of artificial manures.  In old tillage counties that <Col N="938" /> is a calamity.  In that connection the Minister for Agriculture might consider the question of pig feeding.  We do not go in for much of it in the County Meath, but I have an idea that the feeding of pigs helps to provide a large amount of manure which could be utilised for tillage purposes.  From that point of view, the pig is a very important animal, and if we are to continue to produce crops from our land we must make an effort to get it manured.  One of our biggest difficulties is the scarcity of manure.  I notice that some farmers have been complaining that if pig feeding goes out we shall suffer the loss of the manure.</P>
    <P>The Minister might perhaps consider an improvement in prices or a lessening in the cost of distribution which is one of the bigger difficulties farmers have to contend with.  They find that it costs too much to distribute their products.  It is certainly very hard to relate the price charged for bacon in the shops to the price which the farmer gets for his pig.  I am of opinion that the costs of distribution and of the iehandling, killing and curing of bacon are entirely too high.  Tastes, I know, change.  Even labourers and farmers now refuse to eat, comparatively speaking, fat bacon.  They want the leaner type.  That creates a difficulty for the farmer when he goes to dispose of his pigs, especially the heavier types. Formerly that type sold well, or the farmer could use it in his own home and his workers were prepared to eat it.  To-day they are not.  The pig industry is an important one from the point of view of the production of manure.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said that it was an extremely difficult thing to make agriculture pay.  That, apparently, is the case and, as I have said, it can only pay in a situation in which we are passing through now.  How to make it pay in the future will not, I think, be solved by a change over to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or some other money-lending body.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the Agricultural Credit Corporation no longer serves any useful purpose.  I frequently see in the local papers <Col N="939" /> invitations issued to farmers to borrow money from it.  It issues booklets and so on, but I think prospective borrowers get a disappointment when they learn of the obligations they are asked to enter into.  I think some other form of providing credit for farmers should be considered.  If there was a suitable credit corporation in existence many of the difficulties that farmers have to contend with in the purchase of tractors and spare parts would not arise.  If the conditions laid down for borrowing were not too severe&mdash;and the conditions laid down by the Agricultural Credit Corporation are severe &mdash;farmers would be able to comply with them.</P>
    <P>The loans provided under the county council schemes are, to a large extent, beneficial.  There is one objection that farmers have to them, and it is being asked to get two or three of their neighbours to go security for a loan. I think a man should be able to get a loan if he has good land or is producing good crops, and should not be obliged to ask his neighbours to go security for him.  I have observed for some time that seed merchants and shopkeepers who were in the habit of giving credit to farmers until the harvest was threshed are now beginning to give up the practice, and are leaving all that to the county councils. I think we should encourage the merchants to continue the custom that prevailed in the old days of giving credit to farmers.  They used to lend them large sums of money.  It is doubtful if the moneys loaned by the county councils will serve as useful a purpose as the moneys that used to be loaned by business people and seed merchants to farmers.  The shopkeepers were found to be the most convenient lenders.  They were given on personal grounds, more or less, and consequently there was not any publicity about them.  I think they are fighting shy of giving credit now.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to deal with is the question of diseases in animals.  I think we are all agreed that we lose an undue amount of livestock of every description from disease each year. <Col N="940" /> Calves are lost from diseases that are preventable.  We lose an enormous amount of young cattle from blackleg, another disease that is preventable. We lose a lot of young stock from hoose, another preventable disease. The Minister might consider some method by which veterinary expert advice would be made available for combating those diseases.  In some European countries they have a system by which farmers, for a very reasonable amount, are able to obtain veterinary assistance.  We lose a large number of calves through bad handling and bad transport as well as a large number of lambs, pigs and fowl.  Some estimates have been made of our losses under these heads, and they have been put down at the appalling figure of £50,000,000.  Every effort should be made to try and get a veterinary system established by which these diseases could be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what is the position with regard to the many dead-meat factories established here last year.  I should like to know if they are working or if many of them are in difficulties.  I do not know what his attitude would be in regard to those factories if they are in difficulties.  If we have not another visitation of foot-and-mouth disease, possibly we can make no economic use of those factories.  But if, unfortunately, we do have another visitation of foot-and-mouth disease we might want them badly.  If they are in an unhealthy condition, the Minister might consider how he could keep them going if he thought they were necessary, because I have an idea that there is a great danger of their closing down and, should anything again happen to us, we might be very thankful to have them.  Therefore, it might be considered good policy to see what can be done to maintain those factories and keep them working.</P>

      <P>As my only contact with farms, fields, fertilisers or such matters is when I go hiking or biking, I will not presume to add very helpful suggestions on the technical matters raised.  But I am very greatly <Col N="941" /> perturbed when I go around the city these days and see the empty shops which have no food for the workers. I believe it is the same in other cities and towns.  The pork shops in Dublin to-day are empty; there is no pork to be got.  The grocery shops are half empty.  There is no bacon, no flake meal, no bread, no flour, no dripping, and no butter.  I only want to say a word about two of these commodities and I sincerely hope that the Minister will clear the matter up when replying and let us know definitely what will be the future position.  As to flake meal, I see that the Minister for Supplies has come in, and lie will remember that on 4th December last, in reply to a question by me as to the shortage of flake meal in the city, he gave the House to understand that the position would improve.  Well, it did not improve; in fact, it has become worse. There is no flake meal to be got at all now, either loose or in packages, at any price.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister for Agriculture will make a decent effort to explain to the people who are deprived of their flake meal what happened to the oatmeal and whether we can hope that next winter when bread may be rationed more severely than it is now the working people will have some porridge for their breakfast tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of butter, there was a box paragraph in one of the papers the other day to the effect that the shortage of butter was seasonal.  A seasonal shortage does not last for several months.  There has been a certain shortage of butter for several months and an acute shortage for the past two or three weeks.  Can we hope that that shortage will soon come to an end?  I do not know anything about the technical end of the business of butter or milk production, but if this is a seasonal shortage, when will it end?  We must remember that, not alone is there no butter, but there is no margarine or dripping.  We must get the butter.  I do not know whether it represents a very great proportion of the total production, but we were told in this House that some of it is being exported to the Isle of Man. Perhaps that is the result of a contract <Col N="942" /> that could not be got out of or something of that sort.  But I should like to know if we are getting from the Isle of Man any food in return for that butter we are sending there.  I hope the Minister will deal with these matters and give the people in the city some hope that next winter the food shops will not be entirely empty.</P>

      <P>So many points have been raised that I am afraid it would take me some time to go into all of them if I were to go into them in detail.  I will try to deal with the points raised by various Deputies.  The only advantage I have in replying is that some of the points were raised by dozens of Deputies over and over again so that the debate became very tedious, without anything very constructive being mentioned.  Perhaps I might take the last point raised by Deputy O'Reilly, which was also referred to by Deputy Browne, and that is the collection of eggs.  Those who produce eggs are in a very fortunate position from the point of view of convenience in having lorries calling to their doors for the eggs.  That cannot be continued.  In future the eggs will have to be brought to some convenient centre where they can be collected with a great saving in petrol.  Whether Deputy Browne or Deputy O'Reilly expected the Department to organise that or not I do not know.  But I think the collectors are in the best position to organise that, because they know their clients, they know the quantity of eggs they get from each person, and they will be in the best position to fix the best centres for these eggs to be collected. It would, of course, as Deputy O'Reilly says, be a very good thing if those eggs could be offered at least twice a week during the summer months.  Any help my Department can give in the organisation of that will be gladly given.  But, at any rate, I think that the producers cannot expect in future to have people calling to their premises once or twice a week to collect eggs, as has been done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As I explained earlier to-day, those Orders, which are of minor importance, were made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, and have to be confirmed by legislation within a period of months.  I desire to have this Bill enacted by the Dáil to-day, so that it can go to the Seanad for enactment there in view of the fact that it has to be law before 1st May.  There are only three Orders to be confirmed.  The Bill, I may say, is in the usual form, and there is nothing worthy of comment in its sections.  The three Orders are separate and distinct.  The first relates to an amendment of the duty on cotton wool.  Under the Finance Act, 1940, a duty was placed upon cotton wool and a provision was inserted in the duty imposed by that Act to the effect that cotton wool which had been medicated would not be liable to duty.  It was found necessary to amend the definition of medicated cotton wool, and the purpose of this Order is to make it clear that medicated cotton wool was exempt from duty when the wool contained at least 15 per cent. of boric acid, when it had been treated with oleoresin of capsicum in accordance with the British Pharmaceutical Codex, or had been treated with any medicament other than boric acid or oleoresin of capsicum, and formed a single consignment not exceeding 14 lbs. in weight, consigned to one person only.  That amendment of duty was merely for the purpose of preventing evasion of the Order.  The alteration does not affect in any way the position in respect of the supply of cotton wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Order, No. 222, reduces the duty on assembled electrical motor chassis to 15 per cent.  There is in fact none of these chassis being imported, but, in order to facilitate anybody who might get one, the duty was reduced to a nominal one of 15 per cent.  Order <Col N="944" /> No. 223, as I explained earlier, was made solely for the purpose of obtaining power to grant licences for the free importation of goods which were subject to duty, where the Act imposing that duty or the Order imposing that duty did not itself give that power to grant licences for free importation. Again, the position is that the enactment of the Order is merely a formality. In respect of a number of the items mentioned in the Order, the duty has since been suspended altogether by an Emergency Powers Order.  I do not think, therefore, it can be said that any of these Orders is of major importance, but it is necessary that they should be confirmed by law, because, owing to the provisions of the Emergency Powers Act, if an Order made is not confirmed either because the Dáil refuses to confirm it, or because a Bill is not presented to the Dáil for that purpose, then a similar Order cannot be made again, and difficulties would arise if that situation were created by failure to enact this Act before 1st May.</P>

It includes all classes of goods&mdash;margarine, glass bottles, cocoa, compound manures, galvanised steel, novels printed in English, clay smoking pipes, ice-cream powders, inside soles for boots and shoes, lubricating oil, certain kinds of iron and steel, and a whole list of other articles in respect of which there is now no duty in operation at all, but we have to confirm the Order now, because otherwise we could not at a later stage take power to give those licences for free importation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is satisfied, I take it, that the change in the cotton wool duty which he has mentioned is the only alteration that has been made?  He will remember that when the Finance Act, under which the original Order was made, was going through the House, I raised the question of knitted cotton padding for use for clothing machinery.  He said it was not intended that that should <Col N="945" /> be dutiable, and that if a satisfactory formula could be produced to exclude it he would accept it.  Unfortunately, it was not easy to produce a watertight wording, and it was left to be imported under licence.  Within recent times, the Revenue Commissioners have decided that that commodity is not liable to duty.  That is a very satisfactory position and I do not want the Minister to change it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course, I think we can all agree with him in that.  A number of people think that that has been too long delayed.  In fact, I think the reproach could be levelled at the Government that in a number of instances they waited until almost all chance of getting the goods in the only market available had disappeared. I do not want to enlarge on that; I merely mention it.  But there is another aspect of the matter which I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  People may have, in the very recent past, imported those goods and paid duty on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A question raised by many Deputies was the question of post-war famine or planning for the future.  Two Deputies in particular &mdash;Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Childers&mdash;devoted a good deal of time and evidently had given a good deal of thought to the subject.  Other Deputies referred to it, but they evidently had not given it the same amount of thought.  Those Deputies who visualise an open market after the war which will take any amount of our surplus produce and at a good price, and who are impatient if you suggest anything else, are not thinking <Col N="947" /> about the subject at all&mdash;they are merely hoping.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by a number of Deputies to a speech I made in Cork some time ago.  I could have gone to Cork and said that everything would be all right when the war was over, and, if I had done so, I probably would have pleased some of the Deputies opposite who take that view also.  I want, however, to make this matter clear because some Deputy referred to a conflict of opinion between some other Minister and myself.  It was not, I need hardly say, the considered judgment of the Government that things would go as I outlined there and I am quite sure that other Ministers would have looked at it in a different way, but I thought it well to talk about these subjects in a lecture of that kind, when I was speaking largely to an academic assembly, and to say what I thought might be the position when the war was over.  I was not dogmatic and, in fact, I hope I am not right.  If Deputies disagree with me and think that things may be otherwise, all I can say is that they have just as good a right to that view as I have to the views I expressed in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who have raised this question that it is well we should try to get down to this subject, if we can.  It is all very indefinite.  Nobody can say what the position will be, and nobody can say what market will be there.  I will, however, take one subject I dealt with in the Cork lecture, that is, dairy products.  I said that we had been subsidising dairy products for the past ten years or so, all the time in the hope that matters might improve in the world market for dairy products, that we would have kept up our production in the meantime, and so be in a position, when things improved, to take our place as producer of dairy products, but that it was rather disheartening, when the war came and when the British people themselves were at war, that they should offer us a price for our dairy products which was much below the cost of production here.  I said that if they did that in times of war, it was at least arguable that they might not <Col N="948" /> do much better when the war was over. If they do not do much better when the war is over, and if we cannot get any foreign market, what are we going to do?</P>
    <P>I did go on to point out that we had not a very big surplus&mdash;as a matter of fact, our surplus now is almost gone&mdash;and we might have to make some slight reduction in the number of cows here, but that reduction would be only 7 or 8 per cent. and it was not a reduction which would ruin our agriculture, but a matter which we would have to consider with a view to seeing what might be done about it.  I also spoke of bacon and I propose to come back to bacon again.  I do not want to repeat my speech in Cork but merely to give an instance of the type of subject I dealt with there.  As I say, I dealt with these subjects only in a personal way, on the basis of whatever thought I could give to them myself, in the hope that others might also give some thought to them, and with the idea that we might be able to get down to a consideration of the subject in more detail and perhaps more intelligently as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to that speech as the death-knell of agriculture, so far as I was concerned, a pessimistic speech and so on, but I should like to remind Deputies that, although I said there that I did not see much prospect of a big and profitable export business in dairy products or pig products, I did, on the other hand, say that the cattle trade and the egg trade would probably be all right.  I agree absolutely with Deputy Fagan that the prospect for good store cattle will probably be all right.  I do not see that any change as a result of this war will make a great difference in the position with regard to good store cattle.  But I may be wrong in that.  I may be wrong about pigs and I may be wrong also about butter.  I merely give my own opinion and I am glad to hear the opinion of others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey said that the only solution I could give was a reduction of industrial wages.  As an attempt at misrepresentation of a speech, the <Col N="949" /> Deputy could scarcely have done much better.  It is true that I did make a reference to industrial wages.  I said that if things turned out as I had outlined the price of world food products would go down and that if we had to depend on a foreign market for the sale of a considerable portion of our farm produce, very naturally the price of the exported article would regulate the price at home; in other words, that if we sent out butter at a low price, butter would be cheap here, and that if we sent out cattle at a low price, beef would be cheap here, and that if that were to occur all around, the price of food would come down to perhaps half its present price.  I said that if the farmer got only half of what he is getting at the moment for what he is selling, he could not go on paying the present price for industrial products and that the only thing he could do would be to get his industrial products at half their present price.  I also said&mdash;and I should like Deputy Hickey to look this up&mdash;that they could be reduced in price in three ways &mdash;by the manufacturers bringing down their prices themselves, by reducing wages, or by getting some money from the common pool, that is, the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say that the gap between industrial and agricultural wages is far too wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that at the moment the gap between them is too wide, but I said that if, after the war, agricultural wages are half what they are now, the position would become intolerable and we could not stand it any longer.</P>

      <P>I have been giving whatever thought I could to this subject of the post-war position, and so have the higher officers of my Department, whose job it is to look forward in anything they may be doing at the moment.  I have considered the question of appointing a committee to go into the matter, but the whole thing is rather hazy.  It is very hard to know what you could put to such a committee for <Col N="950" /> consideration, and there is not much use in putting the alternatives suggested by one Deputy: what will be our policy if the English win the war, if the Germans win the war, or if neither wins the war?  I think it would be very difficult to get a committee to sit down to consider such alternatives.  The best you could expect a committee to do would be to say, whatever the conditions are, or whoever wins, there are certain things we should do at the moment.  From that point of view it might be well to have some committee set up to go into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You could consider the provision of greater efficiency in face of lower prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be good, no matter what happens&mdash;more efficiency would be good.  The constitution of the committee will give a certain amount of trouble, because you cannot expect to get people from a distance to attend a committee anyway regularly now on account of transport difficulties and it may be difficult to get a very representative committee to deal with this matter.  I am inclined to agree with the views put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan on that subject, that what you want is more a technical committee than, say, a farmers' committee; that is, a committee composed more of economists who can deal with the general principles.  It may be possible to do something along those lines.</P>
      <P>The next big matter raised had reference to butter and milk.  When I was opening this debate I said that we had exported no butter since last August.  Unfortunately, I did not give the whole truth; I overlooked some points.  What I had in mind was creamery butter and the British market, and as far as my statement went it was true, that we exported no creamery butter to the British market since last August.  We exported, before that period, slightly over 100,000 cwts. of creamery butter to that market.  I should have made it clear that I was referring only to creamery butter and the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> There are three items I should have thought of.  I should have thought, for instance, of factory butter.  There is a certain amount of factory butter exported all the year round.  It is only butter that is surplus to our home requirements. That factory butter is used in cookery, for confectionery, and so on.  After our own needs are filled, something like 16,000 cwts. were exported during the whole of last year. Some of that went out during the winter, and some may have gone through the port of Cork for all I know.</P>
    <P>As well as that, I should have mentioned that last August, when we decided to stop the export of creamery butter, we had a contract with the Isle of Man.  It was a small contract, comparatively speaking, embracing only 300 cwts. per month.  For the whole period since last August we have exported only what would be one full day's supply in this country.  Deputies may, quite rightly, say that we should not send butter to the Isle of Man if our own people are short.  I agree up to a point.  On the other hand, if you make a contract it is an honourable thing to carry it out.  When we made this contract, which was for a small quantity, we would have left the Isle of Man in rather a bad position if we had not carried it out.  When the contract was made for the 300 cwts. per month, which is equivalent to two ounces per person per week, they were told by the Ministry of Food in Great Britain that the Isle of Man would get no butter from them, that they could do with the butter we were giving them.  If we did not carry out our contract, we would have left the people in the Isle of Man without any butter.</P>
    <P>We may be criticised for entering into that contract, but I should like to point out that during the years when the British Government put penal tariffs on our cattle, sheep, butter and eggs going into Great Britain, the Isle of Man put on no penal tariffs.  They took what they required in the way of sheep, cattle, bacon and butter from us without imposing penal tariffs, and <Col N="952" /> when the war commenced they asked us to see them through so far as butter is concerned, and we said that as far as we possibly could we would do so.  I think every Deputy will agree that, having made that contract with the Isle of Man, we could not do otherwise than carry it out.</P>
    <P>There was another thing I did not mention, but it is, however, a very small matter.  We did stop the export of butter by parcel post, but appeals were made to us by Irish people living in England that they wanted butter very badly for health reasons, and we adopted a scheme of sending a small quantity of butter, not more than 1 lb. per week, to any person possessing a doctor's certificate.  A very small quantity has gone out in that way; it does not amount to much more than 1 cwt. per month.  Considering that we use 1,700 cwts. per day, the amount that went out in that way is not very considerable.</P>
    <P>I have already said that we exported something over 100,000 cwts last year. It was not a decrease in production that left us short.  The fact is that our consumption went up enormously during the past year.  We thought we had provided for that to a great extent.  We did provide for an extra 100,000 cwts.&mdash;at least we tried to, but we did not succeed in getting all that stored.  We called the wholesalers together, as we usually do, and told them what we thought would be required for the coming year, and we asked them to store to that extent.  If all the wholesalers stored as we suggested, there would not be a shortage now.  They did not do so; some of them were afraid to take the risk. Some people are getting enough butter because they are lucky enough to be dealing with retailers associated with wholesalers who took a proper view of the situation and stored sufficient butter.  These people are now getting adequate supplies.</P>
    <P>Other people are not getting sufficient butter because they are dealing with retailers who, in turn, are dealing with wholesalers who did not store enough.  Instead of telling these retailers that they did not store enough <Col N="953" /> butter, they are blaming the Government for the mess.  They are right to this extent, that the Government should have interfered when they did not store enough.  This year the Government must interfere and go into the business, and I am quite sure you will have Deputies and business men saying the Government should not enter the business.  When business men do not do their business properly, what alternative have the Government but to go into it&mdash;to do it properly where the business men have failed?</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that instead of exporting butter we should try to get our own people to consume more.  The consumption of butter by our own people has gone up to an enormous extent.  Although anybody listening attentively to Deputies on the opposite side would, imagine that our production had gone down, and that that was the cause of all our trouble, that is really not the case.  When I took over this office in 1932, I found that the production of creamery butter in the previous year was 608,000 cwts. Last year it was 663,000 cwts.  We were actually 55,000 cwts higher last year than in the year before this Government took office.  On the other hand, under the previous administration, our people consumed about 330,000 cwts of creamery butter in the year.  Last year they consumed 544,000 cwts.</P>
    <P>Although the consumption of butter in this country has gone up by over 200,000 cwts., from 1931 to 1941, and although the production was up slightly, it was not sufficient to provide for a very small export and to supply everybody with what he wanted.  There has also been a very big increase in the consumption of liquid milk, although I agree with speakers here, such as Deputy Hickey and others, that it would be a great thing if our people could be induced, and if they could be put into the position of being able to afford to drink more milk.</P>

I only want to point out that although Deputies opposite would give the impression that all this thing was due to bad conditions for the dairying industry under this Government, it had not reached as low a level last year&mdash;it has been going down now for four years&mdash;as it had reached in the last year of the previous Government's term of office.</P>

      <P>I should be fit for a lunatic asylum if I agreed with everything that was said during the last two or three days.  However, I want <Col N="955" /> to make this point clear&mdash;and Deputy Hughes may take it to heart if he likes&mdash;that I do not want the impression to go out that there was a decline in the dairying industry during the last ten years.  As a matter of fact, there was an increase in production.  What is very much more important&mdash;and this should be remembered&mdash;is that our people here are now consuming almost twice as much butter as they consumed in 1931, and I suppose it may be assumed that they can afford to consume it as, otherwise, they could not get it.  I think that is very important and that it is an indication that we have made conditions here for our people such that they can enjoy butter now that they could not enjoy in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that they are consuming less bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be coming to that in a moment, and the Deputy will be surprised when he hears the figures in regard to bacon.  I should like to see people consuming more milk.  It is quite true, as Deputy Hickey says, that the people do consume more milk in America, Sweden and, perhaps, other countries, but I do know that in the two countries I have mentioned they consume more milk than we are consuming. We do know, however, that there is a bigger consumption of milk, in the City of Dublin, at least.  Since the milk board was set up&mdash;we had not the figures before that, and I do not say that the increase is necessarily the result of the setting up of the milk board&mdash;consumption has gone up by 5,000 or 6,000 gallons a day.  Now, I know that any Deputy might say that it does appear to be a ridiculous thing that we should export butter to the British market and pay a subsidy on it because the British are not giving enough for our butter to pay the producer, and, at the same time, not make some attempt to have that consumed in the form of liquid milk here.  It is a very big problem, and not nearly as simple as it may appear at first sight. Any Deputy might realise that that would have occurred to a Minister for Agriculture or his Department.  Take <Col N="956" /> the export of butter last year.  We had to pay, on the butter we exported last year, a subsidy of about £160,000 in order to get for the producer the price that we had fixed here; indeed, it was not a very generous price, but in order to get it for him we had to pay a subsidy of £160,000.  Now, I cannot look on that, I must say&mdash;although it is a simple way of putting it&mdash;as giving cheaper butter to John Bull, as some Deputies have suggested.  It does mean giving cheap butter to the English people, but that is not our object.  Our object is to give the producer a better price than the British were prepared to give him.</P>
      <P>Now, on the question of trying to get the milk consumed here, I do not think you would succeed in getting much more milk consumed by the people here unless you gave it free. Take the case of a workingman here in the City of Dublin, with a wife and three or four children and earning £2 or £3 a week.  He is probably paying all that he can afford for milk already, and even if you were to give it at ½d. a pint I do not think you would get much more consumed.  I do not think you would get an increased consumption unless the milk were to be given practically free, and to give it free and distribute it, at a cost to the distributor of even 1½d. a pint, which is very low&mdash;that is, if you give the producer 8d. a gallon only, which would be equivalent to 6d. a gallon in the case of the creamery, where the question of butter comes in&mdash;that transaction would cost the Government, or whoever was doing it, £1,250,000.  So it is almost ten times as expensive to distribute it in the form of milk to the people here as to export it in the form of butter and pay the subsidy on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I have anything else to say on this question except that the present shortage of butter, as I already said, is not universal.  It exists in some places in the City of Dublin&mdash;in some shops, but not all over the city, and only in shops where the wholesaler concerned did not do what he should have done last year. It is, of course, seasonal in this <Col N="957" /> respect at any rate, that when the creameries are in almost full production, which will be, I take it, in a week or so, there will be enough butter to go around, so that to that extent the shortage will not last very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few other points I should like to mention before leaving this question of butter and milk.  I was asked with regard to the coming year whether it will be possible to do something to improve the position of the dairy farmer.  I am meeting representatives of the dairying industry as soon as possible and I intend putting before them a scheme under which they will receive the equivalent of about 7d. a gallon in the coming year.  That will mean, of course, that the price of butter to the consumer will go up.  I think that is all I can say at the moment as far as that is concerned.  Another point that was raised in connection with the milk and butter position was with regard to the milk boards.  Deputy Hickey raised the matter of the Cork Milk Board.  I have not got the figures with me, and in any case they would take a long time to go into properly but, generally speaking, the experience of these boards, both in Dublin and in Cork, is that they have increased the price to the producer very materially, during the four or five years they have been in operation, and that they have not allowed the price to the consumer to go up until, I think, this year.  So that they did regulate the business to that extent at any rate, that they were able to take a fair amount from the margin that was there for distribution and give it to the consumer, leaving the producer in the position he was in before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey raised a question about the position in Cork.  I quite admit that it does appear rather strange that the Milk Board should <Col N="958" /> collect milk in Cork at 1/0½ and have it distributed to the consumers at, I think, 1/8 per gallon.  Any excess over was sent to University College creamery at 7d. per gallon or thereabouts. I would like Deputy Hickey to think over the position.  I do not know how you are going to have these matters regulated properly unless you do it by having a fixed price both for the producer and consumer, and then deal with the surplus that is over in some other way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have in mind.  I am not objecting to the Milk Board.  What I am objecting to is that it is so circumscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here in Dublin during one year&mdash;I cannot recollect whether it was last year or the year before&mdash; they did make an attempt to distribute a fair amount of surplus milk to charitable organisations.  I cannot say what exactly the result was, but I think that, on the whole, it worked fairly satisfactorily.  We must, however, be careful, under any scheme like that, that the surplus milk that is handed over to organisations of that kind will not interfere with the sale of milk that goes through the board. Otherwise, it would upset the arrangements they had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not much worse that poor people should have to go short of milk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reward to the point the Deputy makes about poor people, that is one which, I think, would arise more properly on the Estimate of my colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. In the case of poor people, there are so many classes now getting free milk that it is hard to see what poor person can go without milk.  Again, that milk, as I have already pointed out, is not any dearer to the consumer than it was before the milk boards started their operations.  It is hard to please everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy, in proposing to refer this Estimate back&mdash;by the way, he did not give any reason for referring it back&mdash;said that I was not very <Col N="959" /> cheerful.  Deputy Hughes, on the other hand, said that I talked very complacently about all sorts of disasters that were going to happen.  As I have said, it is rather hard to know what sort of attitude one should adopt in coming in here.  Deputy Murphy talked about people leaving the land and said they were not doing so for more congenial work on the other side, or for higher wages, but because they had lost faith in the back to the land movement, and so on.  He also said that I had lost faith.  Deputy Cosgrave quoted figures and said that, although we had increased our tillage in 1941, considerably over the previous year, there was very little increase in agricultural employment.  He also said that although we increased our tillage slightly from 1932 to 1938 there was a decrease in agricultural employment. I do not look at that in the same way as Deputy Cosgrave.  Deputies on the other side, when they speak here, talk about the low income of the farmer, the farmer's son and the farm labourer. How are we going to improve that unless we increase production, or increase the total income of agriculture without increasing the number of people on the land?  After all, that should be our aim.  I think that if, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, we did succeed from 1932 to 1938 in increasing tillage here and, in maintaining our live stock, and at the same time had a reduction in the number of those engaged in agriculture, we did well for agriculture, because if that is the case the individual income was better than it would have been if we had more people on the land.</P>
    <P>The next point that was made by Deputy Murphy, supported by many other Deputies, was somewhat to the effect that the pig industry is ruined in this country.  He said that was due to my bungling, and so on.  That, also, was supported by many other Deputies. I would like to give some figures dealing with that.  Before we came into office there was a big import of bacon into this country, and a big export of bacon and pigs.  Therefore, the figure that we must take is the balance of trade.  If we sent out £2,000,000 worth <Col N="960" /> and got back £9,000,000 worth, we had £7,000,000 of a favourable balance of trade.  I am taking very big figures. Of course, the actual figure was nothing like that.  Otherwise, the figure for exports alone would not be a comparative figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If our predecessors in office sent out half their pigs and bacon and imported against that a lot of bacon well, naturally, we must compare the balance of trade with the figure when no bacon is coming in. We cannot take exports alone and give it, as a fair comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the ex-Minister for Finance agrees with that kind of economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan </NameTxt>
      <P>In 1931, the year before we came into office, the balance of trade, so far as live pigs are concerned, was £2,178,000, and as far as bacon and other pig products are concerned, the figure was £1,169,000.  That is over £3,250,000.  The figures went down, unlike those for the dairy industry, where they went up.  In this case the figures went down for four or five years, and then began to come up again until 1940, when the figure was £3,900,000, so that we have brought the pig industry into a better position than it was in when the last Government went out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the queerest bit of reasoning I have ever listened to in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have some queer things to say when I come to deal with the Deputy's speech.  Last year it is true that the number of pigs went down.  A number of Deputies spoke on this but, as I have already said, it was like the post-war planning&mdash;it was not thinking but hoping.  They asked why we cannot have more pigs in this country and so on.  If the feeding were there, there is not the slightest doubt that farmers would keep pigs to give the feeding to them.  It is quite true that the feeding was not there, and that is why the number of pigs went down.  If we are fortunate enough <Col N="961" /> to have a good harvest and a good crop of potatoes, I am quite satisfied that we will have an increase in the number of pigs.  They always come back when they are wanted.  There will not be any difficulty about that. it would be a good thing for Deputies on the opposite side to face facts.  I do not see the use of trying to conceal certain facts when we are talking on this subject.  If we have only a certain amount of grain, is it not obvious that we must give humans in this country at least enough to eat, and if we have only enough left to feed the number of pigs we have, then we cannot feed more at the expense of the people? We will have to do with the number we have until we produce more in the way of grain and potatoes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes said he understood from my speech that we had enough of binder twine for the coming year. I do not think I put it in that way.  I qualified the statement by saying that we might be able to get through with what we have.  The company, which is a very progressive company, I must say, is trying other means to get raw material produced in the country during the coming year.  Of course at best they can only get a certain small quantity produced.  I think it would be impossible for them, in the first year at any rate, to deal with native raw material in sufficient quantities, even if it were produced, to turn out binder twine for the harvest of 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be as well to get the twine salvaged during the threshing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been put up to them, and evidently it cannot be used. I will not say it definitely, but my information so far is that that twine cannot be used again for the making of binder twine.  Deputy Hughes was not altogether right when he said that we could have got one thousand tons of binder twine after the last harvest if we had promptly provided the transport. As a matter of fact, the shipping space was not refused.  Representations were made to the Minister for Supplies that a certain firm could bring in 1,000 tons of binder twine from <Col N="962" /> America if the shipping space were supplied.  The Minister did not refuse. He made it very plain that he would go into the matter immediately and see when and how it could be done. He was not able to reply to that for a couple of weeks, not a couple of months.  In fact, so far as I remember, it was between two and three weeks. Then he said that shipping space could be provided at a certain time, but the proposed importer said that the twine could not be got at that stage.</P>
      <P>Dealing with another point raised by Deputy Hughes, there is no tendency whatever in the Department to depart from the Shorthorn breed in cattle.  As a matter of fact, I think that everything done during the last 20 years was done to encourage the Shorthorn breed.  Premiums and everything else concerned with Shorthorns were higher than in the case of Herefords and Polled-Angus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misrepresenting me.  I did not say that there was any tendency in that way, but I said that we were using too many black bulls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy there.  Personally, I think we should go even further to encourage Shorthorn bulls.  Deputy Dillon made a gallant attempt to defend his famous cry that wheat growing is &ldquo;codology&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In peace time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the most fantastic attempt I ever heard any Deputy make in this House.  The Deputy said that owing to farmers not growing wheat when we asked them we have land which is fit to grow wheat.  I think that was the gist of his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proof is altogether the other way.  The Deputy would want to have a very thick skin to stand up now and try to cover up his tracks after telling the people four or five years ago that wheat growing was &ldquo;codology&rdquo;, especially now when people are crying out for wheat and bread.  It would be better for the <Col N="963" /> Deputy to say that he made a mistake, if he is capable of saying such a thing, which I do not think he is.  He said the people who did not grow wheat formerly have land which can grow wheat and that those who grew wheat before are not able to grow it now.  There are 400,000 or 500,000 farms in the country. Will the Deputy instance a dozen farms where that holds good?  If you look at the statistics published for last year you will see that counties that always grew wheat are still far and away on top for growing wheat. In Leix, Louth, Offaly, Wexford, and Carlow they grew wheat year after year.  They grew wheat when other counties were not growing it.  They are still increasing their wheat acreage every year.  They are not going back, and they should be going back according to Deputy Dillon.  They are increasing their wheat acreage at a greater rate than the counties which did not grow wheat before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the yield per acre has gone down substantially in the last ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is true. Our experience in the Department of Agriculture is that in certain counties where they did not know much about growing wheat they did not even know when to reap it.  They reaped the wheat too early and it was in a shrivelled condition. They did not know anything about it, whereas the farmers in those tillage counties who knew all about it were able to grow much more wheat than before and much more than the counties that did not grow wheat before, and they were able to present their wheat in the best condition.  I think Deputy Dillon would do well to make some other defence for his &ldquo;codology&rdquo; speech rather than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point that Deputy Dillon made was that this was a racket, that the Fianna Fáil wheat growers were racketeers looking for a bigger price, and that when they came along to me and asked for a bigger price I could not do anything but give it.  Did Deputy Dillon, Deputy Hughes, and the other Deputies who came to the Taoiseach and myself to ask for 50/- a barrel for wheat come on behalf of Fianna Fáil racketeers, or did they come as honest men asking for a better price for wheat all round?  It is extraordinary what Deputy Dillon is capable of saying.  I have not heard the like of it since I read <i>Finnegan's Wake.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If his speech was calculated to get him back on the benches opposite, I think he overdid it.  Deputy O'Donovan said that there was not sufficient information given about root seeds.  That matter was also raised by Deputy Belton.  I mentioned before that we made appeals through newspaper advertisements and the radio last spring, when we thought there was a very great possibility of a scarcity of root seeds, to farmers to grow sufficient root seeds for themselves.  We also met certain seed merchants who undertook to get root seeds grown as far as possible.  It was very late, of course, and it was very hard to expect <Col N="965" /> these merchants to do much about it. They did succeed in getting a few acres grown and many of these patches were successful.  A number of farmers also grew sufficient mangel and turnip seeds for themselves, and they were also successful on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the germination successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, it was fairly good.  Even if it were not so good, they could afford to sow the seed fairly thickly as they had grown it themselves.  We also got out a leaflet and a very large number were distributed throughout the country.  I think the knowledge must have been disseminated fairly well as far as that is concerned.  Deputy O'Donovan also made a complaint about our handling of the sea-sand that is used as a stimulant for the land in West Cork.  He asked if we had carried out any experiments as regards cement dust, and he said that the oldest and best form of stimulant or manure&mdash;I suppose it should be called a stimulant rather than a manure&mdash;was this sea-sand. We did carry out experiments with cement dust, but have not got any results yet.  I may say that we did not neglect the sea-sand in South Cork, because we are paying a subsidy on that the same as on lime.  He also asked about spraying materials.  We have enough copper sulphate for the year, but we intend to advise the farmers to use a weaker solution.  We have carried out experiments to prove that a weaker solution is all right, and we are advising the farmers to use a weaker solution of copper sulphate so that we may save some for the following year.  We have also some washing soda but, of course, lime could be used there as an alternative, so it is not so important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know that the wholesale distributors of copper sulphate are speaking in terms of 66? per cent. distribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are advising 1 per cent. instead of 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister <Col N="966" /> know that the wholesalers are speaking of only 66? per cent. distribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be sufficient, because usually the farmer used 2 per cent., and now we have proved by experiment that 1 per cent. is effective, so that 66? per cent. will be sufficient. The Deputy also complained that the tillage inspectors&mdash;some other Deputies made the same complaint&mdash; were not sent out in time.  The tillage inspectors started in September, and they could not, of course, go to every farmer before Christmas.  They could not visit a number of them until after Christmas, and that means that some of them are only being called on now. But, after all, the farmer knows his own duty.  He knows his own arable acreage fairly well, and he knows what he should till, so I do not think he has any great complaint in that regard.</P>
      <P>Another point which I want to mention is the price of pigs, which was raised by Deputy Cogan.  He talked about the price not being a fair one. I think I said in my opening statement that we had to bring down the price of pigs for various reasons.  One of them was that we felt that wheat was being fed to pigs.  Now, there is no use in every Deputy on the other side getting up and saying that that is a slur on the farmers.  The fact that certain farmers fed wheat to pigs, which was proved, is not a slur on the farmers generally.  If there is a man hanged in this country it is not a slur on the rest of us.  I suppose it is, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not to any great extent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is nobody who will say that there are no dishonest farmers in this country?  We all know that there are, and if we looked at the matter properly we should say: &ldquo;If I have a dishonest brother, you try to catch him and stop him from doing what is wrong.&rdquo; Every Deputy on the other side who spoke on this matter of feeding wheat to pigs tried to condone it, and one of them suggested that it was a shame to go after those farmers at all.  Some said it was only screenings that were fed to the pigs, and some said it was <Col N="967" /> damaged wheat.  An inspector of my Department who gave evidence said that the wheat fed to those pigs could have been used for human food.  The district justice accepted his evidence and inflicted a fine in the particular case referred to.  There are other cases to come on, too.  I do not say at all that every farmer in this country was feeding wheat to pigs.  I believe it was only a very small percentage, but at any rate there were some doing it, and that, as I say, is not offensive to all the farmers, but it is one of the reasons why the price of pigs was brought down.  Even this price of 106/- a cwt. means that if the farmer &mdash;he must feed his own produce now &mdash;feeds a certain mixture of oats, barley and potatoes to his pigs, those are worth to the farmer 27/- a barrel for his oats, 31/- a barrel for his barley and £4 a ton for his potatoes, and that is not so bad.  If his oats are worth 27/- a barrel for feeding to his pigs, if his barley is worth 31/- a barrel, and if his potatoes are worth £4 a ton, then the price of pigs cannot be too bad.  I am taking that now on the very simple formula of seven times the ration, that is one cwt. of bacon is worth seven times the ration, and there is a margin for profit and so on in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Flynn talked about seed for South Kerry, and said this was not a year to cut it down.  Last year, Deputy Flynn said that last year was a year to put it up, that it was an exceptional year, and we should give more seed.  Other Deputies made the same point.  We took them at their word; we gave out more seed last year, but we thought the exceptional year had gone, so we did not revive it this year.  I think it was Deputy Linehan who raised the question of getting root seeds from Great Britain. They are not allowed out, so we cannot get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not very much. Deputy Bennett raised a point about shortage of equipment in non-tillage <Col N="968" /> districts.  Some time ago, in answer to a question by, I think, Deputy Hughes, I pointed out that our experience was that there was just as much evasion of the Tillage Order in counties where tillage was practised before this emergency as there was in counties where there had been no tillage.  Those figures would not go to prove that there was a shortage of tillage implements in those districts.</P>

      <P>We did not take it in counties; we took it in districts rather than in counties.  Deputy Alfred Byrne raised a question about butter, and made the good suggestion that we should have more milk and butter, that they should be sold at a lower price to the people, and that the producer should get more for them.  I am quite sure he would have added, if he had been asked, that there should be no increase in taxation.  That is a nice way of running things if it could be done.  Deputy McGovern complained about the number of inspectors.  He made one constructive suggestion, that we should do away with those warble fly inspectors, and that instead we might find out the number of cattle each farmer had, send him the bottle of dressing, and let him apply it himself. I do not think you would save very much staff on that.  As far as I can see, it takes several months for a big staff to count up the number of cattle in the country, and if, after that, we had to make up the bottles for something like 400,000 farmers, sending out the proper quantity to each, I think the saving on staff would be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said that in our appeals to the farmers in regard to the tillage drive we should have asked them to grow more food for their animals as well as more human food.  I do not think Deputy Brennan or any other Deputy can produce any speech on that subject made by me during the last two years in which I did not make the point that after the farmer had made his contribution to the supply of human food he should look after his own animals, <Col N="969" /> and try, if he possibly could, to carry the same number of animals as he carried before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton made a suggestion with regard to varying the price of wheat with the quality.  For some years we did try to vary the price of wheat with the bushelling, but not the milling quality which Deputy Belton had in mind.  He had the glutin quality in mind, while we had more the moisture content which would be disclosed by bushelling.  We found it almost impossible to bring it into operation, or at least to enforce the Order, and we had to stop it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is bushelling not an indication of quality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent, but it is an indication more of moisture than of anything else.  Deputy Belton also complained about the lack of coal for threshing last year.  I thought he would not refer to that again because we got on all right with the threshing, and we feel happier in respect of the position during next harvest because we now know that threshing can be done quite successfully without coal. We were not sure of that last year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked about seeds for gardens in towns.  That question was raised by a number of Deputies on previous occasions.  The supply of these seeds comes under various schemes.  In the congested districts, we give seeds out at a low price&mdash; about half-price, I think&mdash;to small farmers and so on, the idea in that case being to improve the strain of seed rather than to provide a relief scheme.  To unemployed plotholders we gave free seeds and manures, when we had the manures, and free use of implements.  Between all these schemes, however, there is one class we have not been able to deal with, that is, the working men in towns with their own gardens.  In some cases, parish councils took up the matter on their own and we would have liked, if we had time, to work out an all-round scheme with them, and we may be able to do something next year.</P>

      <P>I do not think they have at the moment, but that is not hard to get.  Deputy Hickey said we should give the farmers a decent price for their milk and have it sold at a reasonable price to the consumer. Again, that is a policy which it is very hard to carry out.  Deputy Cosgrave made one observation which I think was rather unwarranted.  He hopes that we are not going to have a general dose of inferiority complex in relation to our dealings with the British government.  I think that suggestion is scarcely justified and that such a situation is unlikely to arise, at any rate, so long as this Government remains in office.  I am not guaranteeing what might happen if there was a change of Government.</P>
      <P>I want to welcome another suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave.  He thinks there is a possibility of co-operation and collaboration on a sound agricultural policy.  I have, as a matter of fact, said that here on some occasions.  I have said that, after all, the matters upon which we disagree are comparatively small and that some of the points we disagree upon are more apparent than real.  We on this side, for instance, have the reputation of pushing tillage too far at the expense of the live-stock industry, while the Party opposite had the reputation of pushing the livestock industry too far at the expense of the tillage of the country.  I think there is very little in that.  Both can be pushed to a great extent, and when we as an Opposition were fighting the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of the day for more tillage, it was with the object of feeding our own people and our own animals and of trying to cut out the import of wheat for human food and of maize for animal feeding as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have proved now, to a certain extent, anyway, during this emergency, that we can go a great distance&mdash;I know we have not got enough yet, but we may have, and I hope we will have, more in the coming year&mdash;in the production of sufficient wheat for our own people and also in the production of grain for our animals, without reducing the number of <Col N="971" /> animals in the country.  The number of cattle is what it was; the number of sheep is what it was&mdash;they are principally grass-fed animals, in any case; there has been a small reduction in poultry; and there has been a substantial reduction in pigs; but we hope that, with the more extensive tillage during the coming year, we may be able to get back again to the number of poultry and pigs we had before.  If we succeed in doing that, we shall have achieved what we had hoped to achieve and what, I am sure, everybody, no matter from what side, would welcome, that is, the maintenance of the number of live stock in the country and, at the same time, the growing of the grain we want for human food and for cattle feeding within the country.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, and I am sure I can speak for the Government and for everybody on this side, we would welcome co-operation and collaboration on an agricultural policy.  I have been around a good many of the counties in connection with the food drive.  Deputies and Senators of all Parties were at those meetings, and I must say that at every meeting I attended I got just as much co-operation, encouragement and help from Deputies and Senators of the Party opposite as I got from the men on this side.  If we can do that in a time of crisis, it is quite possible that what Deputy Cosgrave says is right, and that we may be able to come closer in a general agricultural policy, and in that way make things better generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter which has been referred to so much that I will deal with it again.  When I made the statement that there were no butter exports since last August, I had in mind only creamery butter exports to Great Britain.  The other matter should have occurred to me.  There were three other items I should have referred to.  A certain amount of factory butter is exported after our own requirements for cooking and factory use are filled.  The amount for the whole year is very small&mdash;about 16,000 cwts.  Some of that went out probably during the winter.  Secondly, we had a contract with the Isle of Man.  We made that contract about May or June last year.  Anyway, it is made yearly and it is for 300 cwts. per month.  That is their full supply in the Isle of Man.  We made that contract with them and at the beginning of the war, when the Isle of Man was depending entirely on us for <Col N="973" /> butter, the people there were told by the Minister for Food in England that they would get no butter from him, so if we had broken our contract with them they would be left without butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We got the home price for our butter, less freight.  We got 152/- less freight, and that meant 150/-, as compared with 126/- in Great Britain.  For that reason we thought we should make the contract and carry it out for the year.  I might also mention that during the time the British were putting penal tariffs on our exports, the Isle of Man did not do so.  They accepted our cattle, sheep, bacon and butter subject only to the 10 per cent. duty imposed in 1932.  For many reasons we felt we would have to carry out our contract with the Isle of Man.  The third item was the parcel post.  We did stop butter going out by parcel post, but we allowed butter to go to Irish residents in Britain who produced doctors' certificates that they wanted butter badly.  The total quantity in that connection was only one cwt. per month.  These are the three matters I should have referred to.</P>

I said it occurred this year only because the wholesalers did not do what they were asked to do.  If they had done what they were asked by the Government to do there would be no trouble now, no shortage.  I said that Deputy Byrne's policy would mean selling <Col N="974" /> the butter at a lower price, while at the same time giving a higher price to the producer.  Whatever deficiency there might be would, have to be found in some way by the Government without increasing taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate includes, for the coming year, the winter storage subsidy for butter.  Is the Minister, in a position to say to us now, with his previous experience of butter production in the country, that we will be able to produce in the coming year a sufficiency of butter for our own people?  There has been a good deal of talk of an acute butter shortage in Dublin, and the Minister explains that now by saying that if there is such a shortage it is largely the responsibility of the wholesalers, who did not store butter last summer and whose retail customers are consequently short now. I am not as familiar with the circumstances obtaining in the City of Dublin as I am with the circumstances obtaining in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that there has been a shortage of butter in the <Col N="978" /> Ballaghaderreen area for the past four weeks, and that despite the most-urgent representations to his Department the local creamery, which used to get supplies from Limerick and other areas in the past, was quite unable to get them.  I made strong representations to the Minister which, as usual with his Department, were very courteously received, but the best assistance which the Minister's Department could give has not, up to the present time, succeeded in overcoming the butter shortage that obtains in that area.  If the Minister foresees for the last two months of next year a butter shortage analogous to that which we are experiencing now, surely he ought seriously to consider whether it will not be necessary to ration butter, because the moment you get a butter shortage the first people who will go without it are those on outdoor relief who get butter on the food coupons issued by the Government. They ought to be the last people to go without butter, because for the young people and others in their homes there is already a considerable deficiency in nutritive food.  I think the Minister ought to be able to say to the House that he sees his way to provide sufficient butter to feed our own people and is prepared to give to the House an unqualified guarantee that he will insist on the storage of butter between now and next September to provide a sufficiency, leaving a margin over and above that to carry us well into the following year's production of fresh butter.</P>
    <P>I feel, despite the Minister's conciliatory remarks on the Agricultural Estimate, constrained to direct the attention of the House again to the new Ministerial technique&mdash;that is to come in here and say: &ldquo;There is no butter, but that is not my fault,&rdquo; just as the Minister for Supplies says: &ldquo;There is no tea or sugar and no this or that, but that is not my fault.&rdquo;  Surely our Minister for Agriculture is put upon his explanation when we in Ireland find ourselves without butter?  There has been alacki of foresight-here.  I want to say quite clearly that I endorse his attitude in honouring the undertaking that he gave to the Isle of Man to deliver 300 cwts. a month <Col N="979" /> 12 months ago.  I think it is a good thing, even though it be a great cost to ourselves, to keep our bargain.  He assures us that the factory butter which went out was surplus to the country's requirements.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the people of Ballaghaderreen would sooner have had factory butter than no butter. Factory butter is not bad butter at all. I have eaten it.  It is not, of course, as good as fresh butter, but it is better than some of the cold-store butter.  I think the Minister is blameworthy for his lack of foresight because, remember, this is not the first year we had a butter shortage.  We had one last year.  The Minister gave a most solemn undertaking on that occasion that a butter shortage would never happen again.  He said that he was obliged to confess that he had been short-taken and had not foreseen the situation that was about to arise, but that it would never happen again.  It has happened again.  I want the Minister to give us a categorical assurance that we will not have a similar situation obtaining next April.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister admits the necessity of maintaining these subsidies. I heard him congratulating himself a few moments ago that the Fianna Fáil policy of producing all the raw materials of our dairy industry and of every other branch of the agricultural industry was vindicated, that we had demonstrated our ability to produce these things, and that if we could go on doing them we could all come together in a universal paean of praise, but he quite overlooked the fact that an essential pre-requisite to the present system is the existence of a world war.  I wonder does the Minister claim that it will go on for ever so that the Fianna Fáil policy of self-sufficiency can similarly continue?  If that has not occurred to his mind, he might do well to dwell on that aspect of the question before he delivers another eulogium of Fianna Fáil in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate contains what is for all practical purposes provision for £500,000 to be utilised for the payment of subsidies on production, the export of dairy products and <Col N="980" /> for allowances for storage of butter for the winter.  I have listened to the Minister, but find it hard to understand where this sum of money has been spent.  At the moment we seem to have practically run out of butter.  I suppose that, in some parts of the country, there is a surplus of butter. The Minister told us that certain wholesalers did not avail of the advice given to them last year to put enough butter in storage to meet the needs of their customers.</P>
      <P>There ought to be some consideration for the economic changes that are taking place in the country.  It seems, anomalous to be making provision for bread and butter subsidies after three years of blockade.  For years we have levied import duties on commodities, nominally for the protection of home manufactures, but really in many instances for revenue purposes.  We are now faced with the loss of that income.  In some instances we taxed the raw materials for housing our people with grave results on the costs. As most of these houses were for the working classes, and were paid for by the rest of the community, it seems as if in some cases we were increasing the costs and afterwards charging it to capital account.  However, in face of some of the other aspects of this situation, that is a small matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It looks as if, with the cessation of supplies to this country, we are faced with a complete reversal of the economic structure and that the agricultural community will now have to produce 100 per cent. of our food requirements.  When one considers the population density of Eire compared with the population density of countries such as France or Belgium, surely it is not unreasonable to think that we ought to be able to raise all the food we want for ourselves?  This ought to be the time for a review of the agricultural subsidies.  We are faced with a deficit in the Budget of £7,000,000, and probably next year it may be £10,000,000 or £12,000,000.  The Government ought to take a more realistic view of our financial position.  Why should we export butter at a loss?  At the present time the most serious <Col N="981" /> problem is the shortage of wheat.  We have a surplus of potatoes, but, in reply to a question a few days ago, the Minister for Supplies said that some people were experimenting with the installation of machinery for making potato flour.  Surely in the last resort we will come down to putting potatoes into the bread.  Are we coming to a time when people will be starving in the towns and the farmers will be unable to sell their potatoes?</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance was introducing the Vote on Account he used words something like these: &ldquo;We have not been unreasonable or ungenerous to agriculture.  I collected some figures to show exactly what agriculture was getting: Department of Agriculture, £666,000; agricultural subsidies, £500,000; relief of rates on land, £1,187,000; reduction in annuities to farmers, £2,200,000; farmers' share of flour and bread subsidy, £503,000; farm improvement schemes, £250,000; seed and lime distribution, £70,000; improvement of estates, £250,000; dairying industry, £771,000; a total of over £7,000,000.&rdquo; The Minister also said that farmers will receive more than £6,000,000 for the 1942 wheat and beet crops as against £2,500,000 for these crops in the last year prior to the outbreak of the war.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to suggest that you can balance a £7,000,000 shortage in the Budget by taking away £7,000,000 of subsidies to the farmers.  But there is no doubt that a very profound change is taking place in the economy of this country.  Perhaps it will not be visible for some few months.  It may begin to show some signs in the Budget.  But I should like to suggest to the Minister that the time has come when he can look on the rest of the community, apart from the farmers, as producing the major part of the taxes for running the country if you continue to provide the farmers with £7,000,000 in the shape of subsidies.  I do not mean to suggest that he can cut that off from the farming community, but there will have to be some sort of adjustment of our economic structure due to changes brought <Col N="982" /> about by the war.  I suppose that having passed all the Estimates and the Government having listened to some criticisms, the Budget will then he produced and we will be told: &ldquo;We have pared down the Estimates all we can and nobody brought forward any suggestions about any items that could be reduced.  We cannot cut down our expenditure.  We cannot effect any economies and really there is nothing to be done but to raise the extra £7,000,000 by taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister and to the Government that they ought to take a more realistic view of the changed situation.  I am afraid the time has gone by when we can present subsidies all round the country.  We shall have to try to live within our income and the expenses of each service will have to be borne by those for whose benefit it is operated.  The Minister can think over that suggestion.  I do not suppose he can give any answer to it off-hand, but it appears to me that a very drastic change will have to be made this year in our ideas of subsidies.</P>

But, as previous speakers referred to the butter situation, I should like to say that I attended some conferences recently in connection with the dairying industry at which people who are qualified to speak in connection with that industry pointed out the reduction in the cow population that has taken place all over the country.  I am glad that the subject matter of these conferences will be discussed between the Minister and these representatives at some future date.  I was interested in listening to Deputy Dockrell in connection with the £7,000,000 which it seems the farmers are getting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to refer to agricultural subjects, too.  I, as a farmer, produce cattle for which I get no subsidy.  I produce wheat at 50/- a barrel, and, if there are subsidies given in connection with wheat, is it fair to assume that I, as a farmer, get them?  Does Deputy Dockrell for a moment want me to produce wheat at a wholly uneconomical price?  It has been urged several times in this House that 50/- is not a fair price in the circumstances. That is all I get for wheat, and, if the Government or anybody else chooses to give it for nothing to the people of this country, I do not consider that a subsidy.  I am not getting it, anyway.  I am not getting the bare cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I will refer to the dairying industry for a moment.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his speech in connection with this Vote, has mentioned that the price for milk in the creamery districts was 6d. a gallon.  I understand that he considered it very low. Deputy Hickey said that the distributors in Cork city were getting 7½d. for distributing the milk in Cork City, while I, as a producer, have to take 6d. in the country and send the milk <Col N="984" /> to the creamery to produce butter for the people.  I wonder does Deputy Dockrell think I am getting a big subsidy out of that?  We get no subsidy on butter.  We are not getting the cost of production.  I produce beet, and the price is fixed at £3 10s. a ton.  I do not know what subsidy is given. I do not care.  But I do know, and I want to tell Deputy Dockrell this, that in 12 months' time we will be talking about a sugar scarcity in this country, because the beet acreage has gone down considerably.  If it were such an economic proposition to grow beet, the farmers are the people who would grow it.  They have never failed to grow anything for which they thought there was a reasonable prospect of getting an economic price.  Those are the things that I should like people who represent city constituencies to think about.  I take exception to the fact that a Deputy could stand up and say that the farmers are the only people in the country who are getting subsidies.  He referred to the abatement in rates.  That has a long history.</P>
    <P>In the past, the landlords were accountable for half the poor rate.  In those far away times, what are called the bad old days, what happened was that a lump sum was given in connection with this half rate to relieve the then landlords of their responsibility in connection with it.  That was the original idea of the agricultural grant.  I know we were relieved of half the land annuities, but, if we were, we lost considerably more during the economic war than would pay the land annuities for half a generation.</P>

      <P>We are talking about the supply of butter, and the Minister in a previous statement said that he blamed the wholesalers for not storing sufficient butter.  This Vote includes a sum for the storage of butter for the future.  Why should the Minister blame the wholesalers, when retailers that I can name, both in Dalkey and Dublin, were dealing with the creameries and could not get their supplies from the creameries?  Why should the Minister try to put the responsibility on the wholesalers?  I would ask the Minister to pay serious attention to those points, and to take steps to prevent a recurrence of the blunders which have taken place.  I have aletter here from Kimmage.  It is about the butter situation, the bread situation and the tea situation.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This appeal comes from every woman in the Kimmage area.  If investigations were carried out by the Government inspectors the poor would get their rights that all shops charge the same price.  When we voted for the Government we were never to want.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know what steps the Minister is taking to prevent a failure in the supply of commodities, especially <Col N="987" /> butter and bread and wheat, and now beet, because the Deputy who has just sat down told us we would be short of sugar.  To-day in all the streets of Dublin there were queues looking for ¼lb. of butter.  A number of women stopped me with a shilling in their hands or half a crown in their hands after travelling all parts of the city in search of butter, which they could not get.  There are no fats of any kind available.  I do appeal to the Minister to do something to relieve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the provision asked for by the Minister in this case, and if a division is challenged by Deputy Dockrell or anyone else I will go into the Lobby with the Minister in favour of this proposal, in the same way as my colleagues and myself did on previous occasions.  I cannot understand why Deputies object to the provision of a subsidy for the dairy farmers of the country especially if they realise, as they must realise, that the failure of somebody&mdash; the individual citizen or the Government&mdash;to provide an economic price to the dairy farmer for his milk is going to lead to the collapse of the dairying industry.  We have subsidies &mdash;one can call them subsidies&mdash;provided, through the Unemployment Assistance Fund, for the citizen who is unable to find work.  We have subsidies for the aged, and the widows and orphans, which are supposed to be sufficient to enable those people who have no other means or income to maintain themselves in some kind of decency and comfort.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the amount voted for subsidising the dairy farmers higher than it is because I believe that, if the subsidy is justified at all in a case of this kind, it is justified up to the point at which the dairy farmer will get an economic price for his milk. I have been assured by people who know more about this business than I and who are constantly in touch with the Minister's Department on these matters that it would require 9d. per gallon for milk to enable the dairy farmer to say he is getting an economic price for his produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> If this amount we are now asked to vote is going to provide subsidies only sufficient to give the farmer 6d. per gallon for his milk and to compel the farmer still to suffer a loss on this section of his business, I think it will lead ultimately to the disappearance of the dairying industry.  That is what is happening in that part of my constituency where dairy farmers are associated with the creameries.  It took a great deal of eloquence on the part of experts to persuade many of the dairy farmers in my constituency to go into the dairying industry.  I was very glad to see them going into it, but they are getting out of it now more quickly than they went into it because the business is not paying, and, if it is necessary to double the amount set out, I am prepared to go that far in order to give the dairy farmer an economic price for his milk and to maintain the industry as a whole.  This industry gives a considerable amount of employment and its disappearance will prove to the satisfaction of Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies who object to the subsidy that it is better to provide a subsidy in the way now proposed than to throw thousands of agricultural labourers on to the labour exchange and give them money for nothing.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the whole scheme worked in such a way as to enable the price of butter to be brought within the reach of that very large section of our population who are trying to live on low incomes.  As I stated on a previous occasion&mdash;and figures have been given in the House to prove it&mdash;about 25 per cent. of the citizens of the State are trying to exist on a starvation income, and, if it is possible to arrange such a scheme, I should like to see the price of butter brought within the reach of these people, or the incomes of these people brought up by subsidy as well.  I refer to the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the people in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, unemployment assistance and national health insurance.  I should like to see these people brought to the level at which they would be able, as well as everybody else in the State, to get some of our own butter.  I believe the <Col N="989" /> shortage of butter which has occurred not alone in the City of Dublin but all over the country quite recently is due to the failure, to some extent, of the Department to make provision during the year for the storage of a sufficient quantity of butter to meet the requirements of the people during the lean portion of the year.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister and his officials will learn from the experience of last year and the previous year and will see that it does not happen again. I think it is wrong, in existing circumstances, that agents of the British Ministry of Food and British importers should be allowed to get approval for contracts which enable them at this time of the year to take out of this country butter subsidised by the taxpayers, when our people cannot get it in sufficient quantities. We know that a certain quantity was exported even quite recently.  Deputy Hickey has given figures in that regard and the Minister says that it was exported for the purpose of completing contracts.  I wonder does the Minister know the people for whom this butter was exported.  I daresay he does, and I daresay he knows the names of the people who got the licence to export this butter to the Isle of Man.  I hope it will not occur again and that any subsidy which we may be obliged to vote&mdash;and I am willing, with my colleagues, to vote that subsidy&mdash;will not be used during the present financial year to enable butter to be exported at the expense of the taxpayers, so long as our own people are badly in need of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne raised the point that a semi-official statement&mdash;it is not an official statement&mdash;has apparently been disseminated which places the blame for the present shortage on some of the wholesalers or retailers in the City of Dublin.  I want to ask the Minister whether certain wholesalers or retailers in the city were refused permission by the Department to store certain butter which they wanted to put into cold storage for the winter.  I think it very wrong that, in respect of a shortage like this, an attempt should be made <Col N="990" /> wrongly to place the blame in a general way on the trade.  If the trade can be saddled with the blame, we ought to have an explicit statement as to how it comes about that the blame is attributable to them.  Unless the blame can be placed on them, we should not have statements of that kind, and I should like the Minister to say what wholesalers or what traders who wanted to store butter here in Dublin during the winter for consumption at present were refused permission to store it by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to apportion the blame for the state of affairs in the City of Dublin at present. If the Minister is not responsible, I should like to hear him say so, but butter has been exported, we are told, to fulfil a contract.  We learned that this butter was sent to the Isle of Man. We used to get tail-less cats from that country, but I never knew we sent butter there.  So far as I know, the Isle of Man, since the beginning of the war, has been used as an internment camp.  Did the Minister sanction the sending of the butter there for consumption by prisoners of war while our own people had none?  What I want to direct the Minister's particular attention to is that creamery butter is being sold here at 1/7 a lb.  There then came into the city butter which was supposed to come from a certain county and I wonder if the Minister knows that that butter is not fit for human consumption.  It was retailed at 1/6 a lb.  Another point is that margarine, bearing a wrapper: &ldquo;To be retailed at 5d. a lb. in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;, is being retailed here at 1/6 a lb., or at the price at which this non-creamery butter I speak of is being retailed. Did the Minister authorise or issue a licence for the importation of margarine into this city which bears that wrapper and which is retailed here at 1/6 a lb., while our creamery butter is exported to the Isle of Man, to be served out, I take it, to prisoners of war&mdash;Germans, Italians and whatever other nationalities are gathered there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody should see to it that margarine labelled &ldquo;To be retailed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland at <Col N="991" /> 5d. per lb.&rdquo; is not retailed at 1/6 per lb. to the people of this city.

It is a matter that should be cleared up because of the circumstances in which the people are placed when they seek to get some food for their children, something to put on their bread.  They get margarine in a wrapper which indicates that it is to be retailed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland at 5d. a lb. and they are charged across the counter here 1/6 per lb.  That is a monstrous state of affairs and it should not be allowed to continue.  According to our law the price should be marked up in the shop here.</P>

I take it that the individual consumption of butter has not increased.</P>

      <P>In regard to this Vote. I am in the same position as Deputy Davin&mdash;I should like to see it very much larger and I think that eventually it will have to be very much larger.  I hope the Minister will clear the air and let us know definitely if he expects any part of the money under this Vote to be used to subsidise the export of butter and, if so, how much.  I hope he will satisfy Deputy McMenamin and others, who assume that we are not consuming more than the ordinary amount of butter at home.  The Minister has indicated that we are consuming an additional 100,000 cwts.  I think the consumption is increasing every day.  Production has certainly lessened.  I hope the facts are different from the information I have received. I think Deputies who are not farmers ought to be very pleased that it is there.  If there is any decrease, there is no doubt that a serious situation will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has certainly arrived when something should be done for the producers. They include very badly-paid workers, particularly when one takes into consideration the hours they work. They are probably the longest worked people in the State.  The people must have the butter and I think it is only <Col N="993" /> reasonable that those who produce the butter should be adequately compensated for so doing.  If it has to be produced the producers should be adequately paid and it is only reasonable to ask that those engaged in the production of butter should get a fair wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal has been said about the shortage of butter. I believe the shortage is due to two causes.  One is that there is not a decent price paid for producing it.  The milk from which the butter is produced in sold at 6d. a gallon here, whereas in Northern Ireland the price is 2/-.</P>
      <P>Does that not seem to be an adequate answer?  There are two Departments involved and it is difficult to ascertain which Department is responsible for the export of the butter that is needed for home consumption.  If these Departments did not overlap so much, I believe it would help to get over the difficulty of a butter shortage. I agree with Deputies who suggest that a decent price should be provided for those engaged in the butter-producing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell raised a rather important matter.  For the last ten years we did not hear much complaint about the burdens imposed on this country by reason of protective tariffs.  Protection is a two-edged sword.  You have tariffs imposed to protect the home producer, and then there are subsidies for the producer whose surplus is exported, but the agricultural community do not benefit much.  The £7,000,000 that Deputy Dockrell referred to is all humbug&mdash;there is no such thing.  The same statement was made here by the ex-Minister for Finance and I showed that there was no such thing.  Deputy Dockrell gave us a figure that is supposed to go to the relief of rates.  If we here lived under the same conditions as the farmers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland we would be better off to the extent of £3,000,000, because we would have no rates to pay at all.  As it is, we are paying rates on land that, in equity, should not be liable to rates. I submit that we are entitled to be relieved to the extent of £3,000,000. <Col N="994" /> That would whittle down the £7,000,000 mentioned by Deputy Dockrell.</P>
    <P>They want butter in Dublin and in our other cities and towns for the working people, and why not?  But it must be remembered that it is not an economic thing to produce butter in this country.  Neither is it economic to produce wheat.  Therefore, subsidies have to be wasted, not for the benefit of the producer, but merely to try to induce people to produce those things for the benefit of others. Deputies know that milk cannot be produced economically at 6d. a gallon. What sort of wages could workmen get who attend cows, grow food for them and milk them and then have to sell that milk at 6d. a gallon?</P>
    <P>That is what the average price at the creameries is all through the country, where the butter is manufactured for supplying the cities.  That is the difficulty, and in that 6d. a gallon these subsidies are included.  I would not produce milk at 6d. a gallon, and no practical farmer, with any common sense, would produce it at that price unless he is in the business for some other reason except profit, because there is no profit in it. Accordingly, the farmer gets no relief through the subsidies.</P>
    <P>Now, if the general taxpayer has to pay £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 in the shape, of customs duties, agriculture pays 59 per cent. of that, and therefore, in justice, the farmers are entitled to get back 59 per cent. of the burden that is imposed on them.  Mind you, money that is raised in customs should not be used for revenue purposes at all.  If it is used for protective purposes and to encourage industry, then the way to encourage industry is to raise the price for all sections of producers, and, for those who want protection in the home market, to increase the price by tariffs.  Those who have to live by raising produce and exporting the surplus should get the money in subsidies, but the money is being wasted in expenditure upon one thing or another, unnecessary Government expenditure, and taxation is at the root of all our troubles.  Too much money is being spent that should be used for <Col N="995" /> other purposes.  It should be used to encourage production in all directions and to enable everybody to get a decent living in this country.  I only wish the Minister and the Government would try to do something to lighten the burden of taxation upon the people, and to give the money, that is being squandered for different purposes, to encourage production in all directions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked me some questions about giving a guarantee for next year.  All I can say is that I do not intend to allow any butter to be exported during the coming year, until at least we are perfectly sure that we will have enough for ourselves.  In other words, we will not export any butter until August or September, anyhow, until we see how production goes.  I did state, in my concluding remarks on the main Estimate, that we did ask the wholesalers last year to store a certain amount of butter, and that if all the wholesalers had done as much as we asked them to do, we would have had enough.  In answer to Deputy Mulcahy, I do not know whether any wholesaler was refused or not; I think it is unlikely; but there may have been some reason for refusing in the case of an individual wholesaler. I shall look into the matter, but I do not want Deputy Byrne or anybody else to say that I am trying to escape responsibility.  In fact, I have already stated that I was to blame for not intervening on behalf of the Government with a view to having butter stored in some other way when the wholesalers did not do it, and I intend this year, if, in the opinion of the Department, the wholesalers do not store sufficient butter, to have It stored under Government auspices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true, as some Deputy says, that the butter in the Isle of Man is going to war prisoners.  It is not.  That was as the result of an agreement that was made at the beginning of the war for their own people, whatever the number is.  I do not know what the number is, but they are getting 300 cwts. a month, which would be sufficient to provide them with two ounces <Col N="996" /> a week, which is the ration they are getting there.  I presume that prisoners of war are being looked after directly by the War Office, or whatever Department is responsible.  I did mention that the Isle of Man was giving us the home price for our butter, and not the British price.  I do not know anything about the margarine transaction that the Deputy mentioned.  I mentioned that home consumption of butter had gone up very materially from 1930 to 1941.  It was exactly 100,000 cwts. higher than in 1940, and now, during the last few months of February, March and April, the consumption is a good deal higher than in the corresponding months of last year.  So it does look as if we will have to store an additional 100,000 cwts., to be on the safe side, for the coming year, but that is an estimate to be looked after. I do not think I could deal with Deputy Dockrell's speech.  I think it is a speech, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle advised, that might be raised again on the Budget.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £11,247 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar crioch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1943, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Iascach Mara agus Intíre, ar a n-áirmhítear Ildeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £11,247 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1943, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main feature of this Estimate is the substantial reduction which the sum of £16,747 set down for the year <Col N="997" /> 1942-43 shows by comparison with the figure of £33,712 voted for the preceding financial year.  This relatively large decrease will be readily understood if Deputies will turn to page 137 of the Estimates Book and will follow me in simple explanation.  The reduction or saving of £930 on the administration sub-heads arises from some rearrangements in staff personnel.  The reduction of £2,590 on the Sea Fisheries sub-heads arises as to £2,500 from the fact that provision for the special insurance of certain steam trawlers is not being renewed, because the owners of these vessels did not see their way to comply with the conditions proposed to them for the grant of such assistance.</P>
    <P>The reduction on the Inland Fisheries sub-head is £6,040 gross, of which £6,000 represents a special item of <i>ex gratia</i> compensation in connection with the Erne fisheries which was voted and paid last year but against this gross reduction of £6,040 there is an increase of £520, of which £500 is attributable to a rise in the sum set down to meet the claims of local authorities consequent upon the operation of the rating provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1925.  I have more than once explained that if the loss of rates formerly derived by these authorities from the fishery assessments (now payable to the conservators) amounts in the aggregate to more than one penny in the £ spread over a local authority's poor rate income, then such excess has to be made good from the Fisheries Vote.  These annual payments, which are made in response to the sealed requisition of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, have been showing an upward trend; hence this increased provision that is now being made in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the Sea Fisheries Association sub-head we find a total reduction of £5,500, and the reasons for this are as follows.  There is put down for development work the sum of £2,000 against £3,000 last year, because owing to the increasing difficulties in obtaining gear and other requisites the present or immediate future is not considered a good time for experimental operations.  At sub-head G (3) the <Col N="998" /> amount provided for the supply of boats and gear on hire-purchase terms is down by £4,000 for much the same reason; the directors of this association had borrowed rather heavily from the Exchequer in the years 1939 and 1940 during which advances of more than £27,000 were made to the association, and invested largely in the purchase of stocks of gear and general equipment against the shortage of such materials which now prevails.  This was clearly a prudent policy, and, naturally, when they cannot purchase such things in any quantity now, the directors do not wish to burden their members with interest on further borrowing beyond the bare minimum. The reduction of £500 on sub-head G (4) is explained by the fact that no structural work of any consequence could with advantage be undertaken by the association in the conditions likely to obtain during the coming year.</P>
    <P>In former years I have often had to meet criticism from Deputies who complained that nothing was being done by way of development or improvement of our fishing industry that was at all commensurate with the amount of money voted for this service; and I have consistently maintained that neither I nor my Department could undertake the physical side of fishing, and have pointed out that our responsibility ended when we had done our best to provide those engaged upon it with the means of carrying on their work.  While, therefore, not proposing to claim direct credit now for the phenomenal improvement which our sea fishing industry has shown for the year 1941 as compared with previous years, it is right to say that our persistent support of the Sea Fisheries Association throughout the lean and apparently hopeless days has contributed largely to this satisfactory outcome.  Let me quote these few figures.  The total value of our landings of sea fish in 1938 was £167,000, and in 1941 it was £548,000.  The figures of quantity are, in one respect at least, even more remarkable.  During 1939 when there were in commission nine steam trawlers that made in all 259 trips, our <Col N="999" /> people landed a total of 188,000 cwts. of sea fish, whereas during 1941 with only three such steam trawlers making between them 102 trips, we landed 276,000 cwts, of sea fish&mdash;showing clearly how well our inshore fishermen have risen to the occasion and availed themselves of the only opportunity that has offered during a period of years of making a decent living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>These good earnings have had the satisfactory result of reducing considerably the arrears due to the Exchequer by the Sea Fisheries Association in respect of the earlier advances made for the supply of boats and gear. Such repayments prior to 1941 had been in or about £5,000 per annum, but during that year just £21,000 was repaid to the Exchequer.  Our inland fisheries also prospered both as to quantity and value during the year 1941; and the turnover for sea and inland fisheries combined amounted to more than £1,000,000.  We must not, of course, forget that there may be serious troubles ahead in the matter of supplies, not only of engines, nets, ropes and other gear, but also with regard to fuel oils; at the same time it is pleasant to record this spell of prosperity, such as it is.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say much about the items comprised in sub-head H by way of Appropriations-in-Aid; they are virtually self-explanatory.  It will be noted, however, that the sum estimated by way of repayment from the Sea Fisheries Association in the financial year 1941-42 was £7,375, and while (as I have already mentioned) there actually came in from that source just £21,000, the directors are not quite so optimistic about the results for the coming year.  At the same time the sum of £10,000 mentioned in the Estimate is about twice the average receipts for the five years prior to 1941.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would mention that the Directors of the Sea Fisheries Association have continued to display special interest in the needs of their members resident within the Gaeltacht. This is shown by the fact that during the two calendar years 1940 and <Col N="1000" /> 1941 boats and gear on hire-purchase to the value of £17,000 were provided for the Gaeltacht.  These facilities included 11 motor boats, 21 unengined craft, while 10 engines were installed in existing hulls.  No less than 1,083 fishing nets and 121 coils of rope were also supplied to members resident within the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty of obtaining certain supplies, especially kerosene. Another thing that is causing a great deal of difficulty for fishermen is the scarcity of cording for the repair of mackerel, herring and salmon nets.  I understand the position with regard to getting in supplies of that commodity is improving.  After all, the fish caught here help largely to add to the food supply of Britain, and if that were put strongly to the people on the other side we might be able to obtain larger supplies.  I do not know what the position will be with regard to kerosene for the fishing boats.  I am being deluged with complaints as to the inadequacy of the amount available for fishermen along the Kerry coast, and I presume other Deputies also have had representations made to them.  As far as I can find out, the last ration has been cut by 50 per cent. The cut is so severe that the actual time fishermen are able to spend out fishing has been shortened considerably. Some people have put up the case to me&mdash;I do not know if their complaints are well-founded&mdash;that during the last war, when there was no control until about 1918, greater facilities in the way of the provision of boats and gear was made for the ordinary fisherman.  I am not quite sure whether that is so or not.  There may be some substance in it.  At the moment, if the ordinary fisherman is unable to put up the required deposit he is pretty well out of it.  It has been suggested to me that other people who are not real fishermen at all&mdash;fish merchants and others in the fishing localities&mdash;since they are able to make the required deposit, are getting in as members of the Association and, in that way, taking the place of actual working fishermen.  In the past our object was to see that the practical <Col N="1001" /> fisherman was himself made the owner of his own vessel.  I am informed that at the present time, in many cases, the vessels are being given to persons who are able to put down the deposit even though they are not practical fishermen themselves.</P>
      <P>I believe that the purification tank at Cromane has been a very great success, and that the industry there has shown a very good profit during the past season.  I wonder if the Minister has considered the possibility of a similar plant at Mornington.  Perhaps that question would come more fittingly from one of the Deputies from County Louth, but the fact is it has a very considerable interest for the fishermen at Cromane, because, I understand, some mussels have been getting out of the country which really were not fit for human food and were being sold as such on the British market although the licence was only for their export for bait.  If that were true it would, of course, react against the purified mussels from Cromane and lead to the possibility of the markets at Birmingham and Nottingham, where they are usually disposed of, being completely closed down against them.  From the point of view of Cromane it would be a very good thing if there was a purification plant established at Mornington which is a very big centre of the mussel industry. The Minister might consider if expenditure on it could be entertained at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the only matters I want to deal with.  Some Deputies, I am sure, will want to speak about the fixed price of salmon.  I do not suppose anything better could have been done by way of getting a higher price. The principal market for salmon is across the channel, and if the people there fix the price I do not know what we can do about it.  I take it that the matter was fought as hard as it could be.  It must be said that the price fixed is a bit low, especially from May on when it will be 2/6 per lb.  That may have the good effect of putting more salmon on the market here.  I am particularly interested to hear from the Minister if larger supplies of cording for mackerel, herring and <Col N="1002" /> salmon nets are likely to be obtained, as well as of kerosene, and of petrol for priming the engines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the interest in this matter.  He covered most of the facts with reference to the deep sea fisheries.  Then he came to the price fixed for salmon and said that he believed the best that could be done was done, and that it may have the effect of placing more salmon on the market.  What I am concerned with is the interests of the fishermen.  After going to an expense of about £110, if you include a boat, and the expense of paying labour and risking their lives to catch fish, it seems extraordinary that they are only to get 4/- a lb. for salmon, less the cost of transit, etc. and, after May next, a price of 2/6 a lb. which, with the transit cost, will leave them with less than 1/- per lb.  The advantage to the home market will hardly compensate these fishermen who go to such trouble to catch fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what happened.  At the opening of the season catches were exceptionally good, and the price was extremely attractive.  In many cases the fishermen got 6/- and 7/- a lb. for the salmon.  Suddenly a complete alteration took place.  The Government took steps to create a central organisation.  Now the fishermen are debarred from exporting their fish themselves, or through a local merchant, and have to send the fish through a central organisation.  I do not suppose there would be any great disadvantage in that if it were not for the fact that the price was immediately reduced from 6/- or 7/- a lb. to 4/- a lb., less the cost of transit, which is about 2/- or 2/2 a lb.  Then they are faced with a still further reduction in May.  The fishermen do not understand the reason for that when salmon is being retailed in England at 17/6 a lb.  They are wondering whether the Government did their best to get them a good price or whether they made any effort to get a better price than that.  If they knew that such an effort was made they would have some feeling of satisfaction. I wonder if these prices cannot be improved.  If not, there is a possibility <Col N="1003" /> that salmon fishing will come to an end altogether in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain the position to the House and try to reconcile the retail price of 17/6 in England with what the fishermen here are to get.  Taking into consideration the expenses which they have to bear in fitting out their boats and the risks they run, I do not think such a small price can be justified.   A strenuous effort will have to be made to increase the price if at all possible.  Any advantages to the home market or to the people who can enjoy the luxury of eating salmon will not compensate the fishermen who have to undergo such hardships and such expenditure in order to catch the fish.  In the interests of those fishermen I hope the Minister will tell us what the prospects are when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements made do not hold out much prospect for the fishing industry, particularly that of salmon fishing.  I was somewhat deceived myself when these negotiations were going on.  I understood that the British Minister for Food had fixed the price for salmon in England and thereby of course, fixed the price here. When I read a report in a local paper that at a meeting of the conservators in Donegal Deputy McDevitt stated that salmon was being retailed in England at 17/6 a lb.&mdash;I take it the Deputy had verified these figures&mdash;it struck me that &ldquo;a quick one&rdquo; had been put across this country and the Government in fixing the price up to May at 4/- a lb. and thereafter at 2/6. It appears now that the price of salmon has not been fixed in Great Britain.  I think people in this country, including the fishermen, were under the impression that the price fixed here was due to the fact that the price was controlled in Great Britain. If the statement made by Deputy McDevitt and also the statement of Deputy Broderick are true I think there should be a direct approach made to Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food in Great Britain, to point out to him the inequity of this, and that if our fishermen are to provide food for <Col N="1004" /> the English people the question of price should be reopened.  That is all the more necessary when you consider the fact that the equipment these men have to use has either gone up considerably in price or is unprocurable.  Through their own efforts certain fishermen are getting in some equipment.</P>
      <P>I do not know how they are getting it, but they probably have to pay an exorbitant price for it.  Ultimately they will be driven out of business if they have to pay these increased prices. for gear, oil and engine parts, if they can get them.  It is really monstrous in these circumstances if our fishermen are only getting 4/- a lb. less the cost of telegrams, freight and commission. I do not think these charges come to the figure Deputy Broderick mentioned. I do not know what the exact figure is, but it would hardly bring the price of salmon down to 1/- per lb. after May.  In view of the retail price of salmon in Great Britain, I think the price here is grossly inequitable and unfair.</P>
      <P>With regard to the industry generally, the supply of gear, twine, ropes. nets and fuel presents a very serious problem.  Deputy Lynch said he understood that some equipment would be made available, that owing to the fishermen here producing food for Great Britain they are disposed to release some equipment to supply these men.  If that is so, I think a survey should be made of the entire fishing industry here, and an estimate prepared as to the amount which would be necessary to cover, let us say, three years' equipment.  If that equipment can be procured, it should be procured at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another suggestion which I want to make, because I like in business matters of this kind to take time by the forelock, I hope for the best, but I assume the worst.  It is quite possible, it is even probable, that there may be no crude oil or kerosene available for those boats, and it would be prudent to tell the fishermen of this State that where it is possible to do so they should equip their boats with sails.  It may mean heavier labour and a return to the old way of fishing, but <Col N="1005" /> the old way is not always the worst way.  The new way is easier; you simply put your finger on the self-starter and away goes the boat, but I think our fishermen should be told that it is possible and even probable, owing to world conditions, that the quantity of fuel available for them will be practically worthless for the continuous running of their boats, and that consequently they should equip those boats with sails if it is possible to procure the cloth.  With the exception of the very small yawls, practically all the boats are equipped with engines, and it may well be that, at quite an early date, there will be no fuel available for those boats at all.  As a matter of fact, the allocation for the present month is not at all adequate.</P>
    <P>The consequence of that will be that those men, hit by one adverse factor after another, will ultimately be driven completely out of the fishing industry.  That would be a real tragedy from the national point of view, because present world conditions &mdash;particularly conditions in Great Britain, herself engaged in a life and death struggle, and, I take it, the great majority of her trawlers being used for mine sweeping&mdash;would give a golden opportunity not only to the present generation of fishermen, that is the older men, but an opportunity for them to train the younger generation to follow them in their industry.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Lynch who rather regretted the fact that private capital, that is to say, capital other than that of the boat owners, was being invested in the industry.  As a matter of fact, one of the regrets I have always had with regard to the fishing industry in this country was that private capital was not invested in it.  One of its handicaps was that except what came from private funds in the old days of the Congested Districts Board, and, since the establishment of the State here, from public funds, no private capital was invested in the industry at all, and the fishermen themselves have to struggle to put down deposits and pay instalments on their boats.  During bad periods in the industry, those men were unable to pay their instalments, and ultimately <Col N="1006" /> the boats went to loss.  They generally had to give securities, and those securities were mulcted, with the result that nobody would go security for the fishermen.  It would be a good thing if a lot of the money invested in foreign industries, which ultimately go up the spout, were invested in our own fishing industry here to buy some trawlers and boats of all kinds.  It is rather a sad commentary on our position now, when there is an opportunity to lay the foundations of a big fishing industry here, which would be a real asset to the nation, that there is not enough timber available in this country to build a dozen or two dozen boats.  Of course our fishing fleet, taking it on the whole, is nothing at all in comparison with what it should be, seeing the enormous coast line we have and the great potentialities of this industry.</P>
    <P>Instead of regretting the investment of private capital in it, I should like to see millions of pounds being invested in it, as happens in Great Britain.  Take, for example, all those great trawling companies; they are the creation of private capital.  Looking at it as a major industry, capable of producing an amount of food and wealth for this country, it never can be kept alive out of the resources of the individual fishermen around our coasts.  That is why the industry is in such an impoverished condition.</P>
    <P>Let me summarise the main facts. I think the Food Controller in England should be approached with a view to reopening this question of the price of salmon.  I am quite sure that a man like Lord Woolton, occupying the position that he does, would see the injustice which is being done in that regard and would fix a more equitable price. Secondly, I think the Department or the Sea Fisheries Association should impress upon the fishermen the necessity for equipping their boats with sails if sail cloth can be procured. With regard to ropes, twine, netting and other equipment, I do not know what quantity is on hands, but I hope the Sea Fisheries Association has made provision for a considerable quantity to cover a period of four years, and that it will not happen, as <Col N="1007" /> in the case of other supplies which we thought we had here, that when a crisis comes it will be found they are not there.  I hope there is some Department of State that can see beyond its nose and do its duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been indicated by other Deputies, great dissatisfaction prevails in regard to what is considered by the fishermen to be the low price paid for salmon this year, especially in view of the fact that the cost of the equipment necessary for their boats has been increased enormously. That, in conjunction with the hazardous nature of their occupation, would warrant the payment of a higher price for salmon this year.  The fishermen hope that the Minister will again make representations to the British Government with a view to securing that a proper price will be paid.  The price at the moment is bad enough, but, when it comes to 1st May and the lower price of 2/6 is paid, I am afraid there will be very few fishermen who will interest themselves in procuring fish.  We were discussing subsidies some time ago, and I may say that I think the position would warrant the payment of a subsidy to fishermen, seeing that they are not able to procure an economic price on the British market.  Subsidies are being paid to farmers and various other people in the country.  Nobody begrudges the subsidies that are being paid to the farmers; it is necessary to pay them in order that they may secure an economic price for their produce, but a case could also be made for the fishermen in this particular instance, because something should be done by way of supplementing the price paid by the people on the other side of the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I really stood up to say was that applications have been made to the Department of Supplies by fishermen in various parts of the country for an extra supply of tea.  As the Minister knows, the fishermen are absent from their homes for periods of at least ten to 12 hours, and, owing to the fact that in their households each person receives only half an ounce of tea per week, it is impossible for <Col N="1008" /> them to bring any tea with them.  I ask the Minister to make representations to the Department of Supplies with a view to securing that these men's application will receive some consideration.  The Minister knows the Wexford constituency, and he knows that in a great many cases the fishermen live a good distance away from the banks of the Slaney, with the result that they are away from their homes for the whole day.  Now that the application has been made by the fishermen in County Wexford, I exhort the Minister, knowing the situation as he does, to try to secure that these men will be given an extra supply of tea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the remarks of Deputy McMenamin about the investing of private capital in the fishing industry.  I have held that view for a long time.  I think it would be a very good test of how far the subsidising of the industry ought to go, and particularly in regard to power-boat fishing.  I believe that the total number of power-boats necessary to supply our own requirements of fish would not be large, and I do not think it would be advisable to formulate plans for the future on the presents condition of the industry.  Just as in the last war, the industry is prospering now and has readily adapted itself to the conditions which the war brought about.  There are good prices and the fishermen are fishing industriously and in a number of cases with which I am acquainted, the fishermen were ready to put down a very substantial deposit &mdash;people I thought would not be able to do so at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry seems to have been able to finance itself fairly well when prices became good.  I do not think the home market would justify huge expenditure at all, although I certainly think the small inshore man does require special consideration and should get it from the Government, particularly on the poorer parts of the coast. If it were merely a case of supplying our own requirements of fish, I think the obvious thing to do, now that we are establishing something in the nature of a marine, would be to equip that marine with boats which could be <Col N="1009" /> used for fishing and to put whole-time fishermen at the job.  I suggest that young men be trained to it.</P>
    <P>The matter of salmon has been discussed throughout the country.  I had intended to make a complaint on behalf of fishermen who used to have the right of drift-net fishing for salmon in Galway Bay, but it seems to me that salmon fishing at present is not an industry about which people are enthusiastic, owing to the small price, but it is no harm to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this right existed.  I would remind him that some years ago when he introduced his Fisheries Bill, one of the things it did was to make the establishment of several fisheries easier, or at least to make the establishment of a claim to a several fishery much easier.  As a counter-blast to that, we were promised by the Minister that the boards of conservators would be brought under more democratic control.</P>
    <P>Great inroads have been made by the owners of several fisheries, that is, by boards of conservators which are dominated by the owners of several fisheries, on the rights of the ordinary individual, and particularly the ordinary angler. We had a recent case in Galway in which the Minister made an order defining the tidal water mark on the Corrib, and this was evidently quite easily upset with the help of the Fisheries Act when the matter was brought to the High Court.  It is strange to see a claim made that it is necessary to prevent men from drift-net fishing for salmon in a wide expanse of water like Galway Bay, when the people who make that claim are freely allowed to take all the salmon, they can in narrow waters like the Corrib and the Spiddal rivers.  What takes place in those rivers is nothing short of slaughter.  We all know that only one salmon in a hundred is taken in a drift-net.</P>
    <P>There are other indications, particularly in the west, of the hostility of these boards of conservators to the ordinary angler and particularly to organised anglers like the Galway and Corrib Anglers' Association.  This association spent a good deal of its own money on the erection of a <Col N="1010" /> hatchery in Oughterard, and after a great deal of trouble they got a small grant from the Department.  Last year they asked for further facilities in the way of being allowed to take trout in an extra river&mdash;the Farrimer river in Gleann, Oughterard.  This reasonable request was refused by the Department at the instigation, I presume, of the Board of Conservators.  This river has an abundant supply of trout, but the natural spawning is interfered with very much by salmon coming up to spawn, and also by pike at the entrance to it.  This association last year put 400,000 fry into Lough Corrib.  They spread them all over the lake and could have put in another 100,000 if they were allowed to use the Farrimer river.</P>
    <P>I think this attitude on the part of the conservators should be checked by the Department.  It is really tantamount to resentment against anybody, other than themselves, presuming to have any say in the matter of fishing and the development of fishing. They are primarily interested in salmon and, apart altogether from the purely sporting angler's interest, there is the tourist point of view.  If there were not trout fishing in the Corrib, which is the largest free fishing in the country, there would not be any great attraction to the visiting angler.  That really is the attraction on the Corrib, and if there were no anglers' association there at all, it is a first duty of the Board of Conservators to see that trout fishing is promoted.</P>
    <P>The boards also have the duty of cleaning certain rivers&mdash;rivers that are good breeding grounds for trout&mdash;and to my knowledge these rivers have been left to the care of the anglers' association who have had to provide their own money for cleaning them. They have done this, although the Board of Conservators gets a grant every year from the Department of Fisheries for that, I presume, amongst its other duties.  Seeing that the Minister went so far to preserve the rights of the owners of several fisheries, and even went so far as to compensate the owners who were not able to establish their claim, as happened in the case of the Erne fishery, I think the Minister <Col N="1011" /> should implement his promise with regard to the control of boards of conservators and should try to make these boards more democratic in their composition.</P>
    <P>We all know some of the methods&mdash;at all events we know one of the methods &mdash;by which control is exercised; for instance, by purchasing licences either for employees or fictitious persons and thereby securing a majority of votes at the meetings for election of boards. The proceedings of these boards are carried out in a very hole-and-corner method.  Apparently there is no publicity, and nobody outside is aware of what goes on at them.  Indeed, it is very difficult to find out who are the members.  If there is a right of private ownership claimed in relation to fishing, the Minister and the Department ought not allow it to be subject to such grave abuses as have taken place.  I wonder if it would be possible to justify such right at all.  The ordinary man in the street, at least in my constituency, is becoming very interested in this matter, and I am taking advantage of this opportunity to voice his feelings about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the Minister made no reference to the mussel industry, at least so far as the erection of a purification tank is concerned. This matter of the erection of a purification tank has been brought to the notice of the Department for the last five or six years.  The people engaged in the mussel industry were hopeful that a tank would be erected.  The Minister, I am sure, was very interested in the remarks of Deputy Fionan Lynch, when he spoke of the great advantage gained by the erection of a tank on the Kerry coast&mdash;how useful it is to the men engaged in the industry in that region.  This year the mussel industry was a big boon to many people, especially around the ports of Dundalk and Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that, due to the fact that there have been no coal cargoes for some considerable time, the earnings of dock labourers and others engaged in port work were very small. I may say that these were considerably <Col N="1012" /> augmented when those men engaged in the mussel industry.  I think the price per ton ranges from £4 to £6.  Where there were five or six boats, and where it was possible to raise 15 to 20 tons a week, it was undoubtedly a great boon to the workers, especially during a very lean period.  There are great numbers of men engaged in this industry along the river Boyne.  It is a matter of indifference to me where the tank will be erected, so long as it is erected on a part of the coast where it will serve equally the interests of the Dundalk, the Drogheda and the Carlingford men.</P>
    <P>The cost of erection should not be prohibitive and the procuring of necessary materials should not present any great difficulty.  As a matter of fact, the main materials used in the erection of a purification tank would be cement, sand and gravel, and these are easily procurable in the area.  Indeed, there is a very fine selection of sand and gravel in the locality.  The cement can easily be obtained at the Drogheda factory.  I hope the Minister will give this matter his very serious consideration, particularly as the times through which we are passing do not look very bright from the point of view of employment generally. This little industry has, I may say, provided a nice steady income for many people during the last four or five months, the months that really count, because they were the severe winter months.</P>
    <P>The price of salmon has been very widely discussed by the fishermen. Deputy Walsh and myself attended a very large meeting of fishermen in Drogheda, men who fish the Boyne. These men expressed very keen disappointment at the price that has been fixed for salmon.  The price is 4/- per lb. from February to May.  That price was not too bad, but they think that the price of 2/6 per lb., commencing in the month of May, is too low.  In fact, when certain deductions are made, I think the net price works out at 1/8 to 1/10 per lb.  I think the factors retain 7d. or 8d. per lb. to cover transport charges, insurance, etc.; at least, that is what the fishermen stated at the meeting.  Their disappointment <Col N="1013" /> was all the more keen because they had an intimation from the Department that the price would not be fixed without first consulting them.  Now they say the price was fixed behind their backs.  That is the information they gave us, and I should like the Minister to say whether that is the fact.  I think some effort should be made to have the price, particularly the price commencing in May, increased. I understand that last year the price for salmon was 2/6 to 3/- per lb. from May onwards.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that fishing for salmon does not start properly in Dundalk Bay until May, so that the present price of 2/6 will be the starting price for them.  I think the Minister should reconsider this question of the price of salmon and take into consideration what is paid for the fish in England.  The position here becomes far worse when one considers that salmon is sold across the water from l0/- to 13/- per lb. and it has been stated here that the price went as high as 17/6.  The price paid in the British market is such as should enable the fish merchants here to give a bigger amount to the men who catch the salmon.  I hope the Minister will reopen this matter with the object of having the price increased.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the important matter of gear.  That is a matter which possibly would present a little more difficulty to the Minister <Col N="1014" /> and his officials.  All the material for gear, for nets, has of necessity to be imported.  The Minister might be able to come to some agreement with the British so that a sufficient amount of cord and the other things incidental to the making of nets could be imported, so enabling the fishermen to carry on their work.  Many of the men who fish around Dundalk are very short of gear and it is a question whether some of them will be able to fish at all this year.  Even if they do start with whatever gear they possess, it is questionable whether they will be able to continue should anything happen to their nets.  I should like the Minister to do all he can to obtain supplies of gear for those men.</P>
