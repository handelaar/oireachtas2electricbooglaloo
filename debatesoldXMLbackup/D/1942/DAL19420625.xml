      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state the number of letters written from his Department to doctors in the City and County of Dublin since the 15th May asking for an explanation as to why their cars were standing in particular places in the streets, the reason for the making of such inquiries, the number of letters of explanation received, the number of such explanations considered unsatisfactory, the grounds upon which they were considered unsatisfactory, the nature of any action taken, including the nature of any general instructions issued.</P>

      <P>Letters requesting explanations from all categories of owners of permitted cars, including doctors in the City and County of Dublin, have been issued by my Department in all cases where the information reaching the Department indicated possible misuse of the vehicle concerned.  The number of such letters written to doctors in the City and County of Dublin since the introduction of the permit system is 46. Replies have been received in 43 cases. Explanations have been considered unsatisfactory in 11 cases on the ground that the vehicle concerned was used for a purpose other than that for which the permit was intended and warning letters were issued to the doctors concerned.  One permit has been withdrawn on other grounds and one case is still under inquiry.  The general purposes for which permits and <Col N="1736" /> petrol are made available to medical doctors are indicated in the warning letters issued.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, on the 16th June, a letter was addressed by his Department to a doctor living at 13 Parnell Square telling him that his car was observed outside the house next door&mdash;No. 12&mdash; on the 6th June and asking for an explanation as to the purpose for which the vehicle was being used on that occasion?  Will the Minister say whether it is his intention to write to doctors and ask them why their cars are standing outside their own doors or within ten or 20 yards of their own doors?  If so, what possible purpose is being served by these inquiries and what possible misuse of the car is suggested when a doctor has it standing outside his own door?</P>

The Minister's reply is that a letter will be addressed to every person who uses his car in a way <Col N="1737" /> which creates a doubt as to whether it is being used in accordance with the terms of his permit.  Does the Minister assert that it is evidence of misuse of a doctor's car to have it standing outside his own hall door and, if not, why was that letter sent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in respect of his letter (P.H. 1206/5/42) of 15th May, 1942, to the Carlow Urban District Council, he will state (a) the date and the grounds on which Mr. John Curran, waterworks caretaker, was suspended by the local authority, (b) the date on which investigation was made by the engineering officer of his Department, (c) the date on which the Minister informed the council that he had terminated the suspension of Mr. Curran, (d) the total amount to be charged against rates as a result of delay in dealing with the case, (e) whether Professor Purcell, the consulting waterworks engineer, was interviewed by the inspector, (f) what independent inquiries were made outside the local authority officials by the inspector as to the general condition of the water in the town prior to and after the suspension of Mr. Curran, (g) whether in view of the unanimous dissatisfaction of the members of the <Col N="1739" /> council and the people of Carlow he will hold a public investigation into the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The caretaker was suspended by the urban district council on the 14th November, 1941.  The resolution suspending him stated that the council were satisfied that the failure of the water supply to the town on the 11th November was due to the gross negligence of the caretaker.  The resolution was received on the 27th November.  On the 16th December the council were requested to obtain statements from the caretaker and from the town surveyor on the causes of the failure of the water supply.  These statements were received on the 8th January, 1942.  The evidence of the surveyor indicated that the failure was due to an exceptional rainfall in the district during the night of the 10th November.  The resolution suspending the caretaker gave one instance and one only as the grounds for suspension. Consequently, the investigation was confined to this particular instance. An engineering inspector inspected the waterworks on the 4th March, 1942. As there was no suggestion at any time that the works were not properly designed, the council's consulting engineer was not, therefore, interviewed by the inspector.  There was also no question of general complaints as regards the management of the waterworks. The cause of the failure of the water supply on the 11th November was due to the choking of the filters. The question to be decided was the cause of the choking.  No evidence on this matter would be obtainable from independent inquiries outside the officials of the urban council.  The inspector was satisfied that on the night previous to the water failure there was a heavy storm, and that the storm came so unexpectedly that the resultant failure of the water supply was due to very exceptional causes and not directly to negligence of the caretaker.  The inspector reported that, in general, the waterworks were well looked after and, on consideration of the facts ascertained by the <Col N="1740" /> inspector as to the occurrence, it was decided to remove the caretaker's suspension.  The Minister is satisfied that a public investigation into the whole matter would not serve any purpose. Approval was given to the employment of a temporary caretaker during the suspension of the caretaker at a cost of 10/- a week, but I have no information as to the charge on the rates arising out of the suspension. There was no avoidable delay in coming to a decision in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that complaints were made about the inefficiency of this officer over a period of years prior to this particular incident, that those complaints appeared on the minutes of the local authority's meetings and that the action of the local authority was taken on general inefficiency over a period and not with regard to a particular incident?  This incident, where the town was left without water, completely dry, on a certain morning, brought the matter to a head and the local authority decided to suspend the officer.  Is the inefficiency of this officer to be judged on the condition in which the Minister's inspector found the waterworks generally four months after suspension, when the job had been cleaned up by a temporary caretaker? Must the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the general efficiency of an officer must be judged over a period on the condition of the water prior to suspension and on whether there was any improvement in it after suspension, and that it is only on that general examination of the condition of the water during the period of office of each caretaker that one can draw a proper conclusion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference of opinion between the Department and the local authority as to the need for a central hospital at Bantry.  The principle of providing it was approved many years ago, but the local authority so far has failed to take any effective steps.  I do not think it would be possible to take effective steps to provide a hospital for Bantry under existing conditions, partly due to the fact that money may not be available now from Hospitals Trust funds to make a substantial grant towards the project, and partly due to the fact that building materials and supplies are not available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the number of public pumps situated in the town of Stradbally, County Leix; the number, if any, condemned by the county medical officer of health since January, 1940; the number of persons certified to be suffering from diphtheria, typhoid, and scarlet fever in the dispensary area, and the number of persons, if any, who died from such diseases during the same period; and whether he can now state if it is the intention of the Laoighis County Board of Health and his Department to see that a suitable water supply is provided for the people of this town at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two public pumps in the town of Stradbally, Laoighis county, one of which has been condemned by the county medical officer of health.</P>
      <P>During the period from January, 1940, to the 20th June, 1942, there were five cases of diphtheria, three cases of scarlet fever and three cases of typhoid fever notified to this Department as having occurred in the Stradbally dispensary district.  Cases of diphtheria or scarlet fever cannot be attributed to the use of impure water.  The cases of typhoid fever occurred in a district about two and a half miles from the town of Stradbally and were not attributed to the consumption of contaminated water.  These three cases of typhoid fever ended fatally and are the only deaths recorded from the above mentioned diseases in the Stradbally dispensary district for the period January, 1940 to 20th June, 1942.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay is due to the failure of the solicitor to the vendor of the water rights to sign the agreement. I understand that we have written to the local authority regularly, at frequent intervals, to try to bring this to a head.  I understand that the solicitor of the local authority is trying to get the solicitor for the vendor to sign the agreement.  So far it has not been possible to do it.  I cannot see that there is anything further I can do to bring the matter to a head.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that large quantities of wheat intended for seed purposes last season when tested after the harvest and immediately before sowing in the spring showed a wide discrepancy in germination indicating that such wheat was not stored under proper conditions, and if he will say whether any consideration will be given by his Department to devising more satisfactory methods of handling our seed supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the germination of seed wheat deteriorated considerably in a number of cases last season.  It is intended that permits for the assembly of seed wheat in the 1942-43 season will be granted only to persons who posses satisfactory storage and cleaning facilities.  Furthermore, and in order to encourage the drying of seed wheat by assemblers, it is proposed that when maximum prices for the sale of seed wheat are being fixed, an adequate margin will be allowed between the price of dried wheat and green wheat.  Certain inducements are being offered to the seed trade for the assembly of a stock of seed wheat of spring varieties.  None but those who are prepared to undertake <Col N="1746" /> the artificial drying of seed wheat to a moisture content not exceeding 15 per cent. will be allowed to participate in this scheme.  Finally, it will be an offence for any person to sell or offer for sale as seed any wheat the germination of which at the time of sale or offer for sale is less than 85 per cent.</P>

Cannot two hours be provided for a discussion of this motion and could we not arrange now to give these two hours to-day or to-morrow?  I suggest that the arrangement announced by the Minister is made with the deliberate intention of preventing this motion from being discussed.  If the Minister intends to provide an opportunity for the discussion of Deputy Hughes' motion, let it be announced now that two hours will be given to-morrow for it.

I then made provision for its being taken following an Estimate that had already been two days under discussion in this House.  Surely it was a fairly safe assumption that on the third day the three hours provided would be available for the discussion of that motion? It so happened, however, that the Estimate took three full days.  For the second time inside the same week, the week following the receipt of the request for time, I am giving an opportunity to this House to take that motion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, in discussing the motion to refer back this Vote for reconsideration, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins drew attention to the distribution, and I think the price, of bicycle tyres and tubes.  The Minister asked Deputy O'Higgins whether the prices that had been fixed were too low.  As a matter of fact, speaking very seriously about this matter, the prices that are fixed may be too low. We must first, of course, draw a distinction between fixed prices and controlled <Col N="1751" /> prices, because there is no sense in sleeping behind a hedge of fixed prices, and pretending that all is well, if we are not able to control those prices.  The case has been made by some people who deal in commodities which are at the moment in short supply, such as bicycle tyres, that they cannot live on the very meagre trade they are carrying on at the moment. It may be a much wiser thing for the Minister, in fixing prices, to have regard to that.  Instead of fixing a price which may possibly represent the value of the article, it might be better if he would fix a price which more nearly approaches a figure that could be stabilised as the controlled price, because the real danger, when the Minister fixes a price of, say, 5/- for a bicycle tyre, is that it will not be sold at that price; it will be sold at possibly three times that price.  Because of the very restricted supply of those articles, the dealers feel that they are entitled to a price which will give them some kind of a living.  They go outside the fixed price then, and charge any price they can get.  I put it up to the Minister that he ought to have regard to that; it might be quite wise to fix the price higher than the value of the article, in order that the price can be controlled at that figure, because there is no use in fixing prices if we are not able to control them. There is a very big difference indeed between fixing prices and controlling prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, I do not think anything could be worse for the Minister, for the Government, or for the institutions of the State, than that we should adopt an attitude of complacency, adopt the attitude that we have done the right thing, that the machine is working, and that our fixed prices are being adhered to, while at the same time prices are running riot all over the country.  There are, of course, in every part of the country fairly big traders who have a good turnover, and who have religiously observed the fixed prices.  I should like to take the opportunity of paying a compliment to those people, but I am afraid they are very much in the minority.  If we allow a situation to arise in this country which <Col N="1752" /> is an inducement to people to be dishonest&mdash;and it is dishonesty&mdash;if we allow a situation to develop which is an inducement to people to act immorally&mdash;and it is immoral&mdash;and if, as I said, we sit down behind what we think is a secure hedge of fixed prices, allowing all those things to go on outside, then we are certainly putting ourselves in a position in which not alone will we not be able to control prices, but we will not be able to control anything in the country; we will ourselves be controlled by circumstances and conditions.  That will eventually result, possibly firstly, in the overthrow of the present Government. That might not be such a disaster, indeed, but if people do not get satisfaction, if people see all around them demoralisation and dishonesty setting in, while the Government and the Dáil stand quietly by and allow that to go on, then you will have the people looking for a solution by some other means.  You will have the people looking for some other type of institution which will give them justice and satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has taken any steps whatever with regard to the conservation of supplies of iron for agricultural purposes, including horseshoes?  Has the matter ever caused him any concern?  We have been driven back to the horse. Possibly, that is not a bad thing at all for this country, but it entails the use of an amount of iron which we have not been accustomed to providing for some years past.  Rubber is on the restricted list, too.  Again, that will cause very heavy inroads on our supplies of iron, because iron will be used for the wheels of vehicles.  There is a very great danger of a shortage, and I do not know whether the Minister has taken any steps whatever to see that iron is retained in the country.  An allegation was made here some time ago, and I think there was justification for it, that there was a very large export of scrap iron of a particular type from this country.  I do not know whether or not that has been stopped. There was also an allegation that representations were being made to the Minister and to the Government that this particular type of scrap iron could <Col N="1753" /> not be used in this country, but according to my information that was merely a blind by the people concerned in order that they could go on exporting that iron and getting a good price for it.  If that particular trade has not stopped completely, the Minister should see to it that it will stop, or we may find that our agricultural industry will come to a standstill.  All our agricultural implements require iron and steel.  Horseshoes require iron, and practically all our vehicles will require it in another year or two if the war continues.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister in the difficulties he has to contend with.  I am sure that, if he makes an effort to grapple boldly with the situation, he will get the assistance of every person in this House and of every person in the country.  But if the Minister is going to pretend that he has the situation in hand, that he is in fact controlling prices when the people know he is not controlling prices, that he has control of supplies when in fact he has not control of supplies, then the Minister is only putting himself and the Government and the institutions of this State in jeopardy. I do not think there are very many people in the cities and towns who understand the position with regard to supplies in the outlying country districts. I do not think anybody in the cities or towns appreciates that there are families in the country who have not got a cup of tea for weeks.  No attempt is being made to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared helpless the other day when he told us that the supply was in the hands of the wholesalers, many of whom were outside the country.  Can no attempt be made to provide for some kind of national pool into which the tea can be put, so that traders will be able to supply tea in respect of their tea cards?  It is an extraordinary thing, which very few people realise, that there is no relation whatever between the tea cards the retailer down the country holds and the supply of tea he gets, and there never has been any relation.  It all depends <Col N="1754" /> upon circumstances which are at the moment outside the control of the tea retailer.  He may possibly have laid in a supply of tea just at the wrong moment in 1939, or 1938, and he may be just outside the period in respect of which the percentage supply is allowed, with the result that he gets little or no tea.  In addition, as I pointed out last night, there are thrown on his books scores of customers who dealt with the travelling shop which has now ceased to travel, with the result that these people who dealt with such travelling shops have now no tea and can get none.  I have a letter in my pocket at the moment, and I was in communication with the Department to-day, in respect of supplies of tea to a lady who owns a shop out in the country.  She gets as much tea per month as supplies her customers for one week and a half, and that has continued since the tea ration started.</P>
    <P>Some attempt must be made to grapple with such situations.  If no attempt is made, I know what is going to happen, and if it were the Minister or the Government alone was blamed, it would not be so bad, but it is going to fall upon the State and upon the institutions of the State.  I appeal to the Minister to endeavour to set up some kind of a national pool for tea, so that a householder may go in with her ration card and get her tea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before it is set up, there will be no tea at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain supply of tea seems to be coming in pretty regularly so far, but the distribution of it is the trouble.  We cannot blame the retailers. There are some unscrupulous retailers who are taking advantage of the situation, and in that respect there is a very great danger.  There has come across the Border a certain amount of tea which has cost a price much in excess of the fixed price, and, of course, when these people sell that tea, they demand and get an exorbitant price for it.  That, in itself, is not so bad, but there are some unscrapalous people who are taking advantage of the situation and selling <Col N="1755" /> at black market prices what is, in the ordinary way, rationed tea, and not giving their customers their tea ration. I have had instances of that.</P>
      <P>The whole scheme of things at present is outside the control of anybody. It is lending itself to all types of dishonest transactions, as most of the things this Government took in hand did, from the time of the cattle licences down to the present day.  We must have control.  There is no use in pretending that we have fixed prices.  We may have fixed prices, but they are not being observed.  If the Minister thinks they are, let him or his agent go out and try to buy something. Let him go down the city and try to buy a bicycle or a bicycle tyre &mdash;he had better not go in person because he will probably be known&mdash; and let him see what the result will be. It might be much better for the Minister in fixing prices of that nature to fix them at a high level, so that there might be a chance of their being observed.</P>
      <P>On the whole, this question of supply and of fixed and controlled prices has not been grappled with at all.  There is a pretence that we are controlling a situation which we are in fact not controlling.  We have either to control it properly, or take our hands off altogether.  This type of midway interference is causing quite an amount of annoyance to decent retailers and annoyance and discouragement to people who cannot get their supplies.  It is exasperating, and it is merely driving the people to courses which I am afraid will not be good for the Government or the institutions of the State.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan when he says it behoves every Deputy and every citizen to appreciate the fact that the Minister for Supplies has one of the most difficult tasks of any Minister of State at present.  I do not think there are many people in the country who are under any illusion about that fact.  They all recognise his difficulties, and they all recognise that, do his best, he is not in a position to provide everybody with <Col N="1756" /> 100 per cent. of what they want, or of what they were getting pre-war.  Nobody expects that he should, but I think that, if we understand his position, and endeavour to make allowances for the difficulties with which he is confronted, he on his side should realise that nobody in the country is asking for miracles or hoping for miracles.  All they are asking for is commonsense, and it is when commonsense is not displayed that the people evince irritation and exasperation, as they very frequently have done and as each one of us in this House must have at one time or another experienced ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the censorship has operated to make a very large number of our people, and indeed a large number of Deputies, labour under the delusion that the war is being fought on some distant planet, and that really this country should not experience any serious repercussions from what is going on in the world; but I think that at least one ray of light is beginning to shine in the Stygian darkness of the Fianna Fáil mind, that is, that the national self-sufficiency they were so fond of in their salad days is not as happy a state of affairs as they thought it was going to be.  They are now experiencing about 50 per cent. national self-sufficiency, and their lamentations are heard upon the breeze.  They are hellbent for 90 per cent. national self-sufficiency in the course of the next 12 months, and, judging by appearances, they will make the welkin ring when they get it.  But for what we are getting from Great Britain at present&mdash; carried to Britain in British ships by British sailors, and convoyed by British warships, and then forwarded to us&mdash; we would be experiencing 85 per cent. national self-sufficiency at this moment, and the boys would not like it, although they have been clamouring for it for the last 15 years.  I wonder do the Fianna Fáil Party realise that this is national self-sufficiency?  This is a handsome instalment, delivered to them by the Government of the Third Reich, of national self-sufficiency. Hitler has got for them what they could not get for themselves, and they do not like it.  Will they preserve this wisdom <Col N="1757" /> that they have acquired, because if they do it will be a very small patch of silver lining on the dark clouds that are hanging over this country at the present time?</P>
    <P>I hear a number of comments and criticisms in respect of the individual follies of the Minister at the present time.  Has it not occurred to this House that the common source of most of these follies is that the Minister's familiarity, in the last ten years, with the tariff racketeers has persuaded him that everybody who goes into his Department is a rogue?  The Minister has met so many rogues and done business with so many rogues during the past ten years, he has found out that so many people who went to him with glib professions of enthusiastic patriotism, were thinking only of their own interests, were simply bent on lining their own pockets, and were nothing more or less than rogues, that every genuine person now is received in the Department of Supplies as if he were a rogue.  Now, honest men do not like to be treated as if they are rogues.  When they go to the Department of Supplies in connection with a licence, or some such matter, and state their business, they do not like to have it said to them: &ldquo;What you are saying is one thing, but what you mean is another.&rdquo;  That is good enough for the tariff racketeers, and it is probably true of the tariff racketeers, but it is time that the Minister for Supplies woke up to the fact that he is no longer the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealing with racketeers&mdash; racketeers of his own making, racketeers of his own political household. The Department of Supplies has brought him into contact with the honest men of this country, and they are entitled to be treated as honest men.  They do not want to be lumped together with the racketeers.  They do not want to be treated with the cynical tolerance which the Minister has shown to the racketeers.  They want to be treated with the common respect that is due to decent men, who come of decent people, and who are not afraid to have their lineage investigated.</P>
    <P>That is one of the Minister's great <Col N="1758" /> difficulties.  He is suspicious of everyone. He thinks that everyone is trying to double-cross him.  He will not take advice from anybody giving him disinterested advice any longer, and, signs on it, he stumbles into the most egregious errors.  Just imagine a Minister of State, in the present condition of the world, addressing letters to the doctors in this city, one of whom is resident in 13 Parnell Square, and who was asked what was his car doing outside 12 Parnell Square Would anyone outside of Bedlam believe that the Minister for Supplies, who is supposed to be working 14 hours a day, could find the time and the staff to conduct correspondence of that kind?  And he conducts it because the fact that that doctor holds a permit from him leads the Minister to believe, from his own experience of the racketeers, that coming into contact with him implied that the doctor is a rogue, must be treated as a rogue, and checked up on as if he were a rogue.  These doctors are not tariff racketeers.  They are honest, professional men, getting on with their job, trying to serve their patients to the best of their ability, and as to 99 per cent. of them, if they say: &ldquo;Whatever instructions you may give us, with regard to permits or anything else, those instructions will be carried out in the spirit&rdquo;, that is very much more important than the mere observance of such instructions in the letter, when every possible opportunity is taken to drive a coach and four through these regulations by those who would cheerfully ignore the spirit of whatever undertaking they have given.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got into the habit here in the House of getting up quite blandly and saying: &ldquo;I will take the licence off anybody that I suspect.&rdquo; Now, let us pause here for a moment. If this doctrine is to remain unchallenged, I say, most deliberately, that the principles of the secret police of Europe are being carried into this State.  The whole basis of the operations of the Ogpu in Russia, of the Gestapo in Germany, of the secret police in Italy, is that a man is not afforded an opportunity of standing his trial in open court.  He is dragged in <Col N="1759" /> on suspicion, and condemned without being afforded any opportunity of knowing the actual charge that is made against him and defending himself before an impartial judge against that charge.  Now, some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies are going to say: &ldquo;Have we not the I.R.A. locked up in Arbour Hill?&rdquo;  Yes, we have members of the I.R.A. locked up in Arbour Hill, but the reason is that they refused to recognise the courts of this country.  If these gentlemen, whom it has become necessary to lock up under the various Public Safety Acts that were passed in this country, had gone before the courts, honestly stood their trial, and let it be known that they were prepared to accept the verdict of a jury of their fellow-countrymen and the sentence of a judge properly constituted by law, there would have been no necessity to lock them up in Arbour Hill in that way.  These people, however, denied the authority of the courts, refused to plead, threatened the juries, and said that they would murder the judges.  In face of that conspiracy, this House consented to the suspension of the ordinary common law with profound reluctance, and on that precedent the Minister for Supplies comes along and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am entitled to go to any law-abiding citizen and say: &lsquo;You have done something which gives me ground for suspicion, and, therefore, I will take your means of livelihood away from you, and you may be very grateful that I accord you the privilege of having an interview with a junior civil servant, who will hear you, weigh your evidence, prosecute you, and then condemn you.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Now, why should an ordinary, honest businessman in this country be put in that position?  Why should he have to go before some little jumped-up junior civil servant in Earlsfort Terrace or Ballsbridge, and what right has such a person to pass judgment on the simplest country publican in this country?  The courts are there.  They were established to protect him and the likes of him&mdash;simple people from down the country&mdash;against the tyranny of an Executive.  The courts were designed <Col N="1760" /> in order to provide, in the majesty of the law, a deterrent to the power of an Executive which sought to oppress the humble citizen, and the only chance that the ordinary citizen in the street has against the power of the Executive is to invoke the courts of law which have an equal power, majesty and strength.  It is all very well: if the bureaucrats attack a member of this House, he can fight; but take the case of the ordinary citizen down the country, who gets a manifesto telling him to appear before the Department of Supplies, what recourse has he?  He has to go, in fear and trembling, and submit his whole means of livelihood to the scrutiny and judgment of one civil servant, who can then issue a fiat wiping him out, putting him out of business, not on the reasonable grounds of knowing that he had broken the law, but because he has given some ground to some member of the Department of Supplies to suspect that he departed in some particular from the conditions of some licence that had been given to him by the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>Now, does Dáil Éireann approve of that doctrine?  I do not, and I want to make this perfectly clear.  I do not under-estimate the Minister's difficulty in the present situation, but unless he is prepared to disown the principle that he has enunciated: that he is entitled to withdraw from men their means of livelihood merely on suspicion, I intend to challenge a vote on this Estimate, and let every Deputy here realise that if he goes into the Lobby to vote on this Estimate, he goes in in defence of a proposition that the ordinary citizen of this country can be stripped of his livelihood because he has given a civil servant reasonable grounds for suspecting that he has committed a breach of some particular regulation.</P>
    <P>Now, mind you, I do not want to lay that exclusively on the motor car. The practice has grown up here of going down the country and taking a licence from a miller.  Somebody goes into a mill and finds a state of affairs obtaining there which leads him to suspect that, within the course of the <Col N="1761" /> last week, some cereal was ground there that should not have been ground there.  No prosecution is started, and no effort is made to bring this man before the courts of law and adduce evidence to satisfy the court that he has been guilty of committing some breach of the law.  Instead, he finds on the following morning that his milling licence is withdrawn.  Do the members of this House realise what that means?  Do they realise that the miller is not only constrained to conform to written conditions but that an authorised officer of the Department can go down and amplify the written conditions imposed upon the miller by verbal instructions?  If the Minister then is given reasonable grounds for suspecting that there has been a breach by the miller of the verbal instructions given him by an authorised officer of the Department, the Minister may take away his licence, put his mill out of business, deprive that man of his livelihood and, so far as I know, that man has no recourse whatever.  That is fantastic and ought to be stopped.  The Minister ought to answer to this House for that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more vile than the tyranny imposed upon people by their own neighbours.  Any of us can bear oppression if it is the oppression of a foreigner, because that is all you expect from a foreigner.  You can fight him with a full heart, but if you have got to fight your own neighbours for the right to live, then life ceases to be worth living, and national independence becomes a sham.  I would sooner have a German, a Russian, or any other tyrant in this country than have an Irish Government playing the part of a tyrant here.  If I could make Deputies realise that liberties have been lost in nearly every country in the world by a slow decline of this character, by failing to note the first encroachment on that fundamental principle, I would have served some useful purpose in speaking in Dáil Eireann to-day, but what terrifies me is that so few seem to realise it.  There is no difference in the world between taking a licence from a miller in that manner and making serious inroads on <Col N="1762" /> individual liberty.  The humblest citizen of this State is as much entitled to the protection of the courts as the biggest shot in Ireland, and the proceedings of the Minister for Supplies are directed towards denying a humble citizen of this State the protection which, under the Constitution, he is entitled to.  The cruel thing is that the Minister cannot do that kind of thing to a member of Dáil Eireann because we have got this public forum from which to speak.</P>
    <P>We have got the experience and would know how to tackle him if he attempted such outrages on our individual liberty, but an individual down the country, threatened with an attempt of that character, is constrained to say to himself: &ldquo;I must cave in because if I fight he will simply crush me, and it is within his power to do so, because the power of the courts to intervene in my defence has been abrogated with the consent and approval of Oireachtas Eireann.&rdquo;  I beg and implore the members of this House to make it quite clear that that abrogation will not take place with our consent, and that whatever orders, rules and regulations are made must be enforced through the instrumentality of the courts so long as the citizens against whom they are directed are prepared, loyally, to accept the verdict of the courts, and to say that the only grounds upon which we will withdraw from any citizen, great or humble, the fullest recourse to the courts are when that citizen challenges the authority of the courts or denies the validity of the lawfully-established Government of this country.</P>
    <P>I want now to approach another aspect of the situation.  I deliberately say that the operations of the Department of Supplies are having the effect of forcing thousands of men, to whom the idea of breaking the law is nauseating, into the position of law-breakers for two reasons.  The first is that you cannot find out what the law is because the Minister for Supplies publishes such a multiplicity of Orders that you cannot ascertain with precision on any given day what the existing state of the law is.  It has become the practice <Col N="1763" /> of the Department to publish in the newspapers a résumé of the Orders and then to say that these Orders will be available shortly at the Stationery Office.  An Order, commonly, is not available at the Stationery Office for a month or six weeks after it has been made.  The average citizen knows the general tenor of the Order but, in regard to its details, they are not to be found in the published notice, and are only to be found in the official Order published by the Stationery Office.  That is peculiarly true of price Orders.</P>
    <P>You will frequently have a price Order made in which a retail price per stone is fixed&mdash;the price of the wholesaler to the retailer and of the importer to the wholesaler.  These prices are fixed, but sometimes the problem arises at once&mdash;what are you to charge per lb. for that commodity?  You find that the price per lb., calculated at the stone rate, does not work out in any mensuration of the coinage, and you do not know whether you are bound to charge a farthing per lb. more or less.  For five or six weeks you are left waiting to find out what the true state of the law is.  Again, you will get a case in which provision is made for a wholesaler to charge so much per cwt. for a special commodity. Of course, the bureaucrats in Earlsfort Terrace quite forget that, in rural Ireland, the bulk of the wholesale trade is done in stones and half-stones between the small roadside shop and the comparatively large wholesaler in the country towns.  There is no means of determining what the price is to be per stone, and eventually, when you ask the Minister in this House what is the price to be per stone, you discover that it bears no relation whatever to the fixed price per cwt.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's difficulties, but I imagine that he could find a group of men who would advise him in regard to the conditions of trade obtaining in rural Ireland.  They are far different from the conditions obtaining in Dublin and Cork.  The Minister would find in his own Party men like Senator McEllin, as well as several Deputies here present, who <Col N="1764" /> have some experience of business in rural Ireland and who could tell him in a thrice how these things are done in rural Ireland.  If he wants help from me, or from any member of the House who has experience in these things, I am perfectly sure that all he has to do is to ask that a Parliamentary Committee be set up to review these Orders and point out to him any obvious discrepancies in them.  But his failure to have any discussion of that kind has resulted in men, who have taken pride in the fact that they would sooner see their premises burned to the ground than that a black market price should be charged by them, waking up one morning to discover that they have not only charged a black market price themselves, but constrained their employees to do the same thing.  To me that is one of the most undesirable and regrettable developments which has confronted us so far, because, as Deputy Brennan said, if that practice becomes widespread, and if decent men through the country are commonly known to their neighbours to be engaged in blackmarket activities, they will not get the charitable benefit of the doubt, but their neighbours will say that they took a chance, and thus the whole standard of conduct which should rule a community is proportionately lowered.  It is easy to lower standards of conduct, but it is difficult to raise them up again.</P>
    <P>A second source of great hardship to law-abiding members of the community throughout the country is the imposition by the Department of Supplies of impossible conditions.  Take the case of an old-established firm in a country town.  The proprietors of that firm, if they ever considered their position, said to themselves sometime: &ldquo;The only justification for our existence is that we provide the community in which we are living with amenities that the community would not have if we were not here.  We are doing this distributing job a bit better than anybody else and it is for that reason that our customers are paying us a profit.&rdquo;  Therefore such an establishment prides itself on making available to customers at all times all available <Col N="1765" /> commodities which would be useful to them.  Comes the time when that establishment finds itself without oatmeal. It cannot get oatmeal to be sold at 4/2 a stone.  It will not go on the black market, because that is against the law, and it says to its customers: &ldquo;There is no oatmeal.&rdquo;  But there is no oatmeal because no oatmeal miller can get oats at the fixed price of 10/8 per cwt.  The miller who is a licensed miller dare not pay more than 10/8 a cwt. lest he should lose his licence. The miller comes to the shopkeeper and says: &ldquo;We have no oatmeal because we cannot get oats at the fixed price.  We cannot get oats and therefore we cannot mill oatmeal.&rdquo; The responsible merchant says to his customer: &ldquo;I am sorry we cannot give you any oatmeal.  There is no oatmeal to be got.&rdquo;  Then a neochán sets up in a shop across the street and hangs out a big notice: &ldquo;Oatmeal for sale,&rdquo; and the person who has the old-established house and has prided himself upon supplying everything reasonably demanded of him for 100 years, has to send his customers over to the neochán to buy oatmeal from him at a black market price in the certain knowledge that when the black market is stopped the neochán will fold up and disappear and send all the customers back to buy oatmeal at the regulated price from the old-established merchant who must forever after hang his head, because now instead of being a useful member of his community who discharged a useful service, he has become a kind of parasite who only has supplies when everybody else has them, and which, in a time of difficulty and stress, but for the neochán, we would have to go without.</P>
    <P>Is not that exasperating?  Can you blame a responsible businessman who says in face of that situation: &ldquo;Life ceases to be worth living?  What is the use of talking of a Minister for Supplies when the neochán is allowed to carry on his black market operations without any interference whatever? The Guards, the inspectors, and everybody else see the big placard: &ldquo;Oatmeal for sale&rdquo;; they know he is charging 7/6 a stone for it, but nobody interferes.  I do not blame him because it is much better to get oatmeal <Col N="1766" /> even at 7/6 a stone for the people than not to have oatmeal at all.  The man who will not break the law is held up to public odium as a common parasite because he cannot deliver the goods.  Is that right?  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to insist on either of two things: If oatmeal is to be sold at 4/2 per stone that it will not be sold by anybody, neochán or merchant, at any other price; if he once makes up his mind that it is no longer possible to get oatmeal at 4/2 a stone, he should take the control off oats and let us all get into the oatmeal business so that competition may provide for the people oatmeal at the lowest price at which it is possible to get it.</P>
    <P>I can tell exactly the same story about barley meal for pig feeding and about cotton thread.  I know a case of a firm which prided itself on never having sold anything relating to the black market which found itself confronted with a situation that it had not a reel of thread in the place, but a few hucksters, who never sold cotton thread before, were charging 1/2 and 1/4 a reel for cotton thread they bought from the smugglers.  Finally, in despair, that responsible merchant was obliged to have recourse to the smuggler and buy cotton thread and put it up for sale at 1/- and 10d., because that represented a fair profit on the price that had to be paid to the smugglers.</P>
    <P>The moral I want to draw is this: It is lawful for the merchant to go to the smuggler in order to bring down the price of the reel of thread to the public.  But it is not lawful for the merchant to go to the black market for oats.  I am suggesting to the Minister that restrictions of that kind, which make the conduct of honest business virtually impossible, ought to be reviewed and abolished so that those who are trying to serve their communities as merchants will be allowed to give their communities good value for the profits they earn out of them, and not allow a situation to develop in which honest men, who are attempting to abide by the law and maintain a decent standard of conduct, will be forced into becoming law-breakers before their own neighbours and employees, <Col N="1767" /> thus putting a patina of respectability on that which ought to stink in the nostrils of every decent man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to intervene now on a small point?  In the vehemence of his speech the Deputy referred to &ldquo;a jumped-up civil servant.&rdquo;  The Minister and not the Civil Service is answerable to the Dáil for administration of his Department.  The Chair, therefore, deprecates the use of the term applied by the Deputy to members of the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to withdraw the term.  It ill-becomes any Deputy to make any reflection on civil servants. There are few Deputies more beholden than I am to that body for their courtesy and assistance on divers occasions that I have trespassed on their kindness.  If the observation is deemed to be a reflection on them, I gladly withdraw it.  Perhaps I should explain that it sometimes happens, with the extensive delegation of authority, that a responsible citizen finds himself confronted by a junior member, or somebody who appears to be a junior member of the public service, and feels that he has been put upon in that he has been put on trial by somebody for whom he has a paternal regard rather than a dutiful filial respect.</P>
      <P>I want now to turn to this controversial matter of the rationing of drapery.  In turning to it, I would venture, from the detached position I now occupy, to address an appeal both to the Minister and to those responsible in the drapery trade to exercise a charitable restraint towards one another.  I have no doubt that feelings on both sides to this controversy have been ruffled.  No useful purpose can be served by the Minister further ruffling the drapers or the drapers ruffling the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister or any other Deputy will deny that his failure to make it manifest that he was ready and willing to meet the drapers at <Col N="1768" /> once after the rationing Order was made was a grave error of judgment on his part.  He gave legitimate offence, caused grievous misunderstandings, and probably gave rise to much unnecessary altercation.  It now is manifest that the Minister, in fixing 52 coupons, was not slow to think better of that decision and to increase it to the very generous level of 78. Whether he has not been thinking better of that decision since he made it is something that I leave to speculators to determine.  He will, I think, readily sympathise with traders in the country when they protest if, on Monday, you declare that 52 coupons are enough, and on Wednesday you announce that you are ready to give 78, to be used before October if anyone wants to use them.  The trader is surely entitled to say that this is evidence of confusion of mind, and it causes us, who are in the trade, consternation and alarm.</P>
    <P>But the fact remains that it is common knowledge to us all that rationing of clothing and drapery is a necessity. There are certain types of drapery and clothing which are running out, and, if the traders and the Minister will get together and pursue the line they have been pursuing for the last few days, of exempting certain classes of articles from the whole rationing scheme, where possible, and reducing the number of coupons in respect of other commodities, where that is more desirable, I believe a very satisfactory working agreement can be wrought between them.  I think all will agree as to the necessity of some kind of a rationing system, the details of which it should be possible to adjust in a peaceable and friendly atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I think it right to issue this note of warning to the Minister.  He may not be conscious of it himself, but he is, intentionally or unintentionally, responsible for a good deal of ruffied feeling, and it is his duty to exercise a patience and forbearance now, until calm and peace are restored, which might not be expected of him if he had not made the initial mistake of vacillating and allowing a misunderstanding to arise as to his readiness to meet <Col N="1769" /> the traders.  May I make this suggestion to him?  A great deal of valuable trade is done in many shops with passing customers.  In my young days this was described as the haberdashery trade, and it involved small sundries, which would be gathered in one department and which would come under the heading of haberdashery.  This would be known in other departments as an ancillary branch to the main line of goods catered for.  I suggest the coupon system destroys that trade.</P>
    <P>No customer will take up a trifle and put it in her bag casually if she finds she will have to contribute coupons in order to purchase it.  Therefore, if the Minister could see his way in regard to the whole trade to exclude articles of haberdashery altogether from the rationing scheme, and say that no coupons will be required for them, I think he will restore to the trade, and particularly to the small shopkeepers, a very valuable part of the business. I would not blame the Minister if he went on to say now: &ldquo;I am taking these things out of the coupon category altogether, but I will give notice that, as from the 1st November or the 1st January, no more of these commodities will be manufactured, but whatever stocks are in existence there is no purpose served by letting them rot on the shelves or get dirty and become second-hand.  It is better to put them into consumption and let the shopkeepers get whatever profit they can out of them rather than have them sold out later as so much rubbish.&rdquo;  I do not think any serious harm would be done if commodities like neckties and scarves and things of that type that would not matter if they vanished off the market were to disappear from the point of view of the consuming public.  They are things that the public could do without.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to ask me for a category of what should be included in the exemption list, I would give him one list, a draper in Grafton Street would give him another, and perhaps a draper in Capel Street would give quite a different list.  I hope the Minister will not take it amiss if I salute him as a fellow-member of the trade.  He will remember, from his <Col N="1770" /> experience, as I can remember from my own, the requirements and the suitability of certain articles in various parts of the city.  I am sure that within the next fortnight or three weeks the Minister could get a representative list, thus securing to large numbers of assistants their positions, and to drapers their livelihoods. These are the people who will suffer seriously if that class of stock is left to perish on their hands.  Let me not depart from that subject without asking the Minister to exercise forbearance and patience over and above what may be demanded of him during the negotiations with the trade; otherwise we may have another hullabaloo and everyone will be worse off, and certainly no one will be any better off.</P>
    <P>I want to pass to a matter which relates to the whole of Ireland.  The most controversial politician cannot disguise the fact that the rationing of flour has gone a long way to remove the acute difficulties that existed prior to that decision.  But this fact remains, that the flour problem in rural Ireland, while it has been at all times a quantitative problem, has also been and still is a problem of distribution.  It is perfectly true that the increased quantities of flour let out recently have greatly improved the circumstances of the large family that was a regular customer of a licensed flour seller, but it has done little or nothing to relieve the condition of the woman who has seven or eight children, who lives on the side of a country road and who habitually dealt with the travelling shop which is, however, no longer travelling through her neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>She has no recourse.  She goes into a local town and goes from shop to shop asking for flour.  The merchants say to her: &ldquo;We would be glad to give it to you, but if we give it to you we must withhold it from somebody who is consistently dealing with us in fair and foul weather, and you cannot ask us to do that.&rdquo;  I have seen this happening. I have seen a woman coming to me whom I knew to be a respectable woman with four or five young children. I knew she was dealing with a travelling shop.  I did not blame her. She had those little children and <Col N="1771" /> lived far from the town, and it would be very awkward for her to come into town, and out of the question for her to come every Friday, the market day. She told me that she had not had flour in the house for a week.  I asked her why she did not get it from the man from whom she had been in the habit of getting it.  She said that he came in a lorry from Tubbercurry, 17 miles away, and that she could not walk to Tubbercurry.  She had been in Charlestown and Ballaghaderreen, and had gone from shop to shop, and nobody would give her flour.  All the merchants had said if they gave it to her they would have to take it from somebody else.  She asked me what she would do.  I did not know what to say to her, and I have never been able to get the Minister for Supplies to tell me what he would say to a woman in that position. Would the Minister for Supplies tell me now what he would say to her? I told her to write to the Minister for Supplies and see what could be done, but so far I know nothing has been done, and I do not see what the Minister could do in the absence of a rationing system.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in dealing with Dublin, with which he is familiar, says the difficulties of rationing flour are almost insuperable and bound to give rise to grave inequality.  I can sympathise with that view prevailing in the mind of a man who is thinking only of Dublin or a place like Cork, or, possibly, Dundalk.  But we who live in rural Ireland, see little or no difficulty arising out of rationing.  We are all on an equal footing in rural Ireland. The difference between one neighbour and another is small, and if we all got the same ration of flour there would be no serious hardship for anybody.  But, at present, what is happening?  The majority of people are getting enough since the extra distribution has been made, but the small minority are getting none at all.  I find it terribly difficult to persuade myself that I have carried conviction to the Minister for Supplies in regard to that matter.  I know people at this minute&mdash;I could name a woman now; she is as clear as crystal in my mind&mdash;who is bringing cold potatoes to her husband <Col N="1772" /> in the bog and sending three children to school with cold potatoes in their hands.  Is not that true?  Do not other Deputies know of cases of that kind? I am not saying that that is the rule, but I am saying that cases of that kind are existing, and the only solution I can see for it is to provide that woman and every other woman with a ration card which would entitle her to come into the shopkeeper and to demand her flour as a right and not to ask it as a favour.  That will operate to draw the surplus flour away from the travelling shopkeeper, who is no longer travelling, and give it to the stationary merchant for allocation to the ration card holder who is registered with him.</P>
    <P>I say deliberately that, sooner or later, that thing will have to be done because next year we are going to have a situation in which the flour problem will be not only one of distribution but of quantity as well.  There is going to be a shortage of flour in this country next year unless we have a ration system operated while there is still approximately enough to go round.  I do not care to think what will happen if we have to introduce rationing on a basis of a very meagre supply for everyone.  If we get a ration system working while there is still approximately enough for everybody, we can pare it down slowly and organise voluntary exertions on the part of the well-to-do to give part of their flour for the benefit of the less wealthy, to adopt families and give part of their ration to the adopted families, and schemes of that kind. But if we have got to clamp down a rationing system when there are only 2 lbs. of flour per week for all our people I think it would provoke a revolution, whereas if we do it gradually and allow the people slowly to adjust themselves to the situation then I think we will be able to get through our difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan was speaking at length about the difficulty in regard to tea.  My sympathies are with the Minister in regard to tea.  I do not think there is much the Minister can do with regard to tea.  The whole kernel of his problem is that a great part of the tea is supplied to this <Col N="1773" /> country through wholesale distributors who live in London and Belfast.  There would be a lot to be said if you could persuade all these wholesalers to consign all their tea to the Government and then to issue tea cards to everybody. The retail tea merchant could cut off a coupon for an ounce of tea and send it to the Government central distributing bureau, for which he would get a corresponding ounce for the following week to issue to the customer. That would be the ideal plan but I do not think it is going to be possible because I think it is quite likely that some of these wholesale distributors in England or Belfast would stop sending tea if they could not send it to the persons to whom they were sending it in the pre-rationing period, 1938-1939, and it would be very difficult in any case to bring effective pressure on them to honour their obligations if they cut up rusty.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I think that in six months' time&mdash;I do not know if the Minister agrees with me&mdash;there will not be any tea.  I do not see the point of setting up a most elaborate rationing machinery to control the distribution of an article which, according to all human probability, will not be available for distribution at all by the time the system designed to distribute it has been perfected.  We have got to face that.  Personally, I would suffer very acutely if we have no tea but we will have to get along as best we can with coffee, of which we seem to have a fair abundance at the present time.  The sooner we get accustomed to drinking coffee the better it will be.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister is going to ration sugar.  I think that is a prudent and good thing.  I know that at present certain shopkeepers are getting allocations of sugar out of all proportion to the number of tea cards that they hold. I do not know what they are doing with the sugar.  The funny part of it is that in some of these cases I directed the attention of the Department of Supplies to that fact and was instructed by the Department of Supplies by return to increase their quotas and give them still more sugar, <Col N="1774" /> although the Department of Supplies was informed that those people were getting five and six stones of sugar a week although they had in fact only 15 or 16 persons registered with them for tea.  What the explanation of this is, I do not know, but there it is.</P>
    <P>In regard to sugar rationing, I want to make one suggestion.  The Minister is distributing sugar for the preservation of fruit at the present time and his plan, apparently, is to give one stone for the preservation of soft fruit now and two stone in the autumn for the preservation of hard fruit.  If a person has only soft fruit, is it not a great pity to allow that fruit to rot? I see the difficulty that people are liable to make <i>mala fide</i> application for sugar for the preservation of soft fruit when, in fact, they intend to use it for other purposes, but if you are going to give people three stone of sugar sooner or later and they write to you and say: &ldquo;I want all the sugar now because it is soft fruit I am going to preserve,&rdquo; why not give them the three stone?  If they are in bad faith, they will waste the sugar next autumn just as they may waste it now.  I think the vast majority of people who stipulate to get the three stone now genuinely and honestly want it for the preservation of soft fruit which, if not preserved now, will go rotten.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister, if three stone is what he has decided to give to everybody for fruit, he ought to give it now if they want it and in those cases where people are going to use it for hard fruit he could keep the two stone for delivery in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Mulcahy yesterday being very broadminded and reasonable in regard to the Minister for Supplies and I must say the milder he talked the higher my anger rose because Deputy Mulcahy was talking about certain limited quota questions and chastening the Minister very mildly and restrainedly.  Does this House realise that 50 per cent. of our supply difficulties at present result from the fact that that Minister, sitting on the Front Bench of Dáil Eireann, kept the quotas on and would not let us bring in the stuff?  Does the <Col N="1775" /> House realise that there were months and months when we could have bought on credit from Great Britain vital and necessary supplies in this country and Deputy Seán Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce of Éire, would not allow us to bring them in?</P>

That stopped exports from Great Britain and stopped imports into Ireland and made it impossible to get horse-drawn vehicles that we wanted.  The day arrived when they were no longer available.  Deputy Lemass then took off the tariff and said: &ldquo;Now, boys, you can get in all you can.&rdquo;  It reminds me of a person who used to come to a house and who was asked if she liked soup and when she said she did she had to be told there was none.</P>

      <P>There was a prohibitive tariff.  There was an Order designed to prevent the importation of essential commodities.  In this House, 12 months ago, I asked that tariffs should be taken off agricultural machinery on the grounds that there would be a scarcity, and I was told by the Minister for Supplies, the Minister for Agriculture, and I think by Deputy Corish, but certainly by Deputy Allen, that there were plenty of mowing machines and plenty of rakes to be had in Wexford.  There are no horse-drawn rakes to be had to-day, and I do not believe there is a tedder.  I could have got mowing machines from Deerings 12 months ago, but I would not be allowed to bring them in.  There was insistence on maintaining the tariff at such a figure as made it impossible to import them. Then Deerings said that they were no longer interested in the Irish trade, because they could not jump the tariff. We have the situation now that we may not have machines to reap the crops; the manufactures have rationed supplies, and we will have to use sickles until the edges are worn off, and then there will be no files to sharpen them, unless people sharpen them with their teeth.  Thank God for such self-sufficiency !</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about flannelette?  There is not a merchant in this country who can get a yard of flannelette.  There is not a countrywoman in Ireland who did not from time to time buy flannelette.  Who stopped flannelette coming to this country from Great Britain?  Was it the big bad wolf?  It was not.  It was Deputy Seán Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce for Éire, or his predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, who was then Minister for that Department.  From other benches I protested most emphatically against the imposition of that quota, and I told the Minister on that occasion that the day would come when he would regret it, because no supplies would be available. Who put the quota on calico? Was it the big bad wolf?  It was not. It was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who would not allow merchants to bring in calico.  What is made from calico?  Is it ball dresses? <Col N="1777" /> Is it fashionable costumes for the races?  No, it is the shifts and night-dresses that the women of this country require, and they will not have these garments because the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not let drapers bring in the wherewithal to make them.  That sounds damn funny for Deputies but country women have to live and it is not all that can be seen outside that is important when they go to market, but what makes the difference between reasonable comfort and intolerable inconvenience.  If it is made impossible for them to get cotton for their husbands' underwear so that they may have a change after laborious work they will be inconvenienced and life in rural Ireland for those working on the land will be made impossible. Those who have been brought up in Dublin do not understand that position. Those of us who live amongst the country people do.  People who left the country 30 years ago and who have since lived in Dublin know that what I am saying is a fact.</P>
    <P>Is there not a quota on boots and shoes at present?  Does the House know that unless a trader is a registered boot and shoe merchant he could not bring in a single pair?  He must be on the register of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is no free imports of these articles, and I say that there will be rationing of boots and shoes before six months passes.  Does anybody deny that there is a quota on boots and shoes now? A licence can be got to bring in any quantity that is wanted, provided the trader is registered, but if he is not he must depend on the enterprise of the wholesaler and if he is not doing his job the trader can go without.  An order cannot be sent to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Let this House realise that 50 per cent. of our present shortage is due to the fact that from 1939 to 1942 a system of tariffs and quotas was imposed which prevented the importation of goods we require. Had we been allowed to bring in goods to the value of £75,000,000 or £100,000,000 during 1939 and 1940, we would have acquired liabilities in Great Britain which we could now be discharging with the export surplus which we enjoy on the present balance of <Col N="1778" /> trade with Great Britain.  For that export surplus we would have tangible assets which we could use.  As a result of the activities of the Minister for Supplies during these years we have an export surplus going to Great Britain and we are getting for it pieces of paper with which we can buy nothing. We should have in this country now a stock of goods piled as high as Leinster House.  We should have in Great Britain debts that would stagger creation.  We should have in Great Britain at the present time every loan and borrowing we could effect for the purpose of securing goods, and we could reduce that liability month after month with the useless paper that is now coming home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, deplored the fact that £3,500,000 was being sent back here every year from our neighbours.  Thanks be to God the boys who are sending that money, home had somewhere to go, because devil a much they would have earned under Fianna Fáil self-sufficiency. They would be walking the country roads here as tramps with their toes out of their boots because they could not get jobs.  They are earning in England and if we had not a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; Government, with their earnings we could redeem the debts that foresighted men would have contracted, in order to ensure that our people would have supplies without which we cannot get on, and without which a very serious problem confronts us in the next 12 months.  Why should the Government make it impossible to do that? Does the Minister want smuggled goods to be coming here or does he not?  I remember, when the smuggling of flour, began, I said that it was dishonourable and mean to encourage our people to go in and steal from the British supplies they so badly wanted.  If we choose to sit back and be neutral in this war, the least we can do is not to constitute ourselves a burden on the backs of those who are defending us as well as themselves. If we want them to do the fighting and to bear all the heat and burden of the day, the least we should do is not to steal in by the back door and take what they have paid for in blood <Col N="1779" /> and toil.  When the people of Britain are down in the bowels of the earth, being hammered by bombs from aeroplanes, we should not steal from their children the food they require to sustain their strength.  That view did not commend itself to the Minister.  He asked, in relation to the flour which was coming in: &ldquo;Do you expect me to stop it,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;I am glad to see it coming in from anywhere.&rdquo; That is his conception of <i>noblesse oblige</i> but he is the Government representative in regard to the matter and, if the standard is good enough for him, we have got to accept it.  God knows it reflects no glory on the people who adopt it.</P>
    <P>If we choose to play the inglorious part of sucking out of Great Britain whatever we can by smuggling operations, we ought to make up our minds to do it consistently.  If you want smuggled goods to come in, you must make up your mind that they will not come in at the controlled prices. Smuggled goods cannot be sold here at the price at which goods manufactured here are sold.  Therefore, do not be laying traps for the feet of unwary men.  I came across a case in which a man <i>coram populo</i> hired another man to go across the Border and smuggle in a lorry-load of cycle tyres.  He thought that he was doing great work for everybody.  He put up a big notice at his place: &ldquo;Tyres for everybody.&rdquo; He hung the tyres in garlands round his door and he sent an advertisement to the <i>Irish Press</i> offering his tyres to the public at a price far in excess of the regulated price, because he himself had paid to the smuggler a price far in excess of the regulated price.  The <i>Irish Press</i>, being a public-spirited organ, felt that it had to do its duty and it communicated with the Department of Supplies.  This man has been prosecuted.  I am as certain as I am standing here that this man acted in good faith.  He bought the tyres at a high price.  He put up a notice at his place of business.  He hung out the tyres and he invited anybody who chose, even the Guards, to come and deal with him.  If I had found myself in his position, I would have done exactly the same thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> In respect of cotton thread, everybody in the State is looking to the smuggled article.  When you buy English cotton thread, you know it is smuggled thread.  A 200-yard reel of smuggled thread sells at 10d. and a 400-yard reel at 2/-, while a 200-yard reel from Westport is sold at the fixed price of 2d. and a 400-yard reel at the fixed price of 5d.  The two are selling side by side.  If it is right, as laid down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to go in by the back door and snatch from Britain the goods her people have bled to bring in there in order to maintain essential services, then it is right to charge a small profit on the price which has been paid to the smuggler.  On the information of the <i>Irish Press</i>, the Minister decided to prosecute this man.  I do not think that that is fair or equitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan has referred to the problem of procuring scrap iron for horseshoes.  I addressed the House before on that problem and I shall now refer to it again.  Unless energetic measures are taken to accumulate a stock of scrap iron suitable for horseshoeing, a situation will develop in which horse travelling will have to stop.  Nobody will open his eyes to that plain fact until the calamity is upon us.  At present, no iron is being made available for the purpose of shoeing horses.  Most of the blacksmiths have a considerable stock and, so long as they have an abundant stock in the farriers' yards, they are not going to kick up a row about the general situation but, when that stock is gone, there will not be a bar of shoeing iron to be had in different parts of the country.  I beg the Minister to face that situation.  I do not know what the technical processes are for the conversion of scrap iron into the form of a bar suitable for horseshoeing.  But if it is physically possible to get that done, I suggest that it should have first priority because, if horse travelling is closed down and if it becomes impossible to use a horse-drawn vehicle in the country, we shall find ourselves in a desperate situation.  A reasonable amount of tillage cannot be done unless you have shoeing for the horses' feet.</P>
    <P>There are three small matters to <Col N="1781" /> which I want to refer before concluding. I asked the Minister for Supplies recently what he intended to do in respect of motor lorries which were laid up.  I asked if he wanted to have them lie there and rot.  The batteries and tyres are deteriorating, and they will be no use if something is not done with them.  The Minister facetiously replied: &ldquo;Does the Deputy want me to go into the motor business?&rdquo;  I do not, but the position is that one is not allowed to export these vehicles, and nobody will buy them because they are afraid they would not get discs when the new control of petrol is introduced.  If the Minister has decided not to allow them to ply on the road and not to permit them to be exported, why does he not requisition the tyres off them and not let them rot?  It may be that the Army would require them for the spares, but surely something, in justice to the owners and to the community, should be done, so that they will not fall to bits in the garages.  Either that or provide some regular method by which a person desiring to dispose of a vehicle of that character can do so.  At present, so far as I know, they cannot be converted into cash or into any other articles for which a person might be willing to exchange them.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I desire to refer has reference to a situation which is continually recurring in County Monaghan.  I have in mind the case of a man who has a carrier's licence and, as an indispensable part of his trade, is plying between some centre in Monaghan and some centre in Northern Ireland.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I will not let him bring his lorry outside Éire in future,&rdquo; whereupon that man's business is dislocated and destroyed.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  He says: &ldquo;What guarantee have I, if I allow him to continue to cross the Border, that he will not put on a strange driver some day and leave the lorry on the other side.&rdquo;  I asked the Minister: &ldquo;Will you permit a person this liberty who is prepared to deposit with your Department the full cash value of his lorry in Northern Ireland as a bond that he will not leave the lorry in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  The reply was: <Col N="1782" />&ldquo;No, I will not.&rdquo;  That is unreasonable. Surely, if the proprietor of a lorry is prepared to put up a bond for the entire value, guaranteeing that he will hand that amount over as a penalty to the Minister&mdash;the entire purchase price&mdash;if he leaves the lorry in Northern Ireland, it is fantastic to say that you will not allow him to continue his trade lest he leave the lorry in Northern Ireland.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that decision and to allow these people to resume their ordinary avocation and thus keep off the dole.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of detail to which I desire to refer.  It has reference to the dispensary doctor.  At present, for the smallest horse-power motor, a dispensary doctor can demand and get eight gallons of petrol.  The fact is that a great many dispensary doctors cannot get round their dispensary districts to do their work in an 8 h.p. car if all the petrol they can get is eight gallons.  I suggest to the Minister that, in respect of the rural dispensary doctor, he should say that he would give him the eight gallons, whether he has an 8 h.p. car or an auto-cycle.  By using the eight gallons on an auto-cycle he would have enough to get everywhere.  He would have to wear waterproof overalls in the winter and endure a meed of hardship, but he would be able to cover the ground. With an 8 h.p. car he could not do that.  Why force the doctor to stick to the 8 h.p. car in order to get the eight gallons of petrol, when he cannot get round his dispensary district in that vehicle?  A doctor who is willing to change over to an auto-cycle instead of a car should get the same quantity of petrol as he would be entitled to get for the 8 h.p. car.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to give the doctor a gallon of petrol extra. Give him the same petrol as he is being given now, but allow him to use it on a different type of vehicle, in order to ensure that he will be able to reach the sick poor.  The bureaucratic objection to that is that, if one makes such a concession in regard to dispensary doctors, the same concessions will <Col N="1783" /> be demanded in respect of every other class of persons; but surely if a man is attending to the sick poor in our scattered areas in rural Ireland he is in a unique position and consideration ought to be shown to the special work he has to do.  If there must be a few more concessions, designed to permit somebody to get an auto-cycle and fly into the winter weather of this country, night and day, surely the people who are <i>bona fide</i> prepared to do that in the service of the public are damned well entitled to some concession, always provided that the nature of the concession sought does not involve an additional charge on the pool of petrol available here.  I am prepared to agree that that stipulation would be perfectly reasonable.  Persons who are giving service to the sick poor&mdash;whether nurses, doctors, or otherwise&mdash;and are prepared to do it on an auto-cycle and face the rigours of that mode of locomotion, should be entitled to the special discrimination that I suggest should be shown.</P>
    <P>May I conclude on this note?  In regard to the ensuing negotiations between the drapers and the Minister, may I ask that forbearance and patience necessary as a result of the follies of the Minister in the early stages of the Order?  A large part of the ills from which we suffer at present arise from the fact that the Minister looks upon his fellow citizens as rogues.  I sympathise with anyone such as he who has been consorting with the tariff racketeers for the last ten years, in coming to the conclusion that all mankind were rogues.  I ask him to realise that, in his new rôle, he is called upon to meet persons other than tariff racketeers, and that the standards and criteria considered suitable by those gentlemen are not accepted by the bulk of the people living in this country.  Most of the ordinary citizens are trying to obey the law and pull their weight in the work that has to be done.  When they approach him, they expect to be treated, not with deference or with any exceptional courtesy, but with the respect due to decent men who come of decent people.  If the Minister will recast his approach to the <Col N="1784" /> bulk of ordinary citizens with whom he is called upon to transact business during the next 12 months, in the light of his discovery, that everybody in this country is not a rogue, I think he will find that a great many of the worries, troubles and difficulties that beset him will melt like snow in summer sunshine, and he will recognise that, great as the difficulties of his office may be, with the co-operation of his fellow countrymen most of them can be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very refreshing to hear Deputy Dillon.  He told us this evening that this Government were sneaking in and taking bread and other food from the mouths of the English people, who had fought for us and who were protecting our liberties. Deputy Dillon held out, when he was in a responsible position over on the Opposition Benches, that the price of the co-operation of the Party opposite in this emergency, was firstly, the abolition of wheat growing and, secondly, the blowing up of the beet factories which were going to produce our sugar.  Those were the two conditions under which we were to get Fine Gael support, through their mouthpiece, Deputy Dillon.  I say to Deputy Dillon here and now that, with that outlook, he should not to-day, in a time of scarcity, be using the bread made from flour which was grown in defiance of him and the sugar made in our beet factories.  He should go across the Border and stay there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also an appeal in regard to the drapers.  We heard that from many quarters of the House.  I have not the slightest bit of sympathy with the drapery trade in this country. They are the people who created a black market of their own.  When a person went in to buy a suit of clothes, he was told to buy it now, as there would be none next week.  A man who wanted a shirt was told he was looking at the last of them and that there would be no more.  That was the tune and the excuse given for a 50 per cent. increase in price.  That was kept up for some months.  All the time it was said that these were the last supplies and then, when the coupon system was <Col N="1785" /> introduced, they said they had three years' supplies.  Though they had nothing a week before, they had three years' supplies then.  I have not a bit of sympathy with them, nor with Deputy Dillon's appeal that they be allowed now to have the coupons taken off some special articles, where there would be a statement from the Minister that they would not be replaced.  You can imagine what the drapers would charge then for those special articles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has encouraged support of the black market.  I have no sympathy with a body of men who engineer a position of scarcity and say that if we do not buy the goods now they will be gone.  They carry on that game and shout &ldquo;Wolf!  Wolf!&rdquo; When the Minister says that, if the goods are so scarce, he must see that the poor have something, and introduces the coupon system, the drapers begin to howl that they have a three years' supply in stock.  It is good news to hear they have a three years' supply in stock but we did not hear that until the coupons were introduced.  We did not hear when they increased their prices by 50 or 75 per cent. that they had these quantities in stock.</P>
    <P>I should like in the first instance to take off my hat to the Minister for the manner in which he has worked the petrol ration and the kerosene ration. I say that frankly as a farmer and as one who would find fault with the Department if I could and make no bones about it.  The manner in which that Department has been worked is, to my knowledge, the most efficient in which any Department could be worked.  In fact I did not believe it could be worked so well.  Any time that I went across there with a complaint&mdash;and I got loads of them&mdash;I was shown straight away the reason why certain supplies could not be made available and I was asked frankly: &ldquo;In that case would you give it?&rdquo; and I had to say: &ldquo;I would not.&rdquo;  I praise every bridge as I pass over it.  I think the manner in which the Department of Supplies has been worked reflects every credit on the Minister.</P>
    <P>As for Deputy Dillon's complaint that dispensary doctors are unable to <Col N="1786" /> get sufficient petrol, in my young days dispensary doctors carried out their work very efficiently with a horse and trap.  After all the greatest distance that any of them has to travel is usually only about five or six miles from his house.  if the dispensary doctor has to buy a horse and trap, and to buy oats from the old farmer from whom he is drawing his salary it will be all to the good.  It would make for a little more of the self-sufficiency that Deputy Dillon dislikes so much.  It will not hurt anybody to travel round in a pony and trap.  The doctors would be able to do their work just as well and they would have less inclination to travel 20 or 30 miles to the dogs at night.  Again I say that the manner in which the petrol and kerosene ration has been worked, the manner in which each person got his honest supply, was highly praiseworthy. I have gone over to the Department hundreds of times with complaints.  Every time I go there the file is produced in about five minutes and I am shown the reason why certain persons do not get their supplies. In every case that I examined I found the Department was right in stopping supplies from these individuals.

    <P>We hear complaints about the shortage of bacon, the price and scarcity of butter and other matters of that kind.  Does any Deputy making these complaints ask himself where these commodities were going to come from?  You can, if you like, blame the whole thing on the fixed price of barley and oats.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that pre-war, in the year 1938, there were imported into this country about 500,000 tons of maize, cotton cake and cotton meal and you had in this country about 100,000 tons of bran, pollard and stuff of that description, left over from the manufacture of flour.  That was a total of 600,000 tons of feeding stuffs.  The increase in acreage of oats and barley in this <Col N="1787" /> country last year as compared with the pre-war year was 276,000 acres, but the total yield was equivalent only to about 40 per cent. of the 600,000 tons of maize, cotton cake, cotton meal and other products available heretofore.</P>

If you have only 40 per cent. of what you had pre-war, then you can have only 40 per cent. of your pre-war output of meat.  Practically the same thing applies to butter, as far as winter feeding is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair would keep those gentlemen from interrupting me, I would get along a lot quicker.  However, that is my view-point at any rate, and I do not think there is any Deputy here who can contradict my figures.  There is not a Deputy here who will tell me that something like 200,000 tons of oats and barley will feed as many head of stock as 500,000 tons of maize and cotton meal.  That is the present position and you cannot get beyond it.  There is no use in speaking in terms of bacon or butter or anything else under those conditions.  The trouble I find with the Minister in that line is that there seems to be an anxiety to keep the price to the farmer as low as possible, but there is no restraint at all once it gets beyond the farmer, just the same as in the case of the turf racket that I alluded to here the other night.</P>
      <P>I produced in this House some time ago a letter from a miller in County Galway.  In that letter, which I read for the House, he stated that from buying oats at the fixed price and selling oatmeal at the fixed price also&mdash;his small mill could manage about 300 barrels per week&mdash;his net profit was £10,600 a year.  His weekly turnover was £280.  Does the Minister consider that that is a fair profit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The miller was very careful as to the figures he gave, and I am certain that he is prepared to stand over them.  At any rate, I wish to protest here very definitely if the Department of Supplies say: &ldquo;Well, the miller must buy black market oats. The price we fixed for oats is not enough, and the miller will have to buy some oats in the black market. Therefore, we will give him a decent gap.&rdquo;  Well and good, increase the price of the oats.  I will guarantee to the Minister that, at the price fixed this year, there will not be two cwts. ground in any mill in the country. Nobody but an idiot would give it to them to grind.</P>
      <P>Why allow all the profit to go to what we know as the collar-and-tie gentlemen, and none to the farmer? That is the position that the Minister is creating.  Then, we had Deputy Dillon talking about smuggling flour across the Border.  It would have been a good thing for this country if all smuggling across the Border were stopped, and stopped on the first day it was tried on.  There would be a little more for the poor, and a little less luxuries for the rich.  I do not believe that you need have any sugar rationing in this country to-day were it not for the quantities of sugar that went across the Border in exchange for white flour. This business of smuggling across the Border is being used as an excuse for every thief in this country.  You have the racketeer in County Cork who takes in Irish wheat, mills it into white flour, and sells it as white flour brought across the Border.  That gentleman got away with it until recently, because the road across the Border was open.  You have the same thing continuing right along the line, and you have essential supplies leaving this country in exchange.  There is no man going to tell me that lorries are coming in full and going back empty.  They are not.  The boxes of butter, the bags of sugar, and all the rest of it, are going out in exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the sugar position is concerned, I am afraid the Minister will have to accept practically all the responsibility.  The question of the <Col N="1791" /> growing of beet for supplying this country with its requirements of sugar was gone into very fully last year.  The Beet Growers' Association prepared their case very carefully. They looked for no wild profits.  They put up their case to the Sugar Company, and the chief agricultural adviser to the Sugar Company stated that their case and their figures were absolutely correct.  But a kind of a jack-in-the-box that is over there, with a pair of spats on it, jumped up and abused the unfortunate man for giving that information, telling him that he was an official of the Sugar Company. Then the Minister fixed the price.  As a result of the fixing of the price the acreage under beet has dropped from 73,000 acres last year to 50,000 paper acres this year, and I believe that that will amount to about 45,000 acres.  The yield from that 45,000 acres will not be 70 per cent. of what the yield was last year.</P>

      <P>He is responsible for having it there, if it can be got.  People have told him that he is responsible for having tea here when he cannot get it, and they were in order.  I am dealing with something he could have here, if enough was paid for it.  I say that the price fixed by the Beet Growers' Association was one which the chief agricultural adviser of the Sugar Company said was fair and reasonable and that under those conditions we might get sufficient sugar to carry on.  That price was cut, and, if the Minister did not fix the price, I say that he should have seen that the price paid for beet was sufficient to enable us to get our supplies of sugar. A farthing on the pound of sugar would amount to 7/- per ton of beet.  The farmers looked for 10/- a ton&mdash;that was our demand.  We asked for 10/- more than the 70/- we got.  That price of 80/- a ton would have satisfied us this year, and if the Minister went <Col N="1793" /> to those who will now get 50 per cent. or 30 per cent. of the sugar they were accustomed to get and told them that for a farthing a pound more, he could have got them plenty of sugar, but that he would not do it, I wonder whether those people would prefer to pay the extra farthing rather than to be short, particularly when there was no profiteering involved.  There was no profiteering in it and, as I say, the price looked for was agreed to by the principal agricultural adviser of the Sugar Company.</P>

      <P>I am finished with it now, as I have said all I want to say on it.  Deputy Brennan put up an argument in connection with the importation of artificial manures as against newsprint.  I suggest to the Minister that, while he may not be able to bring in sufficient artificial manures in the space occupied by newsprint, he can bring in binder twine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take up only the same space as newsprint and be about the same weight.  If there is not sufficient binder twine available this year, I do not know what is to happen to <Col N="1794" /> the harvest, because binder twine is an essential.  I should like to hear some definite statement from the Minister on the subject of iron.  He is in charge of two Departments, and, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he knows the position in regard to Haulbowline and its supplies.  How soon will the place be got working and what supplies can be made available? The position with regard to iron for horseshoes is getting more serious every day, and every day we are left without supplies puts us in a far more serious position.  Has the Minister taken any power to examine the heaps of scrap held here and there throughout the country?  It took us a long time to get the export of this stuff from this country stopped. I have seen in Cork City large heaps of scrap iron and there are several similar heaps in this city.  That scrap could very easily be sent down to Haulbowline and converted into useful iron and steel.  I am anxious to know what has been done in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters which we want to have straightened out because we are anxious to ensure that the farming community will be able to carry on this season, at any rate.  We cannot carry on, if we cannot get essential supplies. There is no use in our looking for stuff from the Minister which he has not got, but when we see something which the Minister could get, it is our duty to point it out to the Minister and see that he gets it for the agricultural community. There is no use in our asking for petrol.  The Minister will get every gallon of petrol he can and we want to see that petrol conserved.  We want to see less of it used in private cars and more of it used in industry.  Let what there is of it be kept for the harvest, for the removal of the harvest into the stores and the removal of the beet crop.  Let it be kept for those operations that are essential.  I am not at all worried if a dispensary doctor has to drive around in a pony and trap, instead of a motor car.  He will do all he has to do and he will not sweat. Similarly with 90 per cent. of the private cars still on the road.  They can be done without, and it will be a lot <Col N="1795" /> worse for the people, if, when the harvest comes on, they find that they have not got the kerosene and petrol to thresh it, the petrol to deliver it into the stores or to move in the beet harvest afterwards.  If we find ourselves in that position, we shall be far worse off than those who have to go short of luxury supplies and supplies for luxury driving.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry, at the close of his remarks, mentioned the question of iron and, a short time previously, he referred to newsprint.  It has struck a good many people that, whereas there was a drive to collect waste paper of all kinds in order to keep the paper mills going, a similar movement so far as I know has not been inaugurated in connection with scrap iron.  At least, if it has, it has not been as effectively brought to the notice of the ordinary people in the city.  Now, yesterday, the Minister painted a somewhat gloomy picture of the future, so far as our supplies from abroad are concerned.  There is one point in his speech, however, that I am not quite clear about, and perhaps he might clear it up immediately.  In paying a tribute to the directors of Irish Shipping, Limited, he made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Directors of Irish Shipping, Limited, and the officers of that company ... deserved well of the community ... It is upon the success of their efforts that the whole economic life of this nation depends. No foreign vessel has come to this country since April of last year, except a Swedish vessel ..., which has since been purchased by Irish Shipping, Limited, three small ships from Iceland, and, recently, three ships bringing wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Do I understand from that statement &mdash;I merely want to get my mind clear, because the situation, if it is as put down there, seems to me to be extraordinarily serious&mdash;that no British ship came into this country since the April of 1941?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not coastwise to this country?  I thought it was foreign shipping.  However, I only wanted the matter cleared up because, naturally, taking the two things together, I took British shipping, in the normal way, to be foreign shipping.</P>
      <P>Later on, the Minister makes an appeal for co-operation from traders, and an acceptance of conditions on the part of consumers which, according to him, is not yet forthcoming.  Does the Minister think that his conduct as Minister for Supplies over a number of years, and especially quite recently, is conduct that invites wholehearted co-operation from anybody?  I thoroughly agree with him that co-operation is necessary, and despite all the mistakes that have been made, the insults which he has poured out on various groups of people that he wants to co-operate with him, I hope that the co-operation will be forthcoming, but I would suggest that if any man has gone out of his way to put obstacles in the way of that co-operation it is the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions, in this House, since the crisis started, I have asked the Government, not merely to seek co-operation from the people, but to give some co-operation and some evidence of co-operation on their part to farmers and others.  Now the Minister himself asks for co-operation and he, by his conduct, by his refusals, by his hasty, ill-considered actions, by his language, even when he does try to <Col N="1797" /> mend his hand, has put grave obstacles in the way of what I might call trustful co-operation on the part of those to whom he now appeals, and that is a serious situation.  I will admit that, from the purely spectacular point of view, the climax, or what I hope is the climax, of his blunders&mdash;because I cannot feel sure that he might not yet even better what he has done in that respect&mdash;seems to have been reached during the last couple of weeks.  If that were only one instance, bad as it was, it might not be so serious.  But it was merely the culminating point, up to this, of the whole conduct of the Minister since the Ministry of Supplies was set up, and for 12 months before that, when a separate subDepartment was set up in the Department of Industry and Commerce. Every time the question of supplies has been discussed in this House the reply always has been: &ldquo;What are you doing?  What is your solution for the situation as we find it?&rdquo;  The things that led up to the situation as we found it were not to be discussed. If the Minister paid a little more attention to the criticisms that were then made, and tried to mend his conduct of the affairs of his Department, the big blunders that subsequently occurred might have been avoided, but that was not his attitude.  His attitude always was to use the emergency as a cloak behind which to hide from criticism. You will never get any good of Ministers if you simply ignore the faults they have made up to the present, and it is because the Minister has been subtle enough to try always, in connection with every crisis in supplies that has occurred, to direct attention to the immediate crisis of the moment, which his lack of foresight has caused, or at least to which his lack of foresight has contributed, that he makes further mistakes of a similar and more serious kind in regard to other matters.</P>
    <P>If anybody dares to point out any fault, any lack of policy, any neglect on the part of the Minister, the parrot cry goes up that that is playing politics. That parrot cry is in familiar use by some of the Ministers who are mainly responsible&mdash;the two Ministers, <Col N="1798" /> particularly, who are mainly responsible for the supplies of this country, the Minister who is here now and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture. That parrot cry does not justify them. It is they who are playing politics and who have been playing them the whole time.  I can say, on behalf of this Party, that since this crisis arose we have never played politics.  It might have been better, not merely for us but for the country, had we done a little more of it, and it is the general belief of the country that the Minister has got off altogether too lightly.</P>
    <P>Now, it is a serious position.  It was obvious to anybody from the start that it would be a serious position.  Even the man in the street was aware of that years ago.  The people knew it.  The Government were continually speaking of it, but so far as this vital matter of supplies is concerned I cannot find what is the balance to the credit of the Government or what they have done as regards supplies.  They spoke, but I cannot find that their words, during these three, or even four, years, had any relevance whatsoever to the facts and to the actions that they were taking or that they were willing to take, and that is what makes what occurred in the last couple of weeks so serious.  It is not the first major blunder for which the Department is responsible, or the first time that they threw the country into turmoil by sudden decisions made, apparently, at the last moment.  Again and again it has been pointed out to them that their whole tendency has been to wait until it was too late to meet a situation.  I wonder whether that was not so even in connection with the matter of clothing, and whether a gentle or more modified system might not have been introduced had the thing been taken in hands early enough?  However, I will return subsequently to the whole question of clothing.</P>
    <P>The real thing that makes people uneasy is the apparent inability of the Government and especially of the Minister for Supplies to mend their ways.  Public criticism is met with scorn&mdash;I do not mind members of the Dáil; I suppose that it is their business to be held up to scorn&mdash;but <Col N="1799" /> when the public is held up to scorn: when even from the lips of Deputy Corry we hear&mdash;I do not say they were civil servants but officials &mdash; that officials treat the public with contempt, and when we find large bodies of important people connected with the commerce of this city making similar complaints, well we have a right to be uneasy.  We have still more right to be uneasy when we see the facts bearing out these complaints.</P>
    <P>I think everybody will admit that when this war started it could have been foreseen&mdash;apparently the Government pretended to foresee it but, certainly, took no measures to suggest that they had foreseen anything&mdash;that the problem before the Department of Supplies was an exceedingly difficult one.  Anybody would gladly excuse a blunder or two, even a serious blunder or two or a mistake or two&mdash;a certain loss of temper even would be excusable &mdash;but when the only constant supply we get is ill-temper and bad treatment of the public, then that is a different situation.  When not only one or two initial blunders are made, but when as time goes on the blunders seem to increase as well as the bad temper and the impudence with which the public is treated, then I think there is a case for a much more serious examination of the capacity of the present Minister to administer his Department. It may be that his own followers on the back benches are satisfied with him.  If they are, I am sorry for them. I wonder whether their supporters in the country are quite so satisfied. Again, that is a matter between them and their supporters in the country.</P>

      <P>Is it for a national Government the Deputy is asking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and there are very few of the present Ministers who ought to be in a national Government. I would like the Deputy to tell me the ones that ought to be in it. There might be one or two.  If the Deputy thinks that the only alternative to the Minister for Supplies is a national Government, well, that is his idea.  Almost any catastrophe would be better than him.  It is very difficult, <Col N="1800" /> before we hear the Minister's statements and the Minister's answers to questions, to find out what the truth is. It may be a little more difficult afterwards. The position is that the public are deprived of one means they had of checking things, and that information is withheld because it is alleged to be in the national interest to withhold it. The emergency is used to cover any ill deeds of the Government.  The return of trade and shipping statistics is no longer issued.  Apparently, it would endanger supplies to this country if our people or other people knew what importations and exports we had, as if anybody acquainted with our exports to Great Britain would not know without the figures supplied by the Minister!  I doubt very much whether certain people do not know, even more accurately than the Minister, what our exports to that country are.  Why are the public deprived of that information? We have no means of checking up the Minister's figures.  We see a controversy in the papers, for instance, between the drapery trade and the Minister.  One thing is certain&mdash;they both cannot be telling the truth.  The Minister agrees by nodding his head. It is for the public, with experience both of the drapery trade and of the Minister, to say which is telling the non-truth.  The Minister does not supply the trade and shipping statistics which would enable ordinary people not to come to a conclusion but at least help them to come to a conclusion.  It is only when he finds it necessary for political purposes to come forward with a few figures that he then has no hesitation in endangering the national security, but when he is asked for information for the public the answer is: &ldquo;Oh, it cannot be given, the emergency forbids it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as I say, the result&mdash;and the Minister need not be surprised&mdash;is that there are stories of all kinds going about the country.  I am not and never was inclined to attach too much importance to these stories&mdash;but some of them are shocking simply, and lack any vestige of credibility.  Others of them are much more serious and seem to be much better founded.  I think it would be a bad thing if the people of this country <Col N="1801" /> could be led to believe one tenth of the rumours and stories that are going about.  But again, we are not in a position scientifically to control the facts and say as to where the truth lies.  If many of the stories I have heard which seem to be well founded are true &mdash;I have no way of refuting them&mdash;then it seems to me that the Department of Supplies has been a barrier to the getting of supplies rather than a help to the getting of supplies: that its whole function, so far as it has been exercised at all, has been to a large extent confined to controlling, and its controlling has been remarkably badly done.  That, I suggest, is the ordinary verdict of the ordinary man in the street so far as the Department of Supplies is concerned, and for that belief the Minister, by his treatment of the whole business, is to a large extent responsible. Cutting down the stories to one tenth and even then making all allowances for exaggeration, I have never seen such dissatisfaction with any department of Government&mdash;and certainly some of them have been the cause of dissatisfaction enough&mdash;as I have seen for this Department of Supplies, and that contempt, dislike and distrust is growing.  The Minister's conduct has contributed to that particular development.  He is quite right in appealing for co-operation. I hope he gets it, but he has put every obstacle he possibly could in the way of people co-operating with him. Why, for instance, in connection with the drapery trade was there not proper consultation?  I have had two reasons.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I have had two reasons.  One is that the Minister had all the information necessary.  Good.  I would expect nothing else from the Department of Supplies.  That is one of their besetting sins.  They act, thinking they know, and they do not know.  They refuse to consult the people who do know.  The other excuse is that they dare not consult because the secret would be let out.  They dare not trust people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that they were invited to a consultation publicly.</P>

      <P>No.  The Minister should not try to mend his hand. I will deal with this question of clothing subsequently, but the case is that the Minister could not trust them beforehand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is that we should consult them beforehand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Because they would let the secret out?  But was it not the business of the Department of Supplies to be in continual touch with all types of supplies within the country since the crisis arose, not merely with these but with tea and everything else?  If that consultation had been kept on, as it should have been kept on all the time, not merely now but during the past couple of years, then there was not the danger of the secret being let out which the Minister fears.  Consultation would be a perfectly normal thing giving rise to no excitement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the time when it was almost high treason against the good name of Ireland to suggest, when you were giving a tariff to a man, that he would try to make profit out of it.  Again and again, when we said that he would act like a reasonable man and try to make as much money as he could, it was hurled at us that that was an insult to the Irish race.  Now the Minister has got most distrustful of another body, another set of the Irish race.  There was no necessity for that if he had been doing his work for the past three years and consultations had been going on continuously, as they should have been, instead of the Department relying on its own secret information. Where it was got, nobody knows; as to what it was worth, we have had an example in the course of the past couple of months.  There was neglect the whole time.  The Minister did not <Col N="1803" /> think of consultation until he had acted.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I noticed, in his speech was, if not trying to mend his hand, at least laying the initial stones, so to speak, of the pathway that would lead in that direction&mdash;the very solid pathway he was going to build.  In fact, I gathered that he was now trying to suggest that the original Order was a &ldquo;try-on&rdquo;.  That is the line he was taking yesterday&mdash;the original Order was a &ldquo;try-on&rdquo; and it was not really meant seriously.  We will soon hear that blazoned forth and we will soon find out that in reality nobody could take the first Order seriously.  The Minister never meant it!  He merely wanted to get the views of the drapers and the people in the trade on the matter.  I have no doubt that will become an established doctrine after a while.  But the facts do not bear it out.</P>
    <P>The Order was issued quite obviously without thought.  I am assuming now that the Minister saw the Order; I cannot guarantee that, but I am assuming he did.  If he did, why did he let it through?  He takes full responsibility for it.  Quite right.  How did he let through an Order that limited the number of coupons in the year to 52?  I suggest, Sir, if officials &mdash;I noticed it during another speech already&mdash;come to this House to assist a Minister, they are not entitled, even by their gestures, to pass what are comments on the members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was objecting to something else; not what the Minister said to the officials, but the conduct of an official.  I noticed it also when Deputy Dillon was speaking. I am sorry I had to interrupt for a moment.  But imagine a Minister putting forward the view that 52 coupons are enough, that 40 are required for a suit of clothes, and that <Col N="1804" /> only 26 can be used before October.  In other words, no suits of clothes could be bought between this and October. That was the original Order.  That was seriously put forward with all the panoply of everybody in the State being circularised; every household got a copy of it.  I will admit that it is possible that a number of people can do without an additional suit between now and October, that a new suit would not be necessary for them. But there may be a number who are not in that happy position.  That was forgotten, perhaps, by those who drew up the Order and by the Minister who signed and issued the Order.  Another thing that was forgotten was the effect on the livelihood of the people engaged in making suits.  That was cast to the winds.  That did not matter to the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Supplies; he was only interested in that, apparently, as Minister for Industry and Commerce. But the two men were apparently working in separate Departments.  We are asked to regard that as a reasonable invitation to people to discuss this thing reasonably; that the Minister's refusal to meet representatives of the trade was a reasonable method of asking co-operation, and that his whole treatment of them since was a reasonable procedure on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Co-operation!  What happens when people try to make suggestions to the Minister?  We had a case quite recently in connection with petrol for doctors. I am not interested in the slightest in the question of petrol for doctors on Sundays.  But some very important issues were raised on that particular matter.  Men were punished without reason, merely on vague suspicion. Even leaving that aside, there were two other aspects of that case that have not been fully adverted to.  One man&mdash;so far as I know I do not know him personally&mdash;made a suggestion with reference to certain other doctors. He was not himself included in the suggestion; I want to make that clear. The other doctors were punished and they were docked of portion of their petrol supply because, apparently, they had enough already and they <Col N="1805" /> were not sufficiently seriously-minded for the Minister for Supplies.  But this doctor was deprived of his petrol supply.  Why?  Not because he asked for petrol for himself, but because he made a suggestion to the Department and because he persisted in his heresy of thinking that these other doctors might be convenienced and the public might be convenienced.  Here are the words of the Minister on that matter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot agree to restore the petrol allowance to the doctor who made the representations.  He, according to his latest letter, apparently still considers that the arrangement he suggested should be permitted&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>Will the Deputy give the reference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Official Reports, volume 86, No. 7, column 2465.  If a person makes a suggestion to an important official of the Department of Supplies, he is punished.  He asked them to consider a certain proposal. I am not interested in that proposal, but I am interested in the fact that a citizen of this State, because he made a suggestion to officials, was punished. That suggestion may be sound or it may be unsound.  I heard it discussed by a number of people who were not doctors and some of them were in favour of it and some against.  But the idea that the man should be punished because he dared to approach an official with a suggestion that he thought was a good one, is, I say, bureaucracy run mad.  I should not mind it running mad if it were not so inefficient.  I cannot describe the methods by which that doctor was approached and led on as anything else than something approaching <i>agent provocateur</i> methods.  He was led on to make his proposal, to get into touch with other doctors, and there was no hint that there was anything wrong in what he was doing.  That is what the Minister is responsible for</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Co-operation?  What encouragement has anybody got in this country to give co-operation to the Government, and to the Minister for Supplies in particular? I cannot see any, and I wish I could. <Col N="1806" /> In the minds of many people, if the Minister for Supplies mixed less with the question of supplies, then the supplies in this country would be in a much more healthy condition than they are at the moment.  A couple of days after this Order had been circulated with such a tremendous amount of ceremony, with such great care and great expense, there came a modification of it which, in itself, whatever the Minister may say, proves how ill-considered the original Order was.  Certain concessions were made, not, as the public are entitled to judge, because the Minister had given better consideration to the matter, but because he was threatened with an agitation.  People were condemned because, when their business was threatened with extinction, as was the case in a good many instances as the Minister now acknowledges, and as we can see from his speech yesterday, they protested.  When thousands of people were faced with unemployment, because they protested in quite an ordinary fashion they were condemned. The person who should be condemned is the Minister who issued that Order without consideration, apparently without considering the merits of the case, and then gave in.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's paper we saw an advertisement in connection with rationing with the advice &ldquo;Cut out this and paste it in&rdquo;.  Is that the way things should be done?  Some things have been cancelled and others modified.  As most people know, though possibly the Minister does not, there are places in this country where it is exceedingly difficult to get newspapers, and there are many people who do not see a daily newspaper from one week-end to another. They have been circularised with the original document, but how are they to know of the alterations? And that is described as efficiency!</P>
    <P>The emergency has been stressed again and again by the Government, but no real effort has been made to meet the emergency.  The only thing the Government have done successfully, so far as the emergency is concerned, is to increase their own powers.  They have practically despotic powers and they are exercising them despotically. That may be necessary in a crisis, but <Col N="1807" /> what is not necessary in a crisis is having despotic powers and not being able to use them usefully or properly.  That is what has caused the discontent and the contempt for Government institutions and for Parliament that is growing on the people.</P>
    <P>There are serious issues, apart altogether from supplies, raised by the whole conduct of the Minister in this case.  We all know that it is quite a common thing on the part of the Government to resent criticism of any kind. I can say that any criticism that has come from these benches, had it been listened to by the Government in time, might have helped them to mend their ways and they and the country&mdash;it is useless for us to dissociate the fate of the Government and the fate of the country&mdash;might be in a much better position to-day.  Everything considered, I do not find it possible to congratulate the Minister and the Government in what is undoubtedly a difficult position. The question must arise whether the present Minister for Supplies is the man to be in charge of supplies.  Judging merely by his conduct, I see no evidence that would lead me to give an affirmative answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I asked a question of the Minister to-day.  There was a similar question put down last week, but on that occasion the Minister lumped a number of questions together and did not answer any of them in detail.  One of the questions was why a licence was withdrawn from a certain mill.  I asked had any offence been committed. Lumping a number of questions together, the Minister said that in the case of mills deprived of a licence, in some cases offences had been committed but in others no offences had been committed.  In order to get out the facts, it was necessary to put down individual questions on separate days. Even then the Minister did not answer the questions, but referred me to his previous answer, which was not really an answer.  He did not indicate the position of a certain mill, though it was quite obvious from his subsequent answers that he knew the mill had not committed an offence.  When I asked him had the mill been guilty of an <Col N="1808" /> offence, he said that that was a matter for the judge.  That is the way in which men's livelihoods are dealt with by the Minister for Supplies!</P>
    <P>The question whether an offence has been committed or not may be ultimately for the judge, but if a person is suspected of an offence the Minister acts on that and cuts off the licence. He does not wait until a case comes before the judge in order to decide whether a person is or is not guilty of an offence.  Finally, he said that the mill in question had been deprived of its licence and it was necessary to do that in order to preserve the supplies in the country.  He did not explain why that was necessary.  When I asked him why it was necessary the answer was: &ldquo;That is another question.&rdquo; There was no reason given.  I know he has the power to do it, but the least he might do is to try, when he is asked, to give an explanation that will satisfy the people affected.</P>
    <P>It is all quite typical of the Minister's attitude, not merely to the House but to the unfortunate people as well.  If a number of farmers express an opinion and it is a question between their opinion of what is good and bad and the Minister's opinion, I prefer to back their opinion, from my experience of the Minister.  They believe it is in their interests that their wheat should be ground in a local mill. They demand the opening of the mill for that purpose and they are refused. I do not know whether the Minister is speaking with knowledge, but he said yesterday that there was a shortage of 50,000 tons or 60,000 tons of wheat and &ldquo;the only conclusion was that the missing wheat was used for animal feeding stuffs&rdquo;.  He believes that.  If he does, does he not see that by running counter in the way he is to the wishes of the local people he is encouraging that and helping it?</P>
    <P>What is the explanation of the closing down of small mills?  I do not at all object to a picture being painted, as it was painted, of the glorious life that was in front of this country, when the mill wheels that are now idle would once more be turning and in every village you would have these mills for different purposes, but especially for <Col N="1809" /> wheat.  The moment the mills are anxious to take on this particular task, what is the answer of the Minister? His idea is to prevent them working. That was what I might call a picture that would look quite well in a cartoon, the idle mills being once more put into commission and the wheels turning; but, when it comes to actual practice, it was very much of a dream.</P>
    <P>There was another matter mentioned by Deputy Corry.  It was the question of the inadequate supplies, as it seems to many people, of petrol for doctors. I am not interested in the doctors&mdash;that is not the question.  Deputy Corry seems to imagine that petrol is given to the doctors because they are a privileged class.  That is not the reason petrol is given to the doctors.  It is not the case of the doctors that is in question. It is the case of the patients. I wonder whether we are living so far from reality as not to know that doctors are much more in demand now than they were previously, and that previously many people died because the doctor could not get to see them in time.  Actually that is what happens. Therefore, it is not a question of conveniencing the doctor&mdash;that should not enter&mdash;but it is a much more serious question; it is the question of the doctors attending the patients promptly and quickly.  That is the matter that calls for consideration.</P>
    <P>When the debate, to which I have already referred, took place on the Adjournment in connection with the six doctors they were referred to as being undoubtedly eminent men in their profession.  I only make the suggestion that that is purely irrelevant but I am quite sure one of the reasons why action was taken against them was that they were eminent, and it was determined to teach the ordinary people a lesson by punishing these men as an example.  I see the Minister for Local Government agrees with me.</P>

      <P>I suggest that even a man who is eminent in his profession is a citizen of this State, and he has the same rights and ought to have <Col N="1810" /> the same rights as a man no matter how poor, how unknown and, possibly, how unlettered.  They all have their rights.  The sick poor in the country have their rights and the Minister for Local Government certainly is interested in that, and I wish he would bring pressure to bear on his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, seriously to consider that whole matter.  I see from the beginning nothing but muddling, muddling of a very serious and dangerous type, as a result of the activities of the Department of Supplies. The Minister, so far as he has guided, has misguided that Department from the start.  He has never made any provisions for the future.  It is quite true he cannot supply things now that are not in the country, but the question is, had he had foresight, how many things might be in the country.  That is the fault to find with him, not that he points out now that there is a shortage which must be dealt with, but nothing that he did did anything to obviate or lessen that shortage.  If we have to ration in the future, is not the spectacle that we had in the last couple of weeks a beautiful introduction to the system of rationing in this country?  Rationing will be necessary, and is the conduct in which the Minister indulged and the Orders he issued and the steps that he took, even in the way of amendment, in the past couple of weeks the best way to prepare the minds of the people for that condition&mdash;a hard condition for many?  I cannot believe it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very attentively to what the Minister had to say in regard to this question of clothes rationing.  I have gone even further than that.  I have consulted the records that have appeared in the Press over the few days in which this matter was so prominently before the country.  I think that it is necessary, in the interests of truth and fair play, that we should examine this statement that has been made by the Minister. The Minister, in the course of his statement, gave a description of the shortage of supplies of certain clothing stuffs, woollens, linen, artificial silks, and so on, and he said: &ldquo;In <Col N="1811" /> those circumstances it was decided that the introduction of clothes rationing should not be further delayed. In making that decision, I decided that intimation of the intention to ration clothing to the manufacturing and trading interests concerned was not in the public interest.&rdquo;  Why was it not in the public interest?  That rationing was necessary is admitted even by persons engaged in the trade.  Why was it not in the public interest that they should have been consulted as to the form of rationing that should take place, the ease with which it could function, the little disturbance that it might be schemed to cause, and, generally, to make the matter one which would be for public convenience rather than for public disturbance? However, we have the Minister's statement that consultation with the manufacturing and trading interests concerned was not in the public interest. That decision, he said, has been challenged but he does not anticipate any difficulty in defending it.</P>
      <P>I think I can pass over that portion of the statement in which he refers to the trading interests, and says that however honourably they might try to preserve the confidence entrusted to them, something would leak out.  The fact is that it did leak out without consulting them at all.  Therefore, his own machinery is at fault.  Had there been consultation with the trade, had these manufacturers not betrayed confidence, but had the information leaked out as it has leaked out, obviously the blame would have been placed upon the manufacturers and it would have been unfair and unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he decided that it was a wiser policy, before consultation with the affected interests was undertaken, that a provisional control of sales should be instituted.  We are given the decision and neither the House nor the country is given any information as to the reasons upon which that decision was based.  He went on to say, in quite childish fashion, that the provisional control should be more restricted than it was essential to maintain during the earlier stages.  What nonsense.  In other words, to present <Col N="1812" /> people with a sort of panic situation and then gradually to water it down to give an exhibition, as it were, of the generous state of mind the Minister had with regard to the whole question.</P>
    <P>He says he invited the trading concerns interested or involved to make any representations which they considered necessary and that they would be considered.  Let us have no quibbling whatever about this.  On the morning following the night in which rationing was announced over the radio, the trading interests concerned had a meeting, and there and then they opened up communication with the Minister's office.  They got into touch, I am informed, with his private secretary and asked for an interview.  That was fairly direct.  Perhaps the Minister may have thought that a communication should have been addressed to him, served upon him or posted to him. Well, the telephone is in fairly popular use, not only by traders in connection with their business but, I presume, also by the Minister.  There is an extensive array of telephonic communication in public offices, and as the telephone is there for public use and not entirely for the convenience of the Minister, an application to the Minister by telephone by the trades concerned, in which it was definitely stated that it was the Minister they desired to see, was, to my mind, full and sufficient.  The consultation in the minds of the drapers concerned was with the Minister and not with officials.  However, the Minister went on to say that the drapery distributing trades decided at first on agitation in preference to consultation, and that their agitation was directed towards the withdrawal of the rationing scheme <i>in toto.</i>  The application was made to the Minister on Tuesday, June 9th, and on the following morning the chairman of the organisation of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade called upon me and informed me of the situation.  I made arrangements to meet them that evening at 6 o'clock, if it was convenient for Deputy McGilligan to attend.  It did not fit in with Deputy McGilligan's arrangements, as he could not come at 6 o'clock, but, with Deputy McGilligan I met, I think, five members that evening at 8 o'clock.  I took down in shorthand <Col N="1813" /> possibly eight foolscap pages of that interview and at its close I put one question to them.  I asked: &ldquo;What are your proposals?  Do you ask for a withdrawal of the rationing scheme?&rdquo;  It was a challenging question. It was not put in challenging form, but the answer given straight out was: &ldquo;Certainly not.  It would be impossible.  In any case, rationing is necessary in respect of quite a number of items.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding that, we have this statement from the Minister: &ldquo;Agitation, however, was decided upon, and the application of the trade was for a withdrawal of the rationing scheme <i>in toto</i>.&rdquo;  I should like to know on what the Minister bases that statement.  I have here a file of all the newspaper reports of the proceedings that took place during that period and in not one of them is there a reference on the part of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade to withdrawal of the coupon system.</P>
    <P>The gentlemen I met were very well informed regarding the situation in the drapery trade.  They had for a number of years taken every possible step to increase their stocks, and were fairly well aware of the efforts that had been made by other houses in the drapery trade to build up stocks during the last two or three years in a difficult period, having no notice whatever except what could be gathered from the newspapers.  They had in certain cases got two or three years' supplies&mdash;two years in some cases, two and a half years in others, and three years in others.  They had committed themselves to firms across the water in connection with credits that they had to get from them to stock up goods, and they had also committed themselves to banking interests here, which responded most generously to any demands they made for such cash accommodation as was required to enable them to stock their concerns with all the goods they could contain.  The public needed these goods and were buying them.  I recollect that some five or six months ago a meeting of the employees' trade union held in Cork adopted a very different approach to present-day problems to that which had been customary with trade unions.  They <Col N="1814" /> congratulated employers on their foresight in getting stocks which would enable them to retain their employees. In a single moment, and without any notice to anybody, backed, as he states, by the best advice he could get, the Minister came along with a scheme under which he distributed coupons broadcast, but limits the use of them to half the number up to October. Twenty-six was all that could be used up to October 1st.  When the Minister was faced with agitation which he condemns, which he holds up to public scorn, and practically tells the House that he has been admonished by certain people for having given way to, frightened by the panic that he has created, he immediately extends the coupon system from 52 to 78.</P>
    <P>Obviously he could not have got the best advice because on Monday he startled the public by stating that there was a shortage of material, that a dangerous situation was approaching, and that he had to ensure that the poor would get supplies as well as the rich.  In order to do that there was notice of a rigid and severe rationing scheme so that everybody would get what they were entitled to and nothing more, but faced with public clamour, which his indiscretion, ill-judgment and non-consideration of essential features created, he changes the whole thing and now he comes forward and tells us that he has been faced with opposition to rationing by the drapery trade and those concerned since the beginning of rationing.  That is not true.  It is a baseless charge against people who have done their duty in the last two or three years, and who during a bad time had not the information that was available to the Department to get in stocks.  They have been able to do so only since the emergency.  They have done well and were able to keep their employees up to the present.  I find that this is not the first occasion on which the Minister has interfered with this trade.  Some time about March last he introduced an Order to restrict, except under licence, the importation of fabrics.  A motion was put down in the Seanad to rescind or to revoke that Order.  It happens that there is in the Seanad a member intimately in touch not only <Col N="1815" /> with the drapery distributing trade, but also with the wholesale trade. There was a discussion there on the 28th May and the following appears in the Official Report of that date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass): I do not know where Senator Douglas got the idea that the Department of Supplies does not consult with the parties interested in matters of this kind.  The assertion was completely unfounded.</P>
    <P>Mr. Douglas: The Minister, I presume, means the trade here?</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: The trade here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Douglas: Can the Minister say what association was consulted? I do not want to press him if he cannot answer at once.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: Discussions were held with the representatives of the trade who were best able to give the advice which the Department required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will note that statement.  The quotation goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole question was discussed with the Secretary of the British Cotton Board in December, 1941, and he suggested that we should regulate the imports of cotton piece goods so as to secure that our desire would be realised, that the most essential types of goods would be imported.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note what Senator Douglas had to say about that matter. Speaking in the Seanad on the 18th June, Senator Douglas said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister did not tell us whom he consulted.  I can now tell the House definitely whom he could have consulted but did not consult, and the House can judge for itself whether or not I was justified in the statement I made.  I have here a letter from the Secretary of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers written in reply to a query from me, in which he states that none of the following groups of manufacturers was consulted before the Order was made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Mantle and gown group, <Col N="1816" /> comprising women's costumes of woollen and worsted cloth, art silk, and cotton, and silk.</P>
    <P>(b)  Shirt group.</P>
    <P>(c)  Made-up household cotton piece goods group, comprising overalls for men and women, aprons, uniforms of cotton, etc.</P>
    <P>(d)  Underwear of silk and art silk group.</P>
    <P>(e)  Glove manufacturers' group.</P>
    <P>These are all groups within the federation which would be at all likely to be affected by the Importation of Fabrics Order, and the secre tary tells me that none of them was consulted, and he is unable to find any individual case in which there was consultation.  If individuals were consulted, they did not tell the association they had been so consulted. The secretary of the federation also adds that, as far as he knew, the mattress makers and the upholsterers were not consulted.  I wrote also to the Secretary of the Irish Woollen Merchants' Association, and he replied that his association was not consulted as an association, and he can find no evidence that any of the members were consulted individually.  The Secretary of the Irish Merchant Tailors' Association wrote that, as far as his association as a body was concerned, they were not consulted before the Order was made and that, as far as he can gather from extensive inquiries, none of the individual members of the association was consulted.</P>
    <P>I have also been definitely informed in writing that neither the Federation of Boot Manufacturers of Ireland, nor the Association of Woollen and Worsted Manufacturers of Ireland were consulted, nor had the secretary any knowledge of individual members being consulted. This also applies to the Linen and Cotton Textile Association, of which I am chairman.  The Secretary of the Irish Clothing and Cap Manufacturers' Association, Limited, wrote to me that his association was not consulted, nor was any individual member as far as he is aware.  The <Col N="1817" /> Drapers' Chamber of Trade, which represents a very large number of the retail importers, replied in some detail to my inquiry, and I propose to read the letter in full:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;In reply to your letter of the 27th instant inquiring whether the chamber had been consulted by the Minister for Supplies before he issued Emergency Powers (Importation of Fabrics) Order, 1942, the first intimation the chamber got of this Order was through its publication in the daily Press, and subsequently copies of Circular I.F.1 were received through the post without any accompanying communication, and the chamber was not asked to express its views on the prices set out in the circular.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That ought to dispose of the sources which the Minister did not consult on a previous occasion.  Apparently, we are left to assume that he was similarly lacking in prevision in connection with the present situation.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the main Opposition has quoted from a speech made in Seanad Eireann by Senator Douglas.  The citation was pertinent to this discussion and was limited to alleged facts relating to consultation, or absence of consultation, with the drapery trade.  It is, I believe, unusual, if not unprecedented, to quote in either House of the Oireachtas speeches made in the other House, always excepting, of course, speeches made by Ministers.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I have said, I had first-hand information regarding the action of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade in connection with this matter. They asked for an interview with the Minister.  It may have been that the mode of approach did not show due deference to the dignity of the Minister. That it was made, there is no doubt.  That the Minister was aware of it, I have no doubt whatever.  If there be any question about it, there is the confirmation of the telegram which was sent to the Taoiseach on the subject.</P>
      <P>The action of the drapers in closing their premises in Dublin has been the subject of criticism.  I inquired from the gentlemen who were negotiating, at that time, if they got the interview and if satisfactory results were likely to follow it, whether they would go on with the meeting, and I gathered that it would not have been necessary for them to do so.  My recollection is that their scheme for the meeting was entirely to put the public in possession of the circumstances of the case.  It is pictured here as if it were an interruption of work.  Was it an interruption of work?  In what respect was it an interruption of work? It was a stoppage of work in the drapery trade for 24 hours&mdash;a full day. Did the Minister make any inquiries as to what trade was done on the following day, or since then until there was a modification of his order?  To interrupt the work of the city by a 24-hour stoppage all round would be an interruption of work, but to stop a trade which has been dealt a paralysing blow and a trade which, it is obvious to everybody, will not be 25 per cent. of what it has been, merely means putting on to the other four or five days of the week an extra day's business, and is no interruption of any sort or kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had two examples, the first <Col N="1819" /> being that of the fabrics Order.  What happened in that connection?  This fabrics Order was brought in somewhere in March, the period terminating in April; it was extended to the 30th June and further extended to the 31st July.  According to the Minister, it was designed to ensure that whatever importations of fabrics would take place in the future would consist of the cheaper types.  The Minister issued a circular from his office, indicating the prices of fabrics for the importation of which he would be prepared to give licences.  The prices varied from 1/- to 5/-.  That Order was amended subsequently and almost every single price was extended or amended&mdash;from approximately 20 per cent. in one case to about 89 per cent. in the most extreme case.  It is obvious that there was no consultation in that case.  Why should there not have been?  Surely people making a living out of their business and who have been doing so for generations, giving employment to so many people throughout the country, are entitled to be consulted with regard to whatever changes are to be made?  Is it conceivable that the Minister in his office, or any public representative, has a greater or more vital interest, either in the consumer or the employees of a drapery firm, than the shareholders, if any, or the people engaged in running and guiding that business and making a success of it?  If I am asked to regard them as stupid, I concede the point on one basis only&mdash;that the Minister is still more stupid.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this was a panic order, which had panic consideration and panic decision.  There are panic changes and panic blunders in the whole thing.  Whenever this Department comes up against a difficulty of any sort or kind, one can expect panic.  Not all the lessons they can learn, or experience they can gain, ever has changed them in respect of panic announcements and panic speeches. Let me give just one example in regard to this Order, which I am told is at present under consideration.  A man ordered a suit a month ago or six months ago: he cannot get it now unless <Col N="1820" /> he gives up coupons.  We are told that this is a luxury trade.  What is meant by luxury trade?  First of all, it takes practically the same quantity of cloth to make a suit for myself as for my learned professorial Deputy friend here beside me.  Usually the suit made for one man is of no use to another: my suit would be of no use to him nor would his suit be of much use to me, though they are cut and made.  The unfortunate employees are the people really concerned.  The number of tailors in this or any other city in the country is negligible, but the number of persons who get employment out of tailoring establishments is very considerable. Why should war be made upon these people, earning their living out of tailoring establishments?</P>
    <P>Is not the trade of tailoring, of the man who sits on his hunkers, as honourable as any other trade?  Is he not entitled to get a living as well as anyone else?  May he not have a family as well as anyone else?  The Minister takes the line of appeal that his interests are directed entirely to the poorer class in the community.  What happens the suit which comes from a tailor's establishment?  Is it not as well worn as any other suit?  Probably it is given away before it is half worn, to some poor person, and in essence one might say that that suit, ordered from a tailor, is two suits.  That is not to be allowed in future and those establishments&mdash;of all others which must have been hard hit during the last couple of years, through the difficulty in getting material&mdash;are bound to require coupons before they can supply suits.</P>
    <P>Under the original Order, notwithstanding all the wise people that the Minister consulted, no man in his senses, not even the Minister himself, could have got a suit&mdash;a coat, waistcoat and trousers&mdash;on the number of coupons allowed in the beginning.  Was any great thought given to that?  The wisdom of it passes comprehension. What was the main case put up by those men who went mad in an orgy of agitation?  What was the case put to me?  Very simply, it was this: withdraw the rationing scheme from those goods in plentiful supply and which are not running short, withdraw seasonal and summer goods from the <Col N="1821" /> list, double the coupon value and set up an advisory committee to advise the Minister as to the changes which should be made, either now or in the future.  Of all the persons I ever came in contact with over a long public career, I never met more sensible or more reasonable men, or men more concerned about their employees, than they were.  Though they were perfectly solvent, by the ukase of the Minister they faced bankruptcy on the night of the 8th June.  They were men who had made their business solvent during the last couple of years, by reason of their initiative, foresight and industry.  They had pledged themselves up to their necks in order to buy goods for the people of this country.  They were solvent men one evening, but the Minister had them practically facing bankruptcy on the next day.  He is disappointed, astonished and aghast at their having a public demonstration&mdash;this master man of public demonstrations of the last 20 years, who would not have his liver in order if he were not agitating, in the days before he became Minister, and who has disturbed this country during the period since he became Minister.</P>
    <P>We have had under consideration here for some time past the question of petrol distribution.  For the purposes of the distribution scheme we have persons described as doctors, clergymen, veterinary surgeons, etc. Petrol is supplied to a medical practitioner in this country whether he be a surgeon, a physician or a general medical practitioner, not for his own private use but to enable him to attend so many of his patients as possible by the use of a car.  In the case of a surgeon, it is given to enable him to get immediately from one place to another to carry out a vital operation or perform some important service of that description.  The guiding principle is to ensure that every drop of petrol in this country will be used to the best possible advantage in these vital services.</P>
    <P>A doctor gets, as Deputy Professor O'Sullivan pointed out, eight gallons for a small car.  If it is possible for that <Col N="1822" /> man to use an auto-cycle, the auto-cycle will give a mileage of at least four times that of a car.  What reasonable objection, therefore, can there be to allowing a doctor getting eight gallons to utilise that quantity in operating an auto-cycle?  Why should you restrict him in his activities if it is possible for him to cover twice as large, or four times as large, an area by an alternative mode of conveyance? Surely it is no pleasure for a medical practitioner to go around on an auto-cycle and to suffer the shakings that we know are involved in the use of auto-cycles?  In the case of a surgeon, probably it would not be by any means advisable to use one of these auto-cycles. If he is a physician he requires to have his wits about him, to have his nerves steady, and he is not going to use an auto-cycle unless it appears to be in the best interests of those he is attending.  It is for their welfare that the petrol is given to him, not for private purposes.  I can see no reason whatever for not attempting to get the last ounce of value out of whatever petrol supplies we have in the country at the moment.  I must say that I was shocked at the manner in which the Minister dealt with particular cases when this matter was under consideration some time ago, but I do not intend to delay the House further now on this question.</P>
    <P>On the 9th May, 1942, <i>The Tablet</i> had the following in its columns from a correspondent in this country, and I should like the Minister's observations on it when he is replying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After Dunkirk when British  that had been used for supplying the Continent with coal, were fully loaded, with nowhere to go, the Great Southern Railways were offered 1,000,000 tons of coal at 20/- per ton.  They were nervous of taking the risk and consulted the Government, who declined to help.  The Great Northern Railway, on the other hand, bought up as much as it could and is still well supplied. So are several small factories.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That extract has been sent to me from my constituency with the suggestion that the matter might be brought before the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>That was before the war.  They were then in short supply; they were reduced I think to a week's supply, but that is a different matter to the one I am raising.  I do not know what happened during July, August or September, 1939, or down the months afterwards.  This, however, is a specific statement and deals with the period after Dunkirk.  It is a different matter altogether</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to make a passing reference is the rationing of tea.  There are people who complain that they cannot get their tea ration.  The Minister says there is a certain difficulty because of the fact that the wholesalers have a certain independence in the matter. Has it ever struck him to approach these wholesalers and see if they will not help him in arranging a more equitable rationing system?  I cannot conceive anybody in business in the present emergency in any country who has not sufficient regard for the needs of humanity to desire and to be anxious to help in a matter of that sort.  I think it would be very much better if an effort were made in that direction rather than try to dragoon or regiment people such as has been the tendency up to this.  This is a time when co-operation should be sought instead of resorting to the methods of the regimental sergeant-major. It is a time when, with even the best will in the world and the best efforts that people can put forward, difficulties will inevitably arise.  I must say that the contribution the Minister has made so far in that direction is not likely to inspire any great desire to accommodate him, but it is not yet too late.  He is there for good or ill. No matter what mistakes a Minister may make in this Department he is <Col N="1824" /> going to be kept there.  We have got to make the best of it.  So far as help is concerned, I have not seen in any part of the country during the past 20 years, even when Party feeling and political feeling ran very high, any instance in which the people were not anxious to help in the national cause if they are approached in a proper way.</P>

      <P>I have studied the detailed particulars given in the Book of Estimates presented to the House so far as the work of the Department is concerned, and I listened attentively to the long statement made by the Minister in introducing this Estimate, but there are certain other detailed particulars which I think it desirable the Minister should give in his reply, if such information is within his reach at the moment.  I should like the Minister to give particulars of the total number of staff working under the supervision of the Department&mdash;it is quite evident that such information is not given in the Estimates&mdash;such, for instance, as the total number of appointed members of the Civil Service, and particularly the number of outdoor inspectors or inspectors available for checking up the different work associated with the rationing scheme and also the number of temporary hands employed in the Department. By temporary hands, I mean those who were recruited into the Department by methods other than the normal Civil Service procedure.  I should also like to get particulars&mdash;I think it is very desirable that it should be made known &mdash;of the income derived by the State as the result of the licensing of traders associated with the different rationing schemes.  We have thousands, or tens of thousands, I suppose, of people paying licence fees for carrying on ordinary business.  I should like to have particulars of the annual sum derived from that source.  I assume it is <Col N="1825" /> the wish of the Minister that, in the difficult times which are in front of us between this and the end of the emergency, the public and all parties in the country should co-operate as far as possible in making or helping to make the work of the Department of Supplies as smooth as possible.  If that is so, I think it is very desirable that the members of the different Parties in this House and the public generally should be given much more information, through whatever is the most desirable channel, about the operations of the Department, and about the changing&mdash; it changes very suddenly &mdash; supply position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it too much to expect, for instance, that any general circular which may be issued by the Department of Supplies should be made available for the small number of members in the Oireachtas? Those circulars are not secret or confidential.  They are accessible to the different sections of the trading public, or to the public generally.  If my suggestion were adopted, I think the Minister would find that Deputies, who are not very well informed with regard to the operations of the Department of Supplies, might themselves be able to answer the questions of their constituents, which unfortunately at the present time they are not able to answer without either writing or telephoning to the Department.  I have heard that in recent times there are thousands of letters arriving at the Department of Supplies daily, and that a considerable number of the staff &mdash;junior members, I take it&mdash;are engaged in opening and examining those letters.  It takes some time, I assume, for those communications to be passed on to the different Departmental heads responsible for dealing with them.  To my own knowledge there is considerable delay&mdash;I say this with a full realisation of the difficulties&mdash;in replying to what might be regarded as urgent communications addressed to that Department.  I think it is desirable, in view of the difficult times which I am afraid we are facing, that there should be some kind of information bureau or propaganda department set up in the Department of Supplies, and that whoever is put in charge of that information bureau or propaganda <Col N="1826" /> department should take advantage of the wireless to deliver statements to the public from time to time in connection with the changing supplies situation. At any rate, I think no consideration of any kind has been given to the necessity&mdash;I call it a necessity&mdash; for giving Deputies, the representatives of the people, some information about the changing supplies situation.  The Minister, as we all know, dislikes the idea of coming to this House and giving information to Deputies in regard to such matters.  I know that there were occasions when he had Emergency Orders in his pocket here on days when the Dáil was sitting, and the next we heard was a speech from the Minister over the radio on the same night giving information to the public which I think should have been given through the medium of this Assembly.  I do not know what the Minister's views are in regard to democratic institutions, but, if he wants to make a contribution to the continuance of the few democratic institutions which remain in the world to-day, and this is one of them, I think he should communicate his views more freely to the representatives of the people, and through this House to the people generally.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that there is no useful purpose to be served in the State by an information bureau or propaganda department, and that things must go on in the future as they have done in the past, that is the Minister's responsibility, but co-operation could be extended to him by Deputies of all Parties if they were given the necessary information, information which is not of a secret or confidential nature.  They should be in a position to answer the reasonable questions put to them by their constituents without having to resort to the telephone or to correspondence for the purpose of getting the necessary information. I do not know whether I do my duty to my constituents in a proper way, but, since I came to this House, 98 per cent. of my work has been carried on by correspondence with the Departments concerned.  I never went around the corridors chasing either the Ministers of the last Government or this Government and wasting their time by asking them <Col N="1827" /> questions which they could not answer offhand, and had to pass on to somebody else.  I think the best way to do a Deputy's job is by communicating in the first place with the head of the Department or the Minister concerned, and letting him get the information and pass it on within a reasonable time.  I may say that, of the correspondence which I have been receiving in recent times, 50 per cent. concerns the Department of Supplies. If Deputies were furnished with more information on the activities of that Department, by way of general circulars from time to time, I think it would help them to give to the Minister and his officials that co-operation which is so necessary in carrying out their responsible duties.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>This country is suffering from a shortage of essential supplies, and if, as the Minister stated here yesterday, the transport industry of the country is in a state of collapse, I assert that that is due to the failure of private enterprise.  If the transport system of this country is collapsing, it is evidence of a convincing nature that the transport system under private enterprise cannot be carried on in an efficient way or in a manner suitable to the needs of the public.  The Minister, in dealing with this matter here yesterday, said that the shortage of petrol and rubber constituted the greatest threat to their ability to prevent a major economic crisis.  What is being done by the Ministry of Supplies, or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, or any other Ministry responsible for the supply of tyres and petrol and for the continuance of an efficient transport system in this country, to deal with that situation?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know, or do any of his colleagues know, or can the Turf Controller tell him, what is the light running mileage of the 11,000 or 12,000 lorries registered in this country at the moment?  Has he any idea of the effect of having lorries carrying turf from the bogs to the cities and returning light? I assert that there is a considerable wastage of petrol in that way, and if there is any desire on the part of the <Col N="1828" /> Government, and particularly on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Supplies, to save petrol, they will have to face up in the immediate future to the question of some central control and supervision over the operations of the road services.  It is a terrible state of affairs to find that there are thousands of tons of traffic in the City of Dublin which cannot be handled by a railway company that is short of good coal, and short of rolling stock, while at the same time the lorries that are bringing turf up here all the year round over distances of over 80, 100 or 120 miles, are returning light over the same roads.</P>
    <P>I am assured by people who know more about rail and road transport than I do that heavy lorries with an average load of four tons of turf run at the rate of ten miles to the gallon, while on the return journey the consumption of petrol is equivalent to 12 miles to the gallon.  Take a lorry returning light over 120 miles or 85 miles.  I am using those figures for the purpose of finding out what is the cost of light running over those distances.  What is the cost of the light running of a commercial lorry capable of carrying four tons of turf?  It uses seven gallons of petrol, under present day methods of operating, on a journey of 85 miles.  That costs about £1.  Deputy Belton knows more about the cost of petrol and the cost of operating road services than I do, but if, for the sake of argument, a lorry running light over a distance of 85 miles consumes seven gallons of petrol, that is the equivalent of £1.</P>
    <P>If the capacity of the lorry is four tons, 5/- per ton has to be added to the cost of carrying turf over that distance to the price the consumer pays here in the city, apart altogether from the wastage of petrol which should be carefully guarded for the purpose of giving it to persons who may be badly in need of it to-day.</P>
    <P>If the cost of turf is to be increased by 5/- a ton, and by 9/- per ton on the longer distance of 120 miles light running, is that not a serious matter for the Minister, who is personally responsible for fixing the price of turf to the poor people who have to pay 64/- per ton for it in the City of Dublin?  I <Col N="1829" /> suggest to the Minister that he should get his Departmental heads, and those people outside who may be in a position to give some advice on the matter, to sit around a table in the very near future and see how the limited railway, canal and road transport can best be used to serve the needs of the community. We are going to build more canal barges at the expense of somebody for the carriage of turf from bogs in the immediate vicinity of the canals. I think that step might have been taken at any period since 1923, if there had been anybody in any of the Government Departments to give that question the consideration it needed so far back as that year.  I think it was one of the unanimous recommendations of the Railway and Canal Commission in 1923, but, of course, at that period very few people were bothering about peat development and no notice was taken of the recommendations made at that time.</P>
    <P>We are suffering from a shortage of transport and the Minister knows it better than anybody else.  There is a shortage of transport by road, rail and canal and, at the same time, we are up against the problem of replacing the tyres required for our road services. I dare say that we will not get a supply of tyres for that purpose for some long time after the emergency has ended. I do not know if the Minister can confirm that or not, but we will not get a supply of tyres immediately the war is ended.  I do not know what the petrol position is, but there are some people without petrol to-day who could do very well with it for carrying on their commercial activities, while, at the same time, we have perhaps tens of thousands of gallons wasted in the light running of lorries over the roads.</P>
    <P>When a lorry arrives in Dublin with a load, it should be an easy matter, if there was any centralised control of the transport system, if there was any one man or body of men in control of the transport position generally, to arrange that, instead of returning light, such a lorry would pick up loads here in the city to go back to the same centre, which the railway company, for reasons which I have given, are unable to handle at the moment.  Is the <Col N="1830" /> Minister aware that there are traders in this city who have to wait for days to get their stuff carried into the country by the railway, while empty lorries are chasing back to those centres and wasting petrol which might usefully be used in other directions?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance&mdash;he is Parliamentary Secretary to everybody so far as I can see&mdash;who is popularly known as the turf controller, told us a few nights ago that in some cases the cost of carrying turf on the roads of this country was as high as 35/- per ton. That is an outrageous charge, and it is more than twice the maximum charge by the railways for carrying turf from the farthest point in the country to any city or town.  That 35/- cost is due to the light running on the return journey.  That is the cause of this excessive charge about which the Parliamentary Secretary complains.  I should like the Minister, who, on the one hand, is responsible for fixing the price of turf and, on the other, for the general supervision of the transport system, to give very serious consideration to this very important question of using the available supply of transport of all kinds to the best possible advantage.  That is not being done, I assert, under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked what was to be done with the tens of thousands of tyres on private cars now lying in garages and also with the many&mdash;I am not sure how many there are, but there must be hundreds, at any rate&mdash;commercial lorries lying in these garages. Are the tyres on these vehicles to be allowed to rot?  Are the tyres on the private cars and are the commercial lorries to be used for any purpose by anybody?  I think the position is sufficiently serious&mdash;the Minister may have better information and may be able to prove I am wrong&mdash;for the Minister to commandeer all these supplies of tyres and commercial lorries and to make arrangements for using them to meet the transport needs of the moment and the greater transport needs of the coming months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> The transport situation, as the Minister said, is very serious and might at any moment lead to what he calls a major economic crisis, but I think he will agree that, when we come to the autumn months when those in charge of the transport of the country, whether road, rail or canal, will be called on to deal with the carriage of more wheat, more beet and more agricultural produce generally, he will find himself up against an extremely serious situation.  Now is the time&mdash; and not when the country is up against the serious problem&mdash;to give consideration to how these things can best be done and how we can save wastage of petrol on the light running of lorries which has been going on all over the country since the turf cutting operations commenced.</P>
    <P>One trade union official told me he had suggested to the Minister that there should be some transport advisory body set up.  I do not know whether the Minister has given that suggestion any consideration, but it is a wise suggestion which was contained in both the majority and minority reports of the Transport Tribunal set up by the Minister in 1938.  There are people in the transport business who can give good advice to civil servants and the political heads of the different Government Departments in matters of this kind, and I suggest that advantage might be taken of that opportunity to set up some advisory body, consisting of people who might give good advice and who might make the Minister's job much easier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be talking about some things which directly affect the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Supplies, has, as you know, Sir, responsibility for the allocation of petrol and the fixing of the price of turf.  I should like to know, in reference to petrol allocated for <Col N="1832" /> Army purposes, whether there is any responsibility on the Department of Supplies to supervise the use of the petrol so allocated.  Are we to understand that there is an allocation of so many tens of thousands of gallons out of the general supply to the Army, and that, when that supply is given to the Army, it is for the Army people to see how it can best be used?</P>
      <P>Is there any responsibility lying with the Department of Supplies for the manner in which petrol, allocated to the Army, is being used, or misused, if you like?  Complaints of waste of petrol by the Army have been made by some of my colleagues, and by other people to my colleagues, and these complaints have been passed on to another body, but I am satisfied that there is still a certain amount of wastage in regard to the petrol that is handed over to the Army.  I was asked recently was it a fact that three or four military lorries per day were sent out from the city here with food supplies to military outposts in the country.  I do not know if that is true, but if it is true, it is a bad state of affairs.  I think that it should not be necessary to send out more than one lorry per day with food supplies to the County Dublin military outposts.  If the matter is outside the supervision of the Minister for Supplies, then the allegation of waste of petrol by the military authorities will have to be pursued in another place and in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several speakers have dealt with the question of the shortage of tyres for cycles, and the effect that that shortage, as well as the price paid for such tyres, is having upon the country as a whole, and particularly upon those who are engaged in certain industries. There is considerable confusion in the country&mdash;in all parts of my constituency as well as elsewhere&mdash;about this question of the allocation and price of tyres.  There is a general demand, as my colleagues in the other Parties can confirm, from turf workers in every part of my constituency, stating that they are unable to get tyres at all at any price in some places, and only at a prohibitive price in other places.  I understand, from a man who is well informed on this matter, that the confusion which has occurred in some <Col N="1833" /> towns is due to the fact that in the past the tyres were allocated by a particular wholesale firm to agents in these towns and villages, that these agents in turn handed them over to other smaller cycle dealers for the purpose of enabling them to carry on their business, and that these agents for the wholesalers, who in years gone by got the allocation under a voluntary system of distribution, are now holding the tyres for their own businesses and not passing them on to the small cycle dealers to whom they used to pass them on.  Is there any way by which that system or method can be corrected, or is there any way, that can be approved by the Department of Supplies, which would enable turf workers and other workers engaged in essential industries to get a reasonable supply of tyres, which they are badly in need of?</P>
    <P>The average turf worker in my county has to travel about five miles to get to the bog, and if these people are to be left without tyres and, as a result, compelled to walk five miles to their work and five miles from it each day, it is certainly going to have a bad effect on the output of the turf workers during their working day.  At any rate, something should be done by the Ministry, or they should endeavour to think out some kind of new system that would make a reasonable supply of tyres available for turf workers and others engaged in essential industries. Deputy McCann, by way of a Parliamentary Question the other day, raised this question also, and he had a terrible complaint to make in connection with about 1,000 turf workers working in the Dublin mountains.  If the information of the Turf Controller is correct, there are 22,000 turf workers affected to a far greater extent than those working in Glencullen or any other part of County Dublin.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the present method of distributing tyres, would it be possible for him to accept from, say, the manager of a factory, a certificate that so many of his workers are badly in need of tyres, or, in the case of turf workers, a certificate from the assistant surveyor or the county surveyor to the same effect?  I assume that in present circumstances it is impossible <Col N="1834" /> for everybody who is looking for cycle tyres to get them, and therefore it is a case of giving whatever is available to the people who are mostly in need of tyres at the moment.  Somebody suggested to me that in the case of organised workers the branch secretary of the union concerned would be the person best able to judge of the requirements of one person as against another.  Well, I say that no sensible secretary of a trade union would take on such a job as that, and he would be a wise man not to do so, and I said that to a trade union person who was talking to me here this evening about that very matter.  I think, however, that the manager of a factory, or the assistant surveyor or county surveyor, might be regarded by the Minister or the Department as persons competent to give a good judgment in a matter of this kind.  At any rate, the present method of distribution is entirely unfair&mdash;that is, through the agents of the wholesaler, who used to pass on the tyres in the old days to the small traders, and who are now not doing so, for their own very good reasons. The turf workers and other workers of the kind I have mentioned must get a reasonable supply of tyres periodically if they are to do the work which they are required to do, taking into consideration the fact that in some cases they have to travel long distances to and from their work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, when he was speaking here, read out an extract which he said was sent to him by some constituent of his and which, apparently, was a quotation from <i>The Tablet</i>, in regard to the coal supply position of the railways, and particularly the Great Southern Railways Company.  This question of who is responsible, or who should be held responsible, for the collapse of our principal railway in this part of the country is a matter that has been under consideration and discussion.  It has been receiving attention for some considerable time past.  I assert that the people who are primarily responsible for the collapse of the Great Southern Railways system at the present time are the directors who were in control from the beginning of the <Col N="1835" /> emergency until the 24th February of this year.  They are the people upon whom this responsibility should be placed, in the first instance, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce has, and should be compelled to bear, his share of responsibility for that matter also.  The Minister, I dare say, when he is replying, will deal with the quotation which has been referred to by Deputy Cosgrave.  I have heard that very same statement made outside, and by responsible railway officials.  It is generally assumed-that it is the railway officials who were responsible for the mismanagement, if you like to call it that, or the collapse of our railway transport here.  It is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir; I am dealing with the question of who is mostly responsible for the collapse of our railway system here, as a direct result of the failure to get the necessary supplies to coal.  A tribunal was set up on 7th December, 1938, and on a certain date in the month of January, 1939, the then general manager of the Great Southern Railways Company came before that tribunal.  He was questioned for days&mdash;I am sure he was in the witness-box for ten days&mdash;and he produced all the evidence that he was asked to produce and that he thought it desirable on his own account to produce in order to show the bad financial position of the company and the reasons why they were not able to do certain things and why they required the permission of the Government to do certain other things.  At any rate, if one reads the report of the Transport Tribunal, it is stated there clearly that evidence was produced to show the low position in regard to stocks of coal and raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence pointed out that the shortage of coal at that particular period was due to the fact that the company had not the necessary money to purchase a reasonable quantity of coal. That evidence was in the possession of <Col N="1836" /> the Minister for Supplies and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the early part of January, 1939, several months before the outbreak of the war.  The reports containing this information were put into his hands on the 4th August, 1939.  I think the Minister should be made shoulder some part of the responsibility for not having helped the Great Sourthern Railways Company to get the necessary supply of coal, sufficient, at any rate, to carry it over the emergency period.  If steps of the kind had been taken at that time on the initiative of the directors of the company, or on the advice or at the persuasion of the Minister, the coal could have been got at one-fourth or one-fifth its present cost.  There were then plenty of ships to carry coal here as against the present position when there is no coal, and very few ships to carry it.  What I personally cannot understand is why the Great Southern Railways Company under the new system of control, which has all the necessary backing from the Minister, cannot even now get a reasonable supply of coal, while the Great Northern Railway, Company operating under the jurisdiction of this Government, can get all the good coal it wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the painful experience myself of sitting in a Great Southern train which was unable to move out of Amiens Street station on its journey to the West, while at the opposite side of the platform there were heaps of the finest coal to be seen&mdash;coal to be used not for the purpose of maintaining the transport system in that part of the country for which the Minister for Supplies has responsibility, but for the purpose of operating a highly-efficient transport system between Belfast and Dublin: for the purpose of bringing down to this State all the people up there who are badly in need of food and clothing which some of them say they cannot get in their own area.  I have seen myself, in portions of the Great Northern Railway Company's area outside of Dublin, several heaps <Col N="1837" /> of the finest coal that one could look at, particularly in Dundalk and Greenore. I have been assured by railway officials of the Great Northern Railways Company that it has a greater number of dumps of coal inside the Six County area than it has within our area.  The Minister, I think, will not deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Great Northern Railways Company, in an official statement issued about a fortnight ago, denied that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of the war the Great Northern Railways Company was in a far worse financial position than the Great Southern Railways Company and how, in view of that, was it able to get more coal than the Great Southern Railways Company, especially in view of the fact that the latter had so many bank directors on its board? I agree with the change that has been made in the system of control so far as the Great Southern Railways Company is concerned, but I would like to have an explanation from the Minister as to why he has as advisers to the new chairman of the company the four gentlemen who are mainly responsible for leaving the system without coal at the present time.  I will have an opportunity for dealing more fully with that matter on another Vote.  Since I am sure the Minister has the inside story on this matter, I would like to hear from him how it was that the Great Northern Railways Company, in view of the fact that it had less money than the Great Southern Railways Company at the beginning of the war, was able to get all the coal it needed. Will he tell us whether the British Government backed the Great Northern Company to get a supply of coal, while our Government could not back the Great Southern Railways Company to get whatever coal it required from the same source of supply?  I hope I am not asking anything unfair in secking information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like the Minister to attempt to justify when he is replying.  It is with regard to the fixing of the price for turf.  We were told the other night by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that his Department was <Col N="1838" /> not responsible for that, but rather that the Minister for Supplies was mainly responsible.  The Parliamentary Secretary went further.  He asserted, and I challenge the accuracy of the statement, that 90 per cent. of the 64/- per ton which is being paid by the people of Dublin for turf is represented by wages to workers.  I would like to have some confirmation of that statement from the Minister for Supplies, who has full responsibility for fixing the price of turf throughout the country. I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary's statement can be correct. He further said that 60 per cent. of the railway charges for carrying turf from certain areas, which he quoted, represented wages to workers, and that in some cases they had to pay 35/- per ton for carrying turf from some of the turf-cutting counties to the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Fionán Lynch">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to have the debate on turf all over again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but on this particular aspect of the turf question the Parliamentary Secretary politely, and I would say cutely, passed on the baby to the Minister for Supplies.  When we sought information on this particular point from the Parliamentary Secretary we could not get it.  I hope the Minister will oblige by giving the House some figures to show, if that be possible, that 90 per cent. of the 64/- per ton represents wages to the workers from the time the turf is cut until it is consumed in cities and towns.  I imagine that a considerable portion of the cost of carrying turf by road is represented by the cost of petrol.  I fail to see how 90 per cent. of the cost of carrying turf by road, over long distances particularly, could be represented by wages to workers.  I think that figure is entirely wrong.  The Minister can say whether it is or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to justify if he can&mdash;he made an attempt to do so on a previous occasion here&mdash; the fixing of 16/- per ton for the work performed by the distributors of turf in the City of Dublin.  I know of cases in my constituency where turf is being produced and put in clamps on the <Col N="1839" /> bogs at less than 16/- per ton.  In a paper which was published by the Engineering Association last year the figure of 13/7 per ton was given for doing that work in part of my constituency. But here in the City of Dublin the Minister has allocated 16/- per ton to the coal merchants of the city, to people who never dealt in turf in their lives and would not do so now if they could get imported coal, for the service of taking turf out of the dumps in the Phoenix Park, or at the North Wall, and bringing it to Oriel Street or some other part of the city. I think the figure is excessive.  I wonder how much of it is represented by wages to the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get what the wage figure represents in this 16/-.  Is it 90 per cent.?  I assert that it costs much more than 1/- per ton, if you fix the figure in that way, for the feeding of a horse, depreciation and the price of petrol which in some cases was used in lorries to take the turf from the dumps to consumers inside the city boundary.  I am of opinion that 16/- is an unfair allowance to make to city coal merchants when you relate that figure to the average cost for the production of turf on the bogs in the rural areas.  I know of cases where the cost of producing turf has gone up to 22/- and 22/6 per ton.  That happened on the Clonsast bog.  But even if one were to take the cost of producing turf on the Clonsast bog and relate it to the 16/- per ton which is being allowed for turf distribution in the City of Dublin, the 16/- would still, in my opinion, be an excessive figure.  I am concerned to ascertain what percentage of that figure, as well as the <Col N="1840" /> figure for carrying turf over long distances, is represented by wages to workers, and what percentage of it represents petrol and depreciation of lorries and so on.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the question of the allocation of petrol to different sections of the community. That matter has been discussed here on many occasions.  But I have come across one or two cases of hardship and perhaps the Minister would be well advised to look into these cases. I know of cases of this kind which have been submitted to the Department and rejected for reasons best known to the officials of the Department. I am only making a case now upon which the Minister can give a policy decision.  Whether he will confirm what has been done or not is a matter for himself.  I have had cases brought to my notice recently in my constituency where public health nurses have been refused the small allocation of petrol given to other nurses acting as midwives in different areas.  The public health nurses operating in my constituency are responsible for the administration of child-welfare schemes, the school inspection scheme and the monthly inspection of midwives operating in the country.  There is only a very limited number of these nurses working under the local authorities throughout the country.  I understand that in some cases they have got petrol.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this particular work might be regarded as an essential public health service and, in view of the limited number of persons involved and for the reasons I have given, I should be glad if the Minister would look into the matter and see if he can give the same small allocation of petrol to these nurses as he has already sanctioned in the case of midwives.  I have been approached by a couple of medical officers of health in my area and strongly urged to press this particular type of case. The quantity of petrol which might be allocated for that very essential and necessary public health work will not hold up the carriage of any essential commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the case <Col N="1841" /> of tailors operating in country towns and villages who, in many cases, require a very small quantity of petrol to enable them to carry on their business. The Minister will understand their business better than I can explain it.  That is a type of case which also might be reconsidered and, owing to the small quantity of petrol involved, perhaps the Minister, after consultation with his officials, might favourably review a previous decision not to grant any further allocations to these people.  In normal times, tailors are very busy at this time of the year. They have to earn their living hard. They are very popular in the places where they carry on their work, and there is a good deal of pressure behind some of the applications submitted to me by people who are badly in need of clothes and who are sympathetic to the claims of these tailors.</P>
    <P>Then there is another type of case. I do not know whether a strong case can be made for them in existing circumstances, but I have come across a number of cases where contractors doing work for local authorities and carrying out work in different areas of the counties have been deprived of the petrol which is necessary to enable them to supervise the activities of their workers.  I know of one case where the contractor has shut down his business and put his men out of work because he could not get a supply of petrol to enable him to get from one job to another to supervise the men engaged on them.  If the petrol supply position improves in the near future, I think cases of that kind might be favourably considered, especially in existing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have in mind the case of one big contractor who has been refused a supply of petrol.  I think it is affecting contractors generally all over the country.  If the petrol position improves in the near future, I think it is a kind of case which might be favourably reconsidered, if only from the point of view of maintaining men in employment in the building industry. Then there is another class of case which affects a very large number of persons in my constitutency and in <Col N="1842" /> County Kilkenny.  For many years a large number of lorry-owners and owners of horse-drawn vehicles have been earning a livelihood carting coal from Castlecomer collieries to consumers in Laoighis, Carlow and Kilkenny.  With my colleague Deputy Pattison, I made representations several months ago in connection with this matter, but I understand a decision has been taken recently which will prevent these people from carrying on their normal work in future.  It involves about 200 carters or, with their families, about 600 persons altogether.  A matter affecting the livelihood of such a large number of people should not be decided in a light-hearted manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as rationing in concerned, I agree that there is a case for interfering with the normal activities of these particular carters.  Castlecomer collieries have been maintained by the support of people in certain parts of counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Laoighis. It is rather unfortunate that a set of circumstances should have arisen in which coal that formely went to consumers within a 15 or 20 mile radius of the collieries in the counties I have mentioned must now go to traders and others who would not touch Castlecomer coal under normal conditions.  If we have only a limited supply of native and other coal, I suppose it must be rationed in the manner best suited to the needs of essential industries and public institutions.  I should like to suggest to the Minister, however, that these carters and lorry-owners, might, with his approval, be used in future for carrying coal to places like Waterford and Kilkenny City and other places where Castlecomer coal will continue to go under the coal rationing scheme, rather than that they should be completely shut off from their normal work, which was the carrying of coal to people mainly for domestic use.  Ways and means could probably be devised to keep the majority of these people in employment.  I would be sorry to see outside lorry owners coming into Castlecomer under any new system which the Minister may devise, while the other lorry owners, who made a livelihood out of the business in the years gone by stand idly by and see <Col N="1843" /> their families in want, because of the new Order which has been recently issued by the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be a person who can put forward a detailed scheme which might receive the approval of the Minister, but I suggest that he might advise his officials to see some of the workers concerned and hear their views as to how the large number of persons concerned could be kept in employment under any new scheme which may be likely to receive his approval.  The carters and other workers, in the Castlecomer coalfields are seriously alarmed at the recent action of the Minister in this matter, and the best way out of it is to have a round-table conference with those who know the needs of the carters and those concerned and see if some scheme cannot be agreed upon which will maintain these people in their business for the period of the emergency and put them in a position to provide for themselves and their dependents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing to be said in favour of the officials of the Department of Supplies, at any rate, and that is that when they are approached about certain matters they deal with them with politeness and expedition.  That is a thing which I cannot say about all the other Departments of the State and, in consequence, I am glad I am able to pay that tribute at any rate to the Department of Supplies.  But I am afraid that when I have paid that tribute to the Department, everything that I can say in its favour has been said.  I think all over this country, if one were to ask the opinion of the man in the street, I believe, completely and entirely, irrespective of his political views, he would tell you that the Department has mismanaged its affairs in this country tremendously.  No matter what support the Minister may get from his Party in the Division Lobby, I rather pity the members of that Party who, compelled to support the Minister when it comes to a division, must, in their heart of hearts, behind his back, condemn him very strenuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is something to be said <Col N="1844" /> in favour of the Minister.  He is only a half-time Minister.  He has to conduct the Department of Supplies as well as the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Department of Industry and Commerce was a whole-time operation for him prior to the war.  It was, indeed, too strenuous an occupation for the present Minister for Local Government, and yet the Department of Industry and Commerce is now being run by the Minister for Supplies, and therefore, that Minister cannot give the whole of his time, possibly not even half of his time, in an endeavour to solve the most serious problems, problems which one might almost say vitally affect the welfare of the people. Surely, if any Department requires the whole attention of the very best Minister who could be found in the political Party now in power, it is the Department of Supplies, and yet we discover that so bankrupt is the Government Party in ability among all its members, so few of them are there who can be said to be men of political weight and leaning, that the Department of Industry and Commerce has had to be tacked on to the Department of Supplies&mdash;or it may be the Department of Supplies has had to be tacked on to the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;and the same Minister given charge of both.</P>
    <P>I put forward some time ago a suggestion which I would like to put forward once more.  I believe that the production and the distribution of food is really the most important problem that this country has to face.  At the moment the production of food is under the Minister for Agriculture and its distribution is under the Minister for Supplies.  In my opinion the production and distribution of food should be under the control of one person, a person who would be able to give the entire of his time to the consideration of what is best to be done for the production as well as for the distribution of food.  Since there is not such a person in the House at the moment, I do not see any reason why we should not recognise that fact and why, in the interests of the country, we should not go outside the House in order to find such a man.  It has been regularly done in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> If we take into consideration the last war and this war, we will observe that men completely unknown to the public, a man like Lord Davenport in the last war, and in this war a man like the person in charge of food distribution in England at the moment, were selected for those positions.  They were men who took no part in political life at all. Lord Beaverbrook may have been a politician, but he was not prominently identified with politics.  Yet, at the moment that there is need for calling in outside men to face new problems, in England at any rate, there is no hesitation in calling in that outside ability.  Considering that neither agriculture nor supply has been so managed as to give satisfaction and confidence to this country, in my view at any rate, the time has come when a man of ability outside this House, outside the Seanad even, should be put in charge of the production and distribution of food and that the country might have complete confidence that, without any secondary consideration, that person was giving his whole attention to those vital matters.</P>
    <P>Production, I cannot deal with now. The production of food is really more important than the distribution of food, but it hardly arises, I think, on the Vote for the Minister for Supplies.  But the distribution of food, the matter of deciding what food is necessary and how it is to be distributed, is a matter which comes under the Department of Supplies.  The Minister, with great self-complacency, in introducing this Estimate talked about shipping and about how much had been done by our native-owned ships to ease the present situation.  I, personally, would have thought that shipping would have been rather a sore subject with the Minister. I would have though that shipping would have been one of the subjects to which he would like least to have allusion made because, in my judgement, at any rate, one of the cardinal mistakes, possibly the cardinal mistake, that this Government have made is that they did not provide native shipping in time.  That may not be entirely the fault of the Minister for Supplies&mdash;that may be more the fault of the Head of the Government; it is <Col N="1846" /> to the Head of the Government one naturally locks for big ideas&mdash;but it is one of the things which the Minister for Supplies should have considered and, if anything has been bungled, it has been that shipping question.</P>
    <P>When this war broke out in September, 1939, this House was immediately assembled.  When this House discussed the matter and discussed the situation, I pointed out to the Ministers that this was a golden opportunity for becoming owners of a mercantile marine.  I pointed out that a country situated like we are situated ought to be a great carrying nation.  I further pointed out that, President Roosevelt having at that time prevented American ships coming into the war zone, there were ships to be had comparatively cheaply.  That was the time in which the mercantile marine should have been started.  It was then that I advised that a mercantile marine should be started but it was not started.  I claim no prescience for that.  I do not claim any wonderful foresight for that.  I think any man with ordinary intelligence, who put his mind to it, could have seen that in 1939, when war broke out, a shipping fleet would be required and that that was a splendid opportunity American ships being on the market.  But it was not done.  It took many, many months indeed before that elementary truth broke in upon the mind of the Minister for Supplies, and when it was finally and belatedly decided&mdash;though I grant you, better late than never&mdash; that a small fleet would be purchased, then it was almost impossible to get ships because the ships which, in the autumn of 1939, were available for sale had been purchased by the British Government.  Instead of talking, as the Minister did, of how satisfied he is with the present Irish fleet, what the Minister should have done was to have dressed himself in sackcloth and ashes and apologised to this House that he had not purchased an Irish native marine at least a year before he did so, if not more than a year and, when it was possible, fill the granaries and the coalyards of this country with commodities which were necessary and which anybody could have foreseen <Col N="1847" /> were needed for the well-being of this country in a protracted war.</P>
    <P>But it is not merely in the general conception of its work that this Department seems to be very unhappy. Even when you come down to details their schemes are not worked out in anything approaching to a satisfactory manner.  Let us take the very simple problem of tea.  I am getting from my constituency many, many complaints as to the way in which tea has been distributed to the retail dealers.  Persons were told to register themselves with certain shops.  They did so and a great number of them now find that they cannot get tea from the shops with which they are registered because, for some extraordinary reason which I cannot understand, tea is not sent to the retailers according to the number of persons who are registered with them; tea is sent to the retailers quite irrespective of the present number of their customers, on a basis of the amount of tea which they received at some period some time ago.  Why distribution cannot be put upon a commonsense basis, why tea should not be supplied to the retailer in proportion to the number of persons registered with him, is a matter which I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is the slightest danger of that.  I do not think that an English firm would have the slightest fear of losing its customers because the customers to whom it supplied tea were compelled to transfer it to somebody else.  Consider the situation which the Minister says is insoluble.  I take it <Col N="1849" /> from the Minister the problem I have put to him is a problem which he considers insoluble and the simple little problem is this&mdash;that one person is getting more tea than he can legitimately sell, another person is not getting the amount of tea which he is entitled to get if he is to supply his customers. The Minister says it is quite impossible to get a solution of that problem.  It seems to me that if the Minister put his mind to work for just a half an hour he would not find very much difficulty in getting two or three satisfactory solutions.  I suggested just one to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In a great many cases you cannot transfer the customer. If a man is dealing with a travelling shop and if it comes a distance of eight or ten miles the customer cannot walk that distance into a town to buy tea.  He must buy it at the nearest shop.  Why the whole problem cannot be treated as one and the entire supplies put into one pool is what beats me.  If it is said that English suppliers will not send tea here if it has to be sent to one Irish pool, then I should like to know if they have definitely refused to do so, or if they were ever approached about doing so.  One of the matters most in the public mind within the last fortnight is the rationing of clothes and the issuing of coupons.  The Minister made a somewhat vigorous attack on drapers and on drapers' assistants, because they organised and held a procession, but as a result of their organisation the Minister altered his original Order.  I think the Minister was perfectly right in making the alteration. It is a bad thing, if an agitation is groundless, that persons in the position of Ministers should yield to such agitation but it is very unfortunate that in this instance the agitation <Col N="1850" /> was not groundless but was well grounded, and because it was well grounded the Minister was wise in yielding.  I hope that a lesson will be learned from that, a lesson from which it will be very important for the Government to learn.  The lesson is this, that hasty and ill-advised measures should not be taken, that mere theory is not sufficient when dealing with the facts of every-day life.  A man might read every book and learn every single thing that could be learned about horsemanship but, put him upon a horse, and he will fall off at the first fence.  It is exactly the same with the Minister and his Department.  They know all about the theory, and they work out the theory, but they are not in touch with the actual facts, and not in touch obviously with people who know the actual facts.  They work out their schemes on paper but they do not see what the repercussion will be when they are put into operation.  They are theorists purely and simply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When important measures of this kind are under consideration, and have to be introduced, it is obvious that those who know the situation, those whose lives are spent in that particular class of industry, are the persons who ought to be consulted first of all.  If their views are not taken the Minister, as a theorist in the practical affairs of real life, comes a cropper. To use my metaphor again, he tries to ride a horse, having merely read books on horsemanship, and at the first fence he goes over, and I think he is still feeling bruised and sore.  I know that the answer put forward by the Minister was that there would be a terrific rush for clothing, and that it would be all bought up if he had consulted persons in the trade.  The answer is that there was an extraordinary rush.  The very fact that the man in the street knew about it a week before was proof conclusive.  As far as securing secrecy was concerned, the Minister secured no secrecy.  It was as publicly known as it could be. There was no struggle between the interests of purchasers and suppliers.  It was the business of drapers in their own interests to have supplies for as many customers as possible in order to keep business going.  Their interests <Col N="1851" /> were indentical.  Possibly there was a difference as to the price, and that customer would like to buy cheaper while sellers would like to sell dearer, but so that the business could be carried on the interests of drapers and customers were the same.  That persons who had a knowledge of the facts and who could not take a one-sided view in their own interests should not have been consulted seems to me to have shown great inability on the part of the Minister to act as a practical man of affairs.</P>

      <P>In introducing the Estimate the Minister proposed in order to guide the House or, as he put it, not to mix the two Departments with which he was concerned, to set out a list of the functions with which the Department of Supplies is primarily concerned.  He stated that the first function was to secure supplies from abroad; the second one was the transport of these suppliers; the third one was the control of internal distribution, and the fourth one the regulation of prices.  In every one of these functions the Minister's Department has failed completely.  He failed to purchase supplies from abroad in the early stages of the war.  I do not agree with, or support, the people who claim that the Minister for Suppliers should have laid in enormous quantities of wheat, tea and other supplies prior to the outbreak of war.  I do not think that that was possible, nor do I think that, in doing so, he would have the measure of public support which would be necessary.  But he, certainly, failed in the first year of the war to purchase the supplies that should have been purchased.</P>

      <P>During the past 12 months, a considerable quantity of tea was purchased in India and the fact that that tea was purchased too late is a condemnation of the Minister's Department.  We know that, during the present year, a very large quantity of wheat was purchased.  That is was not possible, or considered wise, to purchase a similar quantity earlier is also a condemnation of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why, if it was possible during the past year to purchase ships, it was not possible to purchase them more cheaply at an earlier period.  In that respect the Minister has also failed.  We have now a very small mercantile fleet on which we have to depend for all essential supplies which have to be brought into the country.  Because of the small number of ships available, many essential supplies cannot be imported. That, again, is a condemnation of the Minister's Department.  The third function of the Minister's Department <Col N="1853" /> is to could internal distribution.  It is extraordinary that, while the distribution of tea is supposed to be regulated by the Minister's Department, very considerable quantities of tea can be purchased at prices four or five times higher than the fixed price.</P>

      <P>In virtually every town and village what is known as the &ldquo;dear tea&rdquo; or &ldquo;black-market tea&rdquo; is being purchased, and people are asking where it is coming from.  It can hardly be all coming across the Border.  There is a strong feeling that this is tea which has been legitimately imported and afterwards diverted to the black market.  The Minister has admitted that certain retailers are getting more tea than they require for the needs of their registered customers, and that other retailers are getting considerably less than they require.  It would seem, therefore, that there must be a surplus of tea in the hands of some people.  It would be interesting to know what is happening to that tea, and if some of it is not the tea which is being sold at from 25/- to 30/- per lb.  That represents one of the failures of the Department of Supplies to regulate internal distribution.</P>
      <P>Though, last year, there was a tremendous increase in the acreage under oats and barely, though an enormous quantity of oats was produced and a very large quantity purchased by merchants and other dealers, nevertheless, the people who required that oats for conversion into oatmeal for human consumption were unable to obtain one-tenth of their requirements.  That was another failure on the part of the Department of Supplies to regulate internal distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the provision of food for human beings is more important than the provision of food for live stock, it was absolutely necessary that the price of the oats required for human consumption should have been higher than that for oats required for live stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not recollect that six months ago the main contention in a debate in this House was that the price of oatmeal was too high.  Deputy after Deputy voiced that complaint.  I am sure that Deputy Cogan did likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the price is high it is bad enough, but if oatmeal is not to be had at any price, it is worse.  The result of the Minister's operations was that oatmeal was not obtainable in many districts at any price.  In addition, the shortage led to the marketing of oatmeal in bags at a price far above the price fixed by the Minister for loose oatmeal.  If the supply had been adequate, I believe that the price would not have been at all as high as it was during the past year.  Lastly, we have the Minister's statement that it is the function of his Department to regulate prices.  As far as the average man in the street can observe, there has been very inadequate regulation or control of the prices of essential goods.  I have known cases of poor people paying as much as 30/- per lb. for tea.  They may have been fools, but in one particular case, in a small farmer's house, there was a wake, and it would have been unusual for the people not to provide tea.  They had no alternative and, whether they were wise or not, they had to purchase it at the high price.  Cases like that will occur.  Then there is the position of people who have to travel long distances to work on the bogs or on the roads and for them there is no real substitute for tea, which they must buy at whatever price is charged.  Surely, there should be much more effective control over prices than has been attempted up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, reference was made to the need for the display of price lists in <Col N="1855" /> every retail establishment.  There has been some improvement in that respect, but quite a number of small retailers throughout the country who specialise in black-market products very rarely display a price list.  The Minister may say that the people have a remedy, that they should not deal with such persons, but when the goods are there and people require them, they must get them.  A case was brought to my notice in which a woman was charged, for tea and some other groceries, more than double the cost. The total amount would have been less than 10/-.  Being glad to obtain the goods, she handed the shopkeeper £1 without asking the prices, and he said: &ldquo;That is quite all right.&rdquo;  There was no change.  She immediately went to the local Gárdaí and stated her case; but the particular businessman, having reason to suspect her intention to report the case, was ready when she returned, had her bill and change ready on the counter, and said: &ldquo;My dear woman, you must be very foolish; you left your change and bill on the counter.&rdquo;  So nothing could be done in that particular case.</P>
    <P>When supplies are short, the regulation of prices is very difficult and requires the whole-time and energetic activities of somebody specially trained in the work.  I hold&mdash;and I have stated it before&mdash;that it is highly desirable that, in every Gárda sub-district, one member of the local Gárdaí should be appointed to look after prices and supplies generally.  Just as there is a food and drugs inspector in the Gárda Síochána, there should also be a supplies inspector in every district, who would make a special study of that particular work and who would concentrate on it almost exclusively. That would help to secure some improvement in the regulation of prices and would also ensure more equitable distribution of supplies.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for officials here in Dublin to have close and intimate knowledge of the requirements of every person who applies for a permit to purchase licensed commodities. It is absolutely essential to have in every area a man with good local knowledge.  For example, the <Col N="1856" /> allowance of kerosene is made in respect of each threshing set.  That is a reasonable method of allocation; but it is well known that one particular threshing set may be doing as much work as two or three others.  Somebody with local knowledge is needed to investigate the claims of applicants and ensure that the person carrying on extensive threshing operations will get his requirements and that the person doing only his own threshing and a little more will not get the same amount.</P>
    <P>I know there are forms to be filled, giving the names of the persons for whom the threshing is to be done and that a lot of other particulars are required.  It is absolutely impossible for the owner of a threshing set to form any accurate idea as to his customers for the coming season, so such an arrangement would not meet the case. A local officer of the Department of Supplies, or a local Gárda specially authorised to investigate such matters, would be able to give really reliable information and ensure a fair distribution of kerosene.</P>
    <P>I have been forced to condemn the operations of the Department of Supplies in the main matters with which they have been called upon to deal; but I recognise the very great difficulties of carrying the population of this country through the emergency and of ensuring that supplies will be kept up; and I have no desire to do anything but help the Minister for Supplies in the difficult task allotted to him.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why such essentials as iron for the shoeing of horses should not be made available.  We realise that our mechanical transport system is breaking down.  The Minister has stated, I think, that supplies of rubber hardly can be expected to last over another year.</P>
    <P>Now that the failure of mechanical transport is threatened, the only alternative is horse transport.  In addition, the horse is the main source upon which we have to depend for the cultivation of the soil and the production of food.  Therefore one would imagine that adequate steps would be taken to ensure that ample supplies of iron would be made available for horseshoeing. <Col N="1857" /> Nevertheless, we find that over a very large portion of the country iron of any kind is not available. The Minister has stated that when the foundry in Haulbowline is in working order, some supplies will be available, but in the meantime steps should be taken to secure supplies of scrap which would be suitable for horse-shoeing wherever they are to be found.  In some areas scrap of the particular kind that can be used for shoeing is available but there are other areas where there are no supplies at all.  Some steps should be taken by the Department to collect supplies where they are available and bring them to districts where they are required.  Every kind of scrap, of course, is not suitable for shoeing horses.  I understand there is a fixed price for scrap iron and I do not think that that helps in any way because a price that would be quite reasonable for the average type of heavy scrap iron might not be at all reasonable for light iron bars suitable for horseshoeing or work of that kind.  Therefore I think a specially increased price should be provided for the type of iron that can be used by smiths for horseshoeing.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of smiths' coal.  I understand that at present there are some supplies of smiths' coal in this country in the hands of distributors or merchants who have been compelled by the Department to refrain from distributing these supplies. They have been sealed up for some reason or other.  I should like if the Minister would inform us what is the quantity of coal so held up and if he will take steps to make it available to smiths while it lasts, because it is particularly desirable at present, having regard to the inferior quality of iron which smiths have to use in shoeing, that they should be permitted to use the best type of coal available.</P>
    <P>It is hardly possible to pass from horse-shoes without mentioning horses. Every farmer is aware that for the past year a very large number of horses has been exported from this country, particularly young and untrained horses of the agricultural type.  I should like the Minister to investigate <Col N="1858" /> this matter and to see if those exports are so great as to constitute a danger of diminishing supplies to such an extent that there will not be sufficient horses in the country, should it be necessary to increase horse transport and the use of horses generally owing to the failure of mechanical transport. I asked a question recently as to the number of horses being exported at present and how it compared with normal times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At any rate it does not really matter as I did not get the information I asked, on the ground that it is not in the public interest to announce the figures at present as to exports of different commodities or live stock.  I believe it is possible that the number of young horses being exported from the country is altogether too great.  I should like if the Minister would look into this matter so as to ensure that there will be a sufficient supply to carry on farming operations and transport operations in the event of mechanical transport breaking down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of rubber supplies.  As everyone knows, there is no possibility of importing rubber and the question therefore arises of utilising to the best advantage whatever supplies of rubber are within the country.  In this connection I should like to offer the Minister a suggestion, namely, that where scrap rubber is available which is unsuitable for the manufacture of the ordinary balloon tyres for lorries, cars or buses, it might be utilised for the manufacture of solid tyres which might provide a substitute in the event of everything else failing for lorry transport.  I am also anxious to know what steps are being taken to promote the increased manufacture of producer gas plants for lorries.  There seems to be no reason why manufacture <Col N="1859" /> of producer gas plants should not have been carried out on a much larger scale during the past few years than it has been.  While some people may consider it desirable to have such plant made available for private cars, I think it should be confined mainly to lorries and might also be provided for bus traffic in the event of other sources of power not being available.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that having regard to the manner in which transport must be carried on in this country, having regard to the distances it is necessary to transport wheat and beet, the failure or breakdown of road transport by lorry would be one of the most serious problems which this country could be called upon to face.  Anything that could be done by the manufacture of solid tyres or the provision of increased supplies of producer gas plants, should receive the urgent attention of the Minister at the moment.  We cannot under any circumstances allow the foodstuffs which the farmers are producing to be left on their hands and the population of our towns and cities to be left hungry owing to any avoidable breakdown in our transport system.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>During my speech on the Vote for the Minister's Department, we had an intervention by the Minister to the effect that if local authorities were not prepared to do their work they could get out.  I subscribe to those sentiments, provided always that a fair and impartial and independent investigation is made into the working of the local authority.  If there is found to be incompetence or dereliction of duty on the part of the local authority, they should go.  With many new social services in recent years, efficiency and economy in local administration are needed now more than ever, and, in order to be efficient and effective in their work, the local authority needs the co-operation and assistance of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> On this matter that I raised by way of Parliamentary Question to-day, I think the attitude of the Minister and his Department is a very serious reflection on the work and efficiency of the local authority in the town of Carlow.  For quite a long time the citizens of that town had been complaining of the condition of the water, and I myself had personal experience of it, because I had occasion to go into the local hotel for food, and I heard strangers in that hotel commenting time and time again on the shocking condition of the water in an important provincial town like Carlow.  It suffered off and on from discoloration and bad taste for a long period, to my personal knowledge. After the suspension of this man, I noticed a marked improvement in the water during the period when the temporary caretaker was in charge of the waterworks.  Now I must say that I do not know this man, Mr. Curran, and neither do I know his substitute. I am satisfied that there was nothing personal whatever in the action of the local authority.  They were unanimous in their decision to have this caretaker suspended.  At a great many of their meetings they had had serious complaints as to the condition of the water.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reply made by the Parliamentary Secretary, when he suggested that investigation was made of the one specific complaint in regard to the night of November 10th. In the case of a man in that type of job, I think the local authority would be unreasonable to suspend him for one offence, but there had been a series of charges against him, and complaints had been made by the people of the town generally over a period.  Finally, they decided that the matter had reached a head on this particular occasion, when the town of Carlow found itself without water on the morning of 11th November.  Those complaints went very far back.  I have here an extract from the report of Professor Purcell, who was consulting engineer to the local authority at the time.  The report is dated 18th November, 1935. Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret to report that when I visited the filter house on the 12th <Col N="1861" /> October, I found the inspection bowls in a dirty condition and the pipe for delivering the raw water to the inspection bowl choked and out of action, although it only took 15 minutes to clear it and get it working again....  Curran, the waterworks caretaker, states that the steel filter shells have not been painted since they were handed over in 1928. While they are in good condition, they require a thorough scraping and painting with a suitable bituminous paint.  I wrote about this to the borough surveyor in August, 1934.  The metal window sashes also require painting badly.  Some of the timber hatches over the manhole openings are in a neglected and rotten condition, and one is dangerous and should be renewed.  I could not open the door into the clear water tank as a swarm of bees had been left in peaceful possession. The washing of the mechanical filters does not appear to have been done regularly and in the way that it should be, but in the absence of the proper records it is difficult to say much on the point.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is from Professor Purcell, an eminent engineer here in the City of Dublin, who was responsible for recommending the appointment of this man in the first instance.  I was speaking to Professor Purcell on the matter within the last few days and he said: &ldquo;Unfortunately, I was responsible for recommending his appointment in the first instance, and I am satisfied that he has not proved a success.&rdquo;  Now, Professor Purcell had no ulterior motive; in fact he would be most anxious that the man he recommended to this position should prove a success, but he gives it as his opinion that he had not made a success of the job.  The engineering inspector consulted nobody in the town, not even the county medical officer.  He consulted no member of the local authority.  He consulted only the borough surveyor, and the borough surveyor, as well as the caretaker, had been reprimanded by the local authority because he had failed to keep the waterworks in a proper condition. On 14th November, 1941, the local authority passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" />&ldquo;That, in view of the repeated complaints regarding the water supply made by members at meetings of the council for a considerable time past, culminating in the complete failure of the water supply to the town on Tuesday morning, 11th inst., we are now satisfied that the borough surveyor has not discharged his duties with regard to the supervision of the caretaker of the waterworks, and that the whole condition of the waterworks and the water supply reflects great discredit on him as an engineer, and we consider that the samples of water submitted here by him to-night are proof of this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of this resolution, I think the Parliamentary Secretary could not hold at all that the Minister's duty lay in investigating a particular incident only, the failure of the water on a particular night.  As I said before, I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary could seriously suggest that the man's competence or incompetence could be judged by one particular incident in regard to his work as waterworks caretaker.</P>
    <P>One particular incident might happen to the best man in the world, but there had been a series of incidents, and time and time again he had been warned by the local authority that he failed to do his job.  As far back as 1935, the report of an eminent independent engineer like Professor Purcell, that a swarm of bees had been left in peaceful possession of the filter house door, and that he could not get in until he removed the bees, shows whether or not this man was doing his job.  The borough surveyor in his defence&mdash;he had to defend himself as well as the caretaker &mdash;suggested that there was a peat development over the water in-take in Ardeteggle Bog, and that as a result a lot of mud and peat had been disturbed and came down.  He suggested that there was heavy rain that night, and that a good deal of storm water flowed into the waterworks and choked the filters.</P>
    <P>The local authority is not at all satisfied that that is so and the statement made by the borough surveyor to the Minister's inspector conflicts in more than one instance with the report. <Col N="1863" /> made to the local authority.  It is stated, for instance: &ldquo;Mr. MacDermott, when questioned by the council at the meeting on 14th November, said that he had knocked up the caretaker and got him to open the filter-house.&rdquo; In his report to the Minister's inspector he said he opened the filter-house with his own key, so that obviously he was not stating facts.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that aspect, there are many other points contained in resolutions, which I do not want to weary the House with, but I suggest that the Minister should not make a decision as to this man's capability or efficiency or as to whether he was performing his duties properly, without an investigation over a considerable period, and, in my opinion, the best way in which that could be done was to inquire of the county medical officer as to the condition of the waterworks prior to the suspension of this man and subsequent to his suspension. There is no doubt that if he made any independent inquiries from such a man as the county medical officer, or any responsible person in the town, he would have got ample evidence to show that an improvement was effected by putting a temporary man on the job and that, in fact, no further complaints were made.</P>
    <P>Fancy an inspector investigating the work of a waterworks caretaker approximately four months after he had been suspended.  The man was suspended on 14th November, 1941, and the inspector investigated his work on 4th March, 1942, and the Minister made his decision in May.  He commented on the good appearance and condition of the waterworks generally when the waterworks had been in charge of a new man for four months. Does the Parliamentary Secretary seriously suggest that the competence or incompetence of Curran could have been judged by the condition of the waterworks four months after his suspension?  I suggest that the temporary caretaker had cleaned up the whole job, that he took an interest in his work and satisfied his employers that he was prepared to give close attention to the filters, the settling <Col N="1864" /> beds and the general condition of the waterworks.  The result was that not only the local authority but the people of the town were satisfied that, by reason of the fact that a new man had been put on the job, a very great improvement had been effected in the condition of the water.</P>
    <P>I do not know the men involved at all.  I am satisfied that the local authority were anxious, because of pressure from the townspeople, to do something to effect some improvement in the water.  I have already referred to the Minister's statement during the debate on the Vote for his Department that where a local authority was not prepared to do its job, he would simply give it the boot.  Where a local authority is prepared to do its work, it should get every assistance and encouragement from the Minister and his Department, and where a suspension is ordered by a local authority, a very thorough examination ought to be made by any inspector sent down.  I must pay this compliment to the Minister: I feel he is sincere in his anxiety and his intention to make the Departmental machine more efficient and more effective, and to speed up decisions by the Department.  I give him credit for that without any hesitation, but I want to say to him that he has here an opportunity of carrying that out, if he is satisfied that I am now making a <i>prima facie</i> case for a further investigation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Minister, will accede to the local authority's request and to my request.  It is not yet too late to have a fuller investigation into this case.  I think it is a scandal and it would be an injustice to the ratepayers of Carlow to be asked to pay a man who, as is clear to any man with an open and impartial mind, was incompetent in his work and who is now reinstated. The ratepayers are asked to pay the temporary man for practically eight months and to pay all arrears of wages, the charge being approximately £70, involving a rate of 2d. in the £ on the local ratepayers.  That is the net result of the anxiety of the local authority to do its duty and to see that an employee, a most important employee&mdash;the <Col N="1865" /> man in charge of the water for the town&mdash;does his job.</P>
    <P>There is no personal animosity of any sort on the part of any individual against this man.  His father held this position before him and every member of the local authority was anxious that, for the sake of his father, he would do his job properly.  They gave him every opportunity of doing so, but they were finally driven to suspending him.  I am satisfied that the visit by the Minister's inspector four months after the occurrence was not the proper way to investigate what occurred, and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to accede to the request of the local authority for a further investigation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have Deputy Hughes' assurance that there is nothing personal and nothing of a political nature behind this question which he has raised to-night.  I confess that, until I got the Deputy's assurance on that matter, I had grave doubts.  The Deputy gave notice at Question Time to-day that he would raise this matter on the Adjournment because of the unsatisfactory reply he had got.  I find it hard to understand what was unsatisfactory about the reply.  It was a most comprehensive reply which gave the Deputy all the information at my disposal in the Department.  It made no attempt to withhold any information available, and it dealt fully with every point the Deputy raised in his question. Yet he considered it unsatisfactory, and one would be tempted to believe that it was only unsatisfactory in so far as it so completely answered the points made by the Deputy, and that it would be more satisfactory to him if a reply had been given which failed in many respects to deal with the points he had raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He speaks to-night about the delay in sending down an inspector to carry out this investigation.  There is no getting away from the fact that the delay, in normal circumstances, would be entirely unjustifiable.  In ordinary circumstances I think it would be entirely wrong to have a man under suspension for four months before it was definitely determined that the suspension was to be removed and he <Col N="1866" /> was to be restored to office.  Deputy Hughes ought to bear in mind that we are not operating any Department of Government under normal conditions at the present time.  The staff of my Department has been very seriously depleted by reason of the inroads that have been made on it to provide staffs for the other Departments that had to be set up as a result of the emergency, and for augmenting the staffs of such Departments as have more onerous duties to discharge during this period than in normal times.  If I had an unlimited staff at my disposal, if there was no limit to the number of engineering inspectors, medical inspectors, and general inspectors in the Department of Local Government and Public Health, we could send down an inspector to investigate any matter calling for investigation, certainly within the week that a complaint would be made, but, hampered as we are by depleted staffs, we just cannot deal with a minor matter of this kind&mdash; well, perhaps it would not be fair to describe it as a minor matter: to Deputy Hughes it appears to be a major matter, but to me, with the information at my disposal, it appears to be of lesser importance than many of the problems with which our engineers are engaged at the present time.  So much for the question of delay.</P>

      <P>There may have been numerous local complaints.</P>

      <P>Well, I know nothing about that, but I do know that the local authority did not make complaints to my Department.  Deputy Hughes refers to a report from the consulting engineer, away back in 1935.  Apparently, in 1935, this man was not discharging his duties as he should have been.  I have no doubt that Deputy Hughes's representation of the consulting engineer's report of that time is accurate, but Deputy Hughes comes along to-night and talks about the efficiency of this local authority, the Carlow Urban Council, and suggests that when we have a highly-efficient body such as this, their style is being cramped by the action of the Ministry of Local Government.  I, however, find it difficult to reconcile that attitude and the probity of this particular council, being aware since 1935 that this man had been unsatisfactory in the discharge of his duties&mdash;all of which is news to me&mdash;with the fact that, in 1940, the same council unanimously decided to increase the man's salary, which the Minister refused to sanction.  One would have thought that that urban council, which is so conscientious and efficient in the discharge of its duties, would say to the Minister that instead of increasing the man's salary he should be got rid of altogether because he was not doing his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-night, Deputy Hughes couples the town surveyor with the caretaker of the waterworks, and I gathered from Deputy Hughes that the town surveyor is equally inefficient&mdash;in fact, it is doubtful if he is even as reliable, according to Deputy Hughes' representation, as the caretaker of the waterworks, in his own sphere.  If that is the position, the charges have not <Col N="1868" /> been made against the town surveyor until to-night.  The question related to the caretaker of the waterworks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the local authority pass a resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, never mind that: I am dealing with the question that was on the Order Paper and the reply to it, which the Deputy got to-day, and the town surveyor is not referred to in the question.  However, on the 9th September, the caretaker and the town surveyor reported to the urban council that the unsatisfactory condition of the water supply was due to the fact that the chemicals used in treating the water had all been used up, and that supplies were awaiting transport from Dublin.  Apparently, at that time, it was the quality and not the quantity of the water that was unsatisfactory, and the council marked that report &ldquo;noted&rdquo;.  Now, one would think that if what Deputy Hughes states here to-night represented the actual position, they would take more vigorous action to draw the attention of the Minister to the condition of affairs than merely to note the report of the town surveyor and the caretaker.  No action was taken that would indicate that the urban council had in any way lost confidence in the town surveyor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, coming to the 11th November, when the water failed, if the town surveyor cannot be relied upon, well, then, my Department has been misled all along the line.  The town surveyor, however, is satisfied, and so long as he is in office we must pay reasonable attention, at any rate, to his version of engineering matters.  He informed our inspector, and he reports to the Department, in reply to our letter, that in his opinion the choking of the filters was due to abnormal floods that had occurred the night before.  Now, Deputy Hughes may say that there was no rain that night at all.  He has not said so; he has avoided that issue.  If, however, it was in fact a particularly stormy night and there was a very heavy rainfall, and if mud and debris were washed into the filters, it is quite understandable that they would be choked on the day of the 11th.  It is a significant fact&mdash;and I do <Col N="1869" /> not think it is denied&mdash;that on that same morning the pumps that supply the local sugar beet factory with water were also choked with mud and debris. Now, I think that the caretaker was scarcely responsible for that, and neither was the town surveyor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must remember that the supply for the beet sugar factory is from the River Barrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to convey to Deputy Hughes and to the House is that on the particular morning that the town water supply failed, an independent supply to the sugar beet factory also failed, and the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting to Deputy Hughes and to the House that the same cause operated in both cases, namely, that the heavy rainfall washed mud and debris in and choked the filters in the one case as it choked the pump in the other.  It is also a significant fact that the reports of the insurance company's inspectors are to the effect that the plant was getting good attention.  According to the reports of the representatives of the insurance company, the plant was being properly looked after, and the reports of the local engineer, on which we have to rely, are to the same effect.  He says that since he took office in 1939&mdash;he took office in March, 1939&mdash;there had been no evidence of neglect on the caretaker's part, and he goes on to say that he had kept the operations of the filter-house in excellent condition.  He suggests that heavy rains had caused the stoppage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, an inspector goes down and makes his inquiries, and he is satisfied that the explanations of the caretaker and the town surveyor are reasonable and that the balance of probability is on their side.  The balance of probability being on their side, the Minister, when he studies these reports, has to decide, in all justice, that in such circumstances the suspension should be removed.  The Minister or his inspectors have no interest whatever <Col N="1870" /> in trying to humiliate the local authority or to inflict upon them officials that are in any way inefficient. If I were fully satisfied that this man was not discharging his duties properly, I would not have a moment's hesitation in taking the necessary steps to rid him of his position, and neither would I have the slightest hesitation in having the town surveyor removed, but a full investigation has been carried out and no additional evidence has been submitted.  Deputy Hughes talks about a sworn inquiry, but that would not bring out any more evidence than is available to me, and the evidence goes to show that there has been no neglect on this man's part.  That being the case, there was no alternative, in justice to the man concerned, except to remove the suspension.  I do not know anything about him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no interest in him whatever beyond trying to see that he does get fair play.  I grant that it is a suspicious circumstance that the urban council are unanimous in their desire to get rid of him, but at the same time I cannot get away from the fact that the same council, 12 months ago, were unanimous in their desire to increase his salary.</P>
