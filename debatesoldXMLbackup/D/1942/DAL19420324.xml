      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether he has received requests from the Dublin Corporation, dated 9th and the 11th February, to receive a deputation of its members to discuss the question of food and fuel, also the use of the cooking equipment in the Mansion House for the purpose of cooking meals for the citizens and their children; and, if so, whether in view of the existing emergency he proposes to receive the deputation.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part I set out my views in a letter sent to the City Manager on the 14th instant, which, no doubt, will be communicated to the Dublin City Council in due course.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Blind Persons' Pensions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he proposes to amend the means test clause of the Pensions Act so as to enable the Dublin Corporation to give effect to their committee's recommendations to grant a 20 per cent. increase to blind persons receiving inadequate payments; if he is aware that sanction to pay these increases has been withheld, and that permission to pay increased allowances to meet the increase in the cost of living depends entirely on amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In calculating the means of a person for old age pension purposes, account is taken, <i>inter alia</i>, of the income which that person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year in cash, excluding certain items specifically exempted by law.  The rate of pension payable per week is based on the yearly means of the pensioner.  An increase in a cash allowance paid to a blind person might disentitle him to the rate of pension of which he is in receipt, and steps would then have to be taken to reduce his pension to the appropriate rate.  I do not propose to amend the law regarding allowances in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply means that the corporation cannot increase the allowances to blind pensioners by the 20 per cent. already passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The corporation were informed, through the usual channels, that they could, if they wished, increase the benefits in kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is stated in the letter from the Department of Local Government which I have in front of me.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to state that the Minister is advised that such increase would be taken into account as part of the income of the blind person save to <Col N="5" /> the extent to which the increase might be exempt from being so reckoned under Section 2 of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1938.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is turning them down completely, and will prevent the corporation giving them this 20 per cent. increase to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is not fully aware of the situation because the City Manager was informed that, while an increase in cash might result in a reduction of pension, no account would be taken of benefits in kind, such as food or fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that the corporation has received a letter in accordance with his last statement&mdash;that we can give allowances in kind?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that stoppages of work occurred on certain employment schemes in parts of Mayo during the past winter.  The rate of wages paid on employment schemes on public roads in County Mayo is that paid on the ordinary county council road works, and the rate for minor relief employment schemes is related to that paid to agricultural labourers.  The season for the execution of employment schemes is virtually at an end, and the question of the wages payable on minor employment schemes will again receive consideration in regard to agricultural wages rates before the 1942-43 season commences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that a hitch in the distribution of bakers' bread on Saturday, the 14th March, caused queues of large numbers of people to assemble all over Dublin outside shops selling bread, in one case on the south side of Dublin there being 520 persons waiting for supplies at 1.30 p.m.; if he is aware that on Monday, the 16th March, bread steaming hot was sold in Dublin and in many cases in insufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the families who largely depend on bread as the principal article of food and if, in view of these circumstances, he will issue ration cards and grant supplies commensurate with the needs of the people and so prevent the hardships of waiting and the suspense and fear of deprivation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that on Saturday, 14th March, queues formed outside certain bakers' shops in Dublin and I had a special investigation made as to the <Col N="7" /> reason for these queues.  I find it was not due to any dislocation in the delivery arrangements of the bakers nor to shortage of supplies of bread. In fact, more than normal supplies of bread were available at these particular shops and the queues formed about the time mentioned by the Deputy with the object apparently of procuring freshly baked bread immediately on delivery.  The question of issuing official rationing cards for bread is being considered and, meanwhile, the Dublin bakers have adopted a system of registration of their own customers, but I doubt if, in view of the reason for the queues, official ration cards will remove them entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say when it is likely that ration cards for this purpose will be issued, because even this morning there were queues outside the bread shops?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that the queues outside the bread shops are not due to any scarcity of bread, but are due entirely to the people forming the queues waiting to get fresh bread when it arrives.  That will not be changed by the issuing of ration cards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that there is an acute shortage of smith's coal and shoeing iron in the Castleblayney area of County Monaghan; and, if so, whether he will take steps to relieve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from various parts of the country, including Castleblayney, about the shortage of smith's coal. The position in regard to coal imports is that, with the exception of small amounts of gas coal and anthracite, all the coal now made available is indistinguishable from low volatile steam coal and consists mostly of slack.  I am not, therefore, in a position to find supplies of smith's coal for blacksmiths who will be obliged to arrange to carry on their business through the medium of the types of coal now available.  I am also aware that there is a general shortage of shoeing iron of standard quality.  The possibility of obtaining further supplies of such iron is being explored, but the prospects are not good and farriers may have to rely entirely on scrap iron for the repair and manufacture of horse-shoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, can he give any advice to an individual blacksmith who finds it impossible to carry out the necessary agricultural repairs in his area?  If he is unable to get coal locally, and if he applies to the Minister for Supplies, will the Minister arrange for supplies of some sort of coal in order to keep his fire burning?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is this: Take a blacksmith in Castleblayney who has a number of farm instruments awaiting repair and farmers' horses to be shod. If he cannot get coal wherewith to light his fire, and if he gets into communication with the Minister, will the Minister make coal available for this special purpose in the same way as he made kerosene available for special agricultural purposes analogous to the ones I have mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot guarantee that.  The blacksmith will be entitled to purchase coal, but I cannot guarantee that, in any part of the country at a particular time, a supply of coal will be made available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise that, if the blacksmith's shop closes down in a town like Castleblayney, all horse-drawn operations in the area must cease?  You cannot send a horse out to plough without four shoes. You might just as well not send petrol to the tractor as fail to supply shoes to the horse or a point to the plough. Bearing that in mind, will the Minister take steps to ensure that the blacksmith who has to carry out agricultural repairs will have coal made available to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in my power to ensure a supply of coal at all times in all parts of the country.  In so far as it is possible to distribute to the most essential users the supplies of coal that may be available, it will be done, but clearly there can be no guarantee that coal will be available at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if representations have been made to him by policy holders whose policies have been compulsorily transferred to the Irish Assurance Company under recent insurance legislation, and who find, as a result of that transfer, that they are entitled only to the payment of a certain limited sum at the end of a specified period, although premiums have been paid by such policy holders for many years at a rate calculated on the basis that eventually they would receive the sum assured, together with profits; if such representations have disclosed that as a result of the said legislation these policy holders now become entitled after the payment of such premiums to a sum which is less in value than the amount of the said premiums; and, if so, if he has any proposals to make to relieve the hardship so occasioned to such policy holders by the legislation previously promoted by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>The position of the with-profit policies of the several participating companies transferred to The Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company, Limited, by the Insurance (Amendment) Act 1938 is governed by Clause 18 (iii) of the Schedule to that Act.  This provides that with-profit policies shall be converted into non-profit policies at the transfer date by assuming that the premium in excess of a scale of non-profit premiums shall be treated as the gross premium to purchase an additional sum assured at the valuation age according to such scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of their independent existences the several participating companies never attained a financial <Col N="11" /> position which enabled them to declare profits for credit to their with-profit policies and in consequence at transfer date these policies had no accrued bonus rights.  The policies were at that date converted into non-profit policies for the remainder of their term with a proportionately larger sum assured and claims are being paid by The Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company Limited on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that so far from the Insurance (Amendment) Act 1938 being the cause of any hardship to policy holders in these cases it has been the means of affording equitable relief to them from a position of previous hardship.</P>

      <P>Mr. McElligott did not hold the position of Controller of Prices as established by Section 15 of Control of Prices Act, 1937.  He was, for a period, Chairman of the Prices Commission set up under that Act.  As the Deputy is probably aware, however, it was decided that in matters of price control reliance should be placed, for the duration of the emergency, on the powers conferred by the Emergency Powers Acts and consequently the Prices Commission has not functioned for that purpose for some time past. Mr. McElligott has been appointed to conduct the inquiry under the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, into the affairs of Messrs. L. Jordan, Limited, Ennis.

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, while no one will question <Col N="12" /> the competence or the integrity of Mr. McElligott, is it not true that, if Mr. McElligott were to find that Messrs. Jordan &amp; Company had made excess profits during the period when he, Mr. McElligott, was Chairman of the Prices Commission, that would amount to finding that Mr. McElligott and the Prices Commission had failed effectively to discharge their duties, and in those circumstances is it reasonable to ask Mr. McElligott to inquire into this situation?  Should not an independent party inquire into the situation, so that Mr. McElligott and his colleagues, and such other parties as may have any light to throw on the affairs of Messrs.

Is it reasonable now to establish the chairman of that Prices Commission as the judicial authority to determine whether in fact Messrs. Jordan and Co. were charging excessive prices or not during the period when he was charged with the task of supervising them? That amounts to asking a man to act as judge and jury in his own case, and that is utterly unreasonable and absurd.</P>

Eight workers, including Patrick Heffernan, were instructed to report for the work, but they did not <Col N="14" /> do so.

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion Heffernan applied for work and was refused because of his physical weakness.  Then when a strike occurred this man, who is suffering from epilepsy, was ordered to go to work, apparently in order to act as a strike breaker, and because he refused his unemployment assistance was stopped. Is it the policy of this Department to bolster up another Department, in connection with which there is labour trouble and where there is a boycott imposed, by trying to force men to work?  This man, who is suffering from a physical weakness, would not be given employment some time previous to this.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, a notification to the effect indicated by the Deputy was issued to owners of property. As regards the latter part of the question, authority was given to the corporation at the time the bomb damage occurred to carry out repairs to houses which were capable of being repaired with a view to enabling the owners to continue to occupy them on the understanding that the corporation would be reimbursed when legislation was passed.  There is no obligation upon the local authority to carry out permanent repairs to all damaged property in the area and as the Minister for Finance in pursuance of the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, has set up machinery for the determination of claims to compensation, public notice of which was given in October last, it is considered that property owners should exercise their rights as regards claiming compensation under that Act and arrange for the repair of their own property in so far as repairs have not already been carried out.</P>

Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is a number of small cottages owned by very poor people and the roofs of these cottages were damaged and they have not been repaired since the bombing?  Apparently there were no slaters available, but last Friday evening 40 slaters were dismissed and several cottages are now left unrepaired and the people have no money to get the work done for themselves.  Why was there a distinction <Col N="16" /> between those who got their property repaired within the last nine or ten months and the dozen or two cottages where no roof repairs have yet been carried out?  Why should those places be left in such a condition?</P>

      <P>The claims that were dealt with by the corporation were dealt with pending the passage of legislation.  Under the procedure that is now recognised, applications have to be made to the Minister for Finance in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.  These regulations were published in the Press on 14th October, 1941.

They did not rush in at the beginning; they did not wait in a queue, although their houses needed repair after the bombing.  Now, because they did not rush in, they are left with their damaged houses.  Some of the houses were damaged considerably.  I asked the corporation this morning to close four of them because of the Minister's order.  The corporation have very few houses left to give to tenants who are urgently in need of accommodation.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should allow the contractors to continue the repairs and allow the slaters to get back to their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions 17 and 18 together.  The Deputy has raised this matter of repairs to cottages on several occasions.  I had an inspection made by an officer of the Department, in November last, of certain of the cottages which the Deputy considered were urgently in need of repairs. The investigations made extended to 15 cottages.  In four cases the repairs had already been carried out, while in seven others building materials were delivered on the site, and arrangements were being made to proceed with repairs.  Of the remainder of the cottages inspected, namely, four, no repairs had been undertaken at the time of inspection.  The Deputy will understand that inspection of every cottage in a county could not be undertaken by officers of the Department. The work should be undertaken by the officers of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 12th December, 1941, the Wexford Board of Health were communicated with on the general question of repair of cottages, and it is understood arrangements were subsequently made whereby their engineers would carry out periodic inspections of cottages and submit proposals for <Col N="19" /> the repair of cottages to the board.  I am aware that the board carry out repairs to a large number of cottages every year, and I would suggest that the Deputy send to the local authority a list of the cottages which in his opinion require urgent repairs.  I may add that my Department has no reason to believe that repairs already carried out to labourers' cottages in County Wexford have been unsatisfactory. However, if the Deputy has any particular cases in mind, I would suggest to him to lay the facts before the local authority.</P>

If Departmental officials will come with me, I will show them those cottages.  The inspectors go down there, but apparently they are out for a joy-ride.  They blow their horns and, if the lady of the house comes to the door, the inspector will say: &ldquo;Is your cottage in bad repair, ma'am?&rdquo; and she will reply: &ldquo;It is, sir.&rdquo;  The inspector will say: &ldquo;I have not time to look at it now&mdash;I must get away&rdquo; and off he goes.  It is time that something was done in regard to this matter because the cottages are urgently in need of repair, some of them for a period of years.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer together Deputy J. Ryan's two questions and Deputies M. Ryan's and Fogarty's question on the same subject.</P>
      <P>I have looked personally and fully into the scheme for the division of the lands at Ballyholohan as approved by the Land Commissioners.  I am convinced that the scheme was prepared and considered with extreme care and diligence and that it is fair and reasonable in every respect.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the local agitation and of the circumstances which gave rise to the opposition and dissatisfaction referred to by the Deputies.  There are no sound reasons for complaint against the Land Commission and the situation has been aggravated by the malicious destruction of fences erected at public expense and in respect of which a claim for compensation has been lodged in court.</P>
      <P>The lands of Ballyholohan comprise about 100 acres of upland and 247 acres of low-lying, wet land, the dry land being concentrated about the centre. Owing to the silting up of the Drumcomoge River and its branches much damage has been caused to a large area of the estate, and the lack of drainage and periodic flooding have rendered a great deal of the land suitable only for seasonal grazing.  The general lay-out made it impossible to divide the estate into small or standard holdings, or to treat it for the purpose of division as if all the land were of good, agricultural quality.  In planning the scheme it was difficult to find sufficient dry land in convenient places for building sites and for the construction of approach roads.  There is no road frontage to the estate except a small field adjoining the herd's dwellinghouse, the only other approach being a narrow right-of-way from the public road which passes over a holding outside the estate boundary.  The owner of this holding objected to the extended usage of the right-of-way and an agreement had to be reached with him to settle this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the opinion of the Land Commission, which is the competent authority in the matter, such congestion as exists <Col N="30" /> in the neighbourhood is not so real or so acute as in other adjacent places and it would not be in the public interest, nor in the interests of the local cottiers and landless men, to allot small separate plots&mdash;which would have to consist entirely of wet land&mdash;on the greater part of the estate.  It appeared to the Land Commission that the bulk of the lands could best be utilised by providing four economic holdings for migrants from more congested parts of the country&mdash;10 to 20 miles away&mdash; two from County Tipperary and two from across the County Limerick border.  A holding was also provided for a former herd on the estate; an enlargement was given to an adjoining holding, and an accommodation plot to a small local freeholder.  The allotments given to the migrants are the smallest that the migrants would accept in exchange for their home holdings and could not be reduced in size owing to the only possible location of suitable sites and to the actual location of the arable land within the estate boundaries.</P>
    <P>There were 172 applications for allotments on the Ballyholohan estate.  It would be impossible to satisfy even a small proportion of the applicants. Some of the applications were of a most peculiar kind, it having been suggested to the Land Commission that allotments should be made ostensibly for certain purposes (including a sportsfield) with the object of enabling the allottees to obtain more suitable land in exchange elsewhere at a later date.  Some local farmers were approached by members of the Emly Hurling and Football Club and asked if they would agree to such an exchange.</P>
    <P>I should say here that of the numerous applicants for parcels on the Ballyholohan estate, the more deserving have been considered by the Land Commission in connection with the division of the adjoining estate of Michael O'Connor consisting of 204 acres of arable land, on which new holdings are being provided for four ex-I.R.A. local landless men and one landless ex-I.R.A. man from across the County Limerick border; one holding <Col N="31" /> for a former herd; two enlargements of local holdings; one accommodation plot for a cottier, and one accommodation plot for a county council quarry. When the landless men in the Emly district were shown the impossibility of having the usual size holdings for landless men created at Ballyholohan they did not press their claims on the inspector subject to an undertaking, which has been honoured, that their applications would receive full consideration when the O'Connor estate was being dealt with.  Unfortunately, owing to delay on the part of the owners of the O'Connor estate in proving title, it was not possible to arrange for the division of the Ballyholohan estate and the adjoining estate of O'Connor to take place simultaneously. Pending settlement of the title difficulty, lettings have been made by the Land Commission to the approved allottees.</P>
    <P>The local agitation has been mischievous and futile.  A lot has been said about the refusal of the Land Commission to provide a sportsfield for the people of Emly, but it has not been made public that when the application for a sportsfield at Ballyholohan was being discussed locally, the inspector was informed that it was the intention of the persons to whom the sportsfield would be allotted to utilise the allotment for an exchange of land elsewhere which would be more suitable for the purposes of a sportsfield.  The lands of Ballyholohan have not been used as a playing field since 1927, and are not well situated for such a purpose. The possible sites pointed out to the inspector by those interested in the sportsfield project were situated on the only portion of the Ballyholohan estate suitable for building purposes, and the Land Commission could not agree to allot any of these sites as a sportsfield. The Land Commission have not refused to provide a sportsfield for the people of Emly.  They have refused to make a sportsfield allotment on the Ballyholohan lands.  I feel sure that the commissioners would be willing to consider the question of exercising their powers of compulsory acquisition with the object of providing a proper sportsfield <Col N="32" /> in a suitable location for the Emly people if an application were made to them in a proper manner.  The commissioners have been generous in the provision of sportsfields in County Tipperary, and the public attacks that have been made on them in regard to the Emly district are dishonest and unfair.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in this House frequently, and it is now repeated, that the relief of congestion, wherever it exists, is the primary object of land division.  That object is being served fairly and disinterestedly in the Emly district and nothing exceptional or unjust has been done by the Land Commission in this instance.  Other features of Government policy, such as preference for I.R.A. service, have also been faithfully observed.  It is my intention to see that the decisions of the Land Commission, which is the duly appointed and responsible authority in the matter of land division, and the requirements of law and order, are enforced.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that there is any area in this country which there is a ranch around in which there is not congestion?  Does he believe that there are no uneconomic holders within a mile of that place and does he feel that the lands should not be divided amongst them?  There is certainly an amount of congestion there, and information with regard to it was put before the Minister.  May I also ask if in such cases all advice from priests and prominent people in the area goes unheeded?  I thought it was usual for the Land Commission to see the priest and some of the prominent reputable people in the area, but, in this case, the opinion of priests and other public men in the area has gone unheeded and has been defied, although these are people who had nothing to gain from the dividing of the land. The Minister and his inspectors have paid no attention to that advice, at the instigation, I should say, of one or two political hacks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's two questions relative to the lands of Coalteigue on the estate of the late James Ryan, County Roscommon.  The Land Commission are aware of the conditions obtaining in the neighbourhood of this estate, which was inspected and valued in 1939 following a notice of the intention to inspect the lands.  Owing to the emergency it has been found necessary to postpone consideration of the question of the acquisition of this estate as well as many others.  The Land Commission have now been informed that the lands were recently sold to a Mr. Clarke, but otherwise they have no knowledge of the transaction and no ground to interfere.</P>

A petition against resumption lodged on behalf of the tenant was heard on 20th February, 1941, and refused by the Lay Commissioners.  Subsequently an application was made to the Appeal Tribunal by the Land Commission for an order authorising the resumption of the holding but this application was adjourned as the tenant instituted High Court proceedings against the Land Commission and the Attorney-General of Eire for a declaration that the provisions of Sections 7 to 11 of the Land Act, 1933, are <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, for a declaration that certain provisions of the Act of 1939 relating to resumption are also <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution and for an order restraining the Land Commission from prosecuting further the application made by them for leave to resume the holding.

It seems to me that the Second Reading debate on it will not be of as satisfactory a character as it might be if we have not the benefit, first of all, of hearing the Second Reading speech of the Minister for Finance, and afterwards of reading it.  May I suggest to the Minister that he should put that proposal before the Government: that we should first of all hear the Second Reading speech of the Minister for Finance on the Bill, then have an opportunity of reading it, and having done that, resume the Second Reading debate after Easter?

      <P>In paragraph (a), page 5, line 13, after the word &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;on their sites.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is introduced with the idea of clearing up the point as to how far the ramifications of this Bill are to extend.  The Minister has stated that this is an agreed measure, and I think that is substantially true, between certain trades and between certain employers, but some of the ramifications that appear to be possible under this Bill were certainly never contemplated by the people who agreed to the measure.  I accordingly move this amendment with the idea of clearing up the point that the work in the construction, reconstruction, alteration, <Col N="47" /> repair, painting, decoration or demolition of buildings shall apply to the site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to accept this amendment, which, if adopted, would make a radical change in the scope of the Bill, as it would at one stroke remove from the scope of the measure all workers other than those employed on building sites.  This Bill, as the Deputy is aware, was based upon statistics which were collected for the purpose of fixing the actuarial basis of the scheme.  In those statistics were included particulars of the total number of workers employed by each builder, together with particulars of the time lost each week by any of those workers owing to inclement weather.  The total number of workers set out in the statistical return included manual workers employed in builders' workshops and yards.  Obviously, if this amendment were to be adopted, there would have to be a withdrawal of the Bill and a complete revision of the whole scheme, including the rates of contribution and the rates of benefit. I was rather surprised to see this amendment, because on the Second Reading debate Deputy Cosgrave expressed the view that the rates of contribution were inadequate, or would prove to be inadequate, to maintain the rates of benefit contemplated.  I did not agree with that view, but clearly an amendment which would exclude any large number of workers from the scope of the Bill would destroy the financial foundation of the scheme at the very outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any definition of building work which excludes work done by builders in their workshops and yards must be regarded as totally inadequate.  In the definition of &ldquo;building&rdquo; contained in the National Insurance Act, 1911, the manufacture of any fittings of a kind commonly made in builders' workshops and yards is expressly included.  The Deputy has referred to the fact that this is, in a sense, an agreed measure, and included in the number of bodies which agreed that such a Bill should be introduced were the representatives <Col N="48" /> of the workers concerned.  It may be that some of those workers will not be as liable as others to lose employment through inclement weather, but nevertheless they have agreed through their representatives to make the contributions. The bodies included in the discussions which led to the Bill contained amongst them those who are representative of the type of workers who are employed in builders' workshops and yards, particularly the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, the Irish National Union of Woodworkers and the Irish Woodcutting Machinists, as well as the appropriate employers' organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on No. 2, the Minister's remarks on No. 1 seem to make my case, because I propose to exclude the manufacture of such articles in a factory.  The Minister has stated that the statistics for this Bill were founded on particulars which were furnished by certain builders. Well, I think I might say that those builders would be representative of people who work on sites; I think there is no doubt about that, but the Minister is now proposing to bring in articles which are manufactured in a factory.  Included in the statistics there is no builder that I know of who owns a factory.  The Minister spoke about the acquiescence to this Bill of the wood-cutting machinists.  I think undoubtedly they were included in the negotiations and possibly they gave their acceptance to this measure, but is the Minister aware that, under this, in the case of butter boxes which are being sawn in a country mill the person doing that work would be liable for this contribution?  Why should our butter cost us more in order that the workers in the building trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the Minister's statement, but a board of identical thickness is manufactured in a builder's workshop&mdash;let us say a 9 by 3¼ plank that would be useful for butter boxes has been sawn in a builder's workshop or yard&mdash;and where are you going to draw the line?  This is what I have suggested to the Minister, that he is throwing a stone into a pool and I am inviting him to tell us where the ripples are going to end. They do not seem to end at the bank; they seem to crawl up the bank and go abroad in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the manufacture of wood.  A person who is drawing the wood to the machine is presumably engaged in the manufacture of wood.  Is a person who brings that wood from the pile engaged in a similar manner and is the person who brings the wood from the quay also so engaged?  I invite the Minister to tell us where he is going to draw the line. That is my difficulty.  I suggest that no factory was contained in the statistics upon which this Bill was compiled and that the Minister is merely inviting a whole lot of people to contribute to something from which they will get no benefit and under which they never thought they would be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admitted in the discussion on the Second Reading that one of the difficulties arising in connection with this Bill is that of definition. It is not possible to get a watertight definition of the persons who are included in the building trade and there will be a number of border-line cases.  To deal with them we have set out elaborate machinery in Section 10.  It is proposed under that section to determine certain questions that may arise.  They will be determined by the Minister or by the High Court. It is almost inevitable that in the first few years there will be a number of queries addressed to the Minister as to whether persons of one type or another are or are not included in the scheme.  These questions can be settled as they arise and, while we should endeavour to make the definitions as complete as possible, we cannot hope to make them 100 per cent. perfect.  I <Col N="51" /> propose to insert certain amendments which will deal with persons who are or who may be employed for a short period during the week in occupations in which they will be insurable and on other classes of work during the remainder of the week.</P>
      <P>My objection to Deputy Dockrell's amendment is somewhat similar to that which I advanced to his first amendment but there is a further objection to the amendment he now proposes.  If the amendment were adopted it would have the effect of encouraging builders to have their work done in factories rather than doing it themselves, and it should not be the purpose of the Bill to interfere with existing practices in the building trade or in trades ancillary to the building trade.  It may be that persons employed at joinery work are not liable to loss of employment through inclement weather, but such persons can move from job to job.  It may be that in their present jobs the risk does not arise, but in their next jobs with other employers that risk may arise, and unless they have contributions to their credit they will not be entitled to get benefits out of the fund.</P>
      <P>To the extent that there may be a few individuals who may never experience the risk against which this Bill purports to insure them, I can only say that the representatives of those persons have agreed that they must stand-in in the matter of contributions to the pool.  It is only fair that works which are ancillary to building and the prosperity of which depends on the building trade should join in a scheme designed for the welfare of workers of the same trades as those employed in the ancillary works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is very wise in introducing the amendment that he has suggested&mdash;that, where a person is employed only for a short time, he does not come under the scope of this Bill.  I think that is very wise, because, if he had not that, you could not get certain specialised employees <Col N="52" /> in on a building site with a dog whip.  The Minister says that he has taken power under Section 10 to settle anything in dispute.  That is, no doubt, true, but I cannot see why certain wide general principles ought not to be laid down in Section 3.  I cited the case of the butter boxes and the Minister answers me by saying that, when they go before the tribunal under Section 10, they will be able to get out.</P>

      <P>Very well, but there might be a change over.  Let us take some of these butter-box places.  For one reason or another, they may turn over to do certain types of work that will be used for builders.  These men are employed all the time by the one factory, and the object of the employer is to keep these trained workers in his factory until they can go back to their regular work, but in the meantime they turn over temporarily to work for the building trade.  Do these employees, simply because the type of work they turn out may be used for building purposes, become contributors to the scheme?</P>

I explained that we do not want to divert business from builders' yards, and factories that are normally engaged in the production of builders' work, to other places, because they might do the work a shade cheaper there by reason of the absence of this contribution.  We do not want to interfere with the normal practice of the trade, and therefore we say that persons who are employed in that work, even though only temporarily, will be liable to contribution.</P>

      <P>I want to return to the question of the sawmill, because it furnishes a very apt illustration.  The Minister takes me up and more or less says that it is absurd to talk about butter boxes.  Now, there is no such thing as a butter tree out of which you make butter boxes or anything like that.  A tree is a tree, and when it is sawn it is suitable for conversion into certain sizes, and those sizes may <Col N="55" /> be used for a whole host of things. That is the crux of the whole matter. The Minister talks about a tradesman leaving one employer, where he has not been subject to inclement weather, and going to another where he is.  My contention is that all of these trades tend to be in compartments.  Take carpenters who are engaged in a joinery factory.  I should like to assure the Minister that if you sent one of these men out to a site he would not have the tools for the work.  He has got to have a separate set of tools, and all sorts of differences such as that arise.  I suggest that the Minister has founded the whole scope of this Bill on statistics furnished by genuine building contractors who are subject to the incidence of intermittent employment, and that he proceeds to throw the doors wide open to a whole lot of people whom it was never contemplated would be included.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy remembers it, but he himself was a member of the body that met before this Bill was introduced and which had discussions on it, and presumably he kept in mind the possibility of these complications arising. Apart from that, however, I cannot see the possibility of such a misunderstanding as the Deputy contemplates. We refer here to articles of wood for use in the construction, reconstruction, alteration, and so on, of buildings, and of a type commonly made in builders' workshops or yards. There is not the slightest possibility under that definition of a person manufacturing butter boxes, or boards for butter boxes, being drawn into the Bill any more than there is the possibility of people engaged in a match factory being drawn in.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (d), page 5, line 55, to add new sub-paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(viii)  all electrical work carried out by electrical contractors,</P>
      <P>(ix)  all terrazzo work and tiling carried out by terrazzo workers and tilers,</P>
      <P>(x)  all heating and plumbing work carried out by heating and plumbing engineers,</P>

      <P>(xiii)  all flat roofing and asphalt work carried out by roofing contractors,</P>
      <P>(xiv)  all brass-finishing carried out by brass-finishers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, these are only giving certain specific trades.  Take the first item, electrical work.  The people who would be subject to the incidence of intermittent stoppage, due to wet time, in the electrical trade would be the people on mains and overhead wires, who are employed by the Electricity Supply Board.  Now, they are excluded from the provisions of this Bill, and then you come along to the house wires who never get a drop of rain on them.  With great respect to the Minister, I do not know whether they actually sat in the room he was talking about and were parties to this.  However, I do not wish to make any point about that, but I say that they are not subject to it at all.  Then, take terrazzo workers, they always have to have a roof over their heads, since they are the last to work.  Plumbers would be rather a border-line case.  You <Col N="57" /> might get a man running a lead piping on a site.  Another border-line case would be stone and marble work carried out by monumental sculptors. Then there is structural steel work carried out by structural engineers, and also flat roofing and asphalt work carried out by roofing contractors, and we finish up with brass finishers.  As far as I know, there is no brass finisher ever employed by a builder.  I shall leave Deputy Keyes to apply his eloquence to his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of Section 3, page 5, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall apply to work done by an electrician for an electrical contractor.</P>
      <P>I am not going the whole distance with Deputy Dockrell, but so far as his amendment deals with the electrical side of the matter I think there is a good case for exclusion.  The Minister has said that the measure is an agreed measure, but I suggest that, so far as the electricians are concerned, neither the masters nor the men have been consulted in connection with it at all. The agreement, such as it is, was mainly arrived at by the unions affected in the metropolis, and the electricians, according to my instructions, were not consulted, good, bad or indifferent, either on the men's side or the employers' side.  It was not considered necessary, since they do not belong to the building trades group.  They have belonged to the engineering group for many years, and hence their association with the building trades would be of a remote character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is so couched that it deals only with men working for electrical contractors, and not for builders. They had separate agreements, distinct from other unions, with the electrical employers, and were mainly covered by the Electrical Trades Union of Ireland and the Engineering Trades Union of Ireland.  They have a distinct entity as compared with the others, and their ramifications are of a different character from those obtaining in connection <Col N="58" /> with ordinary building work. They mainly work on the inside, and, at such times as they are called upon to work outside and may be liable to inclement weather, they have alternative work provided for them, and are not to be laid off.  The casual electrician laid off a job gets payment for four hours, whereas in the ordinary building operations he only gets payment for one hour.</P>
    <P>This agreement which they have will be violated if they are included in this Bill.  I suggest that there is no case for their inclusion.  They will not benefit by it.  While I agree with the Minister that the exclusion of border-line cases might prejudice the stability of the Bill, I do not think that any case can be made for bringing in people gratuitously under the Bill for the purpose of getting their money.  In this case they have not been parties to this and they do not want to come under the Bill.  They do not want to be associated with the building trades group; they want to be left where they are.  They consider that the agreement which they have is more beneficial to them than anything which would be conferred on them by this Bill.  The acceptance of the amendment in my name would not prevent the Minister, under the powers vested in him by Section 15, including them later if he found it necessary.  I suggest that he has taken powers in Section 15 under which he could bring in at a later stage those who will be working for building contractors.  I am asking for the exclusion of those working for electrical contractors whose work is mainly indoor.  I do not think they can be properly associated with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main features of Deputy Dockrell's amendment and of Deputy Keyes' amendment which I must take objection to is the proposal to make a distinction between builders and those who do on subcontract certain parts of the work for the completion of a building.  I do not think we should have that distinction. I do not think we should make it attractive for people to sub-let their contracts to other people who, because of some amendment of this kind, keep <Col N="59" /> outside the scope of the Bill.  Therefore, even if we are to concede that there is something to be said for the argument in favour of the exclusion of electricians, we must, I think, maintain this position: that electricians are in or out as a whole and not according to whether they are employed by a builder or an electrical contractor.</P>
      <P>I ought to draw attention now to the amendment I propose to Section 18.  The effect of that amendment will be to exclude from the obligation of contributions electricians employed by electrical contractors on building work in the great majority of cases. Where the amount of work done is small in relation to the full week's work of the person concerned, then he will be regarded as excluded.  I am aware that it can be argued that electricians are not liable to this risk except in very exceptional circumstances. In exceptional circumstances they can be liable to this risk.  But it is very hard to prepare a Bill of this nature on the basis that we will have only the bad risks and leave the good risks.  Either we have to regard the building trade as a unit and recognise that the prosperity of that trade, the absence of strikes in that trade, and continuity of employment are as much an interest for the electrician and the plumber and the terrazzo worker as for the bricklayer or the slater, or else we are going to abandon altogether this effort to provide against evils that have been associated with the trade.  I think it is true to say that the various disputes which have arisen in the past, the discontents which have been aroused by the curtailment or loss of employment due to bad weather, have seriously affected many classes of workers who were not themselves involved in those disputes, including electricians and plumbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might remind the House that this Bill had its origin in the very long building strike of 1937.  One of the matters in dispute on that occasion was this loss of wages through inclement weather.  The claim was made on behalf of the representatives of the workers, all of whom acted as a unit although they were divisible into various classes according to their <Col N="60" /> trades, that some payment should be made to them if they were out of employment through bad weather, and the employers could not, or would not, agree to that demand put in on behalf of the building trades group. As part of the settlement of the strike there was an understanding that an insurance scheme to protect these workers in the building trade who were liable to loss of employment through bad weather would be introduced, and a committee representing both sides came together and prepared a scheme which is embodied in the Bill.  It is not, therefore, altogether fair at this stage to pick out this class of workers there and another class of workers somewhere else just because their risk is less than the risk of others, just because they are not as liable to loss of wages through bad weather as others are.  I think we have to consider the building trade as a whole.  We have to decide that what tends to peace in the industry, to continuity of employment, to the absence of disputes and strikes, is as much the interest of one class as of another, of the electrician as of the bricklayer.  On that ground I am disposed to resist the amendment.  I know that the building trades group of the Trades Union Council are very strongly opposed to the amendment and, I think, have expressed that opposition to the Irish Trades Union Congress.</P>
    <P>It may be arguable that in the case of electricians they should be regarded as separate from other trades.  I think that the number of electricians likely to be regarded as building trade workers under the Bill, that is, normally and ordinarily engaged in building work to the extent that would make them liable to a contribution, is not likely to be very serious, and that it can be argued that in their case it is unfair to ask them to make contributions and that the employers should make similar contributions. But I would not agree with Deputy Dockrell as to the other classes of workers.  They are all specifically in the category of persons whose livelihoods depend upon the peace and contented conditions that exist in the building trade.  If building work stops through a dispute, they stop.  On that account they can be fairly asked to <Col N="61" /> make this contribution towards absence of discontent or absence of stoppages in the building trade.  The main purpose of Deputy Dockrell's amendment, as I read it, is to exclude these workers only when employed by a sub-contractor.  I would not agree to that at all.  I think that where builders are liable to pay contributions, and the persons employed by builders are liable to pay contributions, others doing that class of work also should be liable, namely, sub-contractors and persons employed by sub-contractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the Dublin Trade Union Council were not in favour of this amendment.  I am aware of that.  Does it not strike the Minister that it is peculiar that he did not think of consulting the electricians when the matter was being propounded, or that the exemption of the electricians was not considered when the matter was discussed with the people who were parties to the agreement?  If the electricians were to be parties to the agreement, why were they not consulted as well as the other people?  The Minister says that there will be a comparatively small number affected, but if that is so, it is scarcely worth while bringing them in.  My amendment will allow electricians working on buildings for building contractors to come under the Bill, whilst leaving out those working in shops for electrical contractors who have better agreements than this Bill offers.  I would not favour any general exemption of electricians at the expense of reducing the finances of this scheme through making it uneconomic for the general building operatives, but I believe they are practically excluded from participation in the benefits and are being brought in only for the purpose of putting something into the pool from which they can never benefit.  That, in itself, would not be quite so bad, but their position will be definitely worsened by the violation of agreements which they have already made with the employers, if they are brought into this scheme, in so far as they formerly got four hours' notice and will get only one hour's notice if brought into this scheme.  That is the <Col N="62" /> agreement they have made with the electrical employers, so that not alone is the scheme not going to be beneficial to them, but it will be detrimental. If there is such a small group of them likely to be affected as the Minister suggests&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;I suggest that the Minister ought to consider the exclusion of electricians belonging as they do to the engineering group.  They have no association or contact with this measure inasmuch as they do not belong to the building group at all.</P>

      <P>To deal with Deputy Keyes' point as to the failure to consult electricians before the Bill was circulated, the only thing I can say is that I met two representative groups of persons, one of which was the workers' group which claimed to be representative of all the workers concerned in the building trade.  That group did not include members of all the different unions engaged in the building trade. It was a group chosen out of all the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>They did consult all the trades in the building group, though.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted their representative capacity.  There may have been a group like the terrazzo workers in respect of which there might have been difficulty in getting consent, but they came and said: &ldquo;On behalf of the workers, we are appointed,&rdquo; and similarly with the employers.  That rule to which the Deputy refers is one which I think is worth referring to.  It is true that the electricians appear to have a rule in their agreement by which their employment cannot be terminated, except on four hours' notice.  I am informed by the Secretary of the Building Trades Group that every class of worker has a somewhat similar rule in his agreement, but in no case is it interpreted to have the meaning which the electricians are now attempting to give to it.  I think the electricians are straining the meaning of the rule in suggesting that the work cannot be suspended for inclement weather.  A precisely similar rule appears in the agreements of other classes of workers who are employed out of doors in the building trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The period may be different in different cases, but the rule is intended to deal not with the case of a stoppage of work by reason of inclement weather, but with notice of termination of employment, which is an altogether different matter.  Certainly, it appeared obvious, from the wording of the rule in the case of electricians, that what was intended by those who drafted it was that four hours' notice should be given of the termination of employment, and not of intention to stop work temporarily, because of frost, snow or rain, and it is, I think, a straining of the rule to give it the meaning which the electricians are now attempting to give it in order to get exclusion from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, however, is not the main point. The main point is: to the extent that electricians employed in building work are concerned with this Bill at all, they are, I think, as much a part of the building industry as any other class of workers in the industry, and we have to deal with the industry as a whole, requiring from everybody in the industry the proposed contribution so that this fund will be built up.  We know that those who work entirely on the outside, such as bricklayers, tilers, and slaters, are much more likely to have frequent claims on the fund than those workers in other categories whose work is mainly indoor, but nevertheless we propose, in the interests of peace in the industry and of the relationship between employers and employees, that this charge should be imposed on all, so that this fund can be built up.  It is almost impossible to make a case for exclusion of the electricians who are employed by builders, or on building work, which could not be made equally <Col N="64" /> strongly for terrazzo workers, and plumbers, in some cases.  If a house is to be heated and lighted by gas, the plumber does the job.  The plumber pays the contribution and the employer of the plumber pays it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of furnishing which is a different thing. One effect of the exclusion of electricians would be to put a tax on the work done by certain people who are, in a sense, in competition with electricians, such as plumbers, and to make it more attractive to people to use electricity for heating instead of gas.  If you are going to exclude electricians, will you exclude the plumber who puts in the gas-pipes, who installs a gas cooker instead of an electric cooker?  If you have one in, you must have the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the electrical contractors are already making a substantial contribution by reason of the fact that they employ their men whether the weather is inclement or not?  Therefore, I do not think it can be said that to exempt them would be unfair.  At present, they are making a contribution in respect of their men which is similar to the contribution which they would be expected to make under this Bill, and, therefore, if you include them, you compel them to pay a dual contribution.  In addition, if they are included, the agreements between the contractors and their men which at present provide for continuous employment, irrespective of the weather, would probably be terminated, and that would not make for peace and harmony in that branch of the building trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be sticking very consistently to one line of argument.  He says, for instance, that they are all in the building industry, but he did not answer my point as to why, if that were so, the Electricity Supply Board, which runs the mains on to the site and whose employees would be the most exposed of all people in the electrical <Col N="65" /> trade, should be excluded.  I think that if the Minister looks up the statistics on the basis of which this Bill was framed, he will find that there are no electrical people in the returns. The Minister also said that I was seeking to have the work confined to cases in which it was carried out by sub-contractors. I should like to suggest to him that, in practically 90 per cent. of cases, these works are carried out by sub-contractors.  In the case of a builder, the electricians in his employment&mdash;I shall not say that he has no such person in his employment&mdash;are very few and far between.  There are some who probably have plumbers, but there again we come back to a big number of people who are asked to shoulder a burden in order that there may be peace in the building trade.  I suggest that the incidence of wet-time ought to be borne by the trades subject to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The rule the electricians have&mdash;the national agreement between the Electrical Contractors, the Electricity Supply Board and the workers' union&mdash;deals with circumstances in which the work ceases and a man is paid off from his employment. Before he can be paid off, he must get four hours' notice of his employer's intention to pay him off. The temporary suspension of work, <Col N="66" /> because of inclement weather, is an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other trades they have similar rules, that before a worker can be paid off and his employment terminated certain notice must be given. In principle, it is a similar rule to that which the electricians have.  Even though the period of time may be different, the principle is the same.  The electricians' rule relates to the termination of employment, and not to the suspension of work because of inclement weather.  An attempt is being made on behalf of the electricians to argue that they are not liable to loss of employment because of inclement weather.  It appears to me that the rule does not apply in these circumstances at all, but only in the circumstances in which a job is ended.  That, of course, only disposes of arguments advanced in favour of the exclusion of electricians.  It is necessary to give arguments in support of their inclusion. The main argument is that when we set out to legislate on a scheme for building trade workers, involving contributions from them, we have to take contributions from everybody whose livelihood depends on the building trade, even though we know that some of them will have a less risk of loss of employment through inclement weather than others.  We are not relating contributions to the degree of risk but are fixing a flat rate to build up a fund out of which benefits related to the risk will be paid, that is to say, in accordance with the actual period of time lost through inclement weather.  It can happen, however, that one worker in a particularly bad season of the year will get far more out of the fund than he pays in, while another worker in a different occupation, or in another period of the year, will pay far more in than he will get out.  That is an inevitable feature of a scheme of this kind.  So far as electricians employed by a contractor are concerned, it appears to be considered that they will have to pay these contributions all the time. That is not so.  They will only be paying contributions when they are actually employed on building work, <Col N="67" /> and then only when that building work constitutes the greater part of their week's work.  A very large number of these electrical contractors' employees will never pay any contribution because they will never actually qualify for the payment of contributions.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if we were to give way on the question of electricians we would have to reconsider again the question of plumbers and other classes of workers whose risk of loss of employment through inclement weather is just as slight as that of the electricians. Once you were to start in on that process, it would mean a break away from the wide confines of the building trade, and the general scheme of the Bill would be entirely undermined.</P>

If a certificate be given that they are in permanent employment, then they may be taken out of the Bill.

      <P>It deals with the rates of contribution set out in the measure, and if there is to be any change in the rates it should be through a new piece of legislation. That used to be the custom under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I understand Deputy Mulcahy's point to be that if a change is going to be made it would not be a Bill hard to draft, and, under ordinary Parliamentary procedure, Deputies could discuss not only the change in the rates but the reasons which, to the Minister, seem to make it necessary.  I do suggest that the House should get a chance of discussing those changes instead of having them made by regulations which, of course, lie there and are law unless they are nullified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Unemployment Insurance Bill was of much wider application than this.  In this particular case we prepared the legislation in consultation with the people directly concerned&mdash;the employers and workers in the building trade.  In preparing the legislation we did recognise that we were working on the basis of very limited experience, at any rate of a very limited statistical record of experience.  In the case of the Unemployment Insurance Act, <Col N="71" /> national figures relating to the incidence of unemployment were available in Great Britain&mdash;where the Act was first passed and made applicable to this country&mdash;over a number of years, and it was possible to make a rough-and-ready calculation as to what the outgoings would be, and what income would be required to enable those outgoings to be met.  In fact, even those calculations had to be varied from time to time.  In this House, measures have been introduced to raise or reduce the contributions paid under the Unemployment Insurance Act according as the fund became in debt or showed a substantial surplus.</P>
      <P>We only started in 1939 to collect the statistics upon which this Bill is based, and it is really only in respect of the years 1940 and 1941 that any reliable figures are available.  As for earlier years, we were able to get the records of a few large employers, and certain local authorities and other authorities which employed numbers of workers, but in the case of 1940 and 1941 we got the actual record of the experience of the trade.  All I can say is that the record did not lead us to any definite calculation, because in one year the fund would have shown a surplus and in the other year would have shown a deficiency, so it is quite clear that the available information is not sufficiently complete to enable any firm conclusion to be arrived at as to whether the contributions proposed now will in fact enable the rates of benefit contemplated to be paid.  It was on that account that the parties who were associated with the preparation of this Bill agreed that we should have this power, in order to ensure that the fund would remain solvent until we got experience extending over a number of years which would enable us to take the risk of letting the fund run into debt in a bad year, knowing that we would make it up in a good year, or adopting the attitude of reducing the contributions or increasing the benefits when the fund showed a surplus, knowing that that surplus was likely to continue, and that the experience of future years would be no worse than the experience of past years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> I think that, in the circumstances of this particular Bill, while there is something in Deputy McGilligan's point, it is better to have this procedure, because we can consult with the parties directly concerned without any considerable formality.  They will have as much interest in maintaining the solvency of the fund as we will have; in fact greater interest, because it will be their fund.  Every penny that goes into the fund will be available for the payment of benefits to the workers and for the avoidance of disputes in the trade, and clearly it will be in their interest to ensure either that the fund is not allowed to run unduly into debt, or, on the other hand, if the fund does not run into debt but begins to show a surplus, that the contributions should be reduced or the rates of benefit increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks that have been made are almost an echo of the remarks that were made in the British House of Commons at the time when the Unemployment Insurance Bill was first introduced.  It was there laid down that the rates were purely speculative, and were pitched rather high because it was considered better to start high and hold out the hope of a reduction, rather than choose a lower figure, with the danger of an increase. That measure was introduced certainly in the same cloud of insufficient facts as that in which this Bill has been presented here.  I think the point was actually argued at the time as to whether there should be an easier way of changing the contributions than by bringing a new measure before the House.  Certainly it was somewhere stated&mdash;I think it must have been in the Parliamentary Debates&mdash;that it was unlikely that any less period of full experience.  That applies here too. I do not suppose there would be any change inside 12 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know now.  But the original contributions were fixed in the Act, and could only be changed by a piece of legislation&mdash;they could not be changed by order.  Certainly when the Unemployment Insurance Act was first introduced it was introduced by people who said: &ldquo;We do not know exactly what the contributions ought to be&rdquo;, but a certain figure was fixed and there was held out the promise of reduction.  I say that in this case also there is not going to be frequent change necessitated, and surely&mdash;considering the speed with which measures can go through the House, and the ease with which the measure could be drafted, as it means only a change in the terms of the Schedule&mdash;it is only proper to give the House an opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Here is a case where the contributions are not sufficient.  We do not want to lower the benefits paid; therefore, we will have to increase the contributions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Unemployment Insurance Act there was a State contribution. There is no State contribution here.  I am using that as an argument in this way, that under the unemployment insurance code there would be less chance of any haphazard movement in connection with the contribution because the State contribution would go up according to the increase in the contribution demanded from employer and employee.  There is no such contribution demanded of the State here, and consequently there is more reason for asking the State to be vigilant in the matter of changing the contributions. This is called an insurance scheme, and I suppose like most insurance schemes it is built somewhat upon good lives in the business as well as to make allowance for the bad lives.  Any contribution which brings in money surplus to requirements is of course imposing a hardship upon those who are good lives and are not likely to <Col N="74" /> need the insurance or to get the benefit, so that there is a need to relax the contribution in favour of the individual. There is no great hardship done to the Minister and there is no great difficulty in his way.  It is not going to be a thing that will arise frequently, and I do not think the Minister should have this stereotyped in the Act.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, I suggest that he should put some upward limit.  The only point here is that the equality must be kept, but outside that the 8d. might be raised to 1/- or it might be doubled.  It might be found that the benefits to be paid are more onerous than what is expected and, therefore, the amount will have to be raised. The Minister should guarantee that, by regulation, he would not raise the 8d. beyond some limit which he fixes here. It would be a rather serious matter to have control of this given to the Minister&mdash;control by regulation.  We all know that regulations are more or less outside Parliamentary control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say that there will be no drastic change in the rate of contribution, except in very abnormal circumstances, such as might arise if there were a complete collapse in the value of currency, or some change of that kind.  In the normal course, if a variation has to be made, it will be made in the rate of benefit and not the rate of contribution.  The Deputy will realise that there will be numbers of stamps printed and made available throughout the country in various centres and all the arrangements will have been made for the carrying on of this scheme by the affixing of these stamps to the cards of the employees, and if a change has to be made fairly quickly because of the unsatisfactory condition of the fund the change will have to be in the rate of benefit and not in the rate of contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Unemployment Insurance Act the power to vary the rates of contribution or the rates of benefit is given to the Minister.  He must do it under certain circumstances, if he gets a direction from the Minister for Finance, so that in the long run power <Col N="75" /> is given to the Minister for Finance. The only similar case where a change requires legislative sanction is in the case of unemployment assistance, where the money that goes in benefit comes from the Exchequer; some comes from local authorities and some from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, but where there is no contribution from the recipients.  In the case of unemployment assistance there is Ministerial power given to reduce the rates of benefit.  The benefits cannot be increased without the sanction of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In all matters of administration I am naturally anxious to keep the scheme here in the closest possible accord with the scheme of administration under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I think we should not depart unduly from the established practice, and in Section 46 we are following that established practice. I am prepared to give an assurance that there will be no such substantial increase in the rates of contribution such as Deputy McGilligan has referred to without notification to the House or except in very exceptional circumstances.  If a change in the finances of the Bill has to be made with any expedition, it will have to be a change in the rate of benefit, not in the rate of contribution.  It will be appreciated that any change, whether upward or downward, in the rate of benefit or in the rate of contribution, can be annulled in the Dáil by resolution.</P>

      <P>There is a small point in connection with this section to which I want to draw attention.  Apparently, the employer can only recover by means of deduction during the current week.  As far as I understand it, the employer will send forward a claim for wages paid to the employee, and possibly that might be over a period of three weeks.  Of course, that would be very exceptional, but there might then be a period of a week that would elapse, and he would be then told that his claim was disallowed.  I suggest to the Minister that in that case he ought to be allowed to deduct from the employee, during the week and the week following, the amount of money which he had overpaid to his employee. Under this, he is tied to the actual week in which he has paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, this section relates to the contribution only, and not to the recovery of any sums paid to the employee by way of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Contribution, yes.  This section deals with the purchase of the stamp by the employer, just as in the case of the unemployment insurance stamps, where the employer purchases the stamp and puts it on the worker's card, and then deducts from the worker's wages his share of the cost <Col N="79" /> of the stamp.  Evidently, the Deputy is thinking of the case of an employer paying benefit illegally or wrongfully to a worker, or under circumstances in which he thought he was entitled to do so, and then finding that his claim to recover that benefit was disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with circumstances in which he might be allowed to recover payments made to an employee.  That does not arise in this section, but in framing this Bill the principle, generally, was to ensure that there will be little risk of an employer wilfully knocking off his men, at a time, say, when supplies were not arriving promptly or for some other reason, and claiming that he had to suspend work on the ground of inclement weather, thus getting benefit for his employees.  That risk will be reduced because, clearly, what we set out to secure is that every employer who does that, who knocks off his men and suspends work on the ground of inclement weather, will take the risk that the appropriate officer under the Bill will decide that he was not entitled to suspend work, in which case he will lose his claim.  That loss will be a deterrent to employers and prevent them from abusing the Act. Otherwise, there might be considerable abuse, in certain circumstances, in the form of payment of benefits alleged to be insurance against wet time, under circumstances in which a suspension of work was not necessary at all but just happened to be convenient for an employer.  However, it does not arise under this section; it arises under Section 36.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister is serious about this section. It may be all right to ask a small contractor who is on a site to report that a stoppage has occurred.  Surely the Minister is going to give time, where a works foreman is in charge, to communicate with his head office?  I take it that he does not contemplate that a staff of clerks should be maintained on a job, and that they should be ready to send in a report where there is a stoppage of employment?</P>

If work is stopped I do not think any difficulty is imposed on an employer's representative in asking him to notify that work is stopped owing to inclement weather.  We do not ask him to notify the intention to consider a stoppage in respect of severe weather, as he could telephone to the head office which can decide if work will stop.  When work is stopped they can report.</P>

      <P>I want to put it beyond any doubt that a stoppage is to supersede any trade agreement.  The Minister stated that a stoppage could not be argued as termination of employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the recovery of amounts improperly paid, my reading of this section is that if an employer <i>bona fide</i> pays a worker benefit, which is subsequently disallowed, he can only wait until he gets some supplementary benefit to deduct the amount or sue in the courts.  He ought to be able to deduct it from wages because he paid under a misapprehension. There is not very much chance here of any collusion between employers and workers, and, even if there was, the Minister might say that he would allow it to be deducted from wages and declare &ldquo;a plague on both your houses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the recovery of overcharges where the employer pays benefit without authority to a worker, or where the fund pays benefit without authority to an employer, or in any other circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case in which the Deputy is interested, we propose that where an employer has paid benefit which he should not have paid to a <Col N="85" /> worker, he can recover as he can recover any other debt or can deduct it from the next payment of supplementary benefit.  I think that is the more satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can he not be allowed to deduct it from the wages? Is that not the simplest way?  The Minister knows perfectly well that it is absurd to ask an employer to wait for a considerable, or even a small, spell of time until another bonus in respect of intermittent employment arises.  Probably if a worker made the case that he had received very little wages for some weeks, the employer could vary it, but an employer might find that a worker was unsatisfactory and he has simply to lose the amount which he has paid him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that it is desirable that there should be no encouragement to employers to pay out this benefit on any pretext, and, in certain circumstances, on small jobs, these pretexts might easily arise. A worker might be a first cousin of the employer.  The job may have to stop because a car-load of cement has not come from the station, and the employer might say to the worker: &ldquo;I will not see you stuck.  I will write in and say it was spilling rain and we had to stop work.&rdquo;  We want the employer to risk losing the money.  We do not say he must lose it, but he must take the risk of losing it, if he pays it without proper grounds.  On that account, I do not want to make it too easy for him to recover the amount, if he has, in fact, paid without authority. In the majority of cases, no doubt, payment in the circumstances contemplated would be made in error, the employer <i>bona fide</i> believing that the circumstances were such as to justify his paying, but there may be other cases, and it is to deal with these other cases that it is necessary to provide that the employer will have to go through the normal procedure, so far as recovery of the money is concerned, with the exception of this special circumstance of a further payment of supplementary benefit arising, in which case we allow him to recover from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to authorise the payment by the Electricity Supply Board of pensions or gratuities to those of its members who devote the whole of their time to its affairs, and to enable the board to contribute towards and to pay the expenses of operating superannuation schemes, to be established by order made under the Bill, for its manual and non-manual workers.  Pensions to members of the board will be non-contributory, but those of the employees contributory, on the basis broadly of equal contributions by the board and members of its staff.  Persons who were transferred to the services of the board and who already possessed pension rights at the time of their transfer are excluded from the Bill as it now stands, but I am considering, as a result of representations made to me, a proposal to give to these transferred officers the option of accepting the terms of the board's scheme, whatever they may be, in lieu of their existing rights to pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also authorises the payment by the board of modified or supplementary pensions to employees who were transferred to its service from the service of undertakings acquired by the board, and who, at the date of transfer, did not possess a statutory or other right to pension.  These pensions will be in respect of the period of service with the former undertaker and will be additional to any pension earned on service with the board, such employees entering the board's scheme <Col N="87" /> under the same conditions as other of the board's employees.  Provision is also being made to enable the board to grant gratuities on retirement to employees who, for reasons of health, are excluded from participating in the superannuation scheme set up under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the first matter I should refer to is the principle of providing for pensions or gratuities to the whole-time members of the board. When the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, under which the board was set up, was being discussed in the Dáil, reference was made by various Deputies to the absence from the Bill of any provision in that regard.  The omission was explained by my predecessor as being justified by the fact that the creation of the board was in the nature of an experiment, the success of which could be demonstrated only by the lapse of time.  The Minister of the day explained that, after some years of working, a much easier view of the matter could be taken, and I think the time has now come.  Deputies are probably aware that members of the Electricity Supply Board hold office for periods not exceeding five years, and there is no guarantee that a member will be reappointed when the term provided for in his warrant has expired.</P>
    <P>It will also, I think, be generally appreciated that the magnitude of the undertaking which the board is called upon to administer, and its importance to the nation, demand that its personnel should possess the highest administrative capacity.  The necessary qualities and the necessary experience can only be found in men who have demonstrated their ability in other callings, and, consequently, it is inevitable, in the order of things, that the Government choice, when making a new appointment to the board, must be limited to persons who are fairly advanced in years.</P>
    <P>Moreover, appointments to the board in a whole-time capacity will entail, on the part of the person concerned, the surrender of the post which he formerly held with little or no prospect of again securing it in the event of his not being <Col N="88" /> reappointed to the board.  It is, I think, desirable in the interests of efficient administration that the whole-time members should be relieved from anxiety as to their future which must persist so long as they have no assurance of a pension on retirement.  The position of the part-time members is, of course, quite different, since they continue to follow their primary occupations, and there is no case for including such persons in the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not, at this stage, propose to go into details, except to mention that the conditions governing eligibility for pensions in the case of members of the board include a minimum period of ten years' continuous whole-time service. Subject to that minimum, it is proposed that the pension shall be calculated at one-forty-eighths of the annual salary for every year of such service with a maximum of twenty-forty-eighths for 20 or more years' service, such pensions to be payable on retirement after reaching the age of 60 years, or earlier if the retirement is due to ill-health or non-appointment which is not due to causes within the control of the person concerned.  Provision is made for the suspension or abatement of a pension from the board where the member is in receipt of, or is entitled to, a pension from the State or a local authority.  It also provides that, where a member dies whilst in office after at least five years' continuous whole-time service, a gratuity, equal to one year's salary, may be paid to his legal personal representative.  These pensions or gratuities to whole-time members of the board will be payable by the board as part of its general working expenses.</P>
    <P>So far as the employees of the board are concerned, it will probably be generally accepted that an important public body, such as the Electricity Supply Board, should be in a position to arrange for contributory pensions for its employees.  I know the suggestion has been made in some quarters that the pension should be non-contributory. The Government is not prepared to proceed upon that basis.  The Government's attitude in the matter can be taken as quite definite that a pension scheme for employees of the Electricity <Col N="89" /> Supply Board must be based upon the principle of contributions by the employees.  The alternative is no pension scheme at all.  Most, if not all, corresponding bodies possess powers to arrange for pension schemes for their employees, and, as Deputies are aware, many industrial and commercial concerns have in recent years introduced, of their own volition, contributory pension schemes for their staffs. That action cannot altogether be attributed to philanthropic motives.  It is becoming increasingly appreciated that the knowledge that provision is being made for a worker's ultimate retirement is, in itself, beneficial not only to the worker but also to his employer since the greater sense of security which the worker thereby enjoys tends to bind his interests more closely to those of his employer, and render him less prone to endanger his future by hasty or ill-considered action.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to establish separate superannuation funds for the manual and non-manual workers. Under the scheme of the Bill, the board will prepare and will submit to me schemes for that purpose, and, when approved, these schemes will be brought into being by means of an Order to be made under this Bill.  Were the numerous matters incidental to a pension scheme to be specified in the Bill, it would be a very lengthy and complex measure, and any minor defects or omissions which experience might yield could only be repaired by further recourse to legislation.  Consequently, it is desirable that the Bill, in this regard, should confine itself merely to providing a ready and simple means of establishing the schemes and of enabling the respective funds to be properly administered.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should merely legislate to empower the board to arrange pension schemes for its employees, and that there is an objection in principle to the proposal that such schemes should be submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for approval.  My answer to that objection is that whatever may be done now for its employees in this regard by the Electricity Supply Board may be taken as a headline at some <Col N="90" /> future date by other bodies established under statute, or of a similar character, desiring to make similar provision for their employees.  I think it is desirable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should examine, from the viewpoint of his position, the scheme proposed by the Electricity Supply Board for its employees to ensure that it does not contain within it something which, while unobjectionable when applied to the employees of the Electricity Supply Board, might be quite objectionable if applied to employees of other similar concerns, but which, if established in the Electricity Supply Board scheme, would be taken as a precedent in connection with any other schemes subsequently contemplated.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the preparation of the scheme will be a matter for the board's actuary.  It will be very largely a matter of making calculations to ensure that the contributions to the fund from the board and its employees will be sufficient to enable the pensions to be paid at the rate proposed, and the functions of the Minister in examining the schemes submitted by the board will be to deal not so much with the details of the schemes as to ensure that, in their general form, they contain nothing objectionable on grounds of public policy.  The Bill lays down certain overriding conditions in relation to the schemes, and enables any modifications in them shown to be necessary to be made by amending orders, subject to the conditions I have referred to.  Amongst those conditions it is provided that both the board and its employees will make contributions to the fund, and in most cases it is contemplated that the board's contribution will be equal to that of the workers.  Another condition is that service for the purpose of pensions shall be continuous.  It is the intention that the schemes when framed and approved will provide for the establishment of funds on an actuarial basis, to which contributions will be made on scales calculated according to the age of the employee on entering the fund, and related in amount to his remuneration.</P>
    <P>The schemes will also specify the <Col N="91" /> basis upon which pensions will be paid, and will, in addition, provide for the management of the funds, the vesting of the moneys in trustees, the investment of the moneys in the funds, the keeping and auditing of accounts, the making of rules, and other matters incidental to the creation and the operation of a superannuation fund.  So far as the expenses of working the fund are concerned, these will be borne by the board, so that the entire contributions paid into the fund, with the accumulated interest, will be available for the payment of pensions and other benefits.  What those benefits will be must depend upon actuarial considerations, and it will be understood that it is intended that the fund shall be maintained on a self-supporting basis, with periodical actuarial valuations, so that the state of the fund will determine the amount of the pensions payable. Should a valuation reveal a deficiency, it will be necessary either to increase the contributions or to reduce the benefits.</P>
    <P>A point that should be clearly understood&mdash;there appears to be some misunderstanding concerning it&mdash;is that the Department of Industry and Commerce, apart from arranging for the necessary Order, will take no part in administering the scheme.  The body or bodies created by that Order to work the schemes will, subject to the terms of the Order, be solely responsible for their administration.  Possibly a committee of management will be responsible for each scheme, upon which the board and its employees will be represented, but, as I have already explained, that is one of the matters of detail to be settled later when the Bill has become law and the schemes are under consideration.  While the schemes will be on a contributory basis, it must nevertheless be recognised that such pensions and gratuities as they may provide for will represent a very important benefit to those eligible to participate in them.</P>
    <P>When the Government had the draft Bill before them they gave very careful consideration to the question whether or not the manual workers employed by the board should be included <Col N="92" /> in the Bill or not.  Against the argument that such manual workers should be included in the Bill was the fact that it has been the practice of the board to pay to its manual workers the rates of wages recognised in agreements between trade unions and other employers employing similar classes of workers.  Those rates of wages were, of course, determined by negotiation upon the basis of non-permanent and non-pensionable employment.  Employment with the board is different from employment with another employer in the case of the majority of those manual workers.  An electrician, a motor driver, a carpenter, a plumber&mdash;any such worker employed by an ordinary employer is subject to all the risks that workers experience, the risk of loss of employment and the risk of retirement at old age without any provision being made for them.  In ordinary employment there is no pension provision.  In the case of the board's workers, there is much greater security of employment, and that security is not taken into consideration by the board in determining the rates of wages.  The wages paid to the board's workers are the same as those paid to similar workers employed by other employers under agreements with the unions.</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, appear to be unnecessary or, at any rate, of questionable wisdom to provide the addition to workers employed by the board of the benefit of a pension scheme.  The Government, however, decided to do that.  They decided that, despite the considerations I have mentioned, the manual workers of the board should be included within the scope of the scheme, but they felt that it was desirable, in implementing that decision, to impose certain conditions.  One of the conditions contemplated is that those manual workers who elect to come within the pensions scheme for manual workers prepared by the board will not regard themselves as having the same freedom of action to withdraw their labour from the board as other workers employed by other employers claim.  It is, therefore, contemplated that each employee of the board will be given the option of coming within the pensions scheme or not, <Col N="93" /> but, if he elects to come within the pensions scheme, he must enter into a contract with the board which will deprive him of the right of withdrawing his labour from the service of the board, a contract under which he will undertake to submit any question arising in dispute between him and the board to a tribunal to be established under this Bill, and to abide by the decision of that tribunal.  I may perhaps have misled Deputies by referring to the right of such an employee to withdraw his labour.  Under existing law, an employee of the Electricity Supply Board engaged in the production of electricity who withdraws his labour is liable to prosecution.</P>

      <P>I am merely correcting in the minds of Deputies a possible misunderstanding created by a term I used.  Under the law an employee of the Electricity Supply Board who withdraws his labour in circumstances which will result in any place being left without a supply of electricity, is liable to severe penalties.  That is the existing law, and I merely state that as a matter of interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the present Bill is concerned, in the matter of manual workers we propose to give them a choice.  Not all employees of the Electricity Supply Board would be liable to the penalties to which I have referred.  An employee, the withdrawal of whose service would not affect the supply of electricity, would not be held to be within its terms.  In the case of existing manual workers we propose to give them the choice of coming within the pension scheme or not, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>If they come within the pension scheme they come in knowing the conditions, and the conditions are that they will submit any matters in dispute between them and the board to a tribunal to be established, and will abide by the decision of that tribunal and that they will not withdraw their labour.  We are not compelling any employee of the Electricity Supply Board to accept these terms. Each individual can choose for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had discussions with persons interested in this Bill, and officers of my Department have met representatives of the workers concerned, and I gather there is a certain difference of opinion amongst them as to whether it be desirable to come within the pension scheme at all, apart altogether from this provision.  There is a question whether the benefit to be obtained by way of pension on retirement in old age is worth to them the immediate contribution they would have to make. That is a matter which each man can decide for himself, but, if he decides to come within the pension scheme, he must make that decision in the knowledge that he enters into a contract <Col N="95" /> with the Electricity Supply Board which he cannot break without certain consequences to himself.  He is at liberty to break the contract and withdraw his labour, subject to the provisions of the 1875 Act.  There is nothing in this Bill which prohibits him from doing so, but he sacrifices his right to pension and also the contributions previously made by him to the pension fund.  I think it is desirable that we should get, not merely in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, but in the case of all bodies of that kind, the continuity of whose operations is a matter of considerable public importance, a position in which, in return for permanency of employment and a pension on retirement, we will get an undertaking that there will be no arbitrary or unnecessary stoppage of work.</P>
    <P>I know the Labour Party are opposed to the principle of compulsory arbitration.  At least they have expressed themselves in the past as opposed to it.  In that respect they are almost unique amongst Labour parties in the world.  In many other countries the primary principle of labour policy is the institution of compulsory arbitration.  The Labour Government of New Zealand introduced compulsory arbitration there, and when it went out of office and the Conservative Government that followed it proposed to modify or limit in some way the application of the principle of compulsory arbitration, the Labour Party strongly opposed it and on their reelection to office reinstituted the principle in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <P>In Australia and in other countries where the Labour Party take a prominent part in framing the legislation, it is a cardinal principle of their policy to secure compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes. I merely mention that as a matter of interest.  For some reason the Labour Party in this country appear to be opposed to the principle of arbitration.  I think they are very unwise <Col N="96" /> in that, and for the the employees of the Electricity Supply Board I can imagine nothing better than a position created in which they will be protected, not merely in the continuity of their employment but also against any arbitrary change by the Board in the conditions of employment, and they are given, in addition, a pension on retirement which will permit of them living in comfort and economic security in, their old age.</P>

It is my intention, and the intention of the Government, that it should be so; we framed this Bill to make it so and I am prepared to discuss the provisions outlined in this Bill in relation to the tribunal with the Deputy, or any alternative which the Deputy may suggest on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there are any other parts of the Bill to which I need now refer.  Its primary purpose is to empower the Electricity Supply Board to arrange for a contributory pension scheme for its employees, subject to certain conditions.  The actual schemes to be prepared by the board are not in the Bill, and it is not contemplated that they will come before the House.  Under ordinary circumstances, we would leave them to be determined by the board in consultation with its actuarial advisers, and we require the submission of these schemes to the Minister <Col N="97" /> for Industry and Commerce solely because of the possibility that the public interest will be involved to the extent that the schemes of the Electricity Supply Board may be taken as a headline in respect of other similar bodies, established under statute or engaged in the operation of what the Americans call public utilities.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill dealing with manual workers of the board is one which I am prepared to defend here in the House or anywhere.  I think that it is not merely sound principle, but that it is easily the best course that could be taken in the interests of the manual workers of the board, and I recommend the Bill to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A long time ago, I realised that since the present Government moved into Government Buildings they have either infected themselves, or have become infected by those who were there, with a definite hostility to the Electricity Supply Board, but I did not think that their antagonism to that board would go to the point that they would seize on such a small occasion, as that which is presented by this matter of pensions, to attempt to get control by Ministers and by the Civil Service over this board.  That is how this Bill appears to me.  Since I got it into my hands I have been wondering what would be the appropriate point from which to attack it.  It is so full of disagreeable points, which I think this House should reject, that I was wondering what would be the best angle from which to launch an attack on it, but the Minister has given me a foothold from which to base an attack in one phrase that he used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although he was dealing with only one part of the Bill, his phrases were general, and he succeeded in conveying to the House that in my time I had definitely excluded pensions from the purview of the Electricity Supply Board, and that I had done so on the ground that the whole thing was an experiment and that, therefore, the granting of pensions should be taken away from the board.  Now, I have here a record of what was said, in connection <Col N="98" /> with this matter of pensions, in a debate on the 5th April, 1927, on the Electricity Supply Bill.  Deputy O'Connell, who was then, I think, a member of the Labour Party, had moved for the insertion of a section in the Bill providing for pensions.  In reply to that, I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At one time I had in the section a phrase which would have allowed the board to pay its officers and servants not merely remuneration and allowances, but pensions and gratuities.  I took the words out for this reason:...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and then I went on to say that the matter was rather experimental and that that was the reason why I excluded certain phrases which would have allowed the board itself to grant pensions to its employees: that it was better not to have that for the first period of the board at any rate, because the first five years were going to be somewhat of an experimental period.  However, at the end of a column and a half of argument between Deputy O'Connell and another Deputy, I said that we could reinsert in sub-section (2) of Section 7 the words which were previously there, and then I quoted the words, which were as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid by the board to its officers and servants out of the funds at its disposal under this Act such remuneration and allowances as the board shall determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And I added this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And then make it an instruction to the first board that they shall not establish a pension scheme to come into operation earlier than five years after the date of their appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If ever a man made himself clear&mdash; although he may have been mistaken&mdash; that he intended to give the board power to pay pensions to its employees, I think I did in that phrase, because I say there, in effect: &ldquo;We will put that phrase in,&rdquo; and then my thought clearly was that, having put that phrase in, the board was entitled to establish a pensions scheme for its officers, not to come into operation earlier than five years after the date <Col N="99" /> of their appointment.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister says that I specifically excluded from the powers of the board the power to pay pensions to its employees on the ground that the whole thing was experimental.  I did not.  I said that at one time I had in the section a phrase which would have allowed the board to pay pensions, but that I took out the words because it would mean new legislation, and so on, and I also said that we could reinsert in sub-section (2) the words which were previously there, but that such a pension scheme should not operate at once and should not come into operation for at least four or five years.  Accordingly, I think I made it clear that we wanted pensions.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Government and the board themselves both took legal advice on this matter, and I also understand that the advice one of them got was that the words did carry the right to grant pensions.  Unfortunately, they decided to take consultation on the matter with Government Buildings, and the result is that the hooks are now fastened into the board on this small matter of pensions.  What is the logic of this proposal?  At the time the Electricity Supply Board was set up, it was regarded as a novel type of experiment, but it met with the approval of the House at the time.  Except for some small details, I do not think any vote was taken on the measure to set up this board and to give it extraordinary powers and extraordinary liberties.</P>
    <P>I think that the only thing the House asked for at the time was that the board should publish their accounts every year and that these accounts should be subject to acute scrutiny by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the results of that scrutiny given to this House.  There was that, and also the power to dismiss from office members of the board.  These were the only two controls that were embodied, and, fully understanding this, the board was set up with the goodwill of this House.  I think that on that particular proposal to set up a board of that type&mdash;whatever might be <Col N="100" /> the points of controversy on certain details&mdash;there was almost unanimity on the point of principle, to set up a board and give it these powers and liberties.  The only question of control was in these two matters of the reviewing of accounts and the dismissal of members of the board.</P>
    <P>The position is now that the board still has that liberty.  It can provide its own establishment scheme with regard to its employees; it can have different grades among its workers, and arrange for promotion according to merit or otherwise.  It can pay wages, change wages or increase them.  The board is already paying something like £750,000 a year to its employees.  It is given all these liberties, allowed to pay these salaries and wages, allowed to put its employees on different footings and to change the employment from time to time&mdash;it is given all these liberties and powers, but on this small matter of pensions the hooks of the Government must come in.  Of course, this is only a trivial occasion, and the whole thing could be met by a simple piece of amending legislation containing four words, and that is to put in, in sub-section (2) of the relevant section, after the words &ldquo;remuneration and allowances&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including pensions and gratuities&rdquo;. That is all the amendment that is necessary to amend the situation which has developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has used words here which, from the indifferent way in which he pronounced them, and from the fact that they really contained no argument, would lead me to think that he is only trying to hide from the House what is the fact: that this is an attempt to draw back this board, by one link at least, into the ambit of Government Buildings.  He said that if the Electricity Supply Board were left free a headline might be given to other groups&mdash;I suppose that he meant groups like public utilities&mdash;and that the Minister should have power to see that no objectionable feature crept in. That, to my mind, is rubbish, unadulterated rubbish, in connection with this measure.  Apparently, they can set a headline in connection with their staffs, or the wages they pay, or <Col N="101" /> the terms of employment, or the holidays and vacation and periods of leisure, or the working hours; they can do anything that is included under the term &ldquo;working hours and conditions&rdquo; and they may set a headline to other employees of public utility groups in any matters of that kind, but when it comes to this matter of pensions&mdash;a trivial matter from the point of view of finance and expense &mdash;then the Minister for Industry and Commerce must see that no undesirable feature creeps in.  What undesirable feature is likely to creep in?  If the Minister would expose to us, even in a flight of imagination, some of those bogeys that seem to have afflicted him, we might know something about his argument or whether there is any substance in it.  Let him tell us what is likely to creep in so far as the Electricity Supply Board and its own employees are concerned, and then we can see whether or not there is anything substantial in his argument.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board was regarded as a good type of experiment in another direction.  It was the first board set up in this country which the State plentifully supplied with credit. Besides that, we decided not to have the dead hand of the Civil Service over it, and that we would not have any interference by politics.  Even the Minister was excluded from having control, except that accounts had to be submitted for his scrutiny and questions could be put to the Minister here in that regard.  It had to be debated here once a year when the accounts were under consideration but that was all.</P>
    <P>The House and the public welcome that.  The board was plentifully supplied with Government credit, and was told to manage that credit, subject to two overriding considerations, that they told us yearly what they were doing, and that the Minister could come down on the board for going beyond the bounds, if he thought fit.  I think that was a useful type of board to have set up.  It inaugurated a new line of activity as between employers and employees.  The board was plentifully endowed.  It was removed from <Col N="102" /> Government control and not allowed to make private profits.  It was tied up under the Act so that the charges should bring in sufficient to meet the liabilities and pay the staff.  It was decided that the rates should be only enough to meet these charges, and that there was to be no question of private gain.  That type of board, surely, was the ideal board in which to allow the best type of play as between employers and employees.  If there was a headline to be set surely it should come from a board like that.  One consideration was that the board was to be free from motives of private gain, not having to rack those consuming electricity nor to sweat employees, but simply to have rates that the public could bear, and that would popularise the use of electricity.  Surely that was the sort of board which would have brought about a situation in which it would be a model for other employers and employees. We are now going to inject between employers and employees the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Is the record of that Department or of any Government Department in connection with economies such as to enable them to be trusted?</P>
    <P>We know that the cost of government, as far as the Civil Service establishment is concerned, has risen from something short of £4,000,000 in 1932, to something like £5,750,000 this year. We cannot say that after ten years it is on the grounds of economy that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance are introduced. What then is it based on?  I suggest it is the old view that prevailed in Government Buildings when I was there, a view about which I was not too particular, and a view that has prevailed all the time there.  That view is now definitely reflected in this Bill of getting this board definitely back under the control of Government Buildings.  I suggest that that is a complete breach of the principle on which the board is established, and that there is not sufficient argument in the matter of pensions to ask that that should be done.  The Minister stated that if details were to be specified the Bill would be a lengthy one.  It is too <Col N="103" /> lengthy as it is.  The Minister knows that all he requires now is a small paragraph by way of amendment of the 1927 Act, and if he wants to bring in the matter of putting penalties on manual workers, I suggest it might be as well done in a Bill that would apply to industry generally, or even to public utilities generally.  Apart from that, the Minister seemed to feel that people might complain that the Bill was not detailed enough.  All that was required was the simple thing intended in 1927 and accepted by the Parliament and the public of that day, and that I think will be accepted by the Parliament and the public to-day: the idea that a board trusted with power to pay the wages bill of employees could also be trusted to deal with such a small matter as pensions.</P>
    <P>I intended to ask the Minister if he had any idea what the cost of the pension scheme would be.  Has the Minister any idea of what a pension scheme on a fifty-fifty contributory basis, with the arrangement about back payment, would amount to in a year?  I understand from calculations I had made that under the Bill the amount, with the restrictions in the Bill, would not be anything more than £30,000 of an annual charge.  I wonder has the Minister seen any scheme from the board?  Has he discussed it with the board?  Does he know what the board has in mind with regard to provision for their employees?  With the payment of arrears what would the amount be increased by?  I hope before the debate ends that we will have some idea of what the cost will be.  I want that compared with the present revenue of the board.  In 1927 we might be rather timid about asking the board to embark on a pensions scheme.  It was very definitely an experiment in those days, and was not received, as far as the newspapers were concerned, with any great joy&mdash;certainly with no great enthusiasm.  Certain political parties had no great respect for it but they were not in the House then.  There were numbers of people to prophesy dire disaster.  They stated that the consumption of electricity could not be brought to the point at which the <Col N="104" /> scheme would be an economic success. We know that the trouble with the board is not to get electricity consumers, but to prevent further consumers being tied on to the end of the wires.  The amount they are generating now is about three times more than was then regarded as a wholly imaginative idea.</P>
    <P>I remember when it was considered that the board would have to generate 132,000,000 units to make the scheme a success, reams were written about the impossibility of ever getting a per head consumption up to that point.  Now they are generating over 400,000,000 units and selling something less.  The revenue, I might say, is about £2,000,000 at the moment.  Why should this House be asked, taking again into consideration that the board is allowed to pay something short of £750,000 yearly in wages, to consider, as against a revenue of £2,000,000, a pensions scheme which might cost £30,000, if the Bill is allowed to operate, and might cost £35,000 or £40,000 if the board were allowed to treat its employees more liberally than this Bill allows?</P>
    <P>Surely it is ludicrous to ask the House to spend time on giving the board power to establish a scheme which the Minister might amend, reject, send back for reconsideration, or may make law with whatever amendments seem suitable to him.  I suggest that on principle this should be rejected, and that what the House ought to ask the Minister to do is to take the basis of the Act of 1927, and if the phrasing in that Act is insufficient to enable it to give the workers precisely what they require, to take power to allow that it be done and to let ordinary friendship develop still further to establish a pensions scheme which would be a headline for all public utilities.  I do not say that all the public utilities should immediately jump to establish pensions schemes, but to have it as a basis might be considered good.  They might have to win their own spurs; they might have to bring such a project to the point of successful achievement; but supposing they do it as well as the Electricity Supply Board has done it, why should we not have a good <Col N="105" /> headline from the point of view of pensions before the country, provided always that the new public utility which is, say, going to adopt that scheme were able to show that either it had come to the same point of achievement or was likely to reach it within a reasonable time?  That is on the general run of this measure.</P>
    <P>To the details there are any number of objections that could be put forward. I find in Section 2 a matter about which it is personally an embarrassment for me to talk, but I think it ought to be mentioned.  When one comes to read the provisions regarding the pension that may be paid to members of the board, the first thing that starts out is that the pension is payable only after a number of years, that is, after not less than ten years' continuous whole-time membership.  I may be told, and I am sure I shall be told, that that phrase is taken from other Pension Acts.  Possibly those words do come from other Acts, but I want those words considered in connection with the actuality of the board. It is common knowledge in this House, and a matter of unpleasant recollection to me, that one of the members of the board cannot claim continuous service. Why should he be defeated in his rights because there was a break in his employment for a particular period?  If that man were to leave now, he would be deprived of the pension he could get if membership of the board were counted not in continuous years but in an amalgamation of a number of years' service.</P>
    <P>I find in sub-section (2) that if a member of the board dies during his term of office after a period of not less than five years' continuous whole-time service, his personal representative may get an amount equal to the yearly salary of that member; but if he dies a month after leaving office, he is thrown back on other provisions, and one of the provisions upon which he may be thrown back is sub-section (3).  If he dies and the pension to which he is entitled is less than his yearly salary as a member of the board&mdash;I think what is meant is to give him a full year's salary, instead of a pension&mdash;what is set out is that it shall <Col N="106" /> be lawful for the board to grant and pay to the personal representative of such person a gratuity of an amount equal to the sum by which the amount of such pension for the period falls short of the said yearly salary.  What is the pension?  It is the pension as received by him, the pension paid to him.  I suppose that when pensions come to be paid, they will be paid in monthly or quarterly amounts.  I do not know exactly what will happen&mdash;I have been trying to figure out certain cases&mdash;in the case of a person who dies under the circumstances set out in Section 3.  I suggest that there are small points, even in Section 2, that ought to be looked to, but there are two points that are to be specially adverted to&mdash; this question of continuous whole-time service and the upward maximum. The maximum that may be granted is a maximum of twenty-forty-eighths of such yearly salary.  I have never seen that figure as a standard in any Act that I have been able to find.  The maximum in most cases I have been able to look up is two-thirds.  Why has the figure been changed?  Two-thirds is the provision allowed to judges after a certain number of years' service, and two-thirds is the provision under the 1925 Local Government Act which local authorities may pay to people, even people who had not served what was put down as more or less a standard term.  I do not understand why here we subtract a quarter and make the maximum five-twelfths of the salary.  I think it is particularly bad that that upper limit should be lowered in connection with members of the board.</P>
    <P>When we were starting in 1927 we always assumed that people who would become members of the board would, in the main, be people who had served some fairly lengthy period, either in becoming qualified in an academic way, or, having become qualified in an academic way, had found practical experience at other work.  These were men whom we were going to invite away from that other work, and all we promised them was a five years' term.  It was a five years' term, subject of course to renewal, and subject to renewal at successive five year periods, until a man might have <Col N="107" /> put in 40 or 50 years with the board, but always over his head hung this: at any time at the end of the five year period, he could be dropped, and at any time within the five year period, if the Minister liked to come to the House and make a case against him, he could be dismissed.  I think it is a wise provision to retain that power to dismiss.  It is one of the few powers which the House, through the Government, has over members of the board, but is the Minister likely to allow to operate in his mind the point that should operate with regard to dismissal? Will he allow to operate the question as to whether a person has a good pension scheme in the background or has not?  I think he will give fuller play to the reasons that might operate in his mind for dismissing a man, if he knows his future is protected to some extent, or that he has some provision made when he leaves the employment of the board.  He will do it, I think, much more easily than he will if he feels that he is dealing harshly with a man in dismissing him.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that recently in connection with the Guards we passed a special piece of legislation. That was done in connection with Guards who were being dismissed for a particular type of conduct which we did not want to see spreading through the police force.  Yet the Minister felt that, faced as he was with the only powers he had then of removing Guards, he could not operate what he thought was his right to dismiss and his duty to dismiss in certain circumstances, unless he had got special provisions in the way of gratuity or pensions for these men.  It is a rather odious example to take in connection with the board, but there is a point in it and a moral to be learned from it. I suggest that particular attention should be given to this point about continuous membership with the board for this minimum period, and I suggest that the maximum should not be kept at this sub-standard point of five-twelfths, but should be raised to two-thirds, which is the maximum set out in the provision made for judges and for certain local authority employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The sections from Section 4 to Sections 8 or 9 show distinctly that this is not intended to be a provision by the board at all.  The board is to prepare a scheme, and that scheme is to be confirmed by the Minister.  The Minister may, however, modify it and may add to, omit from, or vary it.  He can either send it back for renewed consideration by the board, or he can himself make it law with the modifications he desires to put in, and, later, there is this provision with regard to amending the schemes.  Section 7 gives us some of the matters definitely to be included in a superannuation scheme. There is a fund to be set up, and it must be contributory.  It must be contributory on the basis of whatever the employee pays, the board shall pay the same.  The Minister has told us distinctly that the Government are adamant on this point&mdash;that it is either a contributory scheme or none, but remember that so far as the Bill is concerned, it is a contributory scheme on a 50-50 basis, and it is that apparently we are presented with.  It is either that or nothing.  The board is to defray the expenses of administering and there is a variety of things with regard to classes of persons.</P>
    <P>Lettered paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) Section 7 is one I want to query. The scheme is to provide the circumstances in which persons leaving the employment of the board before they have become entitled to superannuation benefits will be entitled to have contributions paid by them repaid, with or without interest.  Apparently the only thing contemplated there is that of people leaving the employment of the board.  Supposing a person dies is that leaving the employment of the board?  I do not think the courts would so construe it.  Is a person who has paid into the fund for a great many years and succumbs to an illness not going to be entitled to get his own contributions, even without interest, repaid? Sub-section (2) of Section 7 lays it down that only continuous service in the employment of the board, ending on the date of retirement on account of age or ill-health, shall qualify for superannuation.  Apparently <Col N="109" /> disability arising from an accident would be ruled out under a strict interpretation of that sub-section. Is a woman employee of the board who marries not to be entitled to recover the contributions paid even without interest?  Supposing an employee of the board decides to better his position by going elsewhere, are the contributions he has paid to the superannuation fund to be left behind? From the wording of this the only people who will qualify for pensions are those who leave the service of the board on account of age or ill-health.</P>
    <P>At this point there is introduced, for the first time, the matter of disciplining employees of the board.  We have here a complete enlargement of what was contained in Section 110 of the 1927 Act.  That section did apply to utility concerns of the electricity type the provisions of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act which previously applied to gas and water concerns. But this goes much further.  It speaks of any stoppage on the part of a worker that caused or may have caused an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity.  It goes still further because it says: &ldquo;which impeded or might have impeded the due performance of any of the functions or duties of the board.&rdquo; Under the 1927 Act the board were given a variety of functions or duties. One was the supply of electrical appliances, and for that purpose the board established showrooms and ordinary shops.  One of the functions undertaken by the board under the Act was the supply of electrical appliances.  Under this provision an employee of the board who impedes or might impede sales in the sale-room is now put on the same footing as the person who would prevent the generation of electricity.  That is far beyond anything what the Act of 1875, or our adoption of it in the 1927 Act, ever intended to go.</P>
    <P>Away back in 1875 you had a number of public services which demanded continuous attention.  If any worker employed in a public utility service which demanded continuous attention caused a breakdown in the supply of certain things to the community, such <Col N="110" /> as gas or water, and now electricity, then he could be taken before a court. If found guilty of particular conduct he might be punished in a certain way. But, even so, there were certain safeguards. His conduct was made a criminal offence and he had to be taken before a court of summary jurisdiction.  This sub-section is not going in by way of substitution of what was in the 1875 Act, but by way of addition to it.  We are seizing on this small matter of pensions to bring about a situation in which, if any employee of the board prevents the sale of electrical appliances, he can lose his pension rights in so far as they are founded on payments made by him and on service given by him prior to the break caused in connection with the sale of electric bulbs.</P>
    <P>There is a further provision in connection with a manual worker under Section 12.  He is really not entitled to come in under the pensions scheme unless, in anticipation of any break, he ties himself to this: that if he has any dispute about anything he must submit it to a named tribunal in this Bill and must agree to abide by the findings of it.  We start off with the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act the object of which was to prevent a serious interruption in the provision of gas, water and electricity to consumers. We move away from that by imposing upon an employee a penalty in connection with his contribution to the scheme because by his wilful default he impeded or might have impeded the board in the discharge of its functions or duties.  Finally, we come to this that the employee must make an option before he goes into the pension scheme to tie himself, should any dispute arise in connection with his service or employment, that he will take that dispute before a tribunal and will abide by its decision.  That may be a wide provision to introduce, but it certainly cannot be tied up to this public utility matter, or linked up with the 1875 Act, which was aimed to cover a very limited field&mdash;to make it a criminal offence for people to interrupt the supply of gas, water or electricity. This Bill goes to the extent of getting people into the employment <Col N="111" /> of a public utility board and of having all their disputes compulsorily referred to a select type of board.  The Minister said that he would consider other alternatives. I think he is attacking this at the wrong end.</P>
    <P>This cannot be justified on the ground of public utility, because the things I speak of do not touch the supply of electricity.  They are really trivial in connection with the supply of electricity.  Why are they brought into this Bill?  The tribunal is to consist of three people.  One is to be nominated and appointed by the board.  Another is to be appointed in such a way as the board may determine, with the approval of the Minister, and, finally, the chairman is to be nominated and appointed by the Minister.  Why should the Minister be put into this scheme at all, or why should he have this right to appoint?  Is this to be a headline for the new type of arbitration&mdash;that the determining voice in connection with appointments will be the Government? If there is to be compulsory arbitration in this country I hope it will not take that line, and that if there is to be any third or determining voice it will be someone taken from the court area&mdash;some independent and impartial character of that type.  What it is proposed to establish here is, I say, a bad type of tribunal.  Certainly it cannot be considered as a good example to employers or to employees to reconcile their differences.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which is so outstandingly bad that reference should be made to it, and that is, the matter of the payment of arrears. There is really not much good in having a paper scheme for employees of a board like the Electricity Supply Board, if a part of whatever little virtue there is in it really cannot be applied to the work-a-day conditions of those employees.  The board has now been in operation for 15 years.  Pensions generally become payable about the age of 65.  Some of the men who are in the service of the board entered around the age of 20 or 21, but quite a number of them did not.  Certainly those who are in the more important <Col N="112" /> positions, say, on the engineering staff, had some period, after they got through their academic course, in which they got experience elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The result is that those men entered into the service of the board in their earlier thirties or late twenties.  Many of the employees entered much later than that.  Those people have to pay up now for whatever is the remnant of their period with the board.  Take a man who is about 40 years of age at the moment, and let us assume that the pension scheme would come into operation for him at the age of 65.  For 25 years that man will have to pay a particular contribution.  That contribution will be based upon his present salary, and there will be an equal contribution from the board.  But in addition to that, he has to look back over 15 years' contributions, with compound interest, and he is asked to pay those now, if he is to qualify for any type of pension at all under the Bill. He can take his choice and not pay those arrears; then the board pays its share, and he only counts half the 15 years in his pension period.</P>
    <P>When those salaries were given to the men in the employment of the board there was no thought of contributions, and it is very easy to get into a particular standard of living based upon the salary you are receiving. Many of the men in the employment of the board are not so well paid that the board could have immediately expected that they would begin to set aside a pension fund on their own. There was always the hope held out in 1927 that there would be a pension scheme for them.  Some of them could not afford to reduce their standard of living.  In the case of others, some reduction may be possible, but they have got accustomed over a number of years to living in a particular way. I wonder has the Minister made any calculations with regard to the employees of the board in regard to this payment of arrears?  I did get calculations made with regard to some of them, and I should like to put two or three examples to the House.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I am not going to mention names.  I am taking 65 years as the <Col N="113" /> pensionable age.  I have taken three examples.  One man is on a salary of £1,500 at the moment.  He has about 22 years' service left.  That man will have to pay £180 over 22 years in order to qualify under this Bill for a pension of something short of £700.  Another man on the same salary, being an older man, has a period of contribution of 15 years before he reaches the age of 65.  Out of his salary of £1,500 he will have to pay £241 over 15 years, and at the end of the period he will qualify for a pension of about £550.  Is it considered reasonable to ask a man to deduct £241 from his salary, and to continue to do it over 15 years, the remainder of his period with the board, in order to qualify for a pension of about £550?</P>
    <P>I will give a third example.  It is the case of a man on a salary of £1,200. He has 22 years in which he would have to pay a contribution, and he would pay in respect of his future service something over £90 and in respect of his back service it would be nearly £60.  He would pay a contribution of £152 over 22 years, and at the end of it he would qualify for a pension of about £540.  Those are the men with the big salaries.  Does the Minister think of the manual workers, the men who are paid weekly?  Has he thought of their small salaries, and the impossible burden of paying those 15 years' contributions?  It would have been hard enough for them to do that if the measure had been passed away back in 1927, and they had been faced on entering into the service of the Electricity Supply Board with the task of deducting from their salaries the amount which they would have to deduct under this Bill, but you are imposing an impossible burden on them when you ask them in addition to go back over the 15 years during which, through no fault of their own, they have not contributed to the fund, and to pay those contributions now with compound interest.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will go through the salary sheets of the board, divide them into five or six groups, get a mean taken as between the different groups, and find out what those men have to <Col N="114" /> pay, I think he will come to the conclusion that this pension scheme is a paper scheme as far as a number of those employees are concerned.  They will not be able to qualify for pensions. Quite a number will find it hard to qualify on account of the age limit. Quite a number will find it hard to qualify on account of many phrases in the Bill, but this repayment of the 15 years' lost contributions with compound interest will definitely put outside the scope of this Bill many men who would have liked to be inside it.</P>
    <P>I suggest again to the Minister that this whole thing is bad, and completely bad, in principle.  I think that the matter could quite easily be met by a slight amendment of the 1927 Act.  I know that to accept that would involve a rather definite change in viewpoint in connection with this whole matter, but I ask the Minister again to ponder over the logic of leaving the board in a free and independent position in relation to terms and conditions of service.  He should think of their big wage bill, the amazing success that they have achieved, beyond the wildest dreams of the people speaking about this matter in 1927, and ask himself can he justify to this House imposing on the board a Civil Service control in connection with the minor matter of pensions.  I would ask him, in connection with this minor matter of pensions, would it not be a far better course to adopt to allow the board to stand on this unique type of experiment, and let us see how one group of employers can treat the employees of this country when left alone and when there is no interposition by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce or members of their staff?</P>
    <P>Let us have the experiment and let it be run full tilt with this knowledge, that the most liberal thing that the board could do could not make a difference as between a £20,000 and £30,000 per annum pension scheme. You would avoid this matter of asking a repayment of back contributions. That will not operate with regard to new entrants; it will operate only in regard to the members already in. There are quite a number of people <Col N="115" /> who were in the service of the board in the bad years, as I might call them, and who left the employment of the board for some reason best known to themselves.  I make every allowance for special payment in special cases, but the people who are no longer in the service of the board and who left their employment for various reasons in the earlier stages should be given some consideration.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should remove the whole Bill from the House and come in with a one-paragraph measure giving the board, in addition to the very great powers they have at the moment, this small extra power of establishing a pension fund for its employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In all the discussions on the necessity for the provision of pensions for the staff of the Electricity Supply Board the concern has been to ensure that what was thought to be an inadvertent omission from the 1927 Act should be remedied by the introduction of an amending Bill which would give to the Electricity-Supply Board power to provide pensions for its employees, it having been held in certain legal quarters that the earlier Act did not permit the payment of pensions to the board's employees.  All questions on this subject which were directed to the Minister had for their object the slight amendment necessary in the parent Act in order to ensure that the board was equipped with powers to provide pensions for its employees. That was a very narrow issue, a very simple issue.  It was merely a matter of remedying by an amending Bill an omission from the earlier Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what do we find?  Instead of having, as Deputy McGilligan has rightly suggested, a brief amendment of the parent Act, we get instead an amending Bill of 16 sections, and its purpose is not merely to enable the board to provide pensions for its employees; the purpose of this amending Bill is to take away from the Electricity Supply Board certain of its powers of control in respect of the staff, to establish a pensions scheme which has provoked considerable opposition <Col N="116" /> among the people whom it is intended to benefit, and to establish a tribunal which will itself be an instrument of the Minister and which has begotten and will beget considerable opposition and hostility from the trade union movement, because it is an effort to stifle trade union organisation among the staff of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>A very simple issue, therefore, has been grotesquely magnified by the Minister by means of this Bill, a Bill which is quite unnecessary to deal with a problem which can be dealt with by as much writing as would fit on a postcard. The inducements offered to the workers of the Electricity Supply Board under this Bill are represented by pensions on a contributory basis, but these pensions will not be paid on the basis of their entire service unless they are prepared to pay into a pension fund to be created, arrears of contributions due by them, plus compound interest over the period in which the contributions were not paid.</P>
    <P>There is a rather striking anomaly in the Bill.  The directors of the board are not required to pay any contributions to the fund, but the ordinary manual workers, the men struggling on £2 10s., £2 15s., or £3 10s. per week, are expected not merely to pay current contributions, but also, if they are to secure the full pension, they must pay the arrears in respect of the period in which those contributions were not paid.  So far as elderly workers are concerned, they can only purchase a right to pension by carrying a financial burden which they know, and which experience has shown, is too onerous for them.  Such a burden has always proved too onerous for workers similarly placed. Many firms in the past have sought to establish pension schemes for their workers and the problem of providing for the elderly worker has been the rock upon which many schemes foundered.</P>
    <P>If the elderly worker has to pay arrears in respect of his earlier periods of service, that imposes upon him such a heavy financial burden that he is compelled to abandon participation in <Col N="117" /> the scheme and he prefers to carry on spending his week's wages and cannot afford the financial luxury of making provision for his future because of the cost.  If the Minister were to consult the elderly manual staff of the Electricity Supply Board, he would find there is no enthusiasm for the Bill so far as the pension provisions are concerned.  Not merely do these provisions impose a current deduction, but they offer only a small pension unless the workers are prepared to pay the arrears of contributions.  Whatever might be said for asking the persons in high positions on the board to do that&mdash;but they are not asked to pay past or current contributions&mdash;no case can be made for imposing such a heavy burden on manual workers, whose rate of wages, having regard to the present cost of living, is such as to make it impossible for them to bear it.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of the calculation of a pension is extremely intriguing. In the Gárda and in the Civil Service there are schemes which provide a maximum pension of two-thirds or one-half salary, plus a gratuity equal to salary for a year and a half, but in this case the pension is not even calculated on the basis of 1/40th or 1/30th for each year of service, or even 1/80th, which obtains in the Post Office and in the Civil Service generally, apart from the lump sum also payable.  In this case we eliminate the possibility of any lump sum being paid and we fix the method of calculation at 1/48th of the wages or salary, and it is then subject to a maximum of 20/48ths, so that a person cannot get even half his salary or wages as a pension.  Why the figure 48 was selected, I cannot understand; the Minister made no effort to explain to us why it was necessary to select that figure instead of adhering to the recognised practice of paying pensions on a maximum of two-thirds of the salary.  Another provision in the conditions governing the pensions scheme is that only continual service will count for pension purposes and an employee of the board who happened to be guilty of any type of offence which might have led to his dismissal, but who, on a review of the circumstances <Col N="118" /> of the case, was subsequently reinstated, loses entirely his previous service for pension purposes and he also loses&mdash;and this seems an undoubted hardship&mdash;the contributions which he paid in the period prior to the break in his service.  In other words, his right to draw on the fund ceased in respect of the earlier period, but his contributions remained in the fund to be used for the benefit of other persons.</P>
    <P>The most objectionable part of this Bill&mdash;and it seems to me to be the part in which the Government are most concerned&mdash;is the manner in which they provide for the payment of pensions. In order to get a pension under this Bill a person must sign a contract with the board that he will submit every dispute for determination by the tribunal, and that he must sacrifice his right, his natural right and his legal right, to withdraw his labour.  In other words, he must sign away his liberty, he must sign away his conscience.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to compel a man, on the offer of a pension, to agree to submit any claim or any matter in dispute to the tribunal, and he is prevented from going on strike by the use of this instrument against him: that if he once goes on strike he loses all the contributions, which he previously paid into the pensions fund, and all the service he has previously rendered.  That is the weapon held over him to deter him from going on strike.  The Minister knows perfectly well that with a weapon of that kind he might very well be able to create a situation in which persons might refuse to go on strike, and might be willing to put up with any type of injustice rather than risk the loss of a pension, particularly when they were persons of mature years.  In order to get a pension under this Bill, even though the pension is an inadequate one and even though the price exacted for it is extremely high, a person has to accept the decision of this tribunal in every matter affecting his economic position, affecting his status and his grading with the Electricity Supply Board, and unless he is prepared to do that and to accept the decision of that tribunal, then he cannot contract in under this pensions scheme.  Once they have contracted in under the pensions scheme, and once they have accepted this tribunal as the arbiter of their future economic destiny, they dare not go on strike except at the price of losing whatever pensions they have earned by past services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not attempt to tell us what the reason was for the hurried establishment of a tribunal of this kind.  There have been no industrial disputes in the Electricity Supply Board of a kind which led to the interruption of the electricity supply services of the country.  The relations between the board and the staff of the Electricity Supply Board have been harmonious, and I do not think there was even a threatened strike in the Electricity Supply Board during the period of the board's existence.  Yet, although the board apparently has been able to get on well with its employees, and the employees with the board, it is in a condition of harmony <Col N="120" /> of that kind that the Minister rushes in to inject this type of special tribunal and to create there, in that atmosphere of apparent industrial peace, an atmosphere of hostility as between the board and its workers, an atmosphere which was not there until this Bill was introduced, and an atmosphere which will make itself very obvious once the terms of this Bill are read and understood by the workers affected.  If this were an industry in which there were constant disputes, a vital industry, one might understand the anxiety of the Minister to end a condition of affairs which brought about periodic dislocation of industry, but here you have a perfectly peaceful industry, where there have been no disputes whatever and where there have been amity and concord between the board and its staff.  Notwithstanding the fact, that, obviously, that condition of affairs does not call for the application of experiments of this kind, it is to an industry of that kind that the Minister wants to apply this particularly offensive type of tribunal.</P>
    <P>Now, let us have a look at the tribunal which the Minister proposes to appoint.  One member is to be nominated by the board, one is to be nominated by the workers under some type of machinery to be created by the board with the approval of the Minister, and one person is to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to be paid by the board. What chance has a worker's representative in a tribunal of that kind?  As this Bill indicates, the Minister will have an even stronger grip over the board itself by having a nominee on the tribunal.  In this particular case the tribunal will be composed of one workers' representative and two other representatives, one of whom will only see the board's point of view, because the person will be the nominee of the board, and the other who will see both the board's point of view and the Minister's point of view, because he is the nominee of the Minister, and, so far as questions of wages are concerned, will probably be closer to the board than he will be to the workers.</P>

      <P>This tribunal is nominated, to the extent of one-third, by the board, to the extent of one-third by the workers, and the chairman is nominated by the Minister.  I object to giving the Minister power to nominate the chairman, because I do not think you will get an impartial nomination from him.  I think, from the Minister's outlook as it appears in connection with this Bill, you will inevitably get from the Minister the type of person who will be on the side of the board and against the worker.  I do not think the Minister would shed the right of nominating an impartial chairman if he were to ask the Chief Justice to take on himself the task of appointing a chairman to preside over the functions of this tribunal&mdash;if a tribunal of this kind is maintained at all, although my strong advice to the <Col N="122" /> Minister would be to leave this matter of the tribunal alone.  It has not been an issue for the last 15 years. The need for it has not arisen during the last 15 years, and what is the necessity to rush in with it now?  The Minister might very well go slow in this matter, and not cross his bridges until he comes to them, instead of rushing in to provide a tribunal of this kind, which nobody wants, and the need for which has not been shown even by the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the Minister thought there was any danger of an interruption of the service there are ways and means of dealing with such a situation without forcing a tribunal of that kind through this House.  These tribunals, as a matter of fact, very often do not work, and when a real crisis arises it is goodwill and co-operation that help to overcome difficulties rather than pieces of machinery, which are the first things to be wrecked, once tempers become frayed or temperatures show an inclination to rise.  This tribunal will be the instrument of the Minister.  The board will have one-third, the Minister will have another third, and the workers will have two-thirds against them all the time.  If the workers and the board do not agree there will be the decision of the chairman.  That mentality is running in the country. We know the kind of award there would be by a chairman appointed by the Minister, responsible to the Minister and paid by the board.  I suggest to the Minister that if he is really concerned about the establishment of arbitration he ought, at this stage, try to devise some method by which there will be a voluntary arbitration scheme. The Government will not have arbitration in other things, but when we come to the Electricity Supply Board they want to insist on it having an arbitration scheme which is not wanted. They started out in 1933 to consider arbitration and then would not give it, and have not since given it, but, in respect to the Electricity Supply Board, the Minister wants members of the staff to have an arbitration board that they do not want.  That is the kind of somersaulting we get here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that he wants an arbitration <Col N="123" /> board to be established; it can be got with the goodwill and the co-operation of the unions catering for the Electricity Supply Board by the machinery under the Industrial Courts Acts.</P>
    <P>We have had experience of these and in course of time their decisions would produce acceptance of their machinery. If that is not acceptable the procedure of the Railway Wages Board might be applied to the Electricity Supply Board.  It is possible to create a permanent type of arbitration tribunal whose decisions, while not compulsory, would meet with acceptance.  The Railways Wages Board has acted in that way for a long period, and its decisions generally, while producing annoyance from time to time, sometimes on the part of the unions and sometimes on the part of the companies, are generally accepted.  The fact that the board functions in that way has certainly secured a long period of peace in the railways, and is calculated to continue to ensure a period of peace on the railways. We might try, with a good deal of reason, the type of arbitration envisaged in the Industrial Courts Acts, and I think the Minister should look into that and not insist on enforcing a tribunal of this sort, which is not part of the grievance for the establishment of a pension scheme, because there are no disputes in the Electricity Supply Board.  In the long run this may be found to be the weakest need of the Electricity Supply Board and one calculated to cause interruption.  If confronted with that situation, I would appeal to the reason of both sides, saying that this was a national and a vital service, any interruption of which would cause considerable hardship. I would appeal to them on these lines to settle their difficulties and not to interrupt the service, rather than to expect three people to sit down to pronounce judgment on an issue.  An appeal of that kind would be likely to have an effect on the common sense of both sides in a dispute.  I hope the Minister will not persist with a scheme of compulsory arbitration being applied to the Electricity Supply Board staff.  There is no need for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> The Minister will be ill-advised if he proceeds with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some reference to the details of the Bill.  One is the position of certain employees of Rathmines and Pembroke Urban Councils affected by this Bill.  There are ten employees in Rathmines and 12 in Pembroke who were taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  They were not pensionable employees of Rathmines or Pembroke, although if the Electricity Supply Board had not taken them over, they would probably have been absorbed in the Dublin Corporation Electricity Supply Board branch, when the townships were incorporated in the Dublin area.  They were taken over by the Electricity Supply Board before that event.  Having been taken over by the Electricity Supply Board they got no pensions because they were not pensionable by the urban councils.  There is no provision for pensioning them under this Bill; at all events no mandatory provision, and it seems to me that the most they are likely to get is three-eighths, assuming that Section 13 was operated in their favour.  It is not obligatory on the board to operate Section 13, but power is given to grant pensions up to a maximum of three-eighths.  Some of these people are very old.  They gave long service to the urban councils, and long service to the Electricity Supply Board, but the most they can expect the board will give them is probably a maximum three-eighths in pensions.  I think the Minister might recognise that these are exceptional cases.  If the Electricity Supply Board had not taken over the Dublin Corporation works and the staff, and if these men had been taken over by the corporation they would be entitled to a maximum of two-thirds.  Because the Electricity Supply Board intervened they got no pensions and they can now get only a maximum of three-eighths instead of two-thirds.  I should like the Minister to examine their cases to see if it would not be possible to make some special provision for persons like these, who have been particularly unlucky and who, even under this Bill, are not likely to get much in respect of past services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> I understand that when the Pigeon House Works were closed down a number of employees was paid off and, being employees of Dublin Corporation, they got certain pensions based on service.  When it was discovered that the scheme could not run without the Pigeon House plant being used as an auxiliary plant a number of these persons were re-employed by the Electricity Supply Board, and I understand some of them have been in the service of the board for ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>Apparently in this Bill there is no provision for reckoning that additional service.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance that some effort will be made to link up the previous service of those men at the Pigeon House with the services they have given for the past ten years or more with the Electricity Supply Board so that they may, when retiring from the service of the Electricity Supply Board, get pensions based on the additional service they have rendered to the Electricity Supply Board for the past ten or 12 years.  There are cases of other employees similar to the case of one with whom I happen to be acquainted where, having been employed by a certain company whose electricity plant was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board, he was superannuated by the company on a pension of approximately half his previous salary.  The Electricity Supply Board and the company had power to add five years from each side to his pension period.  The company was willing to do so, but the Electricity Supply Board was not then willing to do so, with the result that this man, whose salary at the time was approximately £800 per year, found himself, at a time when his domestic responsibilities were heavy, being pushed out with a pension of £390.  It was not easy for that man to adjust his income or his standard of living.  He was subsequently re-employed by the Electricity Supply Board, and has been employed for the past 11 years.  If he now retires from the service of the Electricity Supply Board, he will get no recognition whatever for the past 11 years' service, unless the Minister will undertake to move an amendment <Col N="126" /> on Committee Stage to enable persons to hook up their recent service with the board with whatever previous service they had either with the board or with some undertaking taken over by the board.  This whole question of the absorption of various staffs of different electrical undertakings by the Electricity Supply Board has produced, as the Minister knows, many difficulties, and, if we are to have a long Bill of this kind, we ought to utilise it for doing something useful in the way of removing these anomalies which have grown up because of the manner in which the staffs were taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has covered practically everything I should have liked to have said on the Bill.  I think the Bill is unnecessary. Its object might have been achieved, as Deputy McGilligan said, by an amendment of the Principal Act.  Its terms are niggardly and the provision of compulsory arbitration might have been left to some other time.  I want to ask the Minister a question in regard to what I would call the pernicious obligations in the Bill by which employees are to be asked to make retrospective payments&mdash;I do not like to call them payments of arrears&mdash;in relation to their full pensions later on.  Under the Bill, if they do not make these payments in respect of arrears, they will not get the full pension, but, if they do make these payments, are they assured in all cases of getting back even the lump sum they have paid?  What will be the position in respect of a person compelled to make these payments for the number of years he spent in the service of the board before the Bill was brought into operation&mdash;I do not like to describe them as arrears because one does not like to associate that word with something which a person was under no obligation to pay&mdash;and who dies a year or two years afterwards? Will his dependents get back that money or not?  According to my reading of the Bill, they will get nothing. Having regard to what Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Norton have said, further speeches on the Bill are <Col N="127" /> unnecessary, but I should like the Minister to say what will be the position of the dependents of an employee who dies some years after the coming into operation of this Bill.  Are such persons assured of getting back everything paid in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan described this Bill as another development in the process of bringing the Electricity Supply Board under Government control.  He said that originally the Electricity Supply Board was set up as an independent body, subject only to certain minor restrictions&mdash;the obligation to submit an annual report to the Dáil and the restriction implied in the power given to the Minister to remove the members of the board on the expiration of their term of office.  He stated that since he set up the board in that independent position, the Department of Industry and Commerce had been trying to get their hooks into it for the purpose of destroying its independence and bringing it back subject to a degree of supervision and control not contemplated originally.  The only restriction upon the independence of the board was imposed by Deputy McGilligan in 1931.  Since he enacted in that year legislation amending the Electricity Supply Act in respect of borrowings of the board, there has been no further restriction imposed on the liberty of the board. Whatever power was conferred on the Department of Industry and Commerce to supervise the capital expenditure of the board was conferred by the Act of 1931, and has not been added to since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the original intention was to set up the board in a more independent position than it now has and it is true that that attempt did not lead to happy results in the early days of the board's existence, and that Deputy McGilligan who then had responsibility in the matter decided that he had to step back from the position originally taken up, but from that position, taken up in the second instance, there has been no retrogressive movement since.  It may have been, and I am quite sure it was, Deputy McGilligan's intention when he <Col N="128" /> was Minister in 1931, that the new restriction placed upon the liberty of the board which gave power to supervise its capital expenditure to the Department of Industry and Commerce should be of a temporary character.  I have on many occasions since considered the possibility of removing that restriction again.  I did not do so because I did not think anything was to be gained by doing so, nor has it appeared to me in practice to impose any undue restriction upon the liberty of the board.</P>
    <P>I think that at some stage we shall have to consider the position of the Electricity Supply Board as a whole. I am not at all sure that the original scheme of organisation was the best. However, the officers appointed by the board&mdash;I may remind Deputy McGilligan that it was he who appointed a civil servant chairman of the board&mdash;have remained unchanged by me.  Whether or not I considered that they were the most suitable persons available, I certainly saw no good reason for changing them, and that organisation has continued in existence since the present Government came into office.  I must say, however, that I have often had in my mind the idea that we should reorganise the board itself, because I think the system of having on the board persons who are also executive officers of the organisation is not the best possible. I do not say it has always worked badly, or that it is now working badly, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board; but, certainly, if we were starting again on the establishment of an organisation of that kind, I think we would adopt the more obvious system of a board responsible only for supervising its executive officers and operating through a managing director, as most commercial organisations do.</P>
    <P>I do, however, wish to refute the suggestion that there has been any deliberate movement on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Finance or the Government to place upon the board any restrictions which did not exist when we came into office, or to curtail their liberty of action in matters which are entirely within their own domain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> It was said here this evening that, in this matter of the pensions scheme, we were going the wrong way: that the only thing necessary to do was to pass a short Bill making it quite clear that, under the original Act, the Electricity Supply Board, in addition to fixing the salaries of its officers, could also provide pensions for them.  Now Deputy McGilligan, if for no other reason than that of maintaining consistency with his own past, could make that suggestion and stand over it, but I frankly admit I was astonished to find it coming from Deputy Norton, who poses as the champion of the workers.  There are two courses we could take, the first which Deputy McGilligan suggested and which Deputy Norton endorsed that we merely empower the Electricity Supply Board to pay pensions if they want to&mdash;much the same thing as we did in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company, to empower them to pay pensions if they want to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that they are.  Deputy Norton is beginning to realise now that he put his foot in it when he endorsed Deputy McGilligan's suggestion, which was that we merely give the board legal power to prepare a pensions scheme for the benefit of their workers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone further than that in the interests of these particular workers.  We are not merely empowering the board to prepare pensions schemes for the benefit of their employees but we are saying in this Bill that, as soon as may be after it is <Col N="130" /> passed, the board shall, in accordance with the section, prepare these schemes.  That is the essential difference between the two methods of procedure. We are making it obligatory on the board to prepare a pensions scheme, and, if we are requiring the board to submit the scheme for the consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think there is a good reason for it.  It can be said, of course, that the board would pay pensions if they were allowed to do so.  In fact, there has been a suggestion by Deputy McGilligan and, I think, by Deputy Norton that we should allow the board to pay any pensions they like; that there should be no restrictions upon the amount of pensions they paid either to themselves as members of the board or to the employees of the board.  I think that is a perfectly preposterous suggestion.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that we can, if we like, allow the existing Electricity Supply Board to pay any pensions they like.  We know that if they were to do so that would not, as Deputy McGilligan said, burst their revenue.  Their revenues are large enough to enable them to pay large pensions, and if they are not large enough they can increase their electricity charges and get the money to pay the large pensions.  I ask Deputies to contemplate not merely a pension scheme for the employees of the Electricity Supply Board but that in the development of social conditions in this country a similar pension scheme might operate for the employees of other public utilities.  Every public <Col N="132" /> utility, however, is not in the happy position of the Electricity Supply Board of being able to pay any pensions they like without any deterioration in their revenue position, so that if we establish that precedent in relation to this board we are making it not easier but more difficult to establish this system of providing pensions for workers on retirement by other less fortunately circumstanced undertakings. We authorised the Great Southern Railways Company to pay pensions to their workers.  We put on the company the obligation of preparing a scheme and of submitting it to the Railway Tribunal.  The railway company did that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I summoned both sides together and said to them: &ldquo;Get an agreed scheme and I will introduce legislation to make it effective,&rdquo; and after years of negotiation we got a scheme agreed upon.  It was submitted to me and accepted by me as a reasonable one, but in the precarious financial position of the company at the time it could not be proceeded with, and was not on that account.  If we contemplate the employees of railway companies, gas companies, and other public utilities and of large industrial concerns being put in the position of having pensions provided for them when they reach the age of retirement, we must ensure that the precedent which we are establishing for the Electricity Supply Board will be one which will be capable of being made applicable to them also.  We cannot set too high a standard for other companies when they are preparing schemes to meet their particular circumstances. Everyone knows that if negotiations were taking place with the representatives of the workers of those undertakings or if strikes were <Col N="133" /> fostered in order to enforce the payment of pensions, that the precedent established for the Electricity Supply Board would be quoted as a justification for the demands made on behalf of the employees of those other undertakings.</P>
      <P>I think we should be reasonable in this.  I think it is not preposterous for the Minister for Finance to ask me to ensure that in any pensions scheme provided for the officials of the Electricity Supply Board the practice in the Civil Service should be taken into account.  Is it unreasonable to say that officials employed by the Electricity Supply Board should not be better treated than officials in Government Departments?  It is a fact, in respect of the members of the board anyway, that the terms which it is supposed to give them are better than they would get if they had been Government officials drawing similar remuneration. I do not think that we should leave that out of account or ignore the possibility that the standards we set now may, if they are set too high, be the cause of considerable trouble not merely in the public service, but also in a number of industrial undertakings whether set up under statute or privately owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At some stage this idea of establishing pension schemes for employees on retirement due to old age will be generally adopted.  Therefore, I propose to stick to this provision which requires the Electricity Supply Board to submit its pension scheme for consideration.  I am not going to deal with the actuarial aspect of these schemes.  I presume the Electricity Supply Board will employ, in their preparation, persons as competent as any that I could command. So far as that part of their scheme is concerned, we will allow experience to show whether they are right or wrong, but, in relation to the question of public policy that arises in this matter, I think it is not unreasonable to say that, before the scheme is finally approved and brought into operation, the Minister for State who is in charge of this business should have an opportunity of seeing what it contains, and requiring such modifications <Col N="134" /> of it as in his opinion public policy necessitates.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy sit back and listen.  I am not going to deal much more with him anyway.  The Bill, as I have said, deals with two matters.  One is the matter of pensions to members of the board itself, and the other is the payment of pensions to members of the staff of the board. I think we should put, by legislation, a limitation upon the pensions which members of the board will pay to themselves&mdash;I do not think anybody will contend otherwise&mdash;and I think that, in determining the limitations that are to be put on the pensions they can pay to themselves, we should have regard to the pensions which comparable service would earn in the public service.  In fact, because of the special circumstances of the board, and the later age at which members of the board entered that service as compared with the ordinary age of entering into the public service, they are getting better terms than members of the public service would get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are non-contributory pensions, because it would not be practicable, having regard to the very small number of individuals involved and the very short period of years during which the board has been in existence, to establish a fund.  It would not be practicable to establish a system of contributory pensions in respect of members of the board. Deputy McGilligan referred to one member of the board who does not qualify at present in respect of ten years' continuous service.  That individual was a member of the board and then ceased to be a member of the board, and when he ceased to be a member of the board he received a lump sum gratuity in respect of his retirement. I do not think we should ignore that fact in deciding what his future pension is to be.  Having regard to the payment of a lump sum in gratuity on the termination of his services in 1931, I think it is only reasonable to take the continuity of his service from his reappointment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  What are we providing for here?  We are providing for compensation to members of a board, who are likely to be appointed fairly late in life, provided they give ten years' service.  What case is there for giving them a pension at all?  There is only this case, that the persons who are likely to be selected for membership of that board are persons who have made a success of their lives in whatever particular sphere they spent them.  They are likely to be persons in employment, who have made good in that employment, and commanded public confidence either in a technical or administrative capacity.  Such persons who are taken out of that employment and given an opportunity of membership of this board are likely to suffer loss if they are divorced from their normal occupations for a considerable time, and the period of ten years is suggested as being the period which should entitle them to payment of pensions on a non-contributory basis, if and when they are retired from membership of the Electricity Supply Board.  I think a shorter period would be open to abuse.  It would lead to the possibility of members being changed around more frequently and it might <Col N="139" /> also not be in the interests of the Electricity Supply Board, because clearly those who are appointed members of the board, so long as it remains constituted as at present, should not be disturbed unnecessarily, and experience in the administration of the affairs of that concern is a very important qualification for membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only on the ten-year point.  What of the other point&mdash;the man who serves for ten years and has a break?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We might discuss that matter in committee.  The point to be considered is whether each of the periods should be in any way considerable, sufficient to involve a man breaking contact with his normal occupation, his ordinary method of living, to an extent that might involve him in personal loss.  There is always a difficulty in inaugurating a pension scheme for an established organisation, especially where that scheme involves contributions calculated on an actuarial basis into a fund out of which pensions will be paid and which fund must be kept solvent.  When we apply a contributory pension scheme to the Electricity Supply Board, or any similar organisation, we apply it to numbers of persons of all ages.  It will apply equally to the person who has just come into the service of the organisation as well as to the person who is about to retire. A difficulty will always arise, unless you are prepared to make a very considerable capital contribution to the fund in respect of those over a certain age when they entered the service. Those who enter young at the beginning of their service will be better off; their pensions will be better than will the pensions of those who entered the service fairly late in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many persons in the Electricity Supply Board organisation may prefer not to make contributions to the pension fund because already they will have made provision for their old age under insurance policies.  That is a matter for themselves to decide.  We say that as from the day upon which this fund <Col N="140" /> begins to operate everybody is in it and, on the basis of a particular contribution, they can get a particular pension.  We say to those previously in the service of the board: &ldquo;You can, if you like, increase the pension you will get to the extent that you are prepared to contribute to the fund in respect of your past service.&rdquo;  We provide in respect of the past service, that the Electricity Supply Board will give its contribution in any event, so that in respect of the past service of each member of the staff a half pension is guaranteed and they can get the other half if they choose to make their contributions. In any event, their contribution and the board's contribution will provide for a pension.  That is a common device in pension schemes. Officers of my Department have examined pension schemes drawn up for large-scale industrial organisations of different kinds and there is no dissimilarity between our provisions and the provisions in these other pension schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one scheme that might interest Deputy Davin.  It was for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company and it contains a precisely similar provision. Deputy Davin should know that.  No one would regard that as unreasonable in the circumstances in which the pension fund was applied to the employees of that organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board scheme will be based on actuarial reports.  Deputy McGilligan quoted certain figures as to the contributions which certain employees of the board would have to pay in order to get the pension he mentioned.  I have also seen these figures and I am not at all sure that these calculations are sound and that every factor that might be taken into account in determining the size of the contribution and the pension was allowed for.  I think they were prepared on an unduly conservative basis.  It was assumed in prepar- <Col N="141" /> ing these figures that one half of the Electricity Supply Board employees would elect to retire at 60 instead of 65 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the experience of the public services can be relied upon.  Deputy McGilligan will recollect that in his time as Minister not merely was there no desire to retire earlier than at 65, but even at 65 most civil servants desired to be retained in the public service rather than retire on pension and, while the circumstances of the Electricity Supply Board might be slightly different, because many of the employees are technical men and their work is mostly outdoor work, nevertheless it is a reasonable assumption that a higher proportion than 50 per cent. will elect to remain on to 65 rather than retire at 60.  If it is assumed that 80 or 90 per cent. will go on to 65, then a considerable change in these figures is produced.  In any event, it appears to me not unreasonable to say to these people who are drawing substantial remuneration and who had no guarantee that a pension scheme would be available for them at all and who, presumably, have made provision against their old age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the manual staff, I would be inclined to take a much more lenient view, were it not for the consideration that the problem of other organisations may be much more difficult than that of the Electricity Supply Board.  The Electricity Supply Board is still a comparatively young organisation.  When we set out to devise a scheme for the Great Southern Railways the average age of the persons concerned was, I think, over 50.  It was extraordinarily high and the whole scheme broke down because of the impossibility of getting a revenue from contributions sufficient to pay any pension worth having, due to the very high rate at which contributions would have to be fixed on account <Col N="142" /> of the high average age of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>For new entrants you could always have a pension scheme, but if the average age is high that can only be met by a subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And, as the Deputy knows, it would be a complete impossibility for the Great Southern Railways to provide that subvention.  Similar circumstances might arise in relation to a number of older organisations in respect of which a movement might be made to provide pension schemes.  It is, I think, undesirable that we should establish certain precedents in relation to the Electricity Supply Board which might be the cause of difficulties later. If it could be shown that a real hardship has been inflicted on the manual workers, I would be inclined to take a more lenient view.  From discussions I have had with certain representatives, I gather there may be a disinclination on the part of some manual workers to enter the pension fund at all, to pay immediately the contributions involved.</P>

      <P>I think that the other point that remains unanswered is the question of the tribunal, and I want <Col N="143" /> Deputies to approach this matter in a reasonable frame of mind, because I think they misunderstand, not merely the intentions of the Government, but also the attitude of the Electricity Supply Board employees in the matter.  From any interpretation of the representations I received from the Electricity Supply Board employees, it was not made clear to me that there was objection to the establishment of a tribunal.  There was certain objection to the form of the tribunal, such as a suggestion that the chairman might be appointed by the High Court rather than by the Minister. Well, I think I am just as competent to do that as the High Court, but, of course, that is a matter of opinion.  My intention, however, is that it should be an impartial tribunal and that no influence should be brought to bear on its members other than the influence of the terms of reference laid down in the Bill, and that they should discharge their functions without any undue pressure either from the board, the Government, or anybody else.  Now, while it is impossible, in this life, to get a completely impartial body, or some individual who will not be liable to be influenced by considerations that should not enter his mind, we should try to go as near that as possible, and that is my aim.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have some person, whether an organisation or an individual, to devise a system.  It is quite clear to me, from the representations I have received from the Electricity Supply Board Permanent Pensions Committee, that there is no fundamental objection, in principle, to a tribunal at all, and that the attempts to manufacture that objection are completely without support from the persons for whom this committee speaks. They say that there is &ldquo;necessity <Col N="145" /> for the establishment of (a) some form of internal conciliation board, representative of the manual workers, the general workers, where, perhaps, the first problem to be considered may be the type of superannuation scheme to be formulated, and of (b) a tribunal to consider such matters as cannot be agreed upon by the internal conciliation board.&rdquo;  It is the type of machinery we contemplate, and I presume that in any matters arising between the board and any section of its workers an attempt will be made to settle that by conciliation and, in default of conciliation, that the matter will come to the tribunal.  Accordingly, we established that system and I think it is necessary and desirable in the interests of the workers to have it there.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a pensions scheme, it is necessary that there should be continuity of service by the workers: otherwise, they will lose their contributions and the right to pensions if they withdraw their services and break their continuity.  Deputy Norton suggested that employees of the board would have to put up with any kind of injustice rather than go on strike. It is for the very purpose of ensuring that they will not have to put up with any kind of injustice that the provision is put in there to establish that tribunal.  It is to give them machinery to prevent the possibility of that injustice.  Take what happened in connection with Dublin Corporation strike.  It was the legislation introduced by the Government which protected the workers there, who had gone on strike and had thereby broken their continuity of service.  If that legislation had not been introduced here, those employees would have sacrificed their rights to pensions and be now starting a new period of service in order to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Electricity Supply Board, it is not desirable that there should be a similar situation, and it is not a question of the workers there having to choose between injustice and the sacrifice of their pensions.  We are giving them an alternative to injustice, and that is an impartial tribunal.  It is intended that it will be impartial, and <Col N="146" /> it will be there to protect these workers against the possibility of their position being abused by the board and injustice meted out to them.  It is, surely, as much a protection to the workers as to the board, because it provides that any dispute between the board and the employees may be submitted to that tribunal.</P>

      <P>In default of agreement. I think that is desirable, not merely in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, but with other similar undertakings, the continuous operation of which is essential, not merely for as concerning public convenience but, very often, the livelihoods of thousands of workers.  A number of matters of detail were raised which I do not propose to deal with now as they can be dealt with more effectively on the Committee Stage.  I propose to confine myself now to this question of principle.  I should like to say that it was with very considerable hesitation, under present circumstances, that I asked the Government to proceed with this Bill at all.  I think that we could have made a good alibi for the adjournment of this measure until after the emergency, but having regard to the fact that it had been under discussion for some time and that it might be held to be a breach of faith if we did not go on with it, I prefer to go ahead with the Bill.  But if Deputies do not want the Bill proceeded with now, then I am quite prepared to put it back again and have another period of discussion to see if we can get a Bill on which there would be agreement.  In my view, however, that would not be in the interests of the employees of the Electricity Supply Board, and a much more preferable course would be to proceed with this Bill now, get the scheme going, and get it into operation on reasonable lines.  It is true that we <Col N="147" /> impose certain restrictions on the Electricity Supply Board in the preparation of schemes, but these are not unusual or unfair, having regard to the circumstances of industrial organisation generally.</P>

    <P>The Estimate for the Army Vote for the financial year 1942-43 is presented in the same unusual form as its immediate predecessor last year.  As <Col N="152" /> was then explained, the form was and is determined solely by reasons of public policy, in that the Government has decided that it would not be in the public interest to publish the manifold details which go to make up the gross sum of £9,037,512, or the net sum of £8,942,052 which the Dáil is asked to approve and to vote.</P>
    <P>When this emergency form of the Estimate was introduced, an undertaking was given that the details of the Estimate would be presented to the Department of Finance, that the Departmental accounts would be kept by the usual sub-heads, that the control by the Department of Finance over the expenditure under the different sub-heads would be unimpaired and that every effort would be made to stamp out any disregard of regulations or any tendency towards negligence or waste.  That undertaking has been faithfully carried out&mdash;the details of the present Estimate were submitted to the Department of Finance, the monthly accounts are rendered to the Comptroller and Auditor-General on the basis of the ordinary sub-heads, the control of Finance remains intact over all expenditure, and during the past year any infringement of regulations or any negligence, default or waste has been punished and stopped.  In other words the form of the Estimate has not and will not affect in any way the usual methods of financial control.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Army stands at present at about the same figure as it did this time last year.  That is not bad, but in view of the constant danger which confronts this country it is not a position which can be regarded with satisfaction or complacency.  The fact of the matter is that a very large number of men are required to complete war establishments, and it must be admitted that the response to the appeal of members of the Government and the Defence Conference for more recruits has not been all that it should be or all that was expected.  An appeal is, therefore, made to individual members of this House to bring before the youth of their constituencies the vital need of the Army for more recruits, and their duty to fill the gaps in the ranks of the forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> In regard to this question of recruitment, it must be pointed out that during the past year the military authorities have adapted the conditions of Army service to meet the exigencies of the civil occupations of soldiers.  Thus, there has been introduced a system of agricultural leave whereby soldiers formerly employed on the land may be released from Army service to take their part in agricultural production. It is, therefore, possible for young men of the farming community to join the Army and undergo training during the slack periods of agricultural production, and then to obtain leave when operations on the land demand their services.  In this way service in the Army may be combined with service on the land, and the balance of agricultural and military requirements maintained.</P>
    <P>Again there has been introduced for other occupations a system of indefinite leave whereby a soldier, once fully trained, may obtain leave to resume his former occupation, or to take up a job if he has succeeded in getting one, or if his studies for any of the professions have been interrupted through his response to the call of the Army. These points are mentioned and stressed because it is felt that if they were more widely known the response to the call for more recruits would be better.</P>
    <P>As regards actual conditions in the Army we have within our very limited financial resources done our utmost to maintain and improve the conditions under which soldiers serve.  Our soldiers are as well, if not better, fed, housed and clothed than any other Army in Europe, so that although their pay may not be as high as we would like it to be if our financial conditions permitted, the conditions under which they are serving are as good as we can make them.  For married men we have during the year increased the rates of marriage allowance payable to the wives and children and for men who enlist for the duration of the emergency we have extended the date whereby they can qualify for marriage allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> Another extension of privilege which we have been able to concede is the grant of a free railway warrant to all married non-commissioned officers and all privates when going on annual leave.</P>
    <P>The discipline of the Army has, on the whole, been satisfactory and the number of serious moral or criminal delinquencies has been relatively light. In the conditions under which the Army so rapidly expanded two years ago it was inevitable that some undesirables should have succeeded in entering the ranks, but they have been gradually weeded out.</P>
    <P>Similarily the medical authorities report that the health of the Army has been excellent and that there has not been any epidemic even of the mildest variety.  This satisfactory position is, of course, due in no small measure to the conditions already mentioned under which the Army is housed, fed and clothed.</P>
    <P>The morale of all ranks of the forces is admirable, and the men have taken to their training with interest and zeal. During the year the organisation of the different arms has been developed and their training has been progressively intensified.  During the autumn, manoeuvres and combined exercises have been carried out on an extensive scale, and each arm of the service has had practical experience of what its functions would be in relation to all other arms in the event of active service. The House will be glad to hear that there has been a steady increase in the supply of equipment, and though in relation to our needs that supply is as yet but a trickle there is every hope that during the coming year it may develop into a steady flow.  In many respects, indeed, and despite still many grave deficiencies, the Army is better equipped to-day than at any other period of its existence.</P>
    <P>An integral part of the Army proper is the L.D.F. which was taken over from the Gárda Síochána at the beginning of 1941.  Our whole aim regarding this force is to make it a self-contained replica of the Army proper for the purpose primarily of local defence, but <Col N="155" /> also of acting as a useful ancillary in case of need to the Army itself.  The force is organised on a basis of groups, districts and areas within each of the four military commands.  Each group is, as far as possible, organised and divided on a functional basis similar to that which obtains in the Army itself, and the training of the whole force is not only modelled on that of the Army but is co-ordinated with it.  During the winter months training had of necessity to be confined to theory of the weapons used, and to instruction in drill, but advantage will be taken to hold courses, camps, exercises and manoeuvres at which practical experience is given in the use of the weapons and in the functions of the force in relation to local defence and to the Army generally.  The fact that the exercises and manoeuvres are held conjointly with the Army and under the supervision of Army officers acting as umpires not only adds interest to the work, but gives the force a practical demonstration of what they may have to face under active service conditions.</P>
    <P>Command officers dealing with the administration of the L.D.F. report that the discipline and morale of this purely voluntary body of citizens are good, and they speak in most encouraging terms of the force as a whole. Recruiting for this force has continued even during the winter months, and the response has not been unsatisfactory. But against this increase we must offset the wastage due to resignations, discharges, and casualties generally, so that there is still ample room for more and more recruits for this force as there is for the Army itself.  The attendance of members of the L.D.F. at special parades held from time to time throughout the country has been exceedingly good, and if the activity of the force were to be measured by this standard, it would leave little to be desired.  The same thing cannot, however, be said of the attendance at ordinary parades and drills in each district. That, of course, is in a sense only to be expected, but what needs stressing is that, in order to fit themselves for the defence of the country, each unit should endeavour to attain <Col N="156" /> in the shortest possible time the utmost proficiency in the use of its arms, and the clearest practical lessons in what is expected of them in case of need.  What is felt is that the urgency of the problem which confronts us is not generally realised, and that if it were realised, the gaps in the ranks would quickly be filled and the activity of the members vastly increased.</P>
    <P>The same lack of a sense of urgency seems to pervade the minds not only of the general public but also of some of our local authorities regarding the initiation, expansion and completion of Air Raid Precautions Services, and here, too, there is a good deal of leeway to make up before we can regard the position as satisfactory.  In some areas, county, scheduled and special, the various schemes approved by the Department have been taken up with admirable enthusiasm, and patriotic volunteers have given freely of their time and leisure to carry them out. But in others the schemes have either not been implemented at all, or have been put into operation in a dilatory and almost reluctant manner.  In some cases the fault lies with the local administrative bodies but in others it is due to lack of enthusiasm on the part of the public.  The Department is doing its utmost to provide the equipment necessary for the various schemes which it has approved, but there is no use in providing equipment unless men have been trained to work it.  This is not to say that steady progress has not taken place in many areas during the past year, or that there has been any slackening of effort on the part of the Department in expanding and developing the various services which will be required in the event of air raids, but it does mean that more interest and energy must be put into the work by volunteers and local bodies if we are to be prepared for the incidence of air raids on our civilian population.  On this subject, therefore, Deputies are asked to take a personal interest and to bring home by every means in their power the urgency of the problem.</P>
    <P>Turning to aspects, other than military, of the Army's activities during the past year, Deputies will, no <Col N="157" /> doubt, be interested to hear something about the results of our experience and experiment with the Construction Corps.  Formed in October, 1940, the object of the experiment was to give the unemployed youth of the country, many of whom had no taste for soldiering, an opportunity to build themselves up physically and to train themselves for civilian occupations when their term of service had expired.  The original term of enlistment was for a period of one year with 1/- a day pay (increased under certain conditions) with a gratuity of £10 at the end of that period.  Under these conditions of service we have put through our hands several thousand young men, but at the end of their term of enlistment a large number of them elected to take their discharge.  During their time with us they were engaged on work of a productive and national character, such as timber felling for the Army and for the Department of Supplies to build up a reserve of fuel, the drainage of bogs preparatory to the cutting of turf, turf cutting itself, the reclamation of land and the building of roads.</P>
    <P>With the experience gathered during the past year, it has been felt that the conditions of service needed revision. In the first place, we feel that 12 months is not sufficiently long to give the training originally visualised when the corps was formed; and, in the second, it was thought that the rates of pay were not such as to attract youths to enlist.  We have, therefore, altered the term of enlistment from one to two years, and we have raised the pay from 1/- to 1/9 a day&mdash;again increased under certain conditions&mdash;with a gratuity of £5 payable at the end of the two years' period of service.  At the present moment we have 200 men engaged at Lullymore Bog, County Kildare, draining the bog in preparation for a turf drive next season.  A similar number are engaged at Glencree, County Wicklow, and at Nadd, County Cork, on the same type of work, and at Cluais, County Galway, we have another 200 men of the corps working on the reclamation of land.</P>
    <P>From a strictly military standpoint, it would be better to have the youth of the Construction Corps handling arms <Col N="158" /> and ammunition rather than wielding pick-axes and shovels&mdash;learning how to use military weapons rather than engineering tools.  But it was not military, but social-economic considerations, which led the Government to embark on this experiment of the Construction Corps.  We had the problem of youths scattered all over the country, unwilling or unfit to join the Army, and, in the absence of work, degenerating physically and drifting into bad social and economic habits.  The problem was and is to turn potential drones into active producers and good citizens, and the Construction Corps is simply a small, though not inexpensive, experiment in that direction.</P>
    <P>The national shortage of fuel was another problem which the Army has helped to solve during the past year. Besides cutting turf for its own requirements, it has also cut for the national pool of fuel about 25,000 tons of turf, and between 10,000 and 12,000 tons of wood&mdash;a not unsatisfactory contribution to the solution of the problem.  In addition, it has lent its mechanical transport for the haulage of turf cut by other bodies, and by this means it has conveyed to Dublin great quantities of turf.  These points are mentioned to show that the Army not only carried out its own normal functions of training and preparedness for active service, but also participated to a very large extent in all activities calling for the maximum effort of a united people.</P>
    <P>The Estimate, therefore, for £9,037,512, which is now before the Dáil, covers not only the cost of the Army proper, but also the cost of such ancillary bodies as the L.D.F., the Construction Corps, and the A.R.P. services.  The sum asked for constitutes a large percentage of our total revenue, but the House may rest assured that we are not asking for anything more than what we actually require.  Indeed, it may well happen that, if the present trickle of equipment becomes a steady flow, or if the influx of recruits exceeds what we at present anticipate, we may have to face a Supplementary Estimate.  Pending, however, that eventuality materialising, the House is asked to approve <Col N="159" /> an expenditure of £9,037,512 on the Army for the financial year 1942-43.</P>
    <P>In asking the House for the approval of the Army Estimate in the form as published, and under the conditions just briefly outlined, I desire to ask the House to approve of establishments for Regular, Reserve and Local Defence Forces which will not, during the year, exceed an aggregate of 250,000 all ranks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate has not been the subject of discussion here in the Dáil for some time now, for reasons which are known to all members of the House and to the public outside.  Personally, I am not at all satisfied with this Estimate.  The amount is far beyond the resources of the people, and I believe that in almost any Department of the service the speech which the Minister has read out here could have been prepared. There was a not unreasonable request made, which, as far as I am concerned, I heard for the first time this afternoon, to have a private session discussion of this Vote.  It was by no means an unreasonable request. The Minister has asked us to take everything that he said as absolutely the case.  I am not satisfied either with the Ministerial conduct of this Department or with the establishment that is costing £9,000,000 and is likely to cost even more.  I do not believe the country is satisfied.  The explanation we have got regarding the activities of the Ministry of Defence, outside of its ordinary normal work of defence, would be laughed at in any other Department.  Some 30,000 or 40,000 tons of fuel have been provided, probably value for £60,000 or £70,000, and that is mentioned as one of the activities of this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as we could follow what the Minister said, we were told that this Construction Corps is not a military matter at all.  I should imagine that the Minister would have nothing else to do except to deal with military matters. If there are other matters to be dealt with, let the Government take up those matters, but do not let us have <Col N="160" /> this farce of spending public money on defence when it is really a social question. The method of presentation of this Estimate for the last two years, without discussion here in this House, calls for greater confidence on the part of the Minister in the understanding and intelligence of members of the House.  It is unreasonable to expect us to lump together this sum of £9,000,000, and take merely what any Civil Service official could have written out as a description of the work of the Department for the last 12 months.  I am utterly and entirely dissatisfied with the sum of money involved, and with the value the country is getting in respect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>One would like to feel such confidence in regard to this matter that there would not be very much to say about it, but, when one reviews what has occurred throughout the world in the last three years, particularly the results that have followed where hush-hush policies were pursued, one cannot feel any great confidence in what is taking place with regard to this Department.  Like Deputy Cosgrave, I feel that the least said about the Minister's statement the better.  He referred to two matters which were outside his jurisdiction altogether, and of course the way the thing was done was lamentable.  He told the House about the contribution to the national fuel supplies.  How was that done? Hundreds of military lorries started off from Dublin somewhere about the month of November to bring turf to Dublin.  From 50 to 75 per cent. of the turf they brought to Dublin was water. As a matter of fact, one would think they were providing a water supply for Dublin instead of fuel.  I have been wondering whether that arose out of sheer cussedness on the part of the Department, simply because in the month of August last the <i>Irish Independent</i> called for the mobilisation of the Army lorries to bring fuel to Dublin.  We can speak quite frankly about this matter.  I should like the Minister to tell us when it was that the attention of the Department was directed to the mobilisation of Army transport for the purpose of bringing fuel to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I know that in August, or perhaps earlier, the <i>Irish Independent</i> repeatedly urged the mobilisation of Army transport to bring fuel to Dublin, when it was assumed the turf was reasonably dry.  The turf never was dry, because it was cut too late. The Minister talked about the Army cutting turf.  He sent members of the Army to cut turf for themselves and for others about the middle of June, at a time when the turf should be dried and on the roadside.  In July he sent hundreds of lorries to Donegal to bring turf to the city.  It was a disgrace, because nobody could or did burn that turf.  In order to bring it here they used transport equipment paid for by the State.  Petrol was supplied for the purpose of conveying wet, rotten bog to the city and it was handed out to the poor at £3 a ton. It would be highly improper on the part of this House to let that matter go without comment.  There was a public notification to the Department as to what it should do in the fuel campaign.  There was a suggestion in the <i>Irish Independent</i> with regard to the mobilisation of Army transport, a thing that was obvious and should not require any effort on the part of a newspaper or anybody else.</P>
    <P>What was this contribution to the national fuel pool?  Did the Minister handle any of the stuff?  When you caught it in your hand it was rotten and wet and it fell away between your fingers.  The Minister comes into the House with a Vote for £9,000,000 and he tells us that this was part of his contribution.  As regards logs, it was not enough for wet, rotten turf to be brought into the city, but wherever they cut the logs they left them lying out until they became so sodden that when you used the axe to split them they were so full of water that it ran down when they were split.  I think the Minister would have been very wise and well advised if he had drawn the blue pencil through those things.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say very much about other matters, though I should very much like to.  I will not elaborate certain things.  The Minister mentioned that the strength of the Army has <Col N="162" /> remained static since this time last year.  One is curious to know what is the explanation of that.  Is it not rather pathetic?  As a result of a speech delivered within the last week at a function in this city, we now know what we were not supposed to know&mdash; we know the strength of the armed forces of the State.  That is a thing that nobody was supposed to know or to refer to.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that if something befall this country in the way of an invasion the Army will be in tip-top form and will give a good account of itself.</P>
    <P>As regards training, is the Army getting that intensive, gruelling training that is so necessary in modern times?  I am merely looking for information on behalf of the public and I am discharging my obligation to those who are putting up the money.  Is the Army getting that intensive training that soldiers in modern warfare are called upon to stand up to?  The Minister referred to the flow of equipment. I do not want to say very much about that, but every woman in this country with a red flannel petticoat knows where that equipment is coming from.  You can be told that at the fireside, although very few in this country are supposed to know it.  I would like the Minister to assure the House that the equipment now going to the Army is modern and that somebody is not putting something across this country. We are taxing the people heavily in order to purchase this equipment and I would prefer doing without the material if it is not modern and fully up to the requirements that are demanded in modern warfare.</P>
    <P>There was a case heard in the Central Criminal Court recently, a case of a very unsavoury nature.  There is no use in starting out to belabour the Minister because of that.  Naturally, in an organisation like the Army, cases of that sort can happen.  I must say that the evidence given in that case showed great laxity, and if that type of offence obtains to any great extent in the Army I think the Minister should see to it that every effort will be made to stamp it out and to see <Col N="163" /> that no cases of that sort will occur in the future.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister talking about granting leave for agricultural purposes.  I would be happier still if we could be convinced that it was more than just a mere statement. I wonder is the thing being done methodically?  The Minister and Deputies know that when the emergency began young men in the country, men on the National Army Reserve, immediately joined up.  Large numbers of these young men are married and have inherited farms from their fathers or mothers, or purchased farms.  Of course, when the call of duty came in 1939 they immediately went back to the Army.  I suppose they thought that things on the farm would pan out some way, and that the best thing to do was to join up, because the farm would be of little use if the freedom of the country was lost.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that any member of the Army who would be useful in producing food from the land should at once be released.  There are in the Army, even from my constituency, <Col N="164" /> numbers of men who should be sent back to their farms and there should be no quibbling about this thing at all.  If these men are required on their farms, or on their fathers' farms, they should be allowed to go back there at once.  In many instances their fathers may be too old fully to make use of the potentialities of the farms and in those cases the sons should be immediately released.  That should be done even within the coming week, because this is the most suitable time to undertake agricultural work.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to see to the modern training and equipment of the Army.  We have often read of commissions and inquiries in other countries about what took place there during wars, what sort of equipment was passed off on the Army.  I would be sorry, when this war is over, if it were to be revealed that questionable equipment was put over on us.</P>
