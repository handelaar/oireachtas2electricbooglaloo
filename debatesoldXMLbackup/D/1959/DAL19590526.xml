    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of instances in which merchandise road licences have been extended since the 1st March, 1957; and to what extent in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-nine merchandise licences have been extended since the 1st March, 1957, in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.</P>
      <P>Full particulars of all extensions of merchandise licences are entered in the Statutory Register which is open to public inspection in my Department at all reasonable times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say from the documents he has with him whether any licences were extended to cover the entire State which previously operated only in respect of a small portion of the State? Secondly, would he oblige me by supplying me with a copy of the changes which have been made in these 29 cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first portion of the supplementary question, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  As regards the second portion, the position is that in all cases the extension to the merchandise licence is entered in the Statutory <Col N="392" /> Register and I do not think the Department of Industry and Commerce should go through the whole Statutory Register to extract the information the Deputy requires when the register is open for public inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it could not be a very difficult job for an official to make a copy of the 29 changes which have been made in merchandise licences.  Why should it be necessary for somebody to go to the Department and browse over a long register of a thousand cases to find out the 29 cases in which changes have been made, when whoever is handling the register could pick out the changes in 29 seconds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right so far as this question is concerned, but there are other statutory registers in which such particulars are entered, and if it were the practice to search the register whenever a public question is asked, it would defeat the purpose for which the Statutory Register is open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not a difficult matter for whoever is handling this register to make a record of the changes which have been made. That would be a simpler matter than for a Deputy or a citizen, who I presume has the right to inspect the register, to browse through a register of a thousand names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy, but the extractions are not made when the licence is extended.  An official of the Department would have to go through the whole 950 cases, which is about the number that exists, to extract the information the Deputy requires, and that could be repeated in other registers whenever a Parliamentary Question was asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that, where a bettor places a winning course bet, the bookmaker makes a deduction on the amount of the winning and the original bet, but pays only the levy under Section 27 of the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945, on the actual bet; and whether he intends to take any steps in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, I understand that the procedure is that 2½ per cent. of each bet is first deducted by way of levy, the actual bet becoming the quoted odds to the net amount of the stake.  Licensed bookmakers are obliged to follow this procedure as a condition of the grant by the Racing Board of permits to them to carry on business at a racecourse.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 12th November last, I am fully conscious of the grave hardship caused to the people on both sides of the Border by the spikes on cross-Border roads, including the Omeath-Newry road.

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that under existing legislation persons who are qualified to act as jurors for as long as 14 or 15 years are not called upon to act as such, whereas persons whose names are already upon jury books are frequently called to give service as jurors; and if it is intended to remedy this situation in the forthcoming Jurors Bill by permitting the addition each year to jury books of the names of persons who have qualified as jurors during that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed legislation will provide for the enlargement of any jury district where under existing law jurors are liable to be selected more frequently than is considered fair and reasonable.  Such enlargement will mean an increase in the number of jurors liable to be called from the particular district and will extend the life of the jurors book for that district. This solution will relieve the hardship referred to by the Deputy Moreover, it is preferable to the one suggested in the Question.  To allow a jurors' book to be amended by the addition of newly-qualified persons would involve serious practical difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) (for the Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to take questions numbered 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> It is yet too early in the season to estimate butter production this year or to say what quantity will be available for export.  It is true that the intake of milk at creameries during the past few months is below that of the corresponding period last year but, provided weather conditions are favourable, it is quite possible that this reduction in milk supplies will be compensated for during the remainder of the season.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is proposed to continue the butter levy but should it transpire that the full amount of the levy, which is paid into the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund, will not be required to meet the dairying industry's one-third share of export losses, any balance will be used only for the benefit of the industry. The Government will, of course, continue to meet two-thirds of the export losses during the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for Lands not aware that there is no butter in cold storage here at present? Is he further aware that, even with a good season, there is not likely to to be any surplus?  Under these circumstances, would the Minister or the Government consider stopping the levy or giving it back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has considered the matter in full.  It is premature to state that there will be no exportable surplus this year, especially in view of the rapid changes which took place in a reverse direction last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This time last year there were big supplies in cold storage. The very fact that some creameries connected with the manufacture of chocolate crumb have had to be turned over to butter production for the Dublin market proves that there is no surplus and that there is a good case for stopping the levy at this time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) the total area planted with ash and (b) the amount of ash cut during each of the five years ended 31st March, 1959, in <Col N="399" /> Counties Wexford, Wicklow, Carlow, Kildare, Leix and Kilkenny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Separate statistics for the felling of ash in the State Forests are not readily available.</P>
      <P>The total numbers of ash trees planted in the Forests in the counties mentioned by the Deputy in the five years ended 31st March, 1959, were as follows:&mdash;1954/55&mdash;111,900, 1955/ 56&mdash;105,100, 1956/57&mdash;26,800, 1957/ 58&mdash;29,900 and 1958/59&mdash;21,200.  Ash is seldom planted pure and it would, therefore, be misleading to quote equivalent area figures.</P>
      <P>In the same period felling licences issued to private landowners in the counties in question permitted the felling of 4,300 ash trees and replanting conditions imposed in the licences provided (<i>inter alia</i>) for the replanting of 8,300 ash trees.  In addition, of course, some ash would have been included in private planting carried out independently in those counties.</P>
      <P>On the general subject of ash, I would like to say that, as far as my Department is aware, the volume of ash coming on the market, both from State and private sources, is adequate to meet the demand.  If any difficulty in getting ash is experienced in any area my Department will give any assistance possible.  The planting of ash in the State Forests, while necessarily limited because of the high quality of land required for the species, is adequate to meet any requirements for ash in the future.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, authorised a higher rate of grant for a new house containing private water supply and sewerage facilities, situate in an area in which public sanitary services are not available.  For such grant it is necessary to have a certificate from the sanitary authority that no public services are available, and that there is no objection to the applicant's proposals.  The Department cannot know in advance that an applicant intends to instal such services and that public services are not available in the area and applicants eligible for the higher rate of grant do not as a rule supply the full details with their original applications.  I do not, therefore, agree that there is overlapping of procedure but I am having arrangements made to make the applicants concerned aware in advance of the necessity for submitting details of their proposals to the sanitary authority in the first instance.</P>

When you enter the courtyard&mdash;I do not think this applies to you, Sir, but only to ordinary Deputies who have to park their cars nearer the gate&mdash;if it is a wet day you have to wade up to the House through pools of water and if it is a wet night, well, may God help you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mention this because I think when it is mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary it will be attended to.  My information is that the reason was that there were two contractors brought in to do the courtyard and evidently it was a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth, or of putting too much water in it.  In any case, I speak not only for myself but for practically all Deputies when I say that I think this matter should be attended to as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>When finishing on Thursday I was speaking about the Kilbarryo Bog in Waterford and about the estimates for arterial drainage and, as I mentioned, they are colossal.  I think they are colossal because we do not get any of them in the eastern counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But we do need them and that is what I want to show. Near the city where I was reared there was an enormous bog.  It was always going to be drained, or something done about it, but nothing ever seems to have been done about it.  When you speak in terms of hundreds of thousands of pounds for something in County Waterford it is said that it is far and away too much money altogether.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not far too much money.  It is a small sum of money in comparison with the Estimates where they run into millions in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to meet me at some future date&mdash;I shall write to him and he can arrange it through his officials&mdash;to tell us what the local authorities in Waterford should do to draw his Department's attention to this matter and to see if we could have an arterial drainage scheme to drain these bogs and deepen the Saint John's River which flows into the Suir.</P>
      <P>The other matter I mentioned was the foreshore at Tramore.  This should be attended to immediately.  I hope that the same thing will not happen here as happened in Rosslare.  For years the Wexford Deputies were complaining, but nothing was done until the sea burst into the town.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to pay particular attention to these two matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of fishery harbours has been a mystery to me.  Who decides where the money is to be spent?  Is the money spent in places where it is necessary to give work and is the fact that the pier is used for fishing taken into account at all?  I am inclined to think that it is not.  If it were, the provision for Dunmore East would be the biggest of all.  Most fish are caught there but the provision for Dunmore East is not anything like the biggest. There is a magnificent pier there but it <Col N="406" /> is always very difficult to get anything done.  Yet I have seen great installations erected in places where there are no fish to be caught at all.  There is much in what the previous Parliamentary Secretary said, that fishes do not vote.</P>
    <P>I would again draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to Dunmore East.  Some people say it just happens that the fish run down there. I do not believe that.  I believe the reason the fishing is good there is that a few years ago a number of Dunmore East men bought boats of their own and started fishing there again.  I know this has nothing to do with the present Vote, but it shows the trend.  Out of 80 boats allocated by the State, we got two.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £120,000 under sub-head J.2 in respect of arterial drainage construction works.  A sum of £12,000 is included for the Bunratty-Rineanna embankment scheme, which work is proceeding.  But there are banks on the rivers in the East of Ireland too. I am a little bit innocent about this.  I want to know why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is a very large increase here for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant, machinery and stores.  That is all to the good.  But again I must say that the sum, considered very large at the time, for the drainage of Kilbarryo was estimated <Col N="407" /> before such plant and machinery and techniques were common here.  I am sure there would be a much reduced estimate for the work to-day.</P>
      <P>When speaking to a Vote I always make it a point to give credit where I think credit should be given.  Whoever is in charge of the restoration, or should I say preservation, of our ancient monuments is to be complimented. He must be dedicated to his work.  I have seen a good deal of it around the country; magnificent work is being done by the officials and engineers dealing with this.  I should like to pay tribute to them.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I do not think has been mentioned heretofore&mdash; the provision of furniture, fittings and so on.  We need not be ashamed of the manner in which the person responsible is carrying out this work.  The furniture seems to have been bought with discretion. It is the right kind of furniture and is placed in various Government buildings with great taste.</P>
      <P>It is good that the Vote for schools has been increased.  There is always a great demand for schools.  I do not suppose this Department has anything to do with the question of where schools are built.  Schools are being built in places where there are no pupils, and in places where there is overcrowding of pupils the schools are on the long list.  I had a question down today to know how much was given to Waterford city in unemployment grants by the Department of Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary replied that in 1938 the amount was £19,000 and in 1958 it was £8,000.</P>

      <P>I was waiting for that crack.  Sometimes we could do with some of it here.  I have often been here when conditions have been such that although they might have been good enough for Deputies, if they were in a factory or office they would be condemned by the factory inspector.  We have legislated to ensure that proper accommodation is provided in offices and factories and that they are properly ventilated and heated.  If a factory inspector were brought to Leinster House he would not pass the conditions; he would ask that the House be adjourned.  I do not know who would be prosecuted or against whom he would proceed.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make an enquiry into the matter.  I have been told that the system of heating here is obsolete.  I may be wrong, but I should like to have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>When the fishing season is at its height, an enormous number of trawlers come into the port of Waterford and there is serious overcrowding. Dunmore is a big port but it is often crowded out.  Complaints have been made about the river in Duncannon, that they cannot get it properly dredged.  That also applies to Passage and Cheekpoint.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>I shall send the Parliamentary Secretary a letter and ask him to meet me and to give me some guidance as to how a local authority in the East can make representations to himself and his officers so that an arterial drainage plant can be provided for Kilbarryo in Waterford and a grant given for work on the foreshore in Tramore so as to ensure that what remains of it will not be carried away.</P>

      <P>I would ruin my speech if I were to follow Deputy Lynch at this stage.  I shall refer to his speech later.  We deal here with Votes 8 and 9.  I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for having supplied me with a copy of his speech.  I did not anticipate that the Vote would be taken last Thursday and, although I <Col N="409" /> was in town, I was not in the House. Vote 8 deals with offices and staff. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to say that on the occasion of last year's Estimate I commenced on a rather sad note by referring to the deaths of the then Parliamentary Secretary and of the retired chairman of the Board of Works.  To-day I have also to sound a sad note by referring to the death of Commissioner Fagan.  He was a long time in the Office of Public Works and was a good Commissioner and later became chairman.  He retired under the age limit.  Everybody in this House and in the Office of Public Works will join with me in praying that the Lord may have mercy on his soul.</P>
      <P>The late Mr. Diarmuid O'Hegarty, the late Mr. Fagan and Mr. Morris, now retired, were in the Office of Public Works when I was there for over six years.  They were good Commissioners. They worked well.  They had a very thankless job.  They worked sincerely.  It is to be regretted that two of them have passed away.  May we hope that Mr. Morris, who is retired, will have many long years of well-earned rest after his hard work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer my congratulations to the present Chairman.  I have not the slightest doubt of his ability to fill the office.  I may have been misunderstood last year when I referred to promotion from the office.  There was nothing personal against the present Chairman, an assurance I am sure he accepts.  We never met.  I wish him very well and many happy years there. I would just say to him that he will be a good man if he fills the gap as well and follows in the footsteps of his two predecessors, Diarmuid O'Hegarty and Mr. Fagan.  I wish the present Chairman well and assure him that anything I said last year was in no way personal.  What I said last year referred to promotion from the office. I went to the Office of Public Works in 1948.  It is one of the most responsible offices.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for being in charge of such an office, not because he is a Galway man, as Deputy Lynch said, or anything like that.  I felt that promotion should be from the office <Col N="410" /> every time.  Therefore, I am sure the present Chairman will not take it that there was anything personal in my view at that time.  I hope my words last year were helpful.</P>
    <P>I congratulate most sincerely the new Commissioners, Mr. Cullinane and Mr. Farrell.  I knew them for years.  I am delighted at their appointments. For many years they worked in the office.  It is a good thing that the promotion is from the office.  It is good from the point of view of junior officers that promotion is to continue to be from the office.  I assure the Chairman, although there is no need for me to do so, that the two Commissioners are persons of wide experience, who have been in charge of divisions for many years.  I hope the Chairman and the Commissioners will live and work as happily together as those who worked with me for six years.  I have no doubt they will give the same loyal service to the present Parliamentary Secretary as their predecessors gave to me.  Let me leave that point.</P>
    <P>Did I ever think I would hear a Deputy say in this House that too much money had been spent on arterial drainage?  I can forgive Deputy Lynch because he was not in this House in 1943 and neither was he here in 1944.  I do not know what the conditions are in the area which Deputy Lynch represents but I do know that if Deputy Lynch lived in the west of Ireland, in Donegal or in Kerry in areas which are swamped out, I am quite sure he would not make the statement he has made.</P>
    <P>When I first came into this House in 1943, one of the things which was foremost in my mind and in the mind of the Party of which I am a representative was arterial drainage.  The Government of the day then was the same as today, Fianna Fáil.  I was a representative of a group which were pressed that year to place arterial drainage above anything else.  If the records are examined, it will be discovered that I was the first in this House to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, then Parliamentary Secretary, for bringing in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1944.</P>
    <P>I claimed that it was the best Act <Col N="411" /> that ever came before this House, but I never thought&mdash;I may as well be honest about it&mdash;it would ever do the work it is doing today.  I have personal experience of it.  I can see it from my own door.  I saw it in the Brosna in Leix-Offaly; I saw it in the Glyde and Dee in Louth and Monaghan; I saw it in the Feale catchment area in Kerry; and I see it at my own door in the Corrib catchment area.</P>

      <P>It is the Deputy's job to look after that.  He is on the Government side and he should pull the guts out of the Parliamentary Secretary as they were pulled out of me when I was in that position.  I should like to make my own speech in my own way.  Did I ever think that a Deputy would stand up in this House and actually say it is a waste of money and that this money should not be spent?  In the Dáil in 1943 and in 1944, when the Act was passed, the unanimous view of Deputies was that there was a crying need for it.  Now that it is in operation, may I pay a tribute to the Office of Public Works, their engineering staffs and the workers on all those schemes?  It is a credit to them.  It is something outstanding in this country of ours and something our people never expected would be done.</P>
      <P>While it may be all right to play politics in this House&mdash;unfortunately I do not play them myself but the Deputies on the opposite side do&mdash;may I say that, no matter what Government comes or goes, the arterial drainage scheme is the greatest scheme in operation at the present time?  It was the greatest Act passed through this House and the manner in which it is being operated by the Office of Public Works is a credit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people hear about the Corrib drainage scheme, the Moy or any other scheme, they just think it is the <Col N="412" /> main river in that scheme which is being done but the House knows it is a catchment area.  Very often, when the surveys are being carried out, you cannot expect an engineer, who probably has never been in the area before, to see everything.  Goodness knows, he sees 99 per cent. of the things.  I give him that much credit, but it is only when a scheme is in operation that it can be seen that a certain part has been neglected which should probably be in on that scheme.</P>
    <P>It is very hard then for the Office of Public Works, when they have estimated a certain amount of money for a scheme, to put an addition to that scheme, because it will cost money.  Naturally enough, if it goes much above the Estimate, they will be blamed in this House and blamed, perhaps, by the very Deputies who asked them to do the work.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that in cases where certain small additions were overlooked, they should be put in the scheme and that they should get special consideration.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to approach the Office of Public Works in connection with some of those cases.  There were some cases where I would not approach the Board of Works because it was small thanks to the people concerned to carry out the little job they wanted carried out because it was possible for them to do it, but there are other cases where it is not possible for the tenants concerned to carry out a job.  I would ask the Commissioners and the Parliamentary Secretary to give special consideration to those cases where the tenants themselves cannot possibly do the work, because, once it is passed over, it can never be done again.</P>
    <P>A statement by the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago worried me very much.  He said the Suck arterial drainage scheme cannot, and will not, be carried out until the Shannon has been done&mdash;I trust he will correct me if I am misquoting him.  I would ask him to go over the files and think of the interest his predecessor, the late Deputy Beegan, took in that scheme, think of my interest in it and realise <Col N="413" /> that when he says it cannot be done or considered until the Shannon has been done, it is just putting us off until Doomsday.  I believe the Shannon will not be done in our time. There are people who say that if you drain more water into the Shannon from the Suck, it will cause more flooding in the Shannon.  The same amount of water flows in there all the time.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to put that question to his engineering staff&mdash;how much extra water did the Brosna, when it was drained, drain into the Shannon? Absolutely none.  When the Clare-Corrib is finished, not one extra gallon of water will it drain into the sea.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the case of the Suck and not to be misled by the argument that it will increase flooding on the Shannon.  It will not increase it one bit, once the drainage is done and the overflow comes in.  As a matter of fact, less water comes along afterwards. I am delighted that the Maine scheme has started.</P>

      <P>Galway people are accused of being selfish and if Galway has the Corrib drainage scheme, they are as much entitled to it in the west of Ireland&mdash;Galway, Roscommon and Mayo all come into it&mdash;as any county or province.  They are even better entitled to it because, as has been proved, no river in Ireland was doing more flooding than the Corrib.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary, it did not matter whether I came from Galway or Donegal, I felt as I do now&mdash; and I do not apologise to any Deputy for it&mdash;that the problems of Connacht and county Galway were entitled to consideration in one scheme at least before Kerry was entitled to two.  We had a scheme which was third in order. Our machinery went down there and the only promise we could make Kerry &mdash;and it has been faithfully carried out&mdash;was that by the time the Feale was finished, the machinery would be transferred to the Maine.  The Feale is about finished now and a great job has been done, but I am certain there <Col N="414" /> is not much thanks for it.  If I know them, it is more they will want.  The machinery has been transferred and they are getting their second scheme in Kerry.  I do not begrudge it to them; if I were there, I would give it to them; it was my promise and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary that it has been carried out.</P>
      <P>Although Deputy T. Lynch condemned arterial drainage and said too much money was being spent on it, he wanted to start a scheme in his own area.  He said he would see the Parliamentary Secretary about it and I have no doubt that he will.  The Deputy must realise that arterial drainage is not a patchwork business, as it was for too long a time.  As it is known now under the Act, it is a comprehensive scheme that has to be maintained by a contribution from the ratepayers in the counties where the scheme is carried out.  To my mind, that is right&mdash;they should not want to have it every way for nothing&mdash;but while it is costing an enormous amount of money, it is very necessary and I wish twice as much money could be spent until such time as the job was finished.</P>
      <P>Something should be done to ensure that the people who benefit at the expense of the taxpayers, those who own the land that is drained, will do the minor schemes required.  Otherwise, quite a lot of money is wasted. Many people think that once the Maine river is drained, it will make good land of the area that was flooded for years and years.  That is not the case.  I hate compulsion, but I think the people should be compelled to open the minor drains and fertilise that land that has cost the general taxpayers so much, so that it may be put into production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to put this point to the Government. I agree that nine out of the ten people concerned appreciate what is done and will look after the land that has been drained, but quite a few will be found here and there who will not do so.  Some of them seem to think that a Government can, of course, drop money upon them like manna.  That is not the position.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="415" /> that some scheme should be devised to compel these people whose lands have been drained to make the lands productive.  I know from personal experience that land which has been subject to flooding for years on end, makes, when reclaimed, the best land that can be got.</P>
    <P>I believe the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials are doing the very best they can.  It is true that the Office of Public Works is expected to take the blame for the shortcomings of other Departments.  To quote the late Chairman of the Office of Public Works, Mr. Diarmuid O'Hegarty, when I asked him on one occasion why we were blamed for everything: &ldquo;Apparently in our Office we are the skivvies for every other Department.&rdquo; Those were his words.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials on the progress made in relation to school buildings.  I have a deep interest in school buildings but I never had much interest in national monuments.  They were referred to by Deputy Lynch. Like arterial drainage, school building is not going quickly enough in my opinion.  The Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening statement that it is proposed this year to spend £1,600,000 on schools.  I hope that money will be spent.  I do not believe that Deputy Lynch's statement that schools are being built in areas in which there are no children to fill them is correct. Certainly that was never my experience. Knowing the Office of Public Works, I know that not one halfpenny is spent without a thorough investigation into every aspect of the situation. I do not know how Deputy Lynch could make a statement like that.  We all know the school manager comes into the picture.  Sometimes he has a site.  Sometimes he has not a site. Sometimes the site is not suitable.  In addition to that, it is not always easy to suit the manager.  But no schools are built anywhere except where urgent necessity demands they should be built.  I have no hesitation, knowing the Office as I did for six years, in contradicting Deputy Lynch's statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to keep up the good work so far as arterial drainage is concerned. I ask him to have another look at the Suck scheme.  I appeal to him not to be led astray by what some people may say as to worsening the Shannon flooding.  The Brosna drainage did not affect the Shannon. Neither will the Suck drainage.  Even though the scheme will be to the benefit of the west of Ireland, that should not prevent him having a look at it.  Let him not think that because he is from the west of Ireland some people may be tempted to complain that everything he does is for the west. Everyone knows that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the Moy scheme.  That is a scheme in which I have a deep interest.  What do we find now? Certain fishery interests are complaining. In my opinion these interests should have been abolished long ago. Lady This and Lord That are complaining that the fisheries will be injured.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at the file and read all the clap-trap sent up to me when the Corrib scheme was about to commence.  I would ask him to read all about the scenery and the aesthetic pleasure of looking at the salmon over the bridge in Galway.  It was said all that would be ruined.  It has been proved by the schemes that have been done that the fisheries were never better than they are now. Instead of looking at the fish over the bridge in Galway, the Parliamentary Secretary should look at the thousands of acres of land drained by that scheme &mdash;thousands of acres in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  That land is much more valuable than are tourists looking at fish, or even catching them.  The same can be said about the Brosna, the Glyde and the Dee.  The same will be said about the Moy some day.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;I know the appeal is really not necessary&mdash;not to let himself be led astray with the trash some people try to put across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that some statistics about the number of national schools were given.  The Parliamentary Secretary said there are about 5,000 of them, and he also said that since the foundation of the State about a quarter of the number have been replaced by new schools, and that in the past year, something like 90 were replaced and 60 reconstructed.  It was gratifying to learn that in the course of the next 15 or 20 years, the back-log of old obsolete schools will have been dealt with and that in the normal course of events, the replacements will be something <Col N="418" /> in the region of 50 new schools per year.</P>
      <P>I should like to advise the Parliamentary Secretary to direct the attention of his architects and engineers to developments with regard to school buildings in other countries.  To my mind, many of the new schools that have been erected in this country have been based on a streotyped plan&mdash;two-teacher, three-teacher of four-teacher schools in all parts of the country&mdash; and they all look the same.  They are variations on one theme.  Plans are available of schools which have been erected on the Continent and in Britain and Scotland since the end of the war, where more care has been given to the provision of better lighting and more colourful surroundings for the children. Greater use has been made of glass, for example, and new colour schemes have been introduced.  All those things are conducive to better conditions for the children and the teachers.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would get his expert advisers to look into this matter and study the plans of continental and other schools which I have mentioned, they might be able to break away from those stereotyped plans as I think we should break away from them.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like to deal with is that we often hear the Board of Works being criticised for passing shoddy and faulty work in connection with new national schools.  That allegation, in my opinion, has been justified. I have seen schools which were erected eight, nine, 10 years ago, or less, the walls of which are showing cracks and in which the rate of deterioration has been hard to justify.  I am pleased to state that in the past five or six years there has been a marked improvement in the quality of the work done under the auspices of the Board of Works. The supervision seems to have been better, anyway, and the rate of deterioration has been slowed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal stringently with those contractors who take two, three or four years to complete a school.  Too much of that has been allowed.  For example, in my own constituency, I know of a two-teacher school in Tír na nEascrach on which work was <Col N="419" /> started four years ago.  In fact, I addressed a question to the Parliamentary Secretary about that matter some time ago.  The sum involved is £4,000 and a building like that should not take four years.  The school has been lying idle there for over a year.  When a school is not occupied and no use is being made of it, goes to the bad and this building is going to the bad.  I know that the manager in this instance has been seriously perturbed by the dilatory attitude adopted by the Board of Works.  In fact, it was brought to my notice that the Board gave sanction to a contractor who baled out about three years ago.  At that time, he had been employed not as a contractor but as a sub-contractor.  If a contractor does not complete a job in the normal period allowed for completion, the job should be taken away from him and given to somebody else to complete. People have complained to me that the school is standing there idle and the school which the children are attending is in a bad state of repair.  The manager, for good reasons, has not been spending any money while the new school is idle.  That, of course, is a scandalous state of affairs and should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Donnellan that great work has been done under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if possible, to circulate some kind of statement to Deputies which would let them know the progress which has been made over the year on the different schemes. For example, on the Corrib drainage scheme, how much money has been spent?  When is it expected that the scheme will be completed?  What is the programme for the following year? What new drainage catchment areas are to be tackled?  I know a survey was carried out some time ago on the Killimor catchment in my constituency. People there have asked me when is it likely that plans will be exhibited and work will commence.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would circulate some information to us which would enable us to give that information to our constituents, it would be very helpful.  As I say, the priority list should be public, and the information <Col N="420" /> I mention should be readily available to Deputies and to the public.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to mention in connection with the Corrib drainage scheme.  In the Gurteen area of my constituency, farmers have complained to me about the spoil that has been deposited on the river banks.  I have seen it, and it is not a very sightly thing.  There are big embankments of spoil and, if possible, the Board of Works should try to lower these high embankments of gravel and silt deposited there when excavators and bulldozers were at work.  I know that a lot of good land has been thrown out of production by these embankments, and in many cases, they are dangerously steep and cattle have been drowned.  It might be possible to do something about this problem when the work is in progress.  When the work has stopped, it is difficult to have the machinery brought back to an area to carry out levelling work that should have been done when the scheme was in progress in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan introduced a few novel notes in his contribution and one of them struck me as being very strange.  He contended that no matter what amount of water was drained into the Shannon, the net result was the same.  I wonder can that contention be substantiated in fact?  We know that the Rydell Report advocated that work should be discontinued on the drainage of the Shannon tributaries until a full and comprehensive scheme was devised for the drainage of the Shannon itself.  Apparently Deputy Donnellan does not agree with the Rydell report.  He says that the drainage of the Brosna did not in any way affect the overall position as regards the Shannon, and did not cause any consequential flooding in the Shannon other than what already existed.  That is a novel idea and it struck me that there might be some substance in it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that he would give whatever information as might appear from the discussion of Deputies to be necessary.  That is a very helpful attitude to adopt and I think it is one that will be readily appreciated in this House.  His Department <Col N="421" /> deals with a lot of matters and, from experience, I know he has been very helpful to Deputies who went to him seeking information about various matters.  He and his Department are to be congratulated on the vast amount of work they have carried out in the past year, and he is also to be congratulated, at a time like this when money is scarce, on securing an increased amount for such necessary work as arterial drainage and the provision of new national schools.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Carty referred to the idea put forward by Deputy Donnellan that even though the tributaries of the Shannon were drained, it would not mean that one extra gallon of water would put into the main river.  That is a rather novel idea and I was rather surprised to hear it being put forward.  As Deputy Carty says, if there is anything in it, then it is worth investigating, but I think that Deputy Donnellan's wish for haste in draining the Suck, in addition to the Brosna, would cause floods in Kerry, especially in North Kerry.  In doing that, eventually the work done on the Feale would be destroyed and, consequently, I think it is a mistake to drain tributaries of a main river, and especially any tributary of the Shannon.  I do not know how drainage of the Brosna has affected Shannon flooding, but certainly I do not think it would be advisable to drain any further tributaries.</P>
      <P>I was not present at the time he spoke, but I understand that Deputy T. Lynch said that too much money was spent on arterial drainage.  I believe that three rivers join together to flow into Waterford harbour, and perhaps Deputy T. Lynch is afraid that if drainage is carried out there, to any great extent, it would flood the city.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the concise statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with this Vote.  Deputy Donnellan stated that people were not grateful for the work done in connection with arterial drainage, and he made particular reference to the people in North Kerry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnellan knows the kind of work the Board of Works have to carry out in connection with the building of schools and with the drainage of rivers.  They are bound to get a certain amount of blame.  It is the same with other Departments but other Departments depend on the Board of Works for carrying out various schemes.  In connection with arterial drainage, I should like to say on behalf of the people of South and North Kerry, because it affects both constituencies, that they are happy that the drainage of the Maine is now about to commence.  Machinery has already arrived there.  We have been waiting for that for a long time and, were it not for the fact that three Parliamentary Secretaries came from the West, the Maine would be drained by now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>We were always led to believe that the Maine came first on the list, but it was always put back. However, when at last a good thing comes, we are quite satisfied and will blame nobody now, but, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, we have one grievance in connection with the plans put forward for the drainage of the Maine.  One very important tributary, the Brown Flesk, has been omitted. He kindly received a deputation in connection with the matter and he promised that the whole question would be examined.  The Brown Flesk is a tributary very near the source of the Maine and, as the drainage up to that point will take perhaps two or three years to carry out, we hope that within those years in which the Parliamentary Secretary will be in charge of the Board of Works, he will make up his mind to drain that tributary.</P>
      <P>It is a rather difficult river to drain and I do not know what can be done about it.  However, having regard to the efficiency of the Board of Works engineers, I am sure they will devise a suitable scheme so as to avoid dissatisfaction among the people there. Some of the most fertile land in Kerry is along the banks of the Brown Flesk as it is along the banks of the Maine, the principal river.  I hope a scheme will be devised to drain that tributary in connection with the whole catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again in connection with the Maine, although I suppose it would not be the duty of the Board of Works, there are some good salmon fishing pools and the people there make their living through mussels.  There are mussel beds at Cromane very near the mouth of the Maine and the people are afraid that the drainage will interfere with the mussel beds and destroy their one and only industry.  I trust the Board of Works, in conjunction with the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, will devise a scheme which will ensure that <Col N="424" /> neither the salmon, other fishing nor the mussel beds will suffer any loss.</P>
    <P>Good work has been done, especially since the end of the war in the erection of new schools and in the improvement and extension of old schools that would bear reconstruction.  Deputy Carty referred to the type of plans for schools.  I believe that, if anything, some of the schools erected are too elaborate.  They are a credit to the Board of Works, to those who drew up the plans and to the contractors.  However, in 40 or 50 years' time they may be obsolete so it might be better to build them in a less elaborate way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would. Rural electrification has been extended to most areas and when new schools are being built or old schools being reconstructed they should be wired for the installation of electricity.  I am not sure whether that would be in the plans or specifications but it is necessary not only for the lighting of schools where various bodies meet occasionally for cultural purposes, Irish classes and so on, but also for the heating of schools in case turf cannot be procured.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much that could be said in criticism of the work of the Board of Works.  There is provision in relation to coast erosion which applies principally to Rosslare. If the Board of Works deal with coast erosion I should like to remind them of a lovely village in Kerry, Waterville, known as the Brighton of the West.  It is a great tourist centre for fishing, and so on, but in about 20 years' time it will be submerged by the sea.  Recently we got the county council engineers to make an estimate of the cost and if the Board of Works are in any way responsible I hope it will be brought to their notice and that they will help us to prevent the destruction of this village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I jokingly said at the outset that it was unfortunate for us in certain areas that we had three Galway men in succession in charge of the Board of Works, I can say that <Col N="425" /> any time we have approached any of them or any of the officials of the Board of Works we have always been received with the greatest courtesy.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary, his engineers and other officials for the good work they are doing.  We may criticise them but, realising they have a difficult task, we are grateful for any work they can do for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works deserves great credit for the way they have attended to the problem of building national schools.  I do not intend to go back ten years; I shall go back much further.  Since this State was founded national schools were in a deplorable condition and great credit is due to the Board of Works for what they have done in every part of the Twenty-Six Counties in providing good schools.  There is, however, one point which may be worthy of attention.  The schools in the rural areas have a tendency to look a bit too much like one another. If the general outline could be varied it would relieve the monotony. Although Deputy Carty complained of faulty work in relation to schools that had been sanctioned by the Board of Works, that is not my experience.  In fact, the main comment I hear in my part of the country is that the Board of Works do too solid and massive a job and the general impression seems to be that they are building schools to last too long.  That is a good fault, and the work I have seen done in this direction is praiseworthy.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider wiring for electric light, at a small cost, at least the new schools, that is, if rural electrification has been brought into the area?  It is in most areas now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Another matter which I think would come within the ambit of the Office of Public Works is heating during school <Col N="426" /> hours.  Because of the very bad weather last year, turf was not available in many cases.  I know of a few schools where a fire could not be provided and the schools were miserably cold.  I heard one father of school-going children say he would not like to see his live stock in a room as cold as the schoolroom his children were attending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Parliamentary Secretary might have some responsibility in that connection.  I shall come to a matter which concerns my own constituency, the drainage of the Moy.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us when the arterial drainage of the Moy will commence and at what speed it will be proceeded with?  There is a huge area of land damaged by the river Moy and its tributaries and the unfortunate thing is that the farmers whose land is flooded are mostly small farmers&mdash;farmers the Land Commission have considered settled, that is, as far as the Land Commission are concerned.  It is a pretty bad state of affairs when a farmer who might be trying to eke out a living on 15, 20 or 30 acres finds that ten acres or in some cases over half the holding are under water for six months of the year, due to flooding.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary is being bombarded by fishing interests.  I do not want to see any set-back in the fishing industry.  From my experience, arterial drainage does not damage or interfere with salmon fishing.  It may upset it for the short time arterial drainage work is going on.  The muddy water may possibly divert salmon for the time being.  Even if arterial drainage killed or completely denuded the river that has been cleaned of salmon, it is pretty simple to restock the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fisheries Section of the Department of Lands, as well as private organisations, are doing excellent work in restocking fish of many kinds in <Col N="427" /> rivers and lakes.  I say this to allay the fears of those who have fishing interests very much at heart.  There is no danger involved.  There may be a temporary dislocation while the work is being done.  If the matter is pressed hard enough, the Parliamentary Secretary will have to choose between two sections of the people&mdash;(1) the tourists who comes here for a week or ten days or a fortnight at the outside or (2) the small farmers whose very means of livelihood are being destroyed year after year and on whom the Government rely for taxation to run this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary will have to choose between these two sections.  I hope his choice will lie in the right direction.  It would be desperate if, after waiting so long for arterial drainage, our hopes were dashed just at the moment we were about to get it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary comes from the West of Ireland.  I feel sure he has too good a grasp of the situation to be deflected easily by other interests. I do not blame the fisheries people for making their case.  It is only fair that if justice is to be got in any court in the world a person should have the right to make his case.  I speak on behalf of the farmers whom we have with us all the time.  The flooding of small holdings has been responsible for the fact that many of them have been closed up and families have left.</P>
    <P>It is essential to speed up the drainage of the Moy and other places, too.  A huge area is involved extending over Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon.  It is the best way in which money can be spent.  Any Deputy who argues that too much money is being spent on arterial drainage clearly shows that he knows nothing whatever about the problems of many farmers in various parts of the country.  If a Deputy made such a statement he probably thought that what he was saying was true but in my view it shows a deplorable lack of knowledge of conditions in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In their efforts to cope with arterial drainage, the Office of Public Works have one natural obstacle against them, <Col N="428" /> namely the shape of our country.  Ireland has very often been likened in physical contour to a saucer or a plate. There is a rim of mountains which encloses a plain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be in a bad way if we had not the mountains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disadvantage to the farmers.  It has created the problem which has made arterial drainage necessary.  The work on this problem has clearly demonstrated that the engineers in the Office of Public Works deserve great credit.  I remember when the famous Tennessee Valley scheme was under way in the United States.  Everybody thought that it would take a vast country with vast resources such as the United States to tackle such a problem and that the Irish could not attempt anything like it.  From what I have seen of arterial drainage schemes in this country, I am convinced that we have excellent engineers who know their business to a nicety and are not afraid to tackle big problems.  The jobs one sees on the road from Tuam to Galway and also the one at Tullamore are Herculean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has the Parliamentary Secretary dropped the river Suck?  This matter has been raised by several Deputies.  The argument that it would cause excessive flooding on the Shannon does not carry sufficient weight. Deputy Donnellan pointed out that the drainage of the Suck would not add a single drop to the effect of rainfall in the Suck area.  The Parliamentary Secretary may argue that it will release water more quickly into the Shannon but I do not think it will.  In the first place, if the Parliamentary Secretary really thinks that that is so, then it means that the Brosna has acted and behaved differently since it was cleaned.  Secondly, it means that the farmers who were flooded all along by the Suck&mdash;they are a huge number&mdash;must put up with the flooding simply because their land is needed as a sponge or blanket to soak up and release gradually the rainfall in slow quantities so as not to flood the Shannon.  I do not think that that would happen.  It will not <Col N="429" /> interfere with or alter the effect of the rainfall to any appreciable extent. The only argument is that it will allow the rain to drain off more quickly than is now the case.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider his pretty violent decision not to have anything to do with it.</P>
    <P>On the 22nd April last I asked the Minister for Finance,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... if he is aware of the inequity of the present system of placing the responsibility for, and cost of maintenance of arterial drainage on ratepayers; and if he will introduce amending legislation to make maintenance a national charge on the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The full cost of the construction of drainage works is borne on State funds and I do not agree that there is any inequity in requiring that the cost of maintenance of the completed works should be a local charge.  It is not proposed to introduce amending legislation in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a result of a supplementary question by me, the Parliamentary Secretary seemed to think I meant something different from the question I put to him in the original Parliamentary Question.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary could really mistake what I meant.  I avail of this occasion to explain the point which I do not seem to have been able to convey to him at Question Time on the 22nd April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain how the Parliamentary Secretary misunderstood me.  At present, the cost of maintenance of arterial drainage is borne by the ratepayers.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to visualise a particular county or counties in which an arterial drainage scheme is carried out.  In those counties which have arterial drainage schemes the matter can be a very vexed question. It can happen that in certain parts of the area the benefits are small.  There is the further point that because there is only a small number of landholders <Col N="430" /> in an area, the arterial drainage will not be carried out for perhaps 20, 30 or 40 years.  The point I raised was that it is unfair and inequitable that portion of the ratepayers in a county who do not benefit from arterial drainage should contribute to the cost of the scheme in another part of the county.  I was asking the Parliamentary Secretary would he consider making maintenance a national charge until all arterial drainage was done.  I hope I have made myself clear on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I want to state clearly that I agree that there is nothing inequitable in putting a charge on those who benefit from arterial drainage when all arterial drainage is done.  Let us take any particular case.  Let us take the case of the Corrib, the Feale in Kerry, or the Brosna which drains three counties.  The ratepayers in many parts of those counties do not benefit by these schemes and they have arterial drainage problems of their own which will not be tackled for many years.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary might consider the point I have raised, that it is unfair to ask the ratepayers to contribute until all arterial drainage or until the arterial drainage in a particular county, is done.  I think that that is not an unfair demand to make.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is to give us, when he is replying, all possible data on the Moy.  The people in my part of the country are very anxious that this work should be commenced as soon as possible.  I know that it cannot be tackled overnight and that it will not be done merely by waving a magic wand.  I know that it will take six or seven years to complete, or perhaps longer.  The Board of Works will be doing a good job if the work can be done in that time.  I am most anxious that the Parliamentary Secretary should give us all the data at his disposal when he is replying as I am very anxious to know what the position is.</P>

Naturally, I would prefer the discussion to be on a more national level but due to human nature it becomes more or less parochial. I think there is one deciding factor as to where the attention of the Board of Works is centred at the moment.

First of all, I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the position obtaining on Ireland's premier monument, the Rock of Cashel.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful to think that after 35 years of native Government we have not decided, and could not decide on what flag should be flown on that ancient monument.  It is true that a few years ago, after many applications, the late Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Beegan, directed that a flag staff should be erected so that at least the National flag could be flown, but what is the secret influence obtaining in the Board of Works which prevents an open declaration as to what flag should be flown there and what times? When the remains of the late Commandant General Seán Myles were passing through the district it was disgraceful that a flag was not flown on the monument at half-mast and when our beloved Archbishop, Most Reverend Dr. Kinane, died, the same position obtained.  All this falls back on the Deputies, especially those who live near this monument, like myself.  I think we should have the courage of our convictions to put up the flag that the people demand.  Many of our comrades died to make sure it would fly on that monument.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying will give a definite assurance to the people that their flag will be flown there in future and offer no apologies to anybody living or dead.</P>

While the Board of Works certainly carried out a beautiful job of work on the monument&mdash;while I will give them credit for everything good they did, I still take the opportunity of criticising them for the things that should be done&mdash;a job which anybody could be proud of, for <Col N="433" /> the sake of a few extra pounds the approach to the monument was left untouched and in a state which would remind one of an approach to a jungle in West Africa.  I hope that my remarks will not fall on deaf ears now.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the schools.  I am sorry to think that in many of our schools the hygiene position is of a very primitive nature.</P>

      <P>If I approach the Department of Education they say it is a matter for the Board of Works. However, I shall bow to the ruling of the Chair.  From my experience in other countries, I believe that one of the very important matters to which our Board of Works should devote attention when erecting schools, especially new schools, is that there are playing fields attached.  We must entice young people to go to school.  We all liked some place to play when we were boys.  Even if we are now in the winter of our lives, I hope we shall always foster the idea that our young people deserve a suitable ground in which to play their games.  Naturally I would advocate our national games.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word about arterial drainage.  In 1946, long before I had the privilege of being a member of this House, I felt that the Arterial Drainage Act was one of the finest the Fianna Fáil Government had the courage and foresight to put through. But I am disappointed at the snail's pace methods with which the Act is being implemented.  I believe that with an effort we could reach much more speedily the position visualised in the Act.  As Deputy Donnellan, Deputy Carty and other Deputies have said, <Col N="434" /> this Act is one of the greatest factors in the progress of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed in the South that the speed with which the Act is being implemented is not what we should like it to be.  The river Suir floods from Thurles down through Holycross, Cashel, Cahir and the prosperous industrial village of Ardfinnan. To think that that is happening without any real attempt being made to remedy it is beyond comprehension. The patience of the farmers is nearly exhausted.  Their land, the finest land in the world, is being flooded and immense damage done.</P>
    <P>It is 12 years ago since I had the honour of waiting on my friend, Deputy Donnellan.  I shall not say he promised to do it in a week or a year, but his assurances were helpful and we were optimistic as to the results. But 12 years of flooding have since occurred and no real remedy has been provided.  It is true that the last deputation to the Minister were assured that a survey of the river would take place in 1960.  It is not a day too soon.  Over 30 years ago we had what could be termed a preliminary survey of the river.  But the river has carried on in its devastating manner year after year, flooding the village of Ardfinnan, the town of Clonmel and right down to Carrick-on-Suir.  Lives have been lost and valuable property has suffered.  The time has come now when a serious effort ought to be made to remedy that evil, which seems to increase yearly.</P>
    <P>It is with disappointment that I speak of the drainage of the river Anner.  The Anner was immortalised by Charles J. Kickham.  Every Irishman worthy of the name will hope to perpetuate the memory of that great patriot, soldier and statesman.  Among his many outpourings was the song, &ldquo;She Lived Beside the Anner&rdquo;.  I can assure the House, particularly the Parliamentary Secretary, that if she lived beside the Anner today, she would be drowned.  The river Anner has flooded its banks, not for 100 yards but for miles, with unfortunate results for the farmers who live in that area from Mullinahone, the birthplace and resting place of Charles Kickham, <Col N="435" /> right down to Loughcopple, the birthplace of some great Irishmen too.</P>
    <P>I shall not put all the blame on the shoulders of the Board of Works because some splendid work has been carried out there.  State money amounting to £6,000 was expended, along with a further £6,000 of local money provided by South Tipperary County Council.  I understand it cost £900 to bring machinery there and take it back. That occurred on two occasions.  The fact that the taxpayer's money was wasted in such a manner ought seriously to concern the people responsible. I should say that any businessman who would tolerate such a position, should have his head examined. The position now is that the land project has been in operation to the north of the village of Mullinahone and a number of the smaller rivers and streams have been cleaned.  They are now flowing into the Anner and causing tremendous flooding in the area.</P>
    <P>The Anner is the one river in South Tipperary that can be drained.  The other rivers cannot be drained piecemeal and to carry out work on them would be contrary to the purposes of the Act.  This one small river is causing immense damage to 54 small farmers, people who gave of their best in the past and who contributed to the freedom of this country in no small way.  Those people are being victi-mised, and it is a disgrace that no real attempt is made to deal with the flooding of this river.  The job that has been done is a splendid one, but it is of no use to the people still suffering, whose livestock have depreciated very considerably in value because of the negligence of somebody.  Who that somebody is will have to be decided sometime in the near future.  It cannot be allowed to go on.</P>
    <P>It is very pleasing, indeed, to get the assurance of the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary that the survey of the River Suir will take place in 1960.  That is not a day too soon.  The eyes of many of the principal bridges over the Suir were blocked, under military necessity, in 1920 and 1921.  They are still blocked. <Col N="436" /> I often thought that it should be the job of the Department of Defence to remove the obstructions which some of us caused at that time.  It behoves the Board of Works to see to it that the bridges under which the River Suir passes are no longer blocked because of that military necessity of as long ago as 40 years.</P>
    <P>I know I shall be told that the Board of Conservators objected to the drainage of the River Anner.  That is perfectly true.  What they knew about the fish in it, remains a mystery to me. I have not any great confidence in their national outlook.  I have always thought that most of them were people with gouty toes because of eating too much fish.</P>

      <P>Those people objected to the drainage of rivers at a period when drainage could have been carried out because, as they said, it would destroy the fishing.  I would love to see our rivers as full as possible of fish and I believe the tourist industry, which is so very important, should be facilitated in every way but I am still of the opinion that the dairy farmers whose cows die of disease because of flooding in small rivers are more important to us.  I hope that no more heed will be paid to these people called the Board of Conservators.</P>

That is a matter of which the Parliamentary Secretary must take special note and see to it that nobody will interfere with arterial drainage or <Col N="437" /> drainage of any kind in future. Drainage tends towards progress and increased production and I sincerely hope that every effort of the Board of Works will be focussed on more drainage of the rivers which they are entitled to drain as part of catchment areas under the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise only two points and will do so very briefly. I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will find time to make some observations in his reply on the two points in question.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, the former Parliamentary Secretary, the late Deputy Beegan, introduced a Supplementary Estimate to provide for certain works at Rosslare Strand to prevent coastal erosion.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us now what progress has been made.  In his opening speech he described the work as experimental.  As far as I can see, the experiment so far, to say the best for it, has not been an outstanding success. The fact remains that the village or town of Rosslare Strand is being gradually eaten away, even since the experimental work to prevent coastal erosion was commenced.  Therefore, it is important that the Parliamentary Secretary should tell the people of Wexford if the experiment has been a success, what the prospects are, whether it is intended to spend more money on it and what the Department's attitude is in respect of coastal erosion generally.  I am particularly concerned, naturally, with Rosslare Strand because I have seen tens and tens of yards being eaten away in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the last hour I have heard Deputies talk about arterial drainage and say that money so spent is well spent.  It is equally important to try to prevent towns and villages, especially on the East coast, being eaten away by coastal erosion. Thirteen years ago I referred to the fact that many houses in Rosslare Strand had been taken away by the sea.  At the present time some of the hotels are in real danger of collapse if the sea eats in any further.  The Rosslare Golf Course has been greatly damaged, even in the last winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what sort of <Col N="438" /> engineers the Board of Works have employed in an effort to combat this coastal erosion or whether or not they have any particular experience in coastal erosion work.  With all due respect to them and joining in the tributes that have been paid generally here to-day to the Board of Works officials and technical staff, I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the employment as consultants of some of the Dutch engineers who, as we all know, have a great deal of experience in fighting the sea back from the land.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought seriously to consider that.  The Dutch have been engaged for generations in trying to preserve their land from the sea and have been successful.  Unless we make a superhuman effort and are prepared to spend pretty liberally, many seaside towns, like Rosslare Strand and Waterville, to which Deputy Palmer referred, will disappear, in a relatively short period.  If we are to accept that they will disappear, that is all right but I suggest that we should not be resigned to the fact that the sea cannot be beaten.  The Dutch have beaten the sea successfully.</P>
    <P>While, as I said, we have the utmost confidence in our own engineers, coastal erosion is not a problem with which they deal from day to day or year to year and the employment of Dutch engineers as consultants would be of tremendous benefit to the technicians in the Board of Works and to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply will give the House whatever report is available to him so that the people of Rosslare Strand may be reassured that every effort is being made to preserve the town.</P>
    <P>The second question I want to ask refers to a scheme of drainage that has been commenced recently in an area called Ballyteigue and Kilmore. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to it in his opening speech.  We are grateful, and the people of the area are grateful, that that scheme has been started but I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if it is a relief scheme, whether or not the workers must be recruited from the <Col N="439" /> employment exchange, and must the workers be recipients of unemployment assistance.  That is my information. It may be right or it may be wrong. I assume that, when it is taken in under the Estimate of the Board of Works, under either Vote 8 or Vote 9, it is not an emergency or employment scheme and that, therefore, the contractor, whoever he may be, or the people who supervise the work, would be entitled to take in any worker who suits them from any part of County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would also make a comment on what I have said about the employment of workers on the Ballyteige and Kilmore drainage&mdash;whether or not it is a relief scheme, whether or not the contractor, or whoever supervises the work, is entitled to draw workers from whatever area he wishes, whether or not they are on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  The reason I raised the matter is that a man who lives in an adjacent electoral division says he was refused work because the labour exchange refused to submit his name as he was not in the electoral area of Kilmore and Ballyteige.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote which brings out the parochial mind in us all, but just before I become parochially-minded, I have a few comments to make.  I must start on the Office, for which I note an increase of nearly £20,000.  I see that the tendency each year is for this Estimate to increase, and since 1951, we have practically doubled it.  It is only natural that there should be an increase in view of the increased activities in regard to drainage and other work throughout the country.  I think drainage was one of the best things we ever started.  Actually, its benefits can never be measured, because you have losses, through fluke and otherwise, of cattle which people overlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I notice an increase of something like £20,000 in the engineering branch, I hope to see an increase in the marine section.  I refer to the marine section of the engineering branch in regard to the extension of the elbow or the pier at the Aran <Col N="440" /> Islands.  I raised this matter before and I think the Parliamentary Secretary is as much interested in it as I am.  He appreciates the need for such an extension.  At the moment, the ferry boat has to remain alongside for only certain periods.  This results in a timetable which will not suit the tourist traffic so well.  It means that the boat must anchor off shore, whereas the provision of this elbow would give greater facilities and would help tourist traffic to the island.</P>
    <P>It would also serve another purpose. It would increase the safe anchorage and tie up of fishing trawlers off the other side of the pier.  During rough weather, it is quite possible that untold damage could be done to fishing trawlers tied alongside the pier in that area.  There is a certain amount of fear that some night with a certain wind and tide great damage might be done there.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary will use his good offices in this connection.  The place is in his area and it will be in his interest as well as mine to have it expedited.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again this year to the increase in the Vote for the National Monuments Branch.  This branch, as far as the west is concerned, seems to me to have the Rip Van Winkle type of mentality.  I have raised this question several times.  I now notice that it has been raised by the Military History Society&mdash;by no less an authority than Mr. G. Hayes-McCoy&mdash;who have pointed out the importance of preserving that last section of the Galway city walls known as &ldquo;The Lion's Tower&rdquo;.  I think the National Monuments Branch should be big enough to swallow their pride. They ignored this in the past; they turned it down and said it was not work of importance.  I do not know whose views we are to take.  Here we have the views of the Military History Society and of that great authority, Mr. Hayes-McCoy.  I would ask the Monuments Branch to swallow their pride and take this matter up again. We hope to have this brought to a fruitful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to bring to the notice of the Board of Works is the necessity for repairing the <Col N="441" /> mill-race embankments.  I do not think it was the function of the Board to deal with these sections of the river.  The mill-race committees no longer function and it seems that these embankments will collapse.  They seem to be nobody's baby at the moment.  I think that in a case like that we shall have the Board of Works coming to the rescue.  At this stage it is only right that they should take an interest to see whose fault it is.  I cannot expect the Parliamentary Secretary to let me know &ldquo;off the cuff&rdquo; whose responsibility it is but, perhaps, he might let me know later by letter.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the intentions of the Board of Works are in regard to the large deposits of Corrib spoil which are dumped along the river at Terrylane.  These big mounds of spoil are anything but nice to look at. They should be cleared and put in lower land away from the area.</P>
    <P>The Board should interest themselves in the possibility of deepening that section of the river further up, known as The Creek at Meenlough.  It would help the flow of water and it would help the people of Meenlough who are interested in that section of the river.  Also, while the machinery is in the area, I should like to know if the Board could possibly consider deepening the approach to the pier in Meenlough.  It may not be the intention of the Board to deal with that, but while the machinery is in the area it is only right, having regard to the amount of time it would take, to undertake this work.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to raise concerns the level of the river Corrib.  People living in the area of Meenlough are wondering, if you interfere with the level of the river, whether it will interfere with their water supply or with the wells and they would like an assurance on that matter.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary enlighten me on the few points I have raised, especially in relation to the preservation of the old city walls of Galway.  I know it is a baby of that section of the Department called the National Monuments Branch.  I suggest <Col N="442" /> that the Parliamentary Secretary should use his good offices to have something done and I should also like him to be prepared to meet the Chamber of Commerce and Galway Corporation and other bodies interested in that question.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lynch on the need for improving the ventilation in this House.  It leaves much to be desired and I think it is the cause of lack of a quorum on a number of occasions.  Deputies just cannot stand the atmosphere at times.  There is, of course, a lot of &ldquo;hot air&rdquo;, but an improved ventilation system would do a good deal to encourage people to remain in the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Office because one gets an acknowledgment of representations there.  Other Departments should take example from them.  I should also like to pay tribute to the work done on the Corrib at Galway by our engineers.  I am only expressing the views of foreigners who have come there and have seen that work being done.  They say it is marvellous and it is only fair that we should express appreciation in the House.</P>

      <P>This Vote is largely concerned with drainage and schools. I am not so much concerned with schools, but there is one matter I referred to here once or twice since I came to the House&mdash;the need for some form of amplification in this House. Some may object, as one member did, and say that if there were amplification, everyone would hear what you were saying.  Most churches have amplification now, even the Vatican. There are times here when it is difficult to hear speakers and I am for ever being asked: &ldquo;What is it that was said?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>He just does the job when he is told.  There is very little I can say in that case.  In connection with the Minister's control of St. Stephen's Green, I would ask him to consider the erection of a low railing around the ponds.  I was there on Sunday and several times I saw small children trying to throw food to the ducks.  The children had to be dragged back and I am satisfied that if adults were not around, those children would find themselves in the pond very often. There is no protection; the ground slopes down; and if you step one inch beyond the limit, you are in the water, which I believe is four or five feet deep and very muddy.  In fact, it could do with cleaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Phoenix Park, we have the base of the Gough monument and we have another base in St. Stephen's Green of a statue that was blown up recently.  I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do with the bases of those statues which cannot be left as they are.  Could he not offer them to the National Monuments Association, the Old I.R.A., or whatever <Col N="444" /> organisation was responsible for their erection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work the Board of Works has been doing in Nenagh and surrounding areas.  The people there appreciate it very much.  The drainage situation is bad in North Tipperary. We have several rivers which we think should be brought under the Board of Works and at present North Tipperary County Council are negotiating with the Board in respect of damage done by the Brosna River.  It is damaging a river which we, as the local authority in North Tipperary, must maintain at a certain cost each year.  I am referring to the Pallas River at Rathcabbin where it joins the Brosna.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary at some future date to speed up the negotiations on this matter, so that landowners in Rathcabbin district will be relieved of the flooding that has taken place for the past three or four years.</P>
      <P>The county council also sent a deputation in connection with the Carrigahorric river and there was an estimate before the North Tipperary Council which showed that the cost of cleaning the river would be roughly £56,000.  We were trying to do it under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and were almost on the verge of doing at least portion of it when that money was stopped.  I believe, and each member of the council is, I think, of the same opinion, that in the case of a river such as this, stretching from the bridge of Portumna almost into Roscrea and where it is costing £56,000 or maybe £70,000 to do it in a small way, that it is too much to expect any local authority to do.  If the money is restored, as sometime it may be, it will be very hard for the county council to spend all the money doing a certain portion of only one river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at that time promised a deputation that he would go very carefully into the question of these rivers&mdash;it was a deputation from the General Council of County Councils because there were other counties with similar problems&mdash;and try to remedy the position.  I mention those points so that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="445" /> may look into them.  If, in his generosity, he can give any little grant either this year or next year to relieve flooding in that area it would be very welcome.  At least 7,000 acres are flooded and any relief in that position would be of tremendous benefit to the people and to the country as a whole ultimately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one point to make on this Estimate.  For a change, it is a point in connection with Dublin City and I am a little reluctant to intervene in what seems to be mainly the preserve of Galway representatives.</P>
      <P>For many years now there have been two problems existing side by side in the City of Dublin.  There is very grave need for new municipal offices.  The present accommodation is quite inadequate. It is unsuitable.  It is unhealthy.  It is uneconomic.  With every year that passes, the problem becomes more acute and more urgent. The necessity for providing suitable and adequate accommodation for the Dublin Corporation is to-day probably one of the most urgent and serious problems facing that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the decision in the matter lie with the Parliamentary Secretary or with some other body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment what I am saying may appear to be irrelevant but, in the light of what I shall say in a moment, it is relevant. From the point of view of Dublin Corporation, it is vital that something should be done about the problem immediately.  The difficulty which the Dublin Corporation come up against in this matter is that of providing themselves with a suitable site.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that problem of the Dublin Corporation, there is the position of Dublin Castle.  For many years there has been a problem in relation to that building, a problem which also grows more acute as the years go by.  Many of the offices there are quite unsuitable and some have deteriorated to the point where they are actually dangerous.  Some buildings have been abandoned and are derelict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Now these two problems&mdash;that of Dublin Corporation providing themselves with new offices and that of the provision of new Civil Service offices&mdash; are in my view related.  The correct place for the new Dublin municipal offices is the Dublin Castle site.  We should, therefore, prepare a comprehensive plan for dealing with the problem of rebuilding Dublin Castle and the problem of providing the Dublin Corporation with new municipal offices on that site.  It would be particularly opportune just now to embark on a programme of rebuilding Dublin Castle because of the amount of slack in the building industry in the city at the moment.  A programme of rebuilding of that order would have a very beneficial effect on the employment position in the city.  It would also have a correspondingly beneficial effect on commercial life generally.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has an opportunity of providing a solution to these two problems in one comprehensive plan.  He should tackle the matter now.  If he does so, he will provide a very sensible solution to two long-outstanding problems and one which will remain as a monument to his judgment and good sense for many generations. I urge him to enter into discussions with the Dublin Corporation with a view to bringing forth a comprehensive scheme to provide the required Civil Service offices on the Dublin Castle site and, at the same time, provide the Corporation with a site for their much needed new municipal offices.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his assistance in bringing the drainage of the River Moy to its present stage.  I hope that work will start this year.  His predecessor postponed this work until 1963.  The scheme will be a great blessing to the people of Mayo and Sligo.  I am assured that over 3,000 families will benefit materially.  From ten acres of land upwards will be improved in each case.  That will be of tremendous benefit to the people concerned.  I am satisfied they will appreciate it very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that certain vested <Col N="447" /> interests are doing their utmost to stop this work.  I am certain they will not be successful in their endeavours. There is no danger of the fishing industry being materially affected by the drainage.  We have had drainage schemes in the past and we know from experience that fisheries are not affected.  It must be remembered, too, that it is now possible to restock our rivers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tackle the problem of boreens. Many people are living without any amenities of any kind in the more backward districts and the least to which they are entitled is a boreen to their houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary intends to speed up the building of schools.  On the figures given to us for 1922 approximately 1,200 schools have been replaced.  There were approximately at that date 750 schools for replacement and 300 needing major improvements. The estimate the Parliamentary Secretary gives for the final solution of this problem in ten, fifteen or twenty years, is heartening.  I should like to feel we would have solved the problem by that time.  That will still leave approximately 2,500 schools which by that time, taking 1922 or 1920 as the base year, will be approximately 50 years older and I am sure quite a number of them, by that time, will require replacement and enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last year that on looking at the schools erected throughout the country, one most certainly feels pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary can report that the staff now dealing with the problem will step-up the work, and that there will be a lessening of the time lag between the <Col N="448" /> sanctioning of a grant for the building of schools and the actual time when building operations commence.  I understand that in the past there were problems in regard to staff which slowed down this work, but I hope that the improvement in that situation will continue.  I wonder if it would help matters if, where there are minor improvements to be dealt with, the local officer of the Office of Public Works could deal with them?  I think that might, in many cases, speed up the carrying out of minor repairs, instead of having to seek sanction, as I understand they must, from the head office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies mentioned playing fields.  Of course, everyone agrees that their provision is a very desirable thing but you cannot, without much thought, sanction playing fields.  It might not always be desirable to entice young people to come back to the playing fields in the evenings, unless someone were prepared to organise and superintend their games.  That is something which would need much thought, whether children should be permitted to play in those fields in the evening without supervision.</P>
    <P>The second large work with which this Estimate is concerned deals with arterial drainage.  I should like to hear something from the Parliamentary Secretary about the two rivers in my constituency which I mentioned on a previous occasion.  They are the Deale and the Maigue.  Preliminary work in regard to a survey of the Deale has been carried out and is continuing at the moment, but he might give some indication as to when the survey is expected to be completed, and what time lag there will be before work on the actual drainage begins.  I mentioned previously&mdash;there is no necessity to labour it&mdash;that last year we had a large amount of flooding in that region, and a large area of land was seriously interfered with.  That happened in a year that was already bad.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in paying tribute to the officials of the Office of Public Works and to the Parliamentary Secretary for the courtesy they have always shown when dealing with queries..</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been a pretty fair representation of the position in so far as Deputies' knowledge goes.  Personally, I feel that if I were to draw up a balance sheet of the faultfinding and the praising, the praise in this case would outweigh the faultfinding. That is gratifying for a person like myself who has not been a very long time in this position.  However, the Office of Public Works, in the main, as has been pointed out by a number of Deputies, very largely gives agency services in respect of a number of matters.  We do, of course, in the matter of one very large item, namely, arterial drainage, initiate, but, as I mentioned in my introductory statement, I put school building in the first priority in so far as the Office of Public Works has responsibility in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputies giving due recognition to the amount of work which has been done since we began to rule and regulate our own affairs here at home, in the elimination of the very large bulk of school building arrears which faced the State when we took over the Government.  I find that between 1901 and 1910, the average expenditure per annum was £25,780; between 1911 and 1920, it was £32,163; between 1921 and 1930, it was £55,065; between 1931 and 1940, it was £134,311; between 1941 and 1950, it was £246,572; and from 1951 to 1959, that is, nine years, £903,692.  I need hardly comment on the figures.  The total expenditure in 1958-59, that is, the last financial year, was £1,491,975 and the Estimate for 1959-60, as Deputies know, is £1,600,000.</P>
      <P>Between 1919 and 1935&mdash;they, mainly, would be years of home government&mdash;a period of 16 years, 660 new schools and large improvements were completed.  The average worked out at 41 per annum.  In the last financial year, 1958-59, the number completed was 154, so that it is true to say that very considerable and steady progress has been maintained.  There are difficulties that are not readily within the capacity of the Commissioners of Public Works to solve.  Perhaps if I were to go through a list of the difficulties which the Schools Section of the Office meet I would save time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> One is the provision by the school manager of an adequate site and others include delays in obtaining satisfactory title to a site, availability of ample and suitable water supply for sanitation and, in rural areas, this very often involves the finding of water on a site and the sinking of a well.  Another matter which causes difficulty is that of changes in accommodation requirements, which may necessitate replanning.  A further difficulty is that consideration of tenders very often involves a considerable amount of correspondence with contractors before all details are satisfactorily settled and a tender can be accepted.  It is sometimes necessary because of unsatisfactory tendering in the first place, or because of the withdrawal of tenders, to seek fresh tenders. In addition, during the course of a contract, particularly during the initial stages, bad weather often impedes progress and, of course, one that is not uncommon, the failure by a contractor to complete a job, sometimes makes it necessary to invite tenders for completion of outstanding works.</P>
    <P>These are difficulties with which the Schools Section has had to contend and, even with the best will and organisation in the Office itself, these difficulties very often cause tantalising and heart-breaking delays.  They are just as heart-breaking to the officers of the Office of Public Works as they are to parents, schools managers and everybody else concerned.  I do not think I ought to delay further in dealing with schools.  From all the remarks that have been made, in the main, Deputies are satisfied that as good progress as is possible is being made.  If we were to attempt to achieve a considerable increase in output I think we would have to have a very substantial increase in the staff and, before we can recommend any such increase in staff to the Minister for Finance, there are certain examinations of the work of the Schools Section which must be carried out.  We want to make sure that, in fact, the staff in the Schools Building Section is being utilised to the best possible purpose.</P>
    <P>If I were to deal with the speeches of Deputies <i>seriatim</i> I would repeat <Col N="451" /> myself in regard to certain matters which have been mentioned by many speakers, but I should like to deal with the question of coast erosion, to which Deputy Lynch first referred. That is really what he has been speaking about in relation to the position at Tramore&mdash;at least, that is what I gather from him by the description he gave of it.  I want to stress that there is no statutory responsibility on the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of coast erosion.  Deputies know that during the previous Administration a Bill was introduced to deal with this question but it raised so many difficulties that the Government of the day decided not to proceed with it, or, in any event, they did not take any steps to ensure that it would be enacted.  After a considerable amount of discussion in the Dáil I think they realised that the problem was bristling with more difficulties than appeared when the Bill was drafted.</P>
    <P>We are very much in the same position with regard to coast erosion and, what is being done at Rosslare is, as Deputy Corish pointed out, by way of being an experiment.  I think he said that we should bring in Dutchmen who have long experience in this matter of coast protection, but what is being done at Rosslare is really a long, patient, drawn-out process of observation for various purposes&mdash;for instance the effect of groynes, observation of tide and sand movements, and things of that sort.  This would all have to be undertaken by the Dutchmen, even if we brought them in, and it seems it is much better that this type of work should be done by ourselves, as it is being done very satisfactorily by our own engineers, before inviting anybody else in.  When we have collected and collated all this information, well and good, let the opinion be sought of people who have longer experience of these matters than we, but I do not think it is necessary, at this stage, that foreign experts be brought in to do the observing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never any need to bring in such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the information <Col N="452" /> on which the judgment of these foreign experts would be placed would have to be collected first of all, and we are collecting it now.</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly what I have to say to Deputies in regard to the very big and important question of arterial drainage.  I know that the cases made by the representatives of every river bed and catchment area in the country are quite true.  Both alone, and in company with the Minister for Finance, I have received a number of deputations on this subject.  They have all made strong cases and we have had no reason to doubt the truth of what they said, but what are we to do? Between major and minor proposals there are sixty of these catchment areas in the country, and it is quite impossible to drain them all together.  It is obvious that there must be some order of preference.</P>
      <P>Whether facetiously or in earnest Deputies referred to a succession of Galwaymen holding the office of Parliamentary Secretary and suggested, or seemed to suggest therefrom, that the location of two major schemes west of the Shannon might not have taken place if, for instance, there had been a Leinster man or a Munster man introduced between some two of them. In any event, I do not know that it is necessary for me to defend myself against any implications arising from that statement because I found, when I came into the office, that there was a very long established order of priority before me.  I would have been a courageous Parliamentary Secretary indeed if I were to interfere with it.  I am not saying that it is just the order of priority I myself would have drawn up, but there it was, and with the pressure coming on us from all quarters, how could we have restored order to the work of arterial drainage if, every time there was a change of Government, we were to make serious alterations in the list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list, as it is, is based on long experience, inspection and observation on the part of the professional staff in the Office of Public Works.  They themselves have been impressed by the degree of hardship suffered in those areas.  I am not saying that the quality <Col N="453" /> of the land has been a first consideration with them although they do have due regard to the question of agricultural output.  If there is any tendency on the part of Deputies to make this a provincial matter and to make a comparison between two provinces, I would ask the Munster Deputy who has large areas of Munster still unserviced to recognise the fact that an acre of land to a Connaught man is more valuable probably than 10 or 15 acres in the broad lands of Munster.  If there has been any shaping of national drainage policy on the part of the Government I imagine that would be a factor that would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the physical impossibility of doing them all together, there is a number of other reasons why in drawing up a priority you would gravitate towards these less fortunate areas.  You have more congestion in these districts and a greater incidence of emigration.  All that has been stressed very much by nearly all public representatives and others who have been talking a great deal about the effect of emigration and the necessity to stem it.  Possibly the people from the areas who have not yet been serviced may be under the impression that I am speaking as a Connaughtman in this matter.  I assure you I do no such thing.  When I look at the map in my office, which has considerably large white areas to the southeast, I am not one bit satisfied.  I often say to the Commissioners and to the drainage engineers that I hope they will get as soon as possible to the stage when they will be able to colour much broader areas in those parts.</P>
    <P>I want to endorse and confirm what Deputy Davern said in relation to a statement made to a deputation from Tipperary received by the Minister for Finance at which I was present, that the drainage officers hope to be able to get into his county and to do something for the Anner, that very famous river which has had that very beautiful song, which he quoted, written about it by Charles Kickham.  They hope to be able to get down to that historic country, as we promised, in the year 1960 and I shall be most disappointed <Col N="454" /> if the Commissioners cannot carry out that promise.  However, I feel satisfied that they will.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Blowick really wants me to give him all the data about the Moy.  I do not think he will welcome the information I have to give him if he presses me. Therefore, I shall confine myself to saying that it has been on exhibition for the statutory period.  That exhibition period ended some short time ago and all the observations received are now being weighed and considered by the Commissioners of Public Works as a statutory duty under the 1945 Act.  It is true that the most serious objection may come from the fishery interests.</P>
    <P>I wanted the Commissioners to give me a limit of time within which these observations would be concluded but they were not able to do that.  I wanted to be able to state definitely to those interested here when the scheme would have been cleared by the Commissioners and be ready for submission to the Minister for Finance for his final judgment.  I can give only a guess as to when that stage will have been reached and, so far as I know, provided no unforeseen difficulties arise, it will not be possible to have it ready for submission to the Minister before the early fall of this year.  As to whether work can be commenced on the Moy this year, if the Minister finds himself in a position to confirm it, I cannot say.  I am sticking to the terms of the Act when I say &ldquo;if the Minister finds himself in a position to confirm it&rdquo;, because I would be exceeding the authority which the Arterial Drainage Act gives me if I were to put the case in any more definite and precise terms than that.</P>

If the scheme is a good and economic one, it would have been as good two, three or four years ago as it is this year or maybe next year or the year after. <Col N="455" /> When Deputy Beegan came back as Parliamentary Secretary in 1957 he was amazed and alarmed, in fact he was enraged, to find a decision before him made by the previous Government that the Moy was to be postponed for a period of five years.</P>

      <P>The national programme of drainage represents about 20,000 miles of arteries.  Between completed works and works in progress, surveys and design work, about one-third of that&mdash;say, roughly 7,000 miles &mdash;has been reached.  That is not bad progress since the end of the war.  The principal engineers dealing with it think that in about ten years the back of the job will have been broken.  I think they are entitled to take that viewpoint because, as the work progresses, they are getting more and more experience and the supervisory staff&mdash;drivers, gangers, and all that type of personnel&mdash;and the junior engineers are all now settling in to a well-regulated and well-controlled routine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> We have difficulty in getting and in holding sufficient professional staff.  I take it that that is just part and parcel of the general emigration tendency. When young engineers hear of better employment elsewhere they leave our employment in drainage, as well as other employments, and go off.  Unmarried men who have no domestic ties, so to speak, are not easily held and we suffer from it.</P>

      <P>After spending some time in these other employments they come back and tell us they would prefer to work with us&mdash;but they have to go away to find that out.  With regard to particular problems such as was mentioned in regard to the Maine and the Brown Flesk, I cannot tell Deputy Palmer what the Commissioners of Public Works will be able to do with the Brown Flesk.  We met a deputation recently and treated them, as Deputy Palmer acknowledged, as fairly as we possibly could.  There is a technical difficulty in relation to the Brown Flesk inasmuch as it is not an ordinary flood drainage problem.  It is more a problem of sudden torrents which accumulate quickly and recede quickly. The nature of the river itself is such that there will be very considerable destruction of land to do the job of straightening which apparently is desired locally and probably more would be lost than gained.  I do not want to say that that is the definite and final judgment on the matter, but it seems to be the way our knowledge is pointing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick mentioned the Tennessee Valley and praised the very fine work done there.  The House will be interested to know that the principle applied in the Tennessee Valley was worked out and established in the United States by an engineer named Manning who got his training in the <Col N="459" /> Irish Office of Public Works.  We had over here a Colonel Rydell who is looked upon as one of the best American experts on this problem.  He was amazed to find that Manning graduated here in Ireland and that we had trained him.</P>
    <P>As I am on the question of Colonel Rydell and floods, I think I should reply to Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Blowick on the matter of the River Suck.  Neither the late Deputy Beegan nor myself can be held responsible for the position with regard to the Suck.  The late Deputy Beegan did not accept, and I do not accept, responsibility for this position with regard to the Suck.  The previous Government brought in this American expert, Colonel Rydell.  He made a recommendation that no further rivers emptying into the Shannon should be dealt with until certain investigations in relation to the Shannon were carried out.  He directed what these investigations should be and when they are completed, he is apparently to be brought back to assess their findings and a decision is to be taken.</P>
    <P>His recommendation was accepted by the previous Government and all we are doing is simply honouring it and carrying it out.  Now these two Deputies, one of them a former Minister and the other a former Parliamentary Secretary, are blaming me for a decision in regard to the River Suck which they themselves made.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything else I want to say on the matter of drainage.  The figure of expenditure last year on drainage was, in round figures, three quarters of a million pounds&mdash;£776,202 to be exact. That is not bad going and it represents a considerable increase which has been sanctioned by the present Minister for Finance.  Even were he prepared to increase it to a much bigger figure, I am afraid we would have had to decline it because our staff and organisation would not be able to deal with it.  So far as the Department of Finance is concerned, <Col N="460" /> we in the Office of Public Works have no complaint to make in regard to the financing of drainage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish wants to know whether the Ballyteige and Kilmore scheme is a relief scheme and whether it is not possible to take on workers from any part of the country.  The standard practice in regard to recruitment on these arterial drainage schemes is that the resident engineer goes to the local exchange and asks for the list of those who are registered. Those who are in receipt of the largest amounts of unemployment assistance get preference, that is, provided that they are fit for the class of work which arterial drainage involves.  A man may, of course, get employment where he has some special skill which is necessary and which is not available from the exchange list.  There is a little latitude in that respect, and if there were not, the work could not go on satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>There were a number of other matters mentioned in relation to arterial drainage, but it is hardly necessary for me to take them one by one. Having given the general position with regard to it I think each Deputy who has a problem can apply what I have said to his own area.  I would ask each Deputy who has a bad problem to try to put himself in my position, where I have 60 of these arterial drainage areas to deal with, and try to re-shuffle them and see what a very difficult position he would find himself in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one point in regard to schools to which I did not refer.  There was a complaint by two or three Deputies in regard to the monotonous appearance or the sameness of all these very fine schools which are now being put up.  Well, even fine appearances or beauty can become monotonous, I suppose.  Everybody who spoke said that the schools were very fine productions but there is one thing which cannot be ignored, that is, when the school section of the Office of Public Works is working to a standard set of plans, they are able to do the work much more quickly and with an arrears of 750 new schools to be built, it is obvious that everything you can do to speed up the rate of progress is desirable. <Col N="461" /> If we are to start having a much wider variety of design, such an innovation would take from expedition and output and whether it is wise to attempt that at this stage, when there is such a clamour for a larger output of schools, is something that would need very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>In referring to output, it is usual to refer to two categories, that is, to new schools and to large scale improvements. These improvements often involve extensions and I am informed by the Commissioners of Public Works that the carrying out of these improvements and extensions is a much slower job than the building of a new school. I think they said that the preparation of the work for extension and improvement takes about four times the amount of time that preparing the plans for a new school involves.  Therefore these reconstructed schools very often have almost as much work put into them as a new building.  In fact, when they are completed, the difference between them and a new school is hardly noticeable, even to people in the building trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned a particular difficulty and one about which I am not able to give him any very definite information.  It is the suggested locating of new Dublin municipal council buildings in the Castle.  That involves a much wider decision and I do not think that the making of that decision is within the competence of the Commissioners of Public Works.  A very comprehensive survey of the Dublin position will have to be made and I take it that there will be consultation and co-operation between the Commissioners of Public Works, Dublin Corporation and any other authority concerned.  I am afraid that I am not able to help the Deputy at this stage and I am sure he will understand why.</P>
    <P>I had the greatest sympathy with what Deputy Davern had to say about the Rock of Cashel but it was news to me that my predecessor had decided that a flagstaff would be erected but that some evil influence has prevented the National Flag from being flown on it.  I am not aware of the decision about the flagstaff or of the evil influence to which he referred.  However, <Col N="462" /> I assure him that I shall have the matter examined and I want to tell him that I have the fullest sympathy with his sentiments in the matter and that whatever I can do to secure his wishes in the matter, I shall be only too glad to do.</P>
    <P>The Chair has repeatedly had to point out to Deputies that matters like the accommodation to be provided in school buildings is not a matter for decision by the Office of Public Works but by the Minister for Education.  We are merely the agents who carry out the decisions already arrived at between the managers and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I ought mention it at this stage, but there are two categories into which the building of primary schools might be put.  One section of it is done directly by the Office of Public Works.  The other category is done by the school managers under, of course, certain supervisions on the part of this Office. Those in the second category would be largely religious orders.  Their schools, of course, are on the average far larger than the ordinary rural primary school.  I asked for some information on the matter and I was told that, on the average, the grant given by the Department of Education for one of these primary schools built by a religious order would be of the order of £60,000 and that for the improvement of such a school would be of the order of £25,000.  That compares with an average figure of something over £8,000 for the national school built directly by the Office of Public Works, and a figure of something over £4,000 for an improvement carried out by the Office of Public Works.  So that, although you have only a small number in the second category, they usually eat up as much money as the total expenditure by the Office itself directly.  Whether that particular section of school building might not be capable of some special treatment is not easy to say at the moment, but I have asked the Commissioners to examine the matter to see if by some different treatment greater expedition of output could not be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> I do not think I have ignored the remarks of anybody who has spoken. I have tried to be as fair as possible to everybody.  The last Deputy who spoke was an Teachta Mac Seoin.  He mentioned schools but I think his remarks were on much the same lines as others who spoke.  He also referred to the question of playing fields.  Again, I want to say that it is not for us to decide what kind of accommodation will be provided.  The Department of Education do that.  If they direct that a certain type of school with certain amenities be provided, it is the job of the Board of Works to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>The Maigue has not yet been started. It is not possible to say exactly when the survey work on the Deale will be completed, but I understand that the field work has made considerable progress.  Of course, that is not the end of the job.  When the field work is done, the results have to be taken into the office and the plotting and the design prepared.  I can assure the Deputy that it will get the best possible attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disposal of spoil, this is a matter of some consequence because as we go ahead with the work there will be more and more of these spoil heaps around the country.  I know that people have been writing letters to the newspapers objecting to their appearance, but there is nothing we can do about it within the financial limits.  If we were to undertake to spread this spoil on the level, it would take up too much time and too much money, and we feel we ought to direct our efforts, our money and our skill to the main task of draining the land.  Very often the spoil thrown up is suitable for top-dressing and farmers will take it away.  Even where it is not possible to have it taken by local people, the engineers in charge of these drainage schemes see to it that the banks they make are trimmed nicely.  In time the vegetation comes on them, they merge with the surrounding countryside and are not the eyesores for all time people make them out to be now.  In any event, it is quite impossible to undertake the spreading of <Col N="464" /> them, as has been suggested.  I am afraid we will only have to put up with it.  In certain places like towns and cities, where you have building operations, preparation of sites for various things and so on, the spoil is availed of as filling-up material.  In fact, in some places there is a clamour for it; but in remote places you have not got that demand for it and there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I was asked about fishery harbours. Of course, I cannot give any definite information on fishery harbours because it is a matter for the Minister for Lands.  I am sure the House is aware that he has been very active in the matter.  In fact, he has detached a number of our staff to collaborate with an F.A.O. expert who has been examining a number of our harbours with a view to development.  That survey has been going on for some time and I think it will not be very long until a report will be available.  Of course, that report does not come to me; it goes to the Minister for Lands.  I take it that the Minister for Lands will make that information available to the House at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I see a reference here to the Lion's Tower, Galway.  It was mentioned by Deputy Coogan.  I am a representative of Galway myself and what I shall say now may possibly be unwise because I shall have to answer for it locally, but I do think something more might have been done locally to clean up the place.  The walls are there but it is not obvious what can be done about them, even by the Office of Public Works.  I believe that the National Monuments Committee did take them over for a period because it was represented to them that there was a danger that the tower was to be demolished.  In any event, their taking over for a period prevented the demolition, but the National Monuments Committee does not regard the Lion's Tower in Galway as being of sufficient national importance to be permanently under their care and, for that reason, they advised the Commissioners to revoke the order which they previously made and the Commissioners did revoke the order on the committee's advice.  That is how the position stands.  I know there is an <Col N="465" /> archaeological society in Galway, that there are many very active bodies, that Deputy Coogan is a member of some of them and, between all of them, it ought to be possible to ensure that the Lion's Tower in Galway is made presentable for the tourists this summer and that will give the National Monuments Committee a little more time to consider the representations that have been made here today about it.</P>

    <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes makes provision for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas; and for other services such as bog development schemes, rural improvements schemes, and miscellaneous schemes such as minor marine works and archaeological excavations.  Provision is also made for salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office who are responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Estimate, it is usual to give a résumé of the work done under the Vote in the preceding financial year, and I propose to follow that practice.  The gross estimate last year was £853,400; but in addition, there was a sum of £48,000, being the total of unexpended balances of previous years' allocations from the National Development Fund, available for expenditure, bringing the total for urban employment schemes to £275,000 instead of £227,000 as shown against Subhead E in the Estimates Volume, and the gross total to £901,400.  The actual expenditure last year is estimated at £858,700, which is approximately 95% of the provision.  To give a comparative picture of the operations of the Special Employment Schemes Office in recent years, I have made available to Deputies a tabular statement giving particulars of the expenditure under the various subheads of the Vote in 1956/57 and 1957/58; the estimated expenditure for 1958/59, as well as the provision for these services in 1959/60. In this schedule I have shown the balance available in 1959/60 from the National Development Fund as <Col N="468" /> £22,000, instead of £12,000 as it appears in the footnote at page 46 of the Estimates Volume.  The expenditure from the Fund last year did not reach expectations and £22,000 is the more correct figure.  For further details, it will, I think, be easier to follow if I deal with the expenditure in each subhead separately, but before doing this, I shall give some general figures of unemployment on which the employment side of the programme is based.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the grants for urban, rural and minor employment schemes is related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area.  A census is taken annually in the third week of January by the Special Employment Schemes Office of the number of these men, as well as the number of persons in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit in each of the sixty urban areas, 477 non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, and 2,875 rural electoral divisions in the whole country. This census includes, in addition to the men drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit, men who had been in receipt of such payments but who were working on the Special Employment Schemes Office schemes during that particular census week.</P>
    <P>The 1959 census figure gives a total of 35,492 men in receipt of unemployment assistance, compared with 36,063 in January, 1958, a reduction of 1?%. The 1957 figure was 35,153.  Including persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, the figures were 84,294 in 1957; 77,104 in 1958, and 74,929 in 1959.  The reduction of 8½% in 1958 on the 1957 figures was followed in 1959 by a further reduction of almost 3% on the 1958 figures, or a total reduction of 11% in the two year period.  The small drop in unemployment assistance recipients in 1959 compared with 1958 was general throughout the country, the urban figures being 12,006 for 1959 compared with 12,067 in 1958; and 23,486 in rural areas in 1959 compared with 23,996 in 1958. Including unemployment insurance benefit claimants, the drop was greater in the urban areas, the figures being <Col N="469" /> 25,916 in urban areas in 1959, compared with 27,147 in 1958, a drop of 4½%; and for rural areas 49,013 in 1959, compared with 49,957 in 1958, a drop of almost 2%.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployment assistance recipients who were employed on the schemes during the census week ended 24th January, 1959, was 2,081 and persons in receipt of unemployment benefit 652, giving a total of 2,733.  The number of persons employed on the schemes under this Vote varies considerably during the year, the peak period being around Christmas.  For the week ended 13th December, 1958, 6,103 men were employed, of whom 978 were in urban areas, 592 in non-urbanised towns and 4,533 in rural electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>Subheads A, B, C and D provide for salaries, travelling and office expenses of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The provision for salaries shows an increase of £2,880, which is due partly to the normal incremental progression in the scales of pay and partly to the special 10/- per week increase granted during 1958.  The increase of £250 in Subhead D is due principally to the increased use of the telephone in respect of which adequate allowance had not been made in recent years.  The increased use arose mainly out of the necessity for frequent consultations with the district offices.</P>
    <P>Urban employment schemes are intended to finance works in the four county borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the borough of Dún Laoghaire, and the fifty-five other urban districts.  Grants, which are administered through the Department of Local Government, are conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office, and making contributions towards their cost.  The local contribution in recent years has been 20% in the case of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, i.e. one-fifth; 17% or one-sixth in Cork and Limerick; 14% or one-seventh in Waterford and it averaged 12% in the fifty-five other urban areas, varying between 5% and 17% in the individual towns.  A sum of £227,000 was provided in the Vote for these urban schemes in 1958/59, but, <Col N="470" /> in view of the additional sum of £48,000 balance available for expenditure from the National Development Fund, we decided to make a sum of £270,000 available for new works last year, of which £150,000 was allocated to Dublin, £18,250 to Cork, £16,750 to Limerick, £8,500 to Waterford, £6,500 to Dún Laoghaire and £70,000 to the other fifty-five urban areas.  The estimated expenditure in 1958/59 came to £253,500.</P>
    <P>The Dublin schemes proceed the whole year round, each U.A. man getting a 12 weeks' spell of employment. The unemployment assistance recipients census figure for Dublin was 6,480 in January, 1959, compared with 6,617 in January, 1958, and 5,889 in January, 1957.  Almost 54% of the urban unemployment assistance recipients are, therefore, concentrated in the Dublin area.  Dublin Corporation were notified on 24th July, 1958 that a State grant of £150,000 was available for new works costing £187,500, subject to a contribution of £37,500.  Schemes costing £182,486, of which £145,987 was State grant, were approved during the year, leaving a balance not taken up of £5,014, State grant £4,013, for which schemes were not submitted in time and which is now forfeited.  Of the £146,000 State grants approved in Dublin, £25,000 was in respect of footpaths, £33,500 for various road works, and the remaining £87,500 was in respect of amenity schemes, including the development of Bushy Park, Terenure, £29,100; St. Anne's Park, Clontarf, £20,800; Dolphin's Barn open spaces, £5,600; remedial works on the Little Dargle River, £30,000, and in Baldoyle, £1,450.</P>
    <P>The State expenditure on Dublin schemes last year amounted to £132,870.  The average number of men employed on the schemes was 131, of whom 90 were unemployment assistance recipients.  The number varied during the year from a peak total of 231 down to 68, of whom 172 and 42 respectively were unemployment assistance recipients.  The amount which will be allocated to the Dublin county borough area in 1959/60 has not yet been determined.  The desirability of finding suitable works of a high un- <Col N="471" /> skilled labour content cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation were notified on 21st July, 1958 of a State allocation of £18,250 for new schemes, subject to a contribution of £3,650, one-sixth of the total, £21,900.  Schemes to absorb the full allocation for 1958/59 were duly approved, which included road and footpath works amounting to £17,100, and the clearance of derelict sites, at a cost of £4,800.  The State grant expenditure, including works sanctioned in previous years, amounted to £21,290, so that some arrears of work in the Cork area were overtaken during the year.  I had occasion last year to comment on the low unskilled labour content of some of the Cork schemes and, while the unskilled labour content of the schemes in 1958/59 was not as high as we would like, there was some improvement.  The proportion of non-unemployment assistance recipients employed on these special schemes in Cork was also rather high. I am hoping that the improvement in the unskilled labour content will continue in the new year and that Cork Corporation will be able to employ a larger proportion of U.A. men on these schemes.</P>
    <P>The full allocation of £16,750, conditional on a contribution of £3,350, total £20,100, was absorbed by the Limerick County Borough.  The approved works were all either roads or footpaths, with the exception of a £2,700 scheme for the development of open spaces in the city.  Waterford also submitted suitable schemes to absorb their allocation of £8,500, local contribution £1,415, total £9,915.  Of the approved works, £6,730 was for road schemes and £3,190 for the clearance of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>Schemes to absorb the full £76,500 made available for the other urban areas were duly approved, including £6,500 for Dún Laoghaire in respect of parks at Newtownsmith, Williamstown and Temple Hill and the improvement of the bathing facilities at Sea Point. Grants in the other urban areas varied from £250 in the case of the smaller towns such as Bundoran, Castlebar and Templemore, providing for only a <Col N="472" /> few weeks' work for unemployment assistance recipients before Christmas, to £5,400 in Tralee, £5,200 in Drogheda, £4,000 in Sligo, £3,500 in Galway, etc., in the larger urban centres.  The maximum number of weeks' employment which may be given to an individual unemployment assistance recipient in urban areas other than Dublin is eight weeks.  As already stated, twelve weeks are allowed in the case of the Dublin unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
    <P>The works approved in the other urban areas include £54,260 for roads and footpaths.  The remaining £15,740 was in respect of various amenity schemes, such as parks and open spaces, car parks, cemetery paths, clearance of derelict sites, promenades and protection walls.  The distribution of available money in the new financial year in the county borough areas and other urban districts has not yet been determined but it will follow the usual pattern proportionate to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Rural Employment Schemes subhead was £35,000 in the last two years, and this provision is repeated for the new financial year.  As in recent years, these schemes will be confined to towns with a population of two hundred and over which have not got urban councils.  The grants will be made available to the various county councils concerned, and the county councils will, as heretofore, be required to contribute a quarter of the cost.  The schemes will be carried out in the weeks immediately preceding Christmas.  The £35,000 available last year was divided among approximately 150 town areas, from which it will be seen that the allocation in nearly all cases was between £200 and £300.  The approved works consisted mainly of footpaths and some very minor road works.  The desirability of providing footpaths in the precincts or in the vicinity of towns will be appreciated by everybody, but I was disappointed to find that in many instances county councils used this money for the improvement of county roads sometimes even two miles or more outside the town areas from which the U.A. men <Col N="473" /> had to be recruited.  I think that it should be possible to find useful works of public utility other than road works within the immediate confines of these town areas to absorb the small sums of money which can be made available annually for these works.  I am sure that in most of these town areas if county councils make local enquiries it should be possible to find alternative works of public utility, including the removal of eyesores, which could be carried out within a figure of a couple of hundred pounds and for which alternative funds may not be readily available.</P>
    <P>Minor Employment Schemes make provision for the repair and construction of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs in areas in which there are substantial numbers of unemployment assistance recipients, commonly referred to as the congested districts.  The primary purpose of these schemes, which are carried out in the period November to March, is to give employment to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in rural areas.  The unit of distribution is the electoral division, of which there are some 2,875 in the whole country.  These full-cost grants, however, are given in only about 400 of the electoral divisions, situated in parts of the twelve counties of Cavan, Clare, West Cork, Donegal, West Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.  More precise particulars of the geographical areas concerned were set out in the detailed statement by the late Mr. Beegan on the 1957/58 Estimates (Cols. 740-741 of the volume for the 2nd May, 1957).</P>
    <P>As the schemes are carried out in the winter period only, drainage works are not regarded as suitable employment schemes.  There is, therefore, no provision in this Vote for full-cost grants for land drainage. Farmers who will benefit by these works by having a good road to their houses, lands and bogs are expected to give road materials free, if they are available on their lands.  As the work is for the benefit of unemployment assistance recipients the farmers are not themselves eligible for work on <Col N="474" /> the schemes unless they are on the highest scales of unemployment assistance in the locality.  Some 900 schemes, representing an expenditure of £130,000 and serving approximately 16,000 families to houses, lands and bogs were approved last year.  The provision in the new year for this service is the same, i.e., £130,000.</P>
    <P>The Bog Development Schemes subhead makes provision for road, drainage and other works to facilitate the production of turf by landholders and other private producers.  The expenditure on this service was £99,177 in 1956/57, increased to £156,266 in 1957/58 and, it is estimated, will amount to £167,000 in 1958/59&mdash;some £7,000 in excess of the Vote provision in the subhead.  1,176 new schemes, costing £160,000, were approved last year, which facilitated approximately 32,000 families in the production of their turf.  521 of these were drainage works, representing an expenditure of £61,640, and the other 655 were road works, costing £98,360.  The very wet year interfered considerably with turf production.</P>
    <P>A number of schemes sanctioned in 1957, which were not carried out before 1st April, 1958, were completed last year in an effort to give as much assistance as possible to the fuel problem.  The provision for the new year is £160,000.  Bog drainage works are done in all parts of the country, and the bog road works under this subhead are done in areas which are not catered for by Minor Employment Schemes.  The necessity for these schemes needs no emphasis from me, and my only regret is that funds are not available to do much more work than the sum provided will permit.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the construction or repair of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  It is a contributory scheme and applies to all parts of the country, irrespective of the unemployment position.  As I explained last year, the scheme was introduced in 1943 to assist farmers in areas outside the congested districts <Col N="475" /> to repair accommodation roads to their houses, lands and bogs.  Up to that year, no State assistance was available for non-county roads in these areas.  The original scheme provided for grants of threequarters of the cost, the farmers finding the other quarter.  In the case of link roads which serve persons other than the farmers whose lands adjoin the road, more favourable terms were available.  This arrangement continued until June, 1950, when sliding scale terms were introduced, a 95 per cent. grant being available for farmers whose average land valuation was below £6 and 75 per cent. grants being made available to farmers with an average valuation of £18 and over.  In 1956 and 1957, however, adequate provision was not made to finance the contributory scheme on this basis.  The issue of new offers of grants was stopped in August, 1956, and the receipt of new applications had to be suspended in September, 1956.  Moreover, only £150,000 was provided for this service in the Printed Estimates for 1957/58.</P>
    <P>The new administration decided in July, 1957, to make additional State funds available for this important scheme.  It was considered that there should also be some increase in the scale of contributions from the benefiting landholders, as the benefits accruing to these landholders from the works were sufficiently good to admit of an increase in the rates without causing hardship.  With effect as from the 20th July, 1957, the minimum contribution is now 10 per cent. instead of 5 per cent.  The 25 per cent. contribution applies to farmers with an average land valuation of between £15 and £18, instead of to those with an average land valuation of £18 and over, as was formerly the case. Proportionate increases were made also in the case of farmers whose average valuations ranged between £6 (10 per cent. contribution) and £15.  Farmers with an average valuation of between £50 and £100 now pay 40 per cent. of the cost and, in cases where the average land valuation is over £100, the State pays half the <Col N="476" /> cost and the benefiting farmers the other half.</P>
    <P>The original provision for this service in 1957/58 was £150,000.  In view of the additional funds made available to the Special Employment Schemes Office that year, we were authorised to enter into new commitments amounting to £215,000, and 798 schemes to absorb the full amount were duly authorised.  The actual expenditure was £194,654.  £200,000 was provided for this service in 1958/59 and 771 schemes, costing £199,988, were duly authorised.  The expenditure, however, will, it is estimated, amount to only £181,000.  The very bad weather in the summer of 1958 and the fact that some of our engineering staff in the winter had to be diverted to work on Gaeltacht schemes contributed to the slow progress and the fact that the balance of almost £20,000 was not expended.  A provision of £200,000 is again being made available for this service in 1959/60.</P>
    <P>The provision for miscellaneous schemes was £15,000 in 1957/58 and 1958/59, and this figure has been repeated for 1959/60.  The expenditure last year, it is estimated, amounted only to about £8,000.  This subhead is required to meet expenditure on minor marine works, towards the cost of which county councils are required to contribute and which they are required to maintain on completion.  Owing to a number of circumstances, only about £5,000 was spent last year.  The subhead also finances archaeological excavations and a few other miscellaneous schemes such as sportsfields.  The expenditure on archaeological excavations last year amounted only to approximately £1,500 in respect of works at Rear Cross, County Tipperary, Drombeg, County Cork, Glendalough, County Wicklow and Dalkey Island, County Dublin.  The International Archaeological Convention in Hamburg in 1958 interfered with the programme originally proposed.  This year, it is anticipated excavation work will be resumed in Tara and the expenditure at this and other centres will, it is expected, amount to £2,500.  It is hoped also to increase the expenditure on minor marine works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The Appropriation-in-Aid subhead is made up almost entirely of the contributions in respect of the Rural Improvements Scheme, which amounted last year to £32,800.  It also includes receipts in respect of works on privately owned bogs, the county councils' contributions towards the cost of minor marine works and the sale of surplus stores.  The amount in the Estimates for 1957/58 and 1958/59 was £30,000.  The total amount realised last year exceeded £34,000 and £35,000 is included in this year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>Apart from the works financed from Vote 10, the Special Employment Schemes Office acts as the agent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the carrying out of development works to facilitate the output of turf for the four hand-won turf-fired generating stations at Caherciveen, County Kerry, Miltown Malbay, County Clare, Screeb, County Galway, and Gweedore, County Donegal.  These works are financed from an allocation of £80,000 made available to the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the National Development Fund, and expenditure amounting to approximately £12,000 was undertaken by the Special Employment Schemes Office on these schemes last year.  In addition, the Special Employment Schemes Office acts as agent for the Minister for the Gaeltacht in respect of the carrying out of accommodation road works in Gaeltacht areas, financed from the Vote of that Department.  Last year was the first year in which these works were undertaken and schemes costing £40,600 were authorised for execution. The expenditure on these schemes amounted to approximately £24,000. The preparation of estimates of works exceeding £40,000 and the supervision of approximately £24,000 worth of these works took up a certain amount of the time of the engineering staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office and was, as already stated, a contributory cause of the failure to expend the full sum available for the Rural Improvements Scheme.  The expenditure for the turf-fired generating stations and Gaeltacht schemes will, of course, be accounted for in the Votes of the Minister for Industry and <Col N="478" /> Commerce and the Minister for the Gaeltacht respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I did not contemplate having to speak first. There are, however, a few matters I should like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  First of all, I want to refer to the grants which are given to urban areas for the alleviation of unemployment during the winter.  The sum in relation to the total Estimate is quite a formidable amount. As the Parliamentary Secretary explains from time to time, the grant is made in relation to the number of unemployed in the previous January.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the grant is to relieve unemployment.  I do not know whether or not that purpose is achieved or fulfilled.  I am not now making any allegation against the Parliamentary Secretary, but I should like information on one particular matter.  It has come to my notice from time to time that all the moneys granted are not spent.  In this connection, neither I nor anybody else can take either the Government or the Parliamentary Secretary to task.  I may be wrong in this and that is why I have asked for guidance from the Parliamentary Secretary. There have been occasions&mdash;not this year, but for many years past&mdash;upon which local authorities did not use up all the moneys granted to them for the relief of unemployment.  In circumstances in which we have, and have had over the years, so many unemployed that is a bad situation.</P>
      <P>I know many urban areas&mdash;this happened during the two periods in office of the inter-Party Government as well as during the periods in office of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;which were given grants to relieve unemployment and which did not fully utilise those grants.  Now, that is a fact.  My criticism, therefore, is not directed to the Government or the Parliamentary Secretary but to the local authorities whose officials are too lazy&mdash;I want to withdraw the word &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;; let me say rather &ldquo;reluctant&rdquo;&mdash;to prepare schemes and have them approved by the local authorities and by the Department of Local Government to relieve unemployment for which purpose certain moneys are provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My criticism now is that moneys given in this Vote are not fully used, and there are enough people drawing unemployment assistance who could very well be employed in laying footpaths, removing corners and doing work which will benefit a particular area, but will primarily relieve unemployment.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could give some information on that point. Perhaps he could say whether the situation has obtained this year or last year or during his term of office. Will he try to see that all the moneys so provided will be spent in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the most important comments I wish to make on this section of the Vote.  The money provided in it represents about 25 per cent. of the total vote.  I cannot say that I am well versed in bog development or any of the other schemes provided for here, but it is very important that these moneys should be spent.  I know that on occasion local authorities have sought and got permission from the Parliamentary Secretary to carry their schemes over <Col N="480" /> the 31st March.  In that way, they can expend any balance unexpended at 31st March, but in many cases, as I have said, I know that money has not been spent by urban authorities but returned to the Department, from places where there is a big unemployment problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this is a matter on which I should say something this evening, and my first duty is to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department on the very useful money they have made available to local authorities.  Deputy Corish suggested that some local authorities have failed to spend the money allocated to them and I suppose there is some reason for that.  It may be that a local contribution is expected.  That may be the reason, but I fail to understand why any responsible local authority should not avail of it.</P>
      <P>In the constituency I represent, Limerick, we have both a rural and an urban unemployment problem.  This is very useful money and we in Limerick Corporation look forward to it every year, because owing to the extension of the borough boundary some years ago, we have very many problems in relation to roads and footpaths.  That work has been done so far as funds were available and the Corporation were very willing at all times, when we knew what money was being placed at our disposal, to give an allocation.  The records of the Department will prove that we in Limerick city have availed fully of the money allocated.  As a result, we have carried out schemes which the Department approved and which were submitted to our engineers in Limerick Corporation.  We have now, to a great extent, solved many of the problems which members of the Corporation are continually asked to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the problem of the provision of housing is very often left to the local authority.  It is debatable at times as to whether or not they are responsible, but very often it has to be agreed between the manager and the people concerned that the Corporation will do some part of the work in the improvement of roads or paths.  In the case of rural improvement <Col N="481" /> schemes, so far as I am aware, that money has been availed of also. The minor employment schemes, too, are most useful because very often we find a farmer living in a backward part of the country, far from the public road, who has been neglected for years. Some of these people are being relieved and, while they all cannot be helped, some very, very useful work is being done.</P>
    <P>My approaches to the officials of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and letters I have had cause to write to them, I must say, have always been received with courtesy, encouragement and help.  It is only right that I should place that on record when this Vote is before the House.  In regard to bog schemes, in my constituency, there is not a very big bog problem but there is some problem.  I can say we do the best we possibly can to help those people who save their own turf and that many useful roads have been built by reason of the allocation of these funds.</P>
    <P>Rural improvement schemes are, to my mind, one of the big necessities of to-day.  In Limerick anyway, owing to the increased number of roads, the county council have, from time to time, been compelled to restrict the amount of money spent on the roads.  To my mind, the rural improvement schemes are, to a great extent, a solution when the farmers are willing to co-operate in carrying out the work.  If farmers can come to terms with the Department, they will be doing some very useful work.  I have in mind many cases where farmers come to me and ask can work be done through the Department, and I always look at the Vote to see how much money is available.  I know how difficult it is to allocate money over the Twenty-Six Counties to do all the jobs that are expected to be done in any year.  I do not wish to say any more on that.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will be very glad because of the useful employment that is given under those headings.  It is most useful because it is work that can be done at a slack time of the year, when work is not available on the land and at a time when farmers are free to <Col N="482" /> help in the schemes that are so much needed in their own localities.  I think far too much demand is being made on local authorities and on the Government Departments concerned, and it would be well if we public representatives, when confronted with these problems, would meet people in their own localities and impress upon them that it is expected of them that they do a little of the work on their own or, at least, bear reasonable costs.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of the Department on the great work they have been doing in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the fine and comprehensive statement he has made in introducing this Vote.  There are just one or two points I want to mention in connection with it, one of which comes under the heading of minor employment schemes.  In the western areas, and I presume in every other area where such schemes are in operation, from time to time, application forms are filled asking for road repair work and, at the same time, grants are made available in conjunction with local authorities for small piers or slips at certain seaside places where they are necessary for the landing of seaweed or the harbouring of boats.  It is wrong that where such piers or slips are built, local farmers or boatmen are unable to reach them with their horses and carts or small lorries, as the case may be, and I think that when a pier or slip is built, the Department should make sure to put the road leading to that pier into proper repair, if not in the year in which the slip is built, then in the year following. Some of the piers in the West cannot be used at the present time for the landing of seaweed because the roads leading to them are in such a bad <Col N="483" /> state of repair.  They should be given more attention.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, I received a complaint with regard to the inspection of a road.  I do not know whether I was being told the truth or whether I was being told a falsehood, but there is no harm in mentioning it.  It was a case in which a road had been applied for and when the inspector or engineer made his visit he did not call on the persons whose names were on the application, and he was not given the proper information.  If that is so, I sincerely hope it will not happen again in the future.</P>
      <P>There should be more co-operation between local authorities and the Department.  Speaking for my own local authority, if there was some co-operation to see that roads were made to a width of 12 or 14 feet, the local authority would be satisfied to take charge of them.  If that is not done, the road is left in charge of the Department and, after two or three years, it falls into bad repair again.  Where new roads are made, or where roads into villages are repaired, if they were made to a width of 12 feet between fences, I think that the local authorities concerned would be satisfied to take them over and maintain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few questions to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, but, before I do so, I should like to say how much I regret that this Vote is not much larger, not because that is an accusation against the Government for not making it more, but on general principles.  Both the previous Government and the present Government have made the mistake of not devoting money to work that can be carried out under this Vote, rather than using money to pay unemployment assistance.  The vast amount of money being used to pay out doles and unemployment assistance is, to my mind, demoralising, when men in this country are willing and anxious to work, and when the work is there waiting to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would much rather see this Vote doubled, and a corresponding reduction made in unemployment assistance, because I believe the dignity of employment <Col N="484" /> is an essential thing to give to our people and, from my knowledge of our ordinary working people, they would much prefer to do hard, honest work and to be paid a reasonable rate, rather than exist on doles and pittances on which they are expected to keep alive during long periods of unemployment.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment in urban areas under the Emergency Schemes Vote, I should like to ask if there is a time limit within which this work should be carried out?  The local authority of which I am a member are engaged in a continuous project of running a sea wall along the sea front, with the double aim of protecting the urban area from erosion and, at the same time, providing tourist facilities such as a promenade. Unfortunately, that work has been done during the winter months, at a period when the seas are rough and the weather is inclement.  Our main trouble is very heavy seas and much of the value of the work is ruined on occasion by the seas coming in.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the need for having employment schemes at a time when work is scarce, but I would suggest that applies more to rural areas than to urban areas.  In urban areas, the difference between unemployment in winter and summer is not so very great, and I would suggest that local authorities should be permitted to use this money during a period of the year when they thought best to use it, when the same value would be got from the point of view of giving employment, but when the productive value of the work would be considerably increased.  I am not certain, but I have a feeling that there is a period laid down by the Department in which the work has to be carried out.  Primarily, as far as I know, the Department limits the work to the period from December to the following April and, as we all know, that is the worst period for carrying out the type of work I am speaking of now.</P>
    <P>There is another question in regard to a farmer who applies for a grant under the rural improvement scheme to improve a road leading to his property. In many cases farmers who either have <Col N="485" /> land in that vicinity or use the place are requested to join with him in the application.  In a case, the particulars of which I have with me, there are four or five farmers using a roadway over which a bridge is needed to make it available to the farmers in the area. One farmer is anxious to get the work done but the others refuse to join with him in signing the form primarily because they are afraid of having to pay a contribution.  Although this farmer is quite willing to put up the necessary share required by the Department he is loath to give the names of the other farmers seeing that they have refused to join with him.  He is prepared to pay the whole sum required.</P>
    <P>Because of failure to get any other farmer using that boreen to join with him the Department turned down his request some six years ago.  He asked me to make representations to the Parliamentary Secretary, and I intend to do that.  However, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say when he is replying if it is correct that, even though he is prepared to put up the amount of money required by the Department, he must lose the benefit of the scheme because his fellow farmers will not co-operate with him.</P>
    <P>This Vote is of great value in keeping our unemployed engaged on necessary work.  Any money spent on work of this type is useful and good for the morale of the people.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Kyne has said, much useful work can be done through the rural improvements scheme and minor employment schemes.  Not alone is it possible to relieve unemployment but also to provide the amenities which these schemes are intended to make available.  By way of rural improvement schemes, much useful work might be done on roadways leading to farms.  Sometimes the work is hampered where one person may be unwilling for one reason or another&mdash;for instance, being unable to make a contribution or not being neighbourly in the matter.  It is a pity that schemes cannot be carried out in such cases where the requirement is that two or more people must join in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a number of roads <Col N="486" /> which county councils are loath to take over because perhaps they are too narrow or in a bad state of repair. If there could be some co-operation with the Department of Local Government in relation to the matter which would secure that the local occupants of the land through which these roads run would contribute their share, a solution to the problem might be reached.</P>
    <P>In relation to the people employed in these schemes, employment is given by reference to the Employment Office. As regards the position of overseer for such schemes, where unemployed people are on the list and where the local engineer considers them suitable, they ought to be considered for the work of overseer as well.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the amount of money provided for these schemes is up to the standard of previous years. There is one point to which I wish to draw attention in connection with the minor employment schemes in certain electoral districts.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned 400 over 12 counties. In my constituency there are certain places which might be included in these electoral districts but which for one reason or another do not seem to have come into the reckoning.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum allocated for these works from 1956-57 to 1959-60, is very much the same.  There is a slight drop this year as compared with last year.  The rural improvements schemes are about the best of the various schemes.  When people have to subscribe towards the local contribution required they expect to get work on the scheme, whereas the rules only allow those drawing unemployment assistance to qualify for work. I would suggest that where a sufficient number of people are not drawing unemployment assistance in the particular area those who contributed should get preference when extra men are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it is the experience of all Deputies that when work is being done under a rural improvements scheme some of those employed idle at the work.  Farmers do not like to see <Col N="487" /> that when they have contributed their share towards carrying it out.  Our minor relief schemes people also, drawing unemployment assistance, have the idea that that money is just given to them to help them over a period.  The work is generally carried out sometime before Christmas.  It would do them good if they got a reminder to work harder.  It is not easy for the gangers to get them to do that but if the gangers were sure that the engineers of the Special Employment Schemes Office and the local engineers were behind them, it should be possible to get the employees to work a little harder on those schemes.  I am sure it has been the experience that these works have not always been carried out very efficiently and that some of the money is wasted.</P>
    <P>I would make a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with bog development.  In the Cahirciveen area people have good turf for the supply of the turf generating stations and I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary that, in the very near future, he would have an inspection carried out of the various roads in areas where a great deal of turf was cut last year.  Because of the wet year that turf is only drying now and the people cannot bring it out because of the condition of the roads. I could give the names of several roads to the Special Employment Schemes Office, but I am sure they have a list already.  If any money is being made available in the near future for bog development and for these roads, I trust that the most essential reads will be attended to first, especially roads to districts were people cut turf for the generating station.</P>
    <P>It would be well if people who work on these schemes would work a little harder and that perhaps the gangers concerned would see to it.  I feel sure that the engineers on their part would wish that the workers would do something better.  The one grievance of people who contribute money, especially, and even of people who expect roads to be done where there are a certain number of unemployed, that is, <Col N="488" /> under a minor relief scheme, is that the money allocated is not well spent.  I am sure the engineers of the Department and all concerned are doing their best to carry out the various schemes and they are very useful.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by two previous speakers to the county council taking over roads when they are improved under a rural improvements scheme, especially.  I am sure some councils do that.  We do it in Kerry. We have to be very careful because we have a big mileage of roads.  Some people feel that once the road is repaired, the council should take it over. You can always, a couple of years afterwards, get a supplementary grant to keep the road in good repair.  I am sure that that work would be carried out better under a rural improvements scheme than under the county council.</P>
    <P>Several of these roads in remote areas were once known as by-roads or accommodation roads.  It is well known that the money allocated by the county council is very small and that stewards, naturally, do not give the attention to these roads which they should.  I do not know that it would be well in all cases that the council should take them over when they have been improved under a rural improvements scheme. The council, on the advice of their county engineers, have always, I am sure, acted wisely in those cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the increased provision for rural improvements schemes.  The provision for bog development is down somewhat.  For rural Deputies, I think the most important matter is the provision for rural improvement schemes, which has been increased this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not agree with Deputy Palmer that men employed on such schemes are not working as hard they should.  I think they are.  I may be wrong&mdash;I am not an engineer or a professional man&mdash;but I think the Department's engineers are inclined to overestimate the amount needed for schemes.  It frequently happens that there is a surplus of money when a scheme has been completed.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to <Col N="489" /> clear the air with regard to that matter. I feel it is the policy of engineers to over-estimate the amount of money required for schemes, with, as a result, an effect on the local contribution.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a certain flaw which should be rectified.  I shall cite an instance.  A scheme may get the approval of the Department from A to B.  A certain amount of money is being provided under a rural improvement scheme.  From B to C, there is an entrance to a single house.  At present, in the Office of Public Works, even if it comes under a rural improvement scheme, the usual reply is that it would be excessive to continue the road into that house.  They are prepared to make the road from A to B; yet from B to C may be the more important part.</P>
    <P>It frequently happens that it is the family living at the C end of the line that makes the highest contribution and yet no provision is made for them. What happens then?  It is all State money.  Having been refused a rural improvement scheme, they can apply for a farm buildings scheme and get a grant of about 10/- a perch to make a road by providing that they will do the work themselves.  The grant of 10/- per perch has some value in providing the material.  I feel that that system is very wrong.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently in my district where a man had no entrance to his farm.  He has only a small farm and keeps nine cows.  He has been granted permission by a sympathetic farmer to enter through his land.  The Office of Public Works are prepared to give £261, provided he puts up £81.  He is prepared to do that.  They intend to make the road only from the public road to the boundary of his farm which means he will still be three quarters of a mile away from his house and no provision is made to enable him to get into his dwelling-house.  That is unfair. I cannot understand why that should be the policy of the Department.  He is prepared to put up money with the others.  A farmer has given him free access from the road.  He has only a small farm and he has a young family. The road will go only as far as his boundary.  Then, from his own resources, he will have to make a road <Col N="490" /> right into his farm.  He can apply for a farm building scheme grant and he will get 10/- a perch.  It is all public money.  I do not see why the Department should do the job from A to B and then stop at bringing the road to C.</P>
    <P>I think the engineers are excessive in their calculations.  I fear they are overestimating the cost.  On various occasions, I have inquired into the matter. The answer we get is that many factors have to be taken into account, such as the increase in the cost of materials, increased wages, and so on.  I submit that many local factors should be taken into consideration against that.  Sometimes materials are readily available for particular work.  Sometimes a certain type of quarry is at hand which yields material suitable for road-making, whereas in other cases, the material has to be drawn a long distance.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to bring before the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the method of recruitment.  Twelve months or two years ago we felt very upset because of the decision of his Department to take this type of work away from the councils and we were sceptical about what the result might be.  We were satisfied with the way the work was being done and the manner in which they were recruiting labour.  Since the Department has taken it over, we have had no cause to complain except in one direction into which I have made many inquiries and about which I should like a check up.</P>
    <P>If a job comes up in a local area, I understand the function and the business of the engineer in charge of the district is to go to the labour exchange where he will get a list of the people unemployed in that particular town-land, or in adjoining townlands.  As far as I understand the managers of the labour exchanges are instructed to give the list of unemployed in order of merit, so far as dependants are concerned. So far as West Limerick, which I represent, is concerned, I found that the recruitment was not taken in that order.  There are men who have dependants and who are placed in numerical order for recruitment but somebody from the tail-end of the list, and who <Col N="491" /> has no dependants, may be recruited instead of those at the head of the list.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should be very rigid about the method of recruitment and see that it should be carried out according to the amount of unemployment assistance, and that those in receipt of the highest amount of unemployment assistance should be recruited in that order.  There should be no picking out of people who are down on the list and who probably have only one or two dependants, while workers with a greater number of dependants are left on the dole.  I had occasion to mention this point on another occasion to the Parliamentary Secretary and now that we have the opportunity, I am taking advantage of this Estimate to bring it home again. We have a certain amount of unrest and dissatisfaction in this respect and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that recruitment is carried out in the order of merit without fear or favour, without any deviation and just in the order found on the register of unemployed.</P>
    <P>I should like again to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the point I made about houses which are isolated. I cannot understand why his Department cannot spend sufficient money to do a good job rather than leave 400, 500, or 600 yards or a half a mile undone.  It is all State money.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Carew, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing a very special word of thanks to the officials in this Department.  On both sides of the House we can safely say that they are most courteous and co-operative in every way.  I am glad to see that the Vote has been increased and, if it were possible, I should like to see it doubled.  I believe, with Deputy Carew and Deputy Palmer, that it is the next best thing we can do to save the ratepaying community in the various counties in providing for roads which over the generations have been sadly neglected.  With those few points, I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every good luck in his work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the tribute they paid to the Special <Col N="492" /> Employment Schemes Office.  From my own experience over a number of years that tribute is well deserved.  Perhaps I would have been a little more pleased if it had been tempered with a little leavening of criticism because unadulterated praise, I am afraid, is bad for them.</P>
      <P>I do not know that anything of a serious nature has been raised which would require special attention.  Certain questions like the recruitment of labour for rural employment schemes and the type of schemes accepted by the Office from local authorities were mentioned.  There are problems such as that which was last mentioned by Deputy Collins, the problem of the man at the end of the road.  These are typical problems that we come up against in the Office.</P>
      <P>It is true that we had some difficulty in recent years in getting a sufficient number of schemes from local authorities to absorb the entire allocation but last year, only Dublin, I think, fell short and the sum by which they fell short was comparatively small.  Arising from that, I should like to tell Deputy Kyne that the works must be completed before the end of the financial year or the money is forfeited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you not agree that you lose the productive content?  That is what I am putting to the Parliamentary Secretary, that he should use his influence to change that system if it does not require legislation.  I do not know if it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have three categories of relief schemes, minor employment schemes, urban employment schemes and rural employment schemes.  If the Deputy will listen, I shall explain it in my way.  We have minor employment schemes which are <Col N="493" /> confined to what are generally described as the twelve congested district counties and they are done in the winter time.  We have urban employment schemes which are done in the areas that are badly off and which are referred to in my statement.  We have rural employment schemes, for which there is a sum of £35,000, done in areas of populations of 200 and up to urban standards.  These are three categories of relief schemes and they are done in the winter time.</P>
      <P>The other schemes are the rural improvement schemes which apply to the whole country but can be availed of in the M.E.S. districts as well as outside. Then we have bog development schemes which do not go into M.E.S. districts.  They are usually done in the summer time.  Neither a rural improvement scheme nor a bog development scheme is regarded as an employment scheme, but nevertheless the officials in charge must recruit the labour from the labour exchange.</P>
      <P>I come now to another point raised. If there are not a sufficient number of unemployment assistance men or of unemployment assistance men plus unemployment insurance men, then, and only then, can the engineer go outside to recruit labour.  He then has two categories from which he can supplement the complement of people available from the unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance lists. They are residents of the road, or those not entitled to unemployment assistance payments who have registered for employment.  It is only after he has exhausted the unemployment assistance and the unemployment insurance lists that he can go outside.  Commonsense is applied to the limit beyond which the engineer may not go in his recruiting. We do not want to have men travelling too long distances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case which Deputy Collins quoted seems to be a very hard one.  A man is prepared to put up £81.  He is the odd man out in a rural improvement scheme.  Again, I am afraid it is a question of the financial limitations under which we are operating.  As Deputy Collins himself pointed out, there is the farm improvement scheme. I am afraid there is no way out of <Col N="494" /> that difficulty, except, of course, a considerable increase in the amount of money placed at the disposal of the Office.  In this connection, I should say that the signatures are not necessary. One person can put up all the money for a rural improvement scheme, but the road must serve a minimum of two householders.  A work that cannot be done in the winter time is not looked upon as an employment scheme in the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>In view of the drop in the number of registered unemployed and also for the reasons set out in the economic development document produced by the Department for Finance, I think we have done well enough in the Office in maintaining, in the main, the sums given last year.  Therefore, I believe we should be able to confer proportionately greater benefit on those entitled to employment.</P>
    <P>One Deputy after another repeated the same type of difficulty.  If I have left out any point, I certainly shall undertake to communicate with any Deputy whose query I have not dealt with.  With regard to Deputy Palmer's inquiry about the Caherciveen turf generating station, I suggest to him that he get in touch with the supervisor of the station in regard to making a grant available for the repair of a bog road serving that station.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Geoghegan's question about the approach road to slips and piers, for a number of years, it has been the practice to include in the grant for the improvement of such structures as piers and slips a sum to cover also improvement of the approach roads.</P>

      <P>For years, there was a problem in the four county boroughs.  Perhaps I should make an honourable exception of Waterford; they were not too bad.  There was a problem in the county boroughs of finding acceptable schemes.  By that, I mean schemes with a sufficiently high labour content.  When moneys of this kind are made available to local authorities, there is a temptation to do schemes they would not do out of their own resources, if they had to bear the full cost themselves.  In the Special Employment Schemes Office, we have to keep a check on these schemes to ensure that they will serve the main purpose for which the money is given, namely, to relieve unemployment. But, as Deputy Corish pointed out, the selection is for the local authorities, and they come to us through the Department of Local Government.  There is constant liaison between the Special Employment Schemes Office and the Department of Local Government in the matter.  The position is satisfactory this year and is likely to continue so.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I would make this suggestion to Deputies.  Every Deputy in his travels through his constituency may come across in towns problems of a sort that cannot be dealt with in the ordinary way by the local authority.  We are talking about removing eyesores in order to beautify the country and improve our tourist amenities.  Here is an outlet for some of this expenditure.  When speaking in this way on that matter, I want to assure the House I am expressing very largely a personal opinion.  I believe that what I say has to be qualified by the experience of the Local Government Department and the Special Employment Schemes Office.  In any event, that does not inhibit me from asking Deputies, particularly those from urban areas, to keep an eye out for this type of outlet for the expenditure of urban employment schemes moneys.</P>

    <P>The Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare shows a net decrease of £3,200.  There is an increase of £26,000 in the provision under Subhead A of the Vote as compared with the previous year. This is due to increases in remuneration following from or arising out of certain agreements reached under conciliation and arbitration machinery for which no provision had been made in the previous year's Vote.</P>
    <P>Deputies' attention is particularly drawn to the fact that the increase in the Subhead for 1959-60 would have been much higher but for savings resulting from the suppression of a net total of 37 posts in furtherance of the Department's policy of securing economy in administration costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> The provision for Telegrams, Telephones, Postal Expenses etc.  under Subhead D is £20,000 higher than the corresponding provision in 1958-59. The increase arises wholly on postal expenses in connection with social insurance and is mainly the result of a revised apportionment between the Social Insurance Fund and voted moneys of the Department's expenses on postage.  Postal expenses arising from the Social Insurance Scheme are borne by the Social Insurance Fund while the other postal services for the Department of Social Welfare are provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs without charge in the normal way.  The Social Insurance postal expenses provided for in Subhead D are met from this Vote in the first instance but are recoverable in full from the Social Insurance Fund. Consequently, the net sum being provided in the Estimate for this Vote is not affected by the fact that an extra £20,000 is required for these expenses in 1959-60.</P>
    <P>All the expenses incurred by the Department in administering the scheme of social insurance are repayable by the Social Insurance Fund and are brought to credit of this Vote as appropriations in aid.  The estimated total receipts from the Fund are £36,000 higher than the corresponding provision for the previous year.  The increase is due partly to the extra provision for postal expenses which I have just explained and partly to the social insurance scheme's share of the increases in remuneration already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £4,372,000 for Social Insurance for 1959-60 is £56,000 less than the Vote for 1958-59 when the Supplementary Estimate of £177,000 in 1958-59 is taken into account.  The increase of £121,000 shown in the Estimate Volume is not now correct; the volume was printed before the Supplementary Estimate was passed.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £56,000, as compared with the previous year, occurs on Subhead A of the Vote and is the result of certain adjustments which were made in the amount of the <Col N="499" /> Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund in 1958-59 and which do not arise in the estimate for 1959-60. I shall refer briefly to those adjustments later on.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the difference between the expenditure and income of the Social Insurance Fund in each year is made good by the Exchequer, in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 (9) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  The sum so required to balance the Fund's expenditure and income, after allowing for any necessary adjustments&mdash;for example, in respect of prior years&mdash;is provided in Subhead A of this Vote.</P>
    <P>It so happens that the excess of the expenditure of the Fund over its income in 1959-60, as now estimated, is exactly the same as the excess provided for in 1958-59 (as revised by the Supplementary Estimate for that year). This occurs despite some variations, which I shall mention later, in the figures making up the estimated excesses in the two years.</P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure of the Fund for 1959-60 is £10,807,000, an increase of £117,000 on the provision for 1958-59.  On the income side it is expected that £6,473,000 will come to hand during 1959-60.  The increase which this last figure represents over the estimated income for 1958-59 is also £117,000.</P>
    <P>The Fund expenditure of £10,807,000 is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The income of the Fund for 1959-60 is estimated at £6,473,000.  It consists of £5,900,000 from employment contributions and £573,000 in income from investments of the Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> The difference between the estimated expenditure of £10,807,000 and the income of £6,473,000, that is £4,334,000, is the sum to be provided by the Exchequer under Section 39 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to make good the deficit on the working of the Social Insurance Fund in 1959-60.</P>
    <P>As I have already remarked, the estimated excess of expenditure over income of the Fund, in 1959-60, namely, £4,334,000, is the same as that estimated for 1958-59.  The amount provided in Subhead A of the Estimate for 1959-60 is, nevertheless, £56,000 less than the provision for 1958-59. The explanation of the decrease is that the Supplementary Estimate for 1958-59 provided for two adjustments&mdash; firstly, a sum of £44,000 to adjust an underdraw from the Exchequer in 1957-58, and secondly, a sum of £12,000 in final discharge of State grant payable under the former National Health Insurance Scheme.</P>
    <P>There are variations, as compared with provisions for the previous year, in some of the items of expenditure and income of the Fund for 1959-60.</P>
    <P>The provision for disability benefit is £37,000 higher than in the previous year.  In this connection it is estimated that disability benefit for the extra persons in insurance resulting from the raising last December of the remuneration limit for compulsory insurance from £600 to £800 per annum will cost about £40,000 more in 1959-60 than in 1958-59.</P>
    <P>Small increases, totalling £10,000 in all, are provided for in the estimates for Maternity Benefits and Marriage Grant.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £74,000 in the provision for Widows' and Orphans' (Contributory) Pensions. The normal trend in this service is for the numbers of contributory pensions to increase from year to year.</P>
    <P>Administration costs incurred by the various Departments in connection with the scheme of social insurance which are borne by the Social Insurance Fund will, it is estimated, be approximately £30,000 higher than the estimate for the previous year.  The <Col N="501" /> increase, which occurs principally in the Department of Social Welfare, is mainly due to the Civil Service pay increases and the higher charges against the Fund for postal expenses which I adverted to earlier.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment benefit it is expected that the position in 1959-60 will continue to improve; the sum provided for 1959-60 is £34,000 less than the provision for the previous year.</P>
    <P>On the income side of the Social Insurance Fund, the only variation of consequence is in the expected income from employment contributions, which is put at £5,900,000, an increase of £116,000 on the estimate for 1958-59. This increase is largely attributable to the raising of the insurance remuneration limit to £800 per annum at the end of December last.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for Social Assistance&mdash;£20,481,000&mdash;is £80,000 lower than the Vote for the previous year.</P>
    <P>The provision of £7,126,000 for Children's Allowances is £31,000 higher than the estimate for 1958-59. The increase is based on the rising expenditure experience in recent years and is due to an upward trend in the number of children in respect of whom allowances are payable.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is a reduction of £97,000 in the provision for Widows' and Orphans' Non-Contributory Pensions.  This reflects the normal downward trend in expenditure on this service.  I should perhaps point out again that the trend of expenditure on the corresponding contributory scheme is upward.</P>
    <P>There are small decreases on other subheads amounting to £2,000 in all. The principal one is a reduction of £1,500 in the estimate for Grants under the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, resulting largely from economies in administration by the local authorities providing the meals.</P>
    <P>The variations I have mentioned add up to a net decrease of £68,000. The balance of the £80,000 decrease shown by the total net Estimate for Social Assistance is accounted for by expected increases totalling £12,000 in Appropriations in Aid.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the remaining five <Col N="502" /> Subheads of the Vote for Social Assistance show no variation.  These Subheads are A, C, F, H and I, covering Old Age Pensions, Unemployment Assistance, Gaeltacht School Meals and the Fuel and Footwear Schemes respectively.</P>

      <P>This motion deals with the Employment Period Order which was made this year&mdash;I think some time in March.  It was an Order designed to exclude recipients of unemployment assistance, who were resident outside the county or other boroughs, urban districts or towns and who were occupants of land the valuation of which exceeds £4, from continuing to draw unemployment assistance within a certain period.  When the Employment Period Order was first introduced it was done, as far as I know, on the assumption that during that period, the spring-summer period, there was sufficient employment in the rural areas to absorb all or most of those who receive unemployment assistance.  The period usually was from the second Tuesday in March to the second last Tuesday in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may not be correct in the actual <Col N="503" /> days of the week but perhaps if I give examples it will demonstrate the change in the last two years.  In 1956 during the period 14th March to the 23rd October persons resident outside county boroughs or urban districts or towns, and who are occupiers of land the valuation of which exceeded £4, were debarred from receiving unemployment assistance.  In 1957 the Employment Period Order was made embracing the period from the second Tuesday in March to the second last Tuesday in October, from the 13th of March to the 22nd October.</P>
    <P>That has been the pattern for many years but for some extraordinary reason when the present Minister for Social Welfare assumed office he decided to extend the period by approximately two weeks.  That meant that for a further two weeks, the people I have described in the rural areas were debarred from receiving unemployment assistance.  Last year the Minister signed an Employment Period Order to cover the period 12th March, to the 4th November.  There were questions about it in the Dáil last year but I do not think anybody was satisfied, neither the questioner nor the Minister for Social Welfare.  I suppose that can be explained by the fact that the Minister was Deputy MacEntee and the questioner was Deputy Norton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess it was allowed to slip by last year.  We get so many Orders and Acts of Parliament in different stages that I must confess I overlooked scrutinising the Employment Period Order.  If I had done so, I would have discovered that the period had been extended last year by two weeks.  This year I did take particular notice and discovered that the Minister had done the same thing and had extended the period for two weeks beyond what it had been for years past, except in 1958.  The Order this year covers the period from 11th March to the 3rd November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be satisfied if the Minister gave a reasonable explanation.  I shall try to make a reasonable case as to why the Order should be annulled. <Col N="504" /> Although I may be wrong, I think the original idea was that men in rural areas should not draw unemployment assistance, on the assumption that there was sufficient employment in the rural areas during that period of spring, summer and beginning of autumn.  These are people entirely confined to rural areas who have certain valuations.  I see no reason why at this time, or indeed last year, the Employment Period Order should be extended in view of the fact that there is less and less employment on the land.</P>
    <P>Last year we were told many times in the debate on the Budget that according to the Government's own figures employment in agriculture fell by 4,000 in 1958 and that employment in construction work fell by 6,000, a total of 10,000 fewer people employed in agriculture and construction work. We can say that the 4,000 people unemployed in agriculture were in rural areas.  I do not want to mislead the House or try to pretend that the 6,000 at work in construction were people formerly employed in rural areas.  Construction work embraces housebuilding, road work, drainage and work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Of these 6,000, a substantial number were rural workers.</P>
    <P>Rural work generally has greatly declined in the past few years, as indeed it has in the past 10 or 15 years. We have a situation where there is less work in agriculture, on roads, in cottage building and repairs and I think we are all forced to admit there is less harvest work at present.  The introduction of the combined harvester and other modern, up-to-date and efficient agricultural machinery has removed the necessity for engaging the usual number of harvest workers. More is the pity that something cannot be done about this.  I know it cannot be discussed in this debate but it is something that has been responsible for too much unemployment in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>If more work were available there would be greater justification for the extension of the Employment Period Order but to extend it from the second last Tuesday in October, approximately, to November is, in my opinion, <Col N="505" /> a shabby trick to play on those people dependent on unemployment assistance. October-November is a very lean period; it is the beginning of winter and these people with the small allowances which they get as unemployment assistance must use the money to buy clothes or other necessities.  It is galling to them to think that this year, as last year, they must go a further two weeks before they can get unemployment assistance, if they are qualified to get it.  It means that in the gloom of October and early November they become desperate and I think I do not exaggerate if I say that, in an effort to provide for themselves and their families, they will be very much tempted to emigrate to Britain in order to get a job at the beginning of the winter to tide them over the period.  As far as I know these people have no means whatsoever to fall back on.</P>
    <P>The local authorities take their line from the Minister.  If the Minister is justified in debarring these people from unemployment assistance during that particular period, the local authorities will feel justified in refusing them home assistance or any of the maintenance allowances for which local authorities are responsible.  The only way then in which these people can get home assistance, or some other allowance, is by producing a medical certificate and doctors are reluctant to give certificates merely for the purpose of enabling people to get allowances. Even when allowances are given, they are very meagre.  The usual rate is 10/- to £1.  I do not think anybody would contend that that is adequate, even for the purchase of food, for any of these people who are debarred from drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this saving is worth while.  In the introductory statement the Parliamentary Secretary talked about economies effected in the administration of his Department by the reduction of some 37 or 57 posts. That is laudable so long as the Department works efficiently.  In his effort to save money&mdash;it is equally laudable that we should try to do that&mdash;I do not think this saving is justified when one remembers the sufferings and deprivations these <Col N="506" /> people may undergo during the period.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to consider annulling this Order.  He may have a perfectly good reason for it, but the reason has never been given.  I do not believe this saving is worth while.  The two weeks during which money will be saved to the Department are difficult weeks for these people.  It is certainly a period during which they should be in receipt of unemployment assistance provided they are otherwise qualified.</P>
    <P>I have little to say on the Estimate in general.  Anything I would like to say would not be allowed because any objections I have would be a criticism of existing legislation or a plea for further legislation to increase the various allowance mentioned.  I did raise a question with the Minister recently in relation to the commission on workmen's compensation.  With all due respect, one does not get satisfaction by tabling questions or by asking supplementary questions at the relevant time, but I should like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister now to state why he thought it necessary to co-opt on the commission two extra representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Two from insurance and one economist&mdash;three altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Two are directly representative of insurance interests.  When I established this commission I followed, for good or ill, the example of my predecessor, Dr. Ryan.  It was he who originally suggested a commission to review the code of workmen's compensation and to report thereon. Having had the Workmen's Compensation Act passed by this House, I promised the House I would follow on the lines of my predecessor.  I honestly thought, when I was inviting people to sit on this commission, that I had included on it people representative of all the interests involved&mdash;business people, workers' representatives, the legal profession, both barristers and solicitors, and insurance representatives. I believed they would give a fair report, one which the Government <Col N="507" /> would consider and subsequently act upon if they so decided.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will not take offence if I repeat what I said on another occasion, even though he did get pretty narky.  It seems to me the jury is being packed.  I have no inside information on the activities of this commission.  I did not interfere with it during the years in which I was in Arus Mhic Dhiarmada.  I do not suggest that the Minister has acted deliberately, but people are suspicious that there should be two persons appointed directly representative of insurance interests and active in insurance business.  When this commission reports, it is quite possible there will be two reports&mdash;one in favour of continuing the present system and the other in favour of a State system.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the personnel of the commission now and the weight of interest there is from the point of view of insurance companies, it looks as if we shall get a report in favour of continuing the present faulty system.  I do not know whether or not that will be the case.  The important point is that this is establishing a precedent, one of which the House should take note.  I do not know of any commission that has ever been enlarged.  It is true that people have resigned, fallen ill or died and have had to be replaced, but I do not know of any commission which has been enlarged, and enlarged in such a manner as to make people suspicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission is taking a very long time to report.  If it goes on much longer it will beat the Commission on Emigration.  I used to be abused and criticised by my colleagues in the last Government because of the length of time that commission took. Possibly the present Minister has been subjected to the same type of abuse and criticism by his colleagues in relation to this commission.  I think everybody will agree that the commission has been sitting for rather a long time now.  Maybe there is some good reason for that, but in the meantime it is costing money.  In the Book of Estimates a sum of £500 or £600 is mentioned for travelling and other expenses. I do not criticise the members. <Col N="508" /> I know they are doing good work at great sacrifice to themselves, but perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us what the Commission has cost to date, and if it is likely to make a report soon.</P>
    <P>I should like to preface my remarks on my next point by saying that, in my experience, the appeals officers who come down from head office to the various provincial centres are men who have done their work extremely well. I think some of our district justices and circuit court judges would learn a lot if they took an example from them, because, in my experience of them, as an applicant or a witness, they are most sympathetic and helpful to all the different types of people who go to them and in particular to some people who, shall we say, are not too bright.  Some of the appellants who come before these appeals officers are aggressive and critical of the Department of Social Welfare and all Government officials, but I found them most understanding, most sympathetic and helpful.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of appeals, I have some observations to make.  I believe that far too many cases for decision are sent up from local offices to headquarters.  I could cite dozens, scores and hundreds of examples of these small, petty cases, and of people being held up for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for weeks, waiting for an appeals officer to come down and say whether or not U.A. or U.B. should be restored to them.  There are officials in the local offices who have the title of deciding officer.  I wonder what does the deciding officer decide?  So far as I know, the deciding officer sends tricky or difficult cases up to head office to be determined or to be referred to an appeals officer.  The most trivial cases are sent up.  Some of them will be heard in Wexford town this week and I honestly believe the appeals officer will dispose of them in a proper way in a very short time, but, in the meantime, these people who will go before him in Wexford on next Thursday, Friday or Saturday have been held up for five, six, seven or eight weeks.  It is true that if their appeals are allowed, they will get the back money, <Col N="509" /> but if you examine the cases that are sent to head office for decision, you will find many are very trivial.</P>
    <P>I shall give one example.  I do not know whether this case could be regarded as <i>sub judice</i>, in view of the fact that it is before an appeals officer, but I shall not mention any names. There is a young man in Wexford who was sacked recently by the boss's son, after they had had some words.  The boss's son does not own the business.  The young lad who was sacked went down to the employment exchange to apply for his U.A. or U.B. Naturally, one of the officials in the exchange rang up the business and asked the owner had he sacked this man.  &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I did not sack him.&rdquo;  Therefore, the official in the exchange took it for granted that the young lad had left as no reference was made to the fact that it was the boss's son who had sacked him.  That case went to Dublin but the young chap has been waiting now for five or six weeks: I do not know if I have made myself very clear, but that is the type of thing which could be investigated in ten minutes on the telephone. I would not have been approached; I would not have had to get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare; the Department would not have had to write to the appeals officer; and the appeals officer would not have to waste another ten minutes in Wexford.</P>
    <P>That is why I think too many of the cases are being sent to Dublin.  I do not remember what specific instructions or powers are given to these officers, but I suggest if they have these powers, they should use them adequately and not cause these appeals which are cluttering up the machinery in Arus Mhic Dhiarmada.</P>
    <P>It was the Parliamentary Secretary who answered a question I put down in the House with regard to the experiment in abolishing the posts of local agents.  I have to confess that I was very indignant with the Parliamentary Secretary when he told me he proposed to abolish them, and that he thought it the best thing to do.  I thought at that time there would be chaos, but I am glad to say there was not chaos.  Perhaps it will still come, <Col N="510" /> because the experiment is only two or three months old, but I must confess there has not been the difficulty I thought there might have been in Wexford, due to the non-filling of the vacated post of local agent.  I should like to have the Parliamentary Secretary's views on that.  I am the local representative of the Labour Party and perhaps people have approached the Fianna Fáil local councillors or T.D.s with regard to difficulties in respect of sickness benefit.  I do not find many difficulties arising out of the fact that there is no local agent in the town.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with regard to some appeals and their payments, but they are inevitable in a Department which deals with so many tens of thousands of individual cases from week to week.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be in a position to say now whether or not this experiment has worked out as well as he thought it would.  I know it is not a widespread experiment.  It is being tried in only three, four, five or six areas, but perhaps he could tell us whether or not the system of dealing with head office has been successful in those areas.</P>
    <P>There is another local matter which I wish to raise.  It is in regard to the lack of accommodation for the social welfare officers in New Ross, and not so much for the officers as for the people who must approach them with regard to their applications for widows' pensions, old age pensions and so on.  I should like to know why the office on the quay in New Ross was surrendered before alternative accommodation was secured.  The accommodation was not very satisfactory and the officers of the Department were making some efforts to get new accommodation, and suddenly they were told to vacate the place, I believe.  Now they are conducting their business in their own homes. That is very unsatisfactory.  Possibly they are receiving an allowance for the use of one of the rooms, but it is still very unsatisfactory.  It is unsatisfactory for the family, apart from the social welfare officer himself. It is unsatisfactory for his wife and his family, but it is much more unsatisfactory for the pensioners and the <Col N="511" /> applicants for widows' and orphans' pensions, to have to go to the private residences of these people for the purpose of filling in application forms or being interrogated by the social welfare officer.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could say later on what, if anything, can be done to get alternative accommodation in the town of New Ross.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the fact that postage, telephones and telegrams had increased by £20,000 but that that was not an actual increase&mdash;it was a transfer from one account to another, or something like that.  It seems to me that, with the abolition of the posts of local agents, postal expenses will go up substantially; whether or not the discontinuance of the local agents will offset postage, telephones and telegrams I do not know.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could not comment on that yet.  That is all I have to say with regard to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I know the Department fairly well; I know how efficient it is, and I am afraid I could not criticise, in any strong way, the administration of the Department.  Of course, from time to time there have been various complaints, as there always will be, about delays in payments but, as far as I know, 99 per cent.  of delay in payment is because an applicant has not sent in a particular form and has not given certain information, or something like that.  There are also complaints about reductions in payments which is usually explained away by the fact that a person had not sufficient stamps but, generally speaking, I think that the majority of the complaints with regard to the administration of the Department of the Social Welfare are unfounded. There may be misunderstandings and mistakes made but sometimes these mistakes are unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister in particular, and the House, to consider this Employment Period Order with regard to the payment of unemployment assistance to people in rural areas.  I gave my reasons at the beginning of my speech and, unless the Minister has some strong, sound <Col N="512" /> reason to extend the period, I think he should now be prepared to annul the Order and revert to the date in October, which is usually the second last Tuesday in that month.</P>

      <P>The Estimate that the Parliamentary Secretary presented to the House this evening is a formidable one.  He stressed that it amounted to a substantial part of the total amount provided for public services, indeed, to as much as 25 per cent. When one recalls that some two years ago the people were led to believe by the most assertive and flamboyant posters that all they had to do was elect the Party now in office, and that wives were told that if they voted for the Party now forming the Government they would get their husbands back to work, it is a sad commentary that Government authorised documents now show there are 32,000 fewer in employment than when the Government took office two years ago.  It is regrettable that it is necessary to find such a substantial sum of money to meet the impact of unemployment on our people, as presented in this Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to compare the figures now presented with the figures presented in former years, and to take into consideration the possible trends of expenditure in the years to come.  It has been rendered extremely difficult by the fact that the House will shortly be discussing Government legislation to provide increased benefits to certain classes under this Department heading. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Government's intention in that respect and he said that it is an indication of the importance which the Government attaches to the welfare of the less fortunate members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A long time has elapsed since the present Government took deliberate action that brought down on the unfortunate members of the community the circumstances which warrant the increases which they propose to pay at a future date.  We assert that these increases should have been paid long ago because, since the food subsidies were abolished, by deliberate act of the Government, various organised <Col N="513" /> classes of the community have legitimately secured increases to protect them from the impact of the increase in the cost of living, but surely the poorer sections of our people were deserving of first consideration from the Government?  They are the classes that come under the various headings of this Estimate.</P>
    <P>During that period old age pensioners, widows and the unemployed received but a negligible increase, completely out of relation with the impact which the increased cost of living had on the circumstances in which they had to exist.  It is indicated that a sum of £883,000 will be necessary to meet this for part of the financial year.  When this is added to what has already been put forward, and when a full year's expenses is taken into account, we may well ask what the Government had hoped for when they abolished the food subsidies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have the retrospective results already of the Civil Service awards in the expenditure in this Estimate, and we claim that these people should have been catered for long before now.  It indicates that a <Col N="514" /> grievous mistake was made in creating the situation that warrants this increase in expenditure.  I know it is not in order to refer to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But we are in a position to compare the proposed expenditure with expenditure in the years gone by because the whole thing has been thrown into upheaval by the fact that the Government have been responsible for the fact that these people are dependent on the State.  They have been in these serious circumstances for the past year and a half.</P>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to the office which he now holds he referred to abuses that existed in the administration of his Department, and it was accepted that he had discovered that there were very considerable abuses throughout the country.  It was taken from that that he would succeed, by the elimination of these abuses, in making a reduction in the expenditure that would be necessary.  It is true that much could be done by bringing it home to very many people throughout the country that it would be in the interests of the genuinely unemployed if everybody realised that the abuses are inimical to the interests of those genuinely unemployed. We know, particularly in rural parts, the attempts that are made to cloak the fact that men in receipt of assistance are regarded as a kind of cheap labour, and the fact that that is condoned by certain employers is reprehensible.  We should have more co-operation in that respect, and an effort should be made by those people to give real wages and, if they have work, to engage men available to do that particular work, pay them a decent wage and not encourage them in the abuses to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred some time ago as having been in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the unemployment in rural parts, particularly seasonal unemployment, as Deputy Corish stated, has been occasioned by the trend towards mechanisation.  This is progress.  Much of the work that has been done by machines could never be done by labouring <Col N="515" /> men.  Nevertheless, as others with an interest in the future of the country have said, very many people who have expended large sums of money on mechanisation seem to have forgotten the part which labour could play in the performance of the work which they sought to do by mechanical means.  They have found that in many instances the capital outlay was such that they would have been better advised if they had given more employment in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There is a growing realisation that mechanisation was overdone and I can see a diminution in the displacement in agricultural employment and, possibly, with the growing importance of animal husbandry, with proper encouragement and also with less incitement to workers in rural areas to go into the industrial parts, there will be an increase in employment on the land.  If these people can be made to realise that though they may not have the bright lights, they have a way of life in which they have often been assisted by neighbours and employers over many difficulties domestic and otherwise, there will be an improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the fact that the considerable amount of money which the House has been asked to vote is necessary.  It is vital that we protect those people among us who are unable, whether due to unemployment or advancing years, to care for themselves.  It is incumbent on us to see that the State comes to their assistance.  But we do regret there is no hope of any substantial reduction in the number of unemployed.  It is a complete negation of the hopes that were held out by the Government before they assumed office, that they could within a short period, given the authority to do it, achieve a situation, where there would be a great reduction in the number of unemployed and consequently less need for giving such substantial sums of money to unfortunate men and women who cannot obtain employment.  The Government's situation in this respect has been relieved by the increase in <Col N="516" /> emigration, and the fact that we have not more registered as unemployed is attributable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have fewer registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, fewer registered, but there are also 32,000 fewer unemployed.  The Minister is standing on the fact that they are not registered, but his own Government's publications show that there are 32,000 fewer in employment, since this Government attained office.  If they are not registered as unemployed and if they are not registered as employed, we can assume they are not in the country.  If they are there, why is there no record to show it?  These figures&mdash;they are Government figures &mdash;surely cannot be disputed.  It is a very poor excuse for the Minister to fall back on that there are fewer registered as unemployed, but it is clear that if they are not registered as unemployed and if they are not in employment, they have left the country.</P>
      <P>The picture as painted in the introductory speech of the Parliamentary Secretary is very far from the high hopes that were held out when the Party in office were seeking election. They have produced very poor results considering they were given a mandate to perform the various tasks they so confidently said they could perform perform within a short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has fallen into a very common error.  He assumes that incomes from employment have remained static over the past few years, when, as everybody knows, the contrary is the case.  A great number of people are very much better off than they were two years ago.  Their weekly earnings have been rising.  Their rates of remuneration have been increasing and therefore a great many people have passed out of insurable occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of last year, I brought in two measures, one relating to insurance and the other relating to health. In both cases, I was compelled, <Col N="517" /> because of the change in rates of remuneration and in earnings, to increase the limits of insurability from £600 to £800 a year, that is, to increase the limit on insurable income by at least one-third.  As a result of that, a number of people will this year come again within the insurable category and their stamps will be taken as an index of the amount of employment which is available.  However, there was no significant change between December of 1958 and January of 1959. There was no sudden influx of people into employment.  There was, however, a very great increase in the number of people who were in insurable occupations and when the next examination of this question is undertaken, it will be found that the number of people in insurable occupations has very considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken was a Parliamentary Secretary in the last Administration.  He ought to have informed himself about the realities of the situation before he spoke.  I want to repeat for the benefit of Deputy O'Sullivan that there are not fewer people in employment than there were in the year 1956.  On the contrary, there are a great many more, but a greater proportion of the people who are in employment have now the benefits of being in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>The real index of unemployment is the number of people who are signing on at labour exchanges and indicating that they are looking for employment. The latest figure of which I have a recollection is that the number looking for employment in May of 1959 is considerably below what it was when this Government took office in February of 1957.  We have reduced unemployment in this country by a very substantial amount.  There is no use in the Deputy or anybody else trying to ring the changes on the fact that because of the rising rates of remuneration in this country, because of the increased earnings of the workers of this country a great number of people passed out of the compulsory insurance category.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been talking about the promises we made to reduce expenditure. We have succeeded in reducing expenditure quite substantially <Col N="518" /> on the two Votes which relate to social insurance and to social assistance. So far as the Estimates introduced before the Budget of this year are concerned, the Deputy, if he takes the trouble to examine the volume of Estimates will find that, in relation to social insurance, there is an actual decrease of £56,000 on the figure for 1958-59 and, in respect of the figure for social assistance, there is a decrease of £80,000.  These are indications of the very substantial improvement which has taken place in our economic conditions.</P>
    <P>We would not reduce&mdash;at least I would not and I take it that the Government would not either&mdash;these Estimates, if we had not good grounds for knowing that the situation had so changed that we could reduce the amount being asked for.  I have never been one who has been anything other than conservative and, if one likes to put it that way, rather pessimistic in my evaluation of the future.</P>

      <P>He did not believe in shutting his eyes to the facts.  He looked at them as I do.  Therefore, when you see that in this year we shall require £56,000 less under the Vote for social insurance and £80,000 less under the Vote for social assistance you may be quite certain we are going to realise those reductions.  You may be quite certain we shall not do as somebody <Col N="519" /> did in 1956-57&mdash;drastically underestimate what the requirements were likely to be and leave it to their successors to bring in a Supplementary Estimate to make good the obligations which the Coalition failed to fulfil. However, that has nothing to do with the administration for this year.</P>
      <P>I really rose, apart from the need to point out the fallacy which underlay Deputy O'Sullivan's speech, to deal with the point which had been made by my predecessor in the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Corish, in relation to the commission on workmen's compensation.  I am sure Deputy Corish, when he again resumes office as I suppose in the ordinary course of human nature he will some time, will agree that as Minister he will be quite entitled to select his own advisers; that he is not bound by what his predecessor does in respect of the persons whom he selects to advise him.</P>
      <P>It happens that Deputy Corish not merely drafted the terms of reference of this commission on workmen's compensation but also selected the personnel. I am not saying that Deputy Corish in a matter of this sort did not act objectively, doing the best as he saw it.  I am not suggesting that for one minute.  When, however, I came to examine this question of workmen's compensation and to study the terms of reference which Deputy Corish, as Minister for Social Welfare, had given to the commission and looked at the composition of the commission I came to the conclusion that so far as I am concerned&mdash;and, for the time being, I am the final judge in this matter&mdash;this commission was, shall I say, overloaded or, to put it in reverse, that this commission was underweighted in respect of the representation which had been given to a very great industry in this country, the insurance industry, which as we all know is one of the great sources of capital investment in this country.  I found that while the employers had been given three representatives, the trade unions had been given three representatives, and that other interests had been given full representation on this commission, the insurance industry had only one representative on the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> The insurance industry is at least the third point of the triangle.  It ought to be an equilateral triangle in which every side is equal&mdash;if you like, putting the other interests inside that as well.  I said to myself: &ldquo;After all, even in insurance, there may be competing points of view: there may be different approaches to this question of workmen's compensation and at least I ought to ensure that every point of view within the insurance industry will be represented on the commission, since they do not all run the same way and they do not all hunt the same way.&rdquo;  I decided to strengthen, as I thought, the commission by appointing two nominees of mine as against the 12 or 14 nominees whom Deputy Corish as Minister for Social Welfare had put on the commission.</P>
    <P>It would have been quite open to me, and it would have been quite within my rights&mdash;I am not saying that I would be justified; that is quite a different matter&mdash; to say: &ldquo;I will dissolve the commission.  I will appoint my own commission.  I am entitled to select my own advisers, every one of them, 12 or 15, just as my predecessor did.&rdquo;  I did not do it.</P>

      <P>A Government are not bound to accept the views of any commission&mdash;not bound in any way. They approach the findings and the recommendations of any commission in a completely independent way and can look at them completely objectively.  But I did not want everything the commission had done to go <Col N="521" /> for nothing.  All I wanted was to ensure that in so far as this very complex problem of workmen's compensation is concerned, the matter would be exhaustively investigated.  Therefore, I appointed two members to that commission who, because they are very familiar with all the aspects of the problem, will, when it comes to writing the report of that commission, be able to bring their special knowledge to bear.  Or, to put it this way, they will be able to give the fruits of their special knowledge to the commission as a whole, so that the merits can be threshed out, with, as I say, the benefit and advantage of having that special knowledge at the disposal of the commission.</P>
      <P>I did something more and Deputy Corish has not referred to it and has not criticised it.  I also appointed&mdash; let me make it quite clear&mdash;a second economist to the commission.  I thought that was very important because I do not think that it is wise to have one single person holding a key position on any committee of investigation.</P>
      <P>I think there is a great deal to be gained by having an independent approach to any question and I selected and appointed to that commission one of the ablest, youngest and most progressive economists in the country to-day.  He is a young man whose political affiliations have nothing to do with me, but whose work I have studied very carefully and whom I have found to take, irrespective of any predilections he might have, a very independent and objective view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I placed him on the commission also.  I make no apologies for any one of these three appointments because I am hoping, if I live long enough, and should stay in office, to be the Minister who will have to consider the recommendations of this commission, that I shall be in a position to consider them with greater faith in the objectivity of the recommendations, by reason of what I have done to ensure that every interest will be adequately represented on the commission.  That, if you like, is my justification for having done what I did in relation to the commission. Having said that, I do not wish to impugn the good faith of my <Col N="522" /> predecessor.  He was quite entitled to select the persons whom he wished to advise him in relation to this very complex problem, as I said, and I think that he will concede that what he was entitled to do I am equally entitled to do.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more that I can usefully add to what I have already said.  I feel that the fact that we have secured significant reductions &mdash;I do not want to put it further than is reasonable&mdash;in the amounts which we are asking from the Dáil for these two services is an indication that the country is improving and that the situation, both from the point of view of employment and what is better, from the point of view of the economy as a whole, is improving.</P>

      <P>This Estimate might be classifified as the bread and butter, Estimate of the unemployed man and his family.  In the main, it is his only means of support, the thing that is between him and starvation, with the exception of what little he may secure in the way of private charity.  So great an impact has this Estimate and this Department on the lives of so many people that I feel the Department of Social Welfare is worthy of a separate Minister.  I say that with no intention of casting any aspersion on the methods of this Department or the manner in which it is handled by the Parliamentary Secretary, but rather as an indication of what I believe the position should be.</P>
      <P>If the head of this important Department held a Cabinet rank, I believe it would encourage him, if it were necessary, to greater initiative and indeed lead to a smoother working of his Department because he would then be in a position to decide for himself on certain matters which now naturally he has to refer to his Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay a personal tribute to the courtesy and efficiency of the present Parliamentary Secretary who, at all times, to me at any rate, has given efficient service, prompt replies and has treated every request made by me with the greatest consideration. Therefore, anything I have said in <Col N="523" /> connection with the Department and his status is purely from the point of view of the position of the head of that Department who should, in my opinion, be of Cabinet rank.  This Department deals with a wide variety of benefits including maternity benefits, children's allowances, cheap fuel, cheap footwear, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, old age and blind pensions and home assistance. That is a vast scope and it should bear out my statement that such a vast Department needs and merits a separate Minister.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge of this in my own right, but it has been said that in connection with wet-time insurance stamps, the administration of which I understand is carried out under the Department of Social Welfare, considerable fraud is being practised by contractors.  Workers are reported as being unemployed, due either to rain or frost, when in actual fact these workers have been kept in continuous employment.  That statement has been made to me by one who has been employed for a long period as an ordinary builder's labourer.  During the course of conversation the subject of wet time insurance came up.  He directed my attention to the fact that he knew of his own knowledge of a case where his own name and the names of at least half a dozen other workmen were put down as persons paid benefit because they had lost time, due to rain or frost, when in fact they had been actually employed indoors carrying out the business of that contractor.  Whether that practice extends beyond that particular contractor or not, I do not know.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be worth while having an investigation to ascertain if all the attempts at fraud are engaged in solely by the person who draws the benefit.  This time last year the Parliamentary Secretary made a good deal of play about fraudulent claims made by insured workers.  While it is true that fraudulent claims have been made by insured workers on the basis that they were unemployed and <Col N="524" /> available for work while at the same time they secured alternative employment, all the malpractices are not on the one side.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he desires to stamp out such practices, it might be a good idea to consider a heavier penalty on the employer who gives employment to a worker who does not produce his insurance cards. If every employer were made to feel that perhaps a prison sentence might follow the employment of a man who does not produce his insurance cards, it would be impossible for a worker, whether driven by the temptation for unlawful gain or by economic pressure, to take up employment with, say, a farmer while actually drawing unemployment benefit or assistance.  He would be unable to secure that employment fraudulently because of the fact that immediately he withdrew his card from the labour exchange, he would be cut off from benefit.</P>
    <P>It might be desirable to put the pressure on the people who take advantage of the fact of the smallness of the benefits and the greatness of the need of the ordinary family, which forces unemployed people to take up cheap labour with certain employers willing to exploit the position.  Some steps should be taken to ensure that the burden of the penalty falls more heavily on the employer than the worker.  The same principle is applied in criminal law; the man who receives stolen property is punished much more severely than the person who steals, because if there were no receivers there would be fewer thieves.  If there were no employers to accept cheap labour, there would be very little reason for the Parliamentary Secretary to complain about fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>I have found in dealing with some social welfare cases a reluctance on the part of the Department to cooperate in the recovery of benefit lost by an insured worker due to the failure of his employer to affix the contribution stamps due and which omission is discovered by the worker only when he falls ill or is out of employment.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, there is a loss of benefit for a period of four weeks in the case of sickness.  It is indicated in a circular to the insured <Col N="525" /> worker that he has the right of recovery at law.  What worker has the finance necessary to engage a solicitor to take the case to court?</P>
    <P>During the time I worked as an agent with the National Health Insurance Society, the unified body, it was the duty of the social welfare inspector to look after this matter, and certainly the unified body helped the insured worker to recover such benefit. That seems to have been dropped under the new system.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us in his reply why is it that his Department refuse to co-operate with the insured worker and even refuse to prosecute employers who have failed to carry out the law?  Why do they refuse to recover for the insured worker, whose interests they are supposed to represent, the benefit to which he is legally entitled and of which he has been deprived?  In many cases local authorities have had to finance workers deprived of benefits because of the failure of employers to affix stamps.  If that payment were recovered and if the Department took steps to make help, even legal help, available to insured workers, the local authorities would gain as a result.</P>
    <P>In regard to the reply of the Minister for Social Welfare to Deputy O'Sullivan, I was very amused to hear him produce proof&mdash;at least to his own satisfaction&mdash;that the improvement in wages so affected insurable employment and we were all so well off now that there were 30,000 people fewer on record at present as being insurable. The Minister for Social Welfare must think we are very green to believe such a statement.  Does he not know &mdash;perhaps he does not?&mdash;that if you are engaged in manual work, as most of our people are, irrespective of what you are paid, you are still insurably employed and still liable for contribution? It is only in the clerical grades when you reach a certain amount&mdash;it has now been increased from £600 to £800&mdash;that the upper ceiling debars you from being in the insurable employment classification.  There is no justification in the Minister's claim that the reduction of those in insurable employment is offset by <Col N="526" /> better living conditions for all, bringing them out of the insurable employment classification.</P>
    <P>Of course, the fact is that the reduction in the number of unemployed on the live register is effected, not by an increase in insurable employment, but by emigration. Anyone who knows the position in Ireland at the present day and who views the matter divorced from politics, realises that that is the position. People who had to seek unemployment assistance found that they could not subsist on it and had to emigrate.  That is the cause of the reduction in the number on the live register and if the present situation continues, we may expect an annual reduction in the figure.  The proof of that is in the opposite figure, the fact that there are fewer insurably employed.  The reduction in the figure of unemployed on the live register and the reduction in insurable employment is proof of emigration. While there is no reliable figure for emigration, it is pretty generally accepted some 40,000 people leave the country every year.</P>

      <P>The number of persons applying for stamps for the first time in England would indicate that also.</P>

      <P>I do not think there can be a great deal of argument in regard to the figure.  It is, broadly, the Labour Party's belief that all types of social welfare must be financed by some method other than a provision by the employer, a provision by the worker and a State contribution.  We made no secret of the fact that we had in mind, if ever we had complete power to do it, amalgamation of the various types of insurance and that the resulting benefit to the State should be made to finance social welfare provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that in view and believing it was necessary that the State should have the information, we advocated examination of the position in regard to workmen's compensation, the financing of it, the profits derived from it and the likely effect on the State, should the State decide to take <Col N="527" /> over administration of workmen's compensation.  Deputy Corish, as Minister for Social Welfare in 1955, set up a commission to make a factual report on what was happening. It is a long time ago&mdash;three years last December&mdash;and, unfortunately, we have had no report to date.  The Labour Party are deeply interested in that report.  We believe, from certain research carried out by trade union research officers, that even on the figures available to them as disclosed by insurance companies, a considerable profit has been made annually in this class of insurance.  We believe that if that profit had been diverted to payment of social welfare benefits, the benefits to insured workers could have been considerably increased without extra strain being imposed on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that we view with alarm the new addition to the commission, having particular regard to the side on which the Minister saw fit to make the appointments.  It is quite true that the Minister is within his rights but we feel that he allowed a long period&mdash;some 18 months&mdash;to elapse before making that addition to the insurance interests on the commission and it is not without significance that now, in what we hope are the closing months of the life of the commission, when the findings are about to be reported, the commission has been loaded by these additional representatives who are unlikely to express views against the interests they now so loyally serve.</P>
    <P>I desire to be associated with the motion standing in the name of Deputy Corish, primarily because of the fact that the matter with which it deals has such an impact on the lives of workers in rural areas.  A period of two weeks may seem to be a small thing but it may be a very important item in the <Col N="528" /> lives of people in rural districts who are living on what they can manage to scrape up.  Even if it were of no significance, the thought behind the regulation would appear to be, by every method and means, to continue to show by the statistics that the figure is lower than it was at any time during the period of inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking sincerely and honestly the officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  In my position as Labour Deputy in my constituency, I have considerable contact with the Department, particularly the section which deals with sickness and disablement benefit for insured workers.  At all times, without fear or favour, I received courtesy, consideration and prompt replies and I desire to express my gratitude for the courtesy I have received from the Department.</P>

      <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to join with other Deputies and to say that I, also, am very pleased with the general working of the Department of Social Welfare during the past 12 months.  Like all other Deputies, from time to time, I have occasion to make complaint to the Department in connection with certain services which it administers.  However, I am pleased to say that during the year under review the volume of complaints has diminished considerably, which goes to show that the general working of the Department is more smooth than it was.  In the past a general complaint was in regard to the very long delay that took place in settlement of claims for benefit, particularly unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27th May, 1959.</P>
