    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is in a position to make a further statement on the seven nation plan for a trading association, with particular reference to the proposed special agreement on agriculture, and the probable effect of these developments on this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present stage, I am not in a position to make any further statement concerning the negotiations in which Britain and certain other countries of Western Europe are engaged with a view to the possible establishment of a Free Trade area.  The Deputy will appreciate that those negotiations have not yet reached Ministerial level.</P>
      <P>The discussions in this connection in which the Ministers for External Affairs and Agriculture took part in London on the 24th instant were of an exploratory nature&mdash;specifically related to the possible implications for Anglo-Irish trade of any arrangements that may result from the negotiations &mdash;and further discussions are contemplated in the early future.  As was stated in the communiqué issued after the London discussions, the desirability of maintaining and strengthening the traditional trade relationship between the two countries, in their mutual interest, was reaffirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to repeat what I have <Col N="144" /> already publicly stated&mdash;that there can be no question about our aim, which is to make sure, in so far as it is in our power to do so, that the expansion of our production and exports will not be impeded in whatever trade situation may emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, might I ask if, in regard to the discussions which he had recently with the British Paymaster-General, he is satisfied that if the Seven-Nation plan goes ahead this country will still be in a position to carry out bilateral trade agreements governing industry, and particularly agriculture, with Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There is no suggestion of any interference with bilateral arrangements with these countries.  The Free Trade area which it is contemplated may result from the Stockholm discussions does not involve the same obligations as the Rome Treaty in respect of uniform external tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether, since he made the statement on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, he has since received an invitation to participate in the Scandinavian talks: and, secondly, whether the discussions which took place in London revolve around the revision of the 1938 and 1948 Trade Agreements with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not received an invitation to participate in the talks at Stockholm; and the discussions in London were, as I have said, exploratory only.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission <Col N="145" /> of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Record.  As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my statement on this matter on the 3rd June last, when replying to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dáil Debates, Vol. 175 No. 8, Cols. 945-947).</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the total national income was £477 million in 1957 and £493 million in 1958.</P>
      <P>In 1957 domestic wages, salaries and pensions, including employers' contributions to social security, amounted to £240 million, profits (including income of farmers and members of their families) from agriculture, forestry and fishing, amounted to £126 million, and non-agricultural domestic profits, professional earnings, interest and dividends amounted to £76 million.  The estimated income from land and buildings (including the rent element in the land annuities) was £10 million and the net inflow of income from abroad was £31 million.  The provision for stock appreciation involved a deduction of £6 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that in 1958 the profits from agriculture, forestry and fishing and the net inflow of income from abroad were £117 million and £32 million respectively.  The other information for 1958 is not yet available but it will be included in the 1958 issue of the <i>Irish Statistical Survey.</i>  It is likely that when the figures are being published in the Survey it will be necessary to make some revisions in them for both years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a few points on the Money Resolution. First of all, I understand that the copy in the short size&mdash;in the ordinary standard size of the Acts&mdash;of the Finance Act, 1958, is not yet available. It seems extraordinary to me that that is so and I presume it arises from translation reasons.  That we are considering today the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1959, and that the short printed version of the Finance Act, 1958, cannot be purchased, is, to say the least of it, ridiculous.  I am aware, of course, that copies of the Finance Act, 1958, are available in what I may call the long white foolscap size but people who have to work on the Finance Bills day in and day out must always bind them for their own use.  It is most inconvenient if they have to bind short Acts together with long Acts and I would ask the Minister, therefore, to ensure that in this coming year, and in the future, when there will be a substantial delay in relation to the issue of the Act in the ordinary form, the Acts will be issued in English only in that short form so as to facilitate those who have to work on these enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, judging by the experience of 1958, it will be a very long time <Col N="183" /> now before we can get this Bill translated, and if during that lengthy interval, the position is that nobody can get a copy of the Bill in the same size for binding, it will materially impede the work and the more the work is impeded, the more it will be thrown back on the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to suggest to the Minister that it is undesirable in the case of a long Bill like this which will take considerable time to annotate and for a memorandum to be made, that the officers of the Revenue Commissioners should not be supplied with a copy of the Bill immediately it is enacted. I know that last year there was very great difficulty&mdash;and I appreciate the difficulty&mdash;in making a memorandum on the impact of the Finance Act, 1958.  In consequence of that, my information, from certain accountants and others who have business with inspectors of taxes, is that no inspector of taxes had, up to last November, any copy of the Finance Act, 1958, and that, in fact, in November, accountants were discussing with inspectors of taxes the provisions of the Finance Act, 1958, in so far as it affected their clients, and that they were told by the inspectors of taxes concerned: &ldquo;That may or may not be so; we cannot tell you because we have not yet got a copy of the Bill as finally enacted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know the reason that happened last year was that the Revenue Commissioners decided, and properly decided, that a memorandum for the use of the Service on the Finance Act, 1958, was utterly essential.  I think they will decide the same thing in respect of this long Bill.  If that is so, then I would urge that regardless of the preparation of that memorandum, they should see that copies of the Bill are circulated to their principal officers, such as inspectors of taxes, at the earliest possible opportunity, and that a copy of the memorandum should be circulated later so that no inspector of taxes will be in the position on being asked whether he has a copy of the Act to discuss with his opposite number, of having to reply that he has not.</P>
    <P>I want also to take advantage of this opportunity on the Money Resolution <Col N="184" /> of raising a matter which I raised on the Second Stage of this Bill in relation to the question of double residence. So far as I am concerned, if the Minister considers it would be simpler if I raised it on any other section, I am entirely in his hands, and it is completely a matter for him.  When we were speaking here on the Second Stage, I informed the Minister that it had been suggested to me by those who deal with this matter day in and day out, that the present arrangement whereby a person is deemed to be a resident here if he maintains a residence in this country and spends only one night in it, is having the effect of preventing people from bringing in capital moneys for the development of stud farms and similar activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply at columns 864 and 865 of the Official Report, suggested that what these people were really anxious to do was to avoid paying any tax at all.  That is not my information.  I suppose everybody would be anxious to avoid paying tax if he could.  That is nothing new.  It is not, however, an anxiety to avoid paying tax that inspires these people.  That is not their concern, and it is my concern here to ensure that there is as great an inflow of capital for proper development of assets here as can be arranged. I can see the circumstances in which quite definitely the provision of this &ldquo;one night rule&rdquo;, as I call it, would deter people from bringing in capital. I do not quite follow the Minister's suggestion that the only gainer in respect of such an extension&mdash;or, to be strictly accurate, in respect of such a limitation as the &ldquo;one night rule&rdquo;&mdash; would be the British Exchequer.  I would be grateful to him for some enlightenment on that point.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Minister on the Second Stage the position that arises for residents here who are also members of Lloyds underwriting syndicates. I got a most helpful memorandum transmitted to me by the Minister, a memorandum which sets out the position very fairly and very clearly. It is admitted in that memorandum that there are cases in which there is double taxation at the moment.  That admission in itself makes it desirable <Col N="185" /> that some method should be evolved of remedying the situation.  The cure the Minister has suggested is that the parties concerned should withdraw altogether from the special reserve fund.  I agree that would be a simple solution, but I do not think it meets the situation at all.  If they do that and continue to reside here, I can see circumstances in which in one year they will be liable for very heavy surtax and in the following year, even though they suffered substantially lower profits, or even losses, they will not get the surtax arrangements evened out.</P>
    <P>It is because of that situation that the arrangement was originally introduced in the British Finance Act of 1949 whereby higher profits in one year and lower profits in another year would be evened out by the creation of this special reserve fund.  I think it is fair to say that the situation was met by treating underwriters in the same manner as they would have been treated if they were a directorcontrolled company.  The whole purpose of Lloyds is to ensure that there will not be a limited liability, as is provided in the company, and accordingly the provisions applicable to a company are not applicable to an underwriter unless there is a special arrangement.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the memorandum submitted to me by the Minister that the relief under the double taxation agreement would be very complicated. I also agree with him that, so far as I can ascertain, there are not very many persons concerned.  The simple solution suggested, however, of the persons withdrawing is not an adequate solution.  There is power, of course, for the Revenue Commissioners to make an extra statutory concession.  Having regard to the very small numbers in this particular class and the desirability of their being fairly treated, I think the extra statutory concession is probably the best method of dealing with the matter. I was trying to draft something that would meet what I have in mind.  I thought of bringing it in as an amendment so that the Minister would have it in writing before him.  However, <Col N="186" /> since it is only an extra statutory concession, I do not think it is proper to put it in as an amendment to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>What I had in mind was a provision something like this: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, through membership of Lloyds Special Reserve Fund, an underwriter in Ireland suffers double taxation and where, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, relief should be granted, the amount of that relief shall be the total amount of United Kingdom income-tax, sur-tax and profits tax, or other tax on income, or the total amount of the Irish income-tax, surtax, and profits tax, or other tax on income, suffered by the Irish resident on the doubly taxed income, whichever is the lesser.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amount from the revenue point of view could not be very large.  The amount from the point of view of individual hardship would undoubtedly be very large.</P>
    <P>I press upon the Minister that he should ensure that these people are not doubly taxed either by arranging an extra statutory concession along the lines I have suggested as a simple method of dealing with the situation or, in the alternative, that he should take the matter up under the double tax agreement.  I admit the latter course would be a rather complicated one.  That is why I have suggested the other.  When the Minister and his advisers come to read the phraseology of the provision I have suggested they will see I have made it quite clear, as it is imperative it should be made clear, that in the extra statutory concession the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is the ruling factor.  In other words, there is no question of right.  I think that proposal would assist capital development here.</P>

      <P>First of all, I was not aware of the fact that the ordinary form of the Act of 1958 has not yet issued. To what the delay is due, I am not quite sure, but I shall certainly look into the matter immediately to see if something better cannot be done in that respect this year as against last year.  I quite appreciate the inconvenience <Col N="187" /> to those using these Acts to have them issued in different sizes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the inspectors, I believe the inspectors did get copies of the Green Print but they did not get the final print until some time in November.  It was accompanied by notes from the Revenue Commissioners and, when the Deputy sees the size of the document, he will understand why it took some time to prepare it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to double residence, I am sorry if I gave a wrong impression.  I did not want to give the impression to the Dáil, when I was speaking on this matter, that these people were trying to avoid income tax. I may have concluded by saying that everybody, of course, tries to avoid income tax.  It is a natural thing.  But I did not say that these people try to avoid it more than anybody else.  I did say that the only gainer would be the British Exchequer which, of course, would be true in the case of a British national, as the Deputy, I am sure, realises.  If we can claim some part of the income tax from a British national, we have it, but, if we do not claim, the British Exchequer gets all the income tax he pays.  If we do not claim it when it is due to us, we lose that bit of income tax and the British get it instead.  That is the only difference there is.  That is why I made the remark that the only gainer would be the British Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Lloyds' underwriting business, that appeared to me to be a rather difficult matter.  I am glad the Deputy appreciated the memorandum which was passed to me by the Revenue Commissioners and which I passed on to him.  I thought it rather difficult to read but I was not, I suppose, as interested in it as the Deputy was and, therefore, he may have understood it very quickly and got a better grip of it, but I think the <Col N="188" /> kernel of the thing there is that it is the impact of British income tax law that is really the big trouble.  I know that those who were advising these people did approach the British income tax authorities and we had hoped that they might get some result from that and we were waiting to see if they would.  Therefore, we had not given very much thought to what we might do to meet this situation because we thought it might be met from the other side.  We have still some hope that it will be met in that way.  All I can say about it is that I shall certainly study the suggestions made by the Deputy now when I see them in print and see if anything can be done on these lines.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Finance Bill, 1959&mdash;Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points that I should like to raise on Section 1.  The first point arises out of the reduction of the standard rate of income tax from 7/6 to 7/- and 6/- to 5/6, and so on.  I think one of the effects of that reduction has been quite unintentional.  I refer to the position arising in regard to marginal relief in respect of the relief granted to old people.  As the House knows, there is a provision whereby persons over 65 years of age who have an income which consists, in the main, of unearned income are granted a relief which is equivalent to earned income relief on the income and it seems to me that, with the reduction in the standard rate, persons who previously qualified for this relief will be unfairly treated.  If the income of such persons is £600 or less than £600, the position is all right, but if it goes over £600, their position under the marginal relief provisions is adversely affected, as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a single person with £800 a year unearned income.  Prior to the Budget, in 1958/59, the age relief available to that person was £31 5s. Subsequent to the Budget, when these provisions are effectual, the age relief <Col N="189" /> available will be only £22 10s.  As I said, that arises directly from the reduction in the standard rate and I imagine that it is quite unintentional that it should be so.  For instance, to give a concrete case, a single person with unearned income of £800 a year, in 1958/59, without age relief, paid £213 15s. tax and, with age relief, paid £182 10s. tax&mdash;in other words, a reduction of £31 5s. as between a person getting age relief and a person not getting it, in 1958/59.  In 1959/60, if nothing were done, the same person, without age relief, would pay £198 15s. and, with age relief, would pay £176 5s., so that the reduction in 1959/60 will not be as great as it was in 1958/59.  That applies to all the range of income over £600 a year for this type of person.</P>
    <P>In addition, the marginal relief in 1958/59 expired, for a single person, at £1,050 and now at £950; for married persons, at £1,040 and now at £1,020. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate if anything can be done about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of marginal relief has been under consideration. The Deputy, of course, has a better grip of it than I have.  I think he is right in saying that up to about £600 the position is fairly all right.  There does appear to be some doubt about the position above that but it is being examined.  All I can promise the Deputy is that we shall examine it further and see if there is any hardship inflicted on these people and, if there is, we can make it right at another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance.  There is just one further point on Section 1 that I should like to raise.  The income which a child may have in respect of qualifying for the child allowance is still restricted to £60.  I think that is too low.  I should like the Minister favourably to consider increasing that income limit.  It has been pointed out to me that the following situation arises: In the case of a number of employers in the city and the country generally who have pension schemes, where the person employed dies, the company will, as a rule, make a pension available <Col N="190" /> to the widow and fairly often will make a sum available to the child.  The £60 income limit is just too low and in many of these pension schemes the fact that the limit is £60 takes the child out of the child allowance category.  The pension schemes, as a general rule, will pay to the child anything from £60 to £100.  Certainly, it is in very rare cases that the payment to the child from the pensions fund would be less than £60.  Therefore, the income tax code at present works very unfairly in those cases.  There are other cases also in which the same thing applies.  I think the Minister might favourably consider increasing that income limit from £60 to £100&mdash;in other words, to the same level as the child allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we have got any complaint&mdash;at least no complaint has reached me&mdash;on this issue. I should not imagine that there would be many pension schemes where a child would get more than £60 a year. It is a matter, of course, that we can look into.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why, as a matter of drafting, there is the entire repetition in subsection (1) of Section 2 of all the rates already included in subsection (3) of Section 1.  Surely that is adding to the verbosity of the Bill in an entirely unnecessary way?  If it is necessary to have the main part of subsection (3) of Section 1 and the main part of subsection (1) of Section 2 as separate main parts, would it not be better that the rates would be put down in the one schedule, rather than twice?  It will mean that people will have to do what I had to do, namely, to check each rate so as to make quite sure it is the same in both places.</P>

      <P>I should like some information in relation to subsection (3) of this Section 3.  The last paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but so that, if the amount by which the income of either falls to be reduced under <i>subparagraphs</i> (i) and (ii) of this paragraph exceeds the amount of that income, the income of the other shall be treated as reduced by the amount of the excess.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, at any rate. Possibly it may mean other things to other people.  It says &ldquo;if the amount by which the income of either falls to be reduced....&rdquo;  Does that mean that if the income of either the husband or the wife is below £2,000 the balance would be available for the husband or the wife, as the case might be, or does it mean that only if the allowance brought the income down to nil the balance would be available to the husband or the wife?  I think it is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case of separate assessments for surtax purposes. I have in mind a case where the personal allowance is divided between them.  This provides that if the allowance when made available to one of the parties reduces the income to a certain level the balance shall be available to the other party.  For instance, the wife could have £2,200. Her share of the allowance is £300. That would reduce her income to £1,900 and therefore she would not be liable for surtax.  In that case would the £100&mdash;in other words, the amount under £2,000&mdash;be available to the husband or is it only if the allowances bring the wife's income to nil that the balance would be available to the husband?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This part of the Bill deals with the case where the husband and wife want separate assessment.  If there is a child to be maintained, then whoever maintains the child gets credit for that.  The section goes on to say that, apart from that, the total must be brought in and that by whatever amount the income of one is reduced the other goes up, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That still does not deal with my difficulty.  The last paragraph deals with a case where the share of the allowance either of the husband or the wife is not fully used up.  Does it refer to that share not being fully used up in reducing the income to £2,000 or in reducing the income to nil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the interpretation, I think it is unfair because it means an allowance will be lost. Take the case of a husband and wife where the total personal allowance divisible between them comes to £600. According to subsection (3), paragraph (ii), which provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>subject to the foregoing subparagraph, the deduction shall be treated as reducing their respective incomes rateably,</P>
      <P>I take it that their divisible rate would be divided equally between them.  If the total allowance is £600 it means that the wife's share is £300.  If she has an income of £2,200 the entire £300 would be allocated to her income and would reduce it to £1,900.  Therefore, £100 of that £300 would not be necessary because when she goes down to £2,000 she is not liable to surtax. Therefore, you are wasting some of the personal allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="194" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the situation is, where they have separate assessments, that you take the total of both their incomes in deciding whether they are liable to sur-tax and on to what sur-tax rate they go.  If you have, as Deputy Haughey says, a husband and wife entitled to £600 allowances and the husband has £2,200 and the wife has £2,200 income, and they decide they want separate assessments, they each get £300 allowance because their incomes are even.  It brings each of them down to £1,900 but it does not make each of them exempt from sur-tax. They are still assessable to sur-tax on the basis that their income is £3,800, and that £3,800 is divided between them.</P>
      <P>On the other hand suppose you have a case where the husband had £4,400 and the wife had £2,600 and again £600 in allowances.  They are assessable on an income, for sur-tax purposes, of £6,600 less £600 which is £6,000 and that is divisible between them in the ratio of £4,400 less £400 for the husband, which is £4,000, and for the wife £2,200 less a third of the allowances because she has a third of the joint income.  I do not think you can possibly lose allowances nor do I think you can go below sur-tax assessment level because you are asking for a separate assessment.  It seems to me to be a question of calculating the proportions.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;that time exceeded one month and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that the purchase and sale were each effected at the current market price, and that the sale was not effected in pursuance of an agreement...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there any appeal in the ordinary way to the circuit court judge on that? As I understand this subsection, it is the one that covers the exemption of purchases and sales where the security is held between a month and six months and it is necessary to show that the transaction is bona fide at arm's length.

      <P>&ldquo;...apply to securities purchased after the 22nd April, 1959 (the date of the Financial Resolution relating to bond washing)&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is perfectly proper; there is no element of retrospection in that because the Financial Resolution was announced on that day and passed on that day.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if the period between purchase and sale does not exceed a month &rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is fixed and there is no question arising on that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; or if, though it exceeds one month, it does not exceed six months &rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again there is no possible difficulty there and the transactions are not <i>bona fide</i> arm's length transactions.

We do not want anybody who is engaged in bond washing operations to get any benefit, but if he <Col N="199" /> has purchased securities and sold them, he is, therefore, properly assessable in respect of that transaction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say that I wish to raise a matter on Report Stage but I would prefer to mention it to the Minister before doing so.  It might not be desirable to raise it in public first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us some information in respect of general taxation on tobacco?  On the Second Stage, I mentioned that it was a highly unhealthy situation that roughly 25 per cent. of our total budgetary income comes out of tobacco alone.  What has been the trend in relation to tobacco consumption in the past three years?  I am not talking of the trend of the tax collected from that, because the tax has varied, nor am I talking of the straight consumption figure because that would not take into account some drop that might be due to an increase in taxes.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate that in the current financial year, shall we say, the tobacco consumption in respect of which he will retain revenue will be up or down or static compared with last year?  The difference there could be in respect of tobacco consumption could mean agonising nights for anybody in the position of Minister for Finance.  His colleague, the Minister for Health, recently circulated some information which leads one to believe that tobacco consumption may reduce in the future.  Certainly it is my experience that if one is in company at present and takes out a packet of cigarettes and offers them around, one finds far more people saying they do not smoke than was the case four or five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether that is just my experience or whether that experience is general, but if that is to be a general experience, and if the experience is to be that according as the existing habitual tobacco smokers die off, there will not be the same number of new people coming in for this habit, to use one word for it, then I think anybody who is Minister for Finance will find himself in queer street.  Between £25,000,000 and £26,000,000 approximately is the amount we get in an ordinary year from tobacco at present rates of tax, <Col N="202" /> excluding any question of tax on stocks.  Last year, because of the increase in duty, there was a tax on stocks then held.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty unpleasant vista in front of the Minister for Finance and I should like to know what is the situation as the Minister visualises it at the moment.  I should like also to know what is the amount of tax payable in respect of the packet of 20 cigarettes of the popular brands, Afton, Players, Gold Flake and the rest of them, the ones which are not filter tipped.  What is the tax proportion of the amount that is payable in respect of a 20 packet?  If the Minister has the information, I should also like to know the tax proportion of the 2/7d. paid in respect of the ordinary filter tipped brands?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Deputy that tobacco is a very important item, so far as the Exchequer is concerned.  We estimated the consumption, if the Deputy looks it up, at practically the same as last year and I am told that for the first three months the estimate was correct.  The element of duty on the ordinary 20 Sweet Afton packet, and the other popular brands, is 2/1d. They are retailed at 3/1d. and the duty is 2/1d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And can the Minister tell me what is the element of duty on the filter tipped, similar brands sold for 2/7d.?  I suppose the difference is 6d.  Of course there would be some retail margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proportionately less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it works out at the same proportions.  When the Minister says he estimated the same as last year, does that mean approximately the same, excluding the amount he got from tax on stocks last year, or including it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite clear that under this Section the Minister is going to get the whole 12 months' tax on tobacco in the current financial year and that there will not be, as a result <Col N="203" /> of this arrangement, a tendency to hold back withdrawals from bond in March of any financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how they can.  What happened before this arrangement was made was that they paid duty when taking the tobacco out of bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not apply to other dutiable articles, at least some of the bigger ones.  It was a sort of monthly account.  They wanted the same facilities and the only objection I could make was that the Exchequer would be out of its money until they did make that good to us.  This twopence halfpenny per lb. is calculated to bring in sufficient to finance something like an average of £2,000,000 the whole year, through the Exchequer standing out of that money.  It will finance that to about 4½ per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 12 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1932, is hereby amended by the deletion of &lsquo;and are not obtainable or likely to be obtainable in Saorstát Éireann&rsquo; and by the insertion of &lsquo;and the said Minister for Finance, after such consultation as aforesaid, so thinks proper,&rsquo; before &lsquo;the Revenue Commissioners may&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The description of goods being imported, where a duty free licence can be given, caused some difficulty. The words used, where a duty free licence can be given, are that: &ldquo;the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is satisfied that any articles... are essential to the process of any manufacture ... are not obtainable&rdquo; in the State, and so on. To give a strict interpretation to the words not a kind obtainable in the State would make it very difficult indeed.  For instance, there might be <Col N="204" /> some raw materials being manufactured in this State which were not really sufficient or perhaps not even of the proper quality and therefore this amendment is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is also another difficulty.  A person could practically demand the raw materials free of duty if they were not available in this country.  For example, a tobacco manufacturer, under a strict interpretation of the Act, could demand all the tobacco he needs, free of duty, for the purpose of his manufacture.  The amendment is brought in to get over these difficulties and to make for more smooth working in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If that demand is correct as an interpretation, surely the amendment does not cover a demand that is made before the passing of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now worded more at the discretion of the Minister concerned than it was.  I think that covers the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does not cover anything between this date and the passing of the Act.  The Minister has now given away his view of the law and anybody who wants to slap in a demand can slap it in to-morrow. I shall be most amused if manufacturers do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I welcome this improvement in the section because I think it will undoubtedly make for the smoother working of these arrangements.  I should also like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the persons who work this section, both in the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the Revenue Commissioners. I know from practical experience that this is one of the most important provisions in the whole customs code and, were it not there, and were it not for the efficient way it is worked, there would be endless bottlenecks in manufacturing industry and commerce generally.  I also know that the operation of the section calls for quick decisions and expert judgment, practically every day of every week, and the officials responsible <Col N="205" /> have always shown that they are prepared to take a sensible view of things and they try to assist and facilitate business people where they can, while at the same time complying, of course, with the overall requirements of the customs code.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable that we should avail of this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to these men who operate this section in very difficult circumstances.  In so far as this amendment of the section will make their work easier, or give them greater facilities for helping the commercial community, it is particularly welcome.</P>

      <P>(4) On and after the 1st day of August, 1959, entertainments duty shall not be charged or levied on payments for admission to any entertainment which consists solely of an exhibition of any game or sport which is played or contested by two or more persons or by two or more groups of persons.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Amendment No. 16 comes within this.  The effect of this amendment is to exempt all sport.  I think that it was back in 1916 that sports were first brought under the <Col N="206" /> law of duty or tax, but gradually, through the years, they have been taken off the list.  Under Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1934, all outdoor sports were exempted and most of the indoor sports were exempted from time to time.  As that long list in the Schedule under Amendment No. 16 will show they have been taken away piecemeal and very few now remain.  All indoor amateur sports are now exempt.  With boxing coming out, there are only a few of the professional sports left that would be liable to duty if they should ever be promoted here, and I thought it well to bring in this amendment to remove all sports, both indoor and outdoor, from entertainments duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is an eccentric attitude to take but I should like to distinguish between amateur boxing and professional boxing.  I think amateur boxing under suitable control and direction can be a very desirable thing, and if proper precautions are taken&mdash;as I believe they can in the sphere of amateur boxing&mdash; to see that no injury is done to either party and that no brutality is engaged in, it can be a salutary thing for young persons to learn to defend themselves in that way under a code of rules which imposes self-restraint and control. Like any other game it is a useful voluntary discipline which helps people to meet the trials of life with dignity and Christian fortitude.  But I do not think that these encomia can be extended to professional boxing.</P>
      <P>Am I eccentric if I say I have not the slightest desire to see professional boxing included in the benefit of tax remission?  Do we in this House want to have re-enacted in Dublin the scenes perennially enacted in Madison Square Garden, New York?  I have not the slightest desire to extend any inducement to professional boxing.  My only contact with professional boxing filled me with nausea and disgust.  I remember once going to Madison Square Garden&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I must add the declaration that my visit was when Mr. Carnera was champion of the world and I had the distressing experience of meeting Mr. Carnera and, of all people, Jack Johnson.  I saw the proceedings there in Madison Square Garden and the annexes thereto, all the goings-on which constitute the background of professional boxing.  I want to say with great deliberation that I pity the participants and I detest the promoters, or at least I detest their <Col N="209" /> activities.  It seemed to me that they were a crowd of money-grubbing persons who were prepared to purchase into virtual servitude a number of individuals of pretty low mentality who were thrust into the ring, almost always in circumstances reeking of dishonesty and fraud, to undergo appalling punishment very frequently with ultimate disaster for themselves, and that the earnings of these unfortunate men very largely found their way into the pockets of the promoters responsible.</P>
      <P>I could not see then, and I cannot see now, any desirable result from the promotion of professional boxing. I believe it is done for an unworthy purpose.  I believe its consequences are frequently disastrous to the participants and I believe the only people who derive any benefit from it are those who have a pecuniary interest in promoting the competitions.  I am credibly informed that the whole business of professional boxing reeks of corruption and dishonesty and that the atmosphere surrounding it is one very largely&mdash;not exclusively but very largely&mdash;of revolting sadism.  I believe if people take an interest in boxing as a sport they will ordinarily confine themselves to the promotion of, and attendance at, amateur displays where a decent standard of conduct is rigidly enforced and adequate provision is made to ensure that the participants will not suffer irremediable injury.</P>
      <P>I think it is commonly stated that to be a successful professional boxer there must be promoted within a man the killer instinct and unless a human being can be sufficiently degraded to be sent into the ring with no other purpose in his mind than to inflict the maximum injury possible on the other man his prospects of becoming a successful professional boxer are remote.  Does Deputy Russell seriously desire to see professional boxing promoted in this country?</P>

      <P>My indictment of this is that professional boxing is promoted primarily for the advantage of the promoter, that the professional boxers are in fact exploited and that it is not a desirable business to promote in this country.</P>
      <P>I want to make the case that the strongest possible evidence has been adduced, in professional papers of the highest standing in Gt. Britain, that extensive permanent injury is habitually done to the participants in professional boxing and that a very considerable number of those who continue in the business of professional boxing suffer irreparable brain injury. I think those who make that case will be prepared to concede that, under proper control and direction, these consequences do not flow from amateur boxing, where a different kind of glove is used, where more elaborate precautions are taken to protect the contestants and to discourage an attitude of mind which induces one of the contestants to seek to inflict on the other injuries, if that be the only way to secure a victory in the contest in which he is engaged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  This is exempting from taxation professional boxing and I want to make the case to the House that we should not exempt it.  Is that not the idea?  I think we might as well exempt bull-baiting. If I brought in a proposal here that we should insert cock fighting, Deputies would get up, raise their <Col N="212" /> hands in holy horror and say that I was a savage.  I would be obliged to reply: &ldquo;Well, the cocks like fighting.&rdquo; But I have no reason whatever to believe that professional boxers like it. The poor cocks get nothing out of it but the animal satisfaction of fighting, though they do get that.  The professional boxer does not.  He goes into the ring to suffer these injuries in the hope of getting money, of getting security, of getting ultimately a sufficiency to enable him to establish himself in modest security.  I am much more solicitous for men than I am for cocks.</P>
      <P>There is a certain kind of mentality in this country which is much more concerned to protect animals from cruelty than to protect human beings. I am concerned to protect human beings much more than I am to protect animals; yet I recoil with loathing from the sport of cock fighting and I would oppose its promotion in any way I could.  For much graver reasons, I want to put it to the House at this stage that we go no further than withhold from professional boxing tax exemption.</P>
      <P>I think a very strong case could be made for prohibiting professional boxing in this society.  In fact, I would be prepared to promote a Bill to prohibit professional boxing.  I think it is a barbarous, detestable, indefensible and, I might almost say, unchristian occupation, <i>pace</i> Mr. Tunney, who is a most pious and Christian man.  I think I would be prepared to argue with him that, on reflection, battering other men into a state of unconsciousness for money and public entertainment is a shocking thing.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear somebody else argue the other side of the case.  I should like to hear Deputy Russell on it&mdash;and I am not trying to put Deputy Russell out on a limb.  I should like to hear some rational Deputy make the case for professional boxing, distinguished from bull-baiting or cock fighting.</P>

Is that not so?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not quarrel with the Deputy over the fine distinction he makes.  He lost his capacity for maintaining a perpendicular attitude seven times.  How far that differs from unconsciousness is something I am not prepared to pass upon.  I assume that the natural desire of a biped is to be perpendicular rather than horizontal and I think I am entitled to assume that if seven times he assumes a horizontal position it is due to some defective consciousness which divorces him from his natural instinct to remain upright.  In any case, that divorce was effected seven times by violence within two minutes&mdash;because they were three-minute <Col N="214" /> rounds and the round was not allowed to finish.  I would say quite honestly that I think that is a barbarous, beastly, detestable occupation for civilised people to engage in and I recoil from the proposal to exempt it from entertainment tax.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to go the length to-day of prohibiting it at this stage, though I shall reserve my right to supply the defect hereafter.  I do ask the Minister to pause and consider, has he weighed up fully the implications of appearing to give his approbation to professional boxing by this specific tax exemption.  I think Dáil Éireann ought to pause before it does that.  I am prepared to argue that we should not approve of it, that we should condemn it; and recoil from the suggestion that it is entitled to tax exemption.</P>
      <P>Is there any Deputy in Dáil Éireann who agrees with me?  I look hopefully at two lady Deputies up there, trusting that their kind hearts may be actuated to say a word on behalf of the suffering of those who take part in this racket. They are about to be regarded as supporting the proposition that this occupation is one which they desire to support by tax exemption.  I do not believe either of them do.  I look to other Deputies in the Fianna Fáil benches who, I believe, share my point of view.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can take offence if some of us say to him that in listening to the representations that have been made to him, he has, perhaps, erred on the side of indulgence. I have no reason to believe that the Minister for Finance shares Deputy Russell's approbation of this occupation. I think very probably his attitude is one of indifference to it and lack of interest.  But I want to suggest to him that his proposal does not present to the public a clear indication of that complete impartiality on this subject because he does appear to be going to the point of helping to promote such contests in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to do that.  If any of the well-known international promoters had in contemplation the promotion of an international professional boxing <Col N="215" /> contest for the city of Dublin or anywhere else, my reaction would be to say: &ldquo;We do not want you.  It is a free country, but if you come here you will pay the full income tax habitually levied on lawful exhibitions of this kind.  The Government offer you no encouragement whatever and would be just as happy if you stayed away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not prepared to go to the extent of taking the step of prohibiting professional boxing, although I think we would be justified in going that extra step and in saying: &ldquo; Amateur boxing, yes; professional boxing, no,&rdquo; because, if we will not allow a dog to bait a bull, if we will not allow cocks to fight cocks, if we will not allow dogs to fight dogs, then surely we should not promote in this country the practice of inducing with fantastic financial rewards men to fight men for the amusement of all sorts of people, and I use that phrase in deference to Deputy Russell because, but for his declaration of interest in this matter, I would have been inclined to employ a pejorative description for those who attend professional boxing matches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the point of view I hold may be simply summarised by saying that professional boxing does not seem to me to be a sport in the full sense of the word at all.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that when it becomes a very big financial racket, as it is apt to be, it ceases to be a sport at all.  As I understand it, the concessions are primarily to encourage people not only to look at exhibitions of sporting activities but also subsequently to learn from them and to take part in them themselves. I feel that as far as professional boxing is concerned, it is apt to become a rather horrible spectacle and I agree with much, if not all, of what Deputy Dillon said.  By reason of the fact that it is not basically a sport, we should not be persuaded to accept this suggestion which, I gather, is to a certain extent influenced by consideration of tourist attractions, that some people feel we would bring a great number of tourists here if we had big world contests of this sort.  We are trying to boost our tourist traffic to the very maximum, but I agree with Deputy <Col N="216" /> Dillon that we should be able to produce better spectacles for the attraction of tourists than some&mdash;I would not say all&mdash;of the professional boxing matches which are taking place.  This matter is one which deserves further consideration and I do not imagine that there would be any great objection from any quarter in this country if the word &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; were inserted before &ldquo;boxing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally do not see any objection to the encouragement of professional boxing in this or any other country.  In spite of Deputy Dillon's long and somewhat highly coloured description of professional boxing, I have seen some very fine professional fights and some very gory amateur fights.  I must say I enjoyed the professional fights in this case and certainly did not enjoy the amateur efforts.</P>
      <P>There is substance in what Deputy Dillon said about the promoters or, shall we say, those associated in some instances with this sport of professional boxing.  But if our criticism of a sport was based on the fact of not liking or suspecting those associated with it, we might also bring in horse racing or similar types of entertainment. I do not think that anybody would suggest for one moment that because certain individuals associated with horse racing are suspected of being crooked or dishonest, we should ban horse racing here.  Whether we like to admit it or not, professional boxing is an accepted form of sport&mdash; perhaps &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo;, as Deputy Booth says, might be a better word&mdash; in almost every country in the world.</P>
      <P>It is quite wrong to compare professional boxing with cock fighting or bull fighting where the unfortunate animal has no choice but to do as it is trained or forced to do.  Surely a human being&mdash;a man trained perhaps as an amateur and who has specially excelled himself in amateur ranks&mdash;has a perfect right to step into the professional ring and earn his living there, if he so desires, doing so of his own volition and knowing that it is, as Deputy Dillon described, a dangerous occupation.  That is happening every day of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> If you do not give some encouragement in this country to professional boxing, that will not stop Irish lads from going across the channel, as they do, and engaging in professional boxing in England, the United States or elsewhere.  Of course, let me be quite frank.  In every form of sport, I would prefer the amateur code, but the fact that one prefers the amateur code should not prevent any young man, whether a professional jockey, a Rugby League professional or a professional boxer, from earning his living through his own prowess at some form of professional sport and I think he should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>The days are gone when sport was the occupation of gentlemen and the entertainment of gentlemen in this country.  I take the view that in the case of any lad competent to earn his living in any form of professional sport, nothing should prohibit him from doing so if he is prepared to take the risk and all the other objections that go with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The first question Deputy Dillon asked me was: did I like professional boxing.  Certainly I do like it, if it is a good boxing match.  I like a good amateur fight, too.  I do not see any reason why we should seek to stop the encouragement of professional boxing in Ireland.  I do not see any objection to it, in spite of what Deputy Dillon said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this.  What this amendment as such suggests is that apart from the Bill itself&mdash;Section 12 of the Bill originally covered boxing&mdash;so-called sports other than boxing should be included.  What about all-in wrestling?  Is that a sport? I have never seen or heard of any all-in wrestling that could be described as a sport by any reasonable person.  It is certainly considerably nearer to crude brutality than professional boxing and yet under subsection 4 we are deliberately encouraging all - in wrestling.  It does not seem to me that there is a case for a prohibition&mdash;I do <Col N="218" /> not go quite so far as Deputy Dillon in that respect&mdash;but there is a great difference between prohibiting something and giving it express statutory encouragement and that is what the remission of taxation in this way is doing.</P>

      <P>I have no very strong views on professional boxing or wrestling or any of those things, but as Deputy Sweetman has just pointed out, in the original section as it stands&mdash;not in the amendment&mdash;the question of boxing was dealt with.  I was asked by, I think, the Dublin Tostal Council if we could exempt professional boxing because they might organise a contest during the Tostal season.  I do not know whether they did or did not.  The way I looked at it was that we were getting no revenue from it.  We got no revenue whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be wrong.  There has been professional boxing in Ireland.  Entertainments duty has been charged in respect of it and, therefore, there must have been some revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, it is a revenue tax and we got no revenue whatever from it, so I thought we should not keep it but that we should get rid of taxation on those sports, including wrestling which Deputy Sweetman mentioned.  If Deputy Dillon or anyone else has strong views on this matter they should bring in a Bill to deal with it.  This is not the way to <Col N="219" /> do it.  Let it be dealt with on its merits whether promoted or not but to deal with it by prohibitive taxes is not the right way to do it.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with just one matter which was mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  As I said, I have no strong views one way or the other, but I should just like to say that I read what Deputy Dillon referred to as the opinions of very reputable professional men on the evils and the injuries that resulted from professional boxing.  A few weeks afterwards, I saw a reply from equally reputable men who said there was nothing in that, so there you have a difference of opinion.  Those men signed a second statement saying that, in their experience, professional boxing, when properly promoted, held no danger and they actually gave the statistics of the deaths and injuries, which appeared to be very low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They gave the figures of those who had been killed or injured, and certainly the figures were very low, and there was no great case made about it.  My point is that it is a revenue tax which is of no use and, as a request was made to me, I agreed to remit it as it was no use as a means of revenue.  If Deputy Dillon wants to deal with it, he should bring in a special Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the case that what we are doing now in exempting professional boxing at the request of the Tostal Council is a disaster.  The implication is that we want to glorify the promotion of such contests in Dublin as a Tostal attraction. I do not; I am opposed to it. The Minister for Finance is being less than frank with us when he says that he saw the expression of opinion to which I referred and subsequently saw an equally authoritative expression of <Col N="220" /> opinion from an equally representative group of medical persons.  The first group of medical persons were persons who could at least profess to be independent observers, whereas the second group avowed themselves to be attached to the Boxing Board of Control, charged with the responsibility of making a case for professional boxing.  Interestingly enough, the Minister agrees with me that in making their statement on behalf of professional boxing, they went into the statistics of deaths and permanent injuries.  Well, you know, that is not a very convincing case.  They at least admit that deaths and permanent injuries arise from what is described as a sport.</P>
      <P>I agree with the view expressed by Deputy Russell that a fellow will know what he is going into, and does so at his own peril, in distinction from the animals, but there is this fundamental difference: these are poor men in the vast majority lured by fantastic monetary reward.  Why does Deputy Russell shake his head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the monetary reward at the outset is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the ultimate objective of these unfortunate youths is to attain to a day when they will arrive at the greater rewards of the profession.  That is why they become professional boxers.  Deputy Russell says he does not see anything wrong in that and I am saying that I do not think Dáil Eireann ought to put its seal of approval on promotions of that character.  I see everything wrong with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Sweetman's distinction between boxing and all-in wrestling which he says is an even more revolting occupation.  He may be right and I may be wrong, but I have gone into the matter with some care and I believe that a more benevolent body of citizens than all-in wrestlers it would be hard to find. They jump on one another and hurl one another about the ring and gouge, bite and trample on one another, and never a hair is disturbed or a bruise left.  It is like ballet dancing.  They clap their hands loudly together when a mighty blow is struck, not a rib of <Col N="221" /> hair is disturbed, but the whole audience is thrown into a state of sympathetic excitement.  They lift each other up and hurl each other about the ring and like acrobats, they fall and make a loud noise without taking the slightest hurt.  They go from town to town <i>en pair</i> and grow long whiskers.  They shake their gory locks at each other and hurl each other around without taking the slightest hurt, and if inadvertently one hurts the other, it causes serious concern to both parties.</P>
    <P>I am told that all-in wrestling has, in fact, becoming a completely farcical fraud partaking more of ballet than of wrestling.  There are some people who enjoy it, however.  It disgusts me, but, from the point of view of the welfare of the participants in it, I am informed that, ridiculous and grotesque as the whole procedure is, there is really no need for solicitude in regard to it.  It has become notoriously a simulacrum of real wrestling and is now no more than a display in which neither party suffers any serious inconvenience in its prosecution.</P>
    <P>That is not the case in professional boxing.  In professional boxing we are dealing with an entirely different thing. In professional boxing the main objective is that the maximum injury should be inflicted by one man upon another, and that for money.  The whole prospect which induces young persons to enter into the business of professional boxing is the hope of ultimate monetary reward on the grand scale.  I detest that.  I believe it is all wrong.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise that, although I say all that about professional boxing, I am prepared at the same time emphatically to defend and to approve of amateur boxing under proper control and to advocate it for my own child and for the children of prudent parents.  I think that a perfectly valid distinction can, and should be, made and not to make the distinction is to allow one's heart rather than one's head to guide one.  It is a silly thing to send boys out into the world wrapped in cotton wool.  It is a good thing to train boys to meet adversity with fortitude, dignity and self-control.  Not all parents may feel that amateur boxing is the best <Col N="222" /> medium through which to teach them that lesson, but I am prepared to say that it is one of the best.</P>
    <P>I distinguish most emphatically and in the strongest possible degree between amateur boxing and the degradation of that laudable sport in professional boxing, which I regard as nothing more than the sale of man's bodily prowess for money, the bulk of which finds its way into the pockets of those who make little or no contribution to the sum of human suffering and injury which is the inevitable residue of professional boxing as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am against this remission.  I wish more Deputies who agree with me would express that view.  I sympathise with those who say that, while they would not remit the tax, they would be reluctant to prohibit the occupation. I would go so far as to say that, far from subscribing to the desire of the Tostal Council to induce international promoters to stage their contests here, we should, if necessary, go to the extreme of fixing them with notice that they would not be tolerated.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister give any consideration to taxing the hall on its capacity?  That suggestion was made last year by me and some other Deputies.  The Minister promised to look into it.  Did he find it impracticable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave it very full consideration indeed.  Various alternatives were suggested.  It was suggested halls should be taxed on valuation.  It was suggested they should be taxed on capacity.  A third suggestion was putting a specific tax on every dance, like a licence fee for every dance.  None of these seemed as equitable as this arrangement.  One could have dances where the profit might be £100 and the same tax would be paid in that case as would be paid in the case of a dance where a loss might actually be sustained because of low attendance. This appears to be the most equitable method of meeting the situation, namely, taxing on attendances and on prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, in his consideration of this question of fixing a flat rate, as Deputy Russell suggested, came across the earlier papers in respect of it.  I must confess that I was very attracted by the proposal to fix a flat rate and it was the procedure in Donegal at that time which made it appear impossible to me.  In most parts of the country, where a dance hall proprietor is making an application to the court to get his licences for the year, he specifies a maximum number for which he wants a licence.  If that were a universal practice throughout the country, it would be simple enough to fix a flat tax on that permissive number granted by the court.  The promoter owning the dance hall would know that if he exceeded that number he would be guilty of an offence and, therefore, he would try to pitch his number as high as he reasonably could, bearing the tax in mind.</P>
      <P>While that is the practice in Leinster and I think, also, in Munster, it certainly is not the practice in Donegal.  In Donegal, there is no question of any fixed number being inserted in the licence.  If the Minister could get a universal practice adopted by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, in relation to the licensing of all dance halls, he would have a very simple flat method of taxation available to him, which would save a great deal of trouble and would be even fairer than this method, but he cannot have that until that is done.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think that the effect of this section will be sufficient to save the cinematograph industry, if we may call it that, in this country?  I think it is doubtful. I do not know whether or not the Minister has available for the House a statement as to the number of people who are employed directly in that industry in establishments, quite apart from the desirability of there being built up here a film industry. It is clear that there cannot be a film industry built up in Ireland unless there is a prospering cinematograph-showing industry.  The competition of television and of sport, such as professional boxing; which has been relieved from duty, and all the other competition that there is with the cinemas from a variety of modern amusements that have arisen since the cinematograph attendances were at their peak, make it rather doubtful to me that the reductions that have been granted here will be sufficient to ensure that the trade remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in the difficult situation in respect of this type of entertainments duty that he wants revenue, naturally enough, but, if he does not give concessions in respect of cinema revenue, he will not have any <Col N="226" /> revenue at all very shortly because the attendances are so much on the wane. The best way of improving the size of his golden egg might well be to give further concessions.  I should like to hear from him what consideration he gave to that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman in that matter.  There is no doubt that the cinema industry is in a parlous state these days.  Anybody who has any experience of provincial cinemas knows that they have been suffering for some years past from falling attendances.  That is causing considerable worry as to the future of the industry to proprietors of cinemas and to their employees.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that, as Deputy Sweetman says, the Minister must cut his coat according to his financial measure but, as far as I can see, in this case it is a question of choosing between revenue and the complete decline of an industry.  I think I am correct in saying that, even after these concessions, the position in this country, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the position in Great Britain, appears to be very unfavourable.  I have not the figures at my disposal but I think I am correct in saying that up to 1/6d. there is no tax in Great Britain.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity of reviewing this entertainment duty because, otherwise, I am afraid cinema attendances will decline very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Russell said, that the scale of taxes in this country is higher than in Great Britain.  I am afraid we could not afford to bring our taxes down to the low level of the British taxes.  It would be a very big loss to the revenue.  What we have done this year will be of considerable help. The position is that we collected almost the same duty in the financial year 1958/59 as in 1957/58.  Therefore, it may be taken that attendances at cinemas were practically the same for those two years.  The point made, of course, was that cinema proprietors were not able to meet their expenses, in other words, that they were going over the line, as it were, from the green into the red, and were not able to make repairs or do any sort of <Col N="227" /> decoration on their cinemas, and so on, and that some of them had reached the point where they felt they would have to close down.  Deputies can take it that we are contributing, if you like, by this reduction in taxation about £150,000 between them this year and that will be a considerable sum when divided amongst the various cinema proprietors.  I think it will be a great help and we shall wait to see how it will work.  We shall know from the revenue we collect what the attendances are like and if, taking this reduction into account, the revenue will show that the attendances are being well maintained, then, I suppose, we need not have any great worry; we can come to the conclusion that cinema owners are doing all right. I think we can deal with this and see how it goes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am afraid I have not.  However, I know from the collection of tax that the attendance was as good in the 1958/59 financial year as it was in 1957/58.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information as to whether the attendance is keeping at the same level this year?  Particularly as regards the urban cinemas, it appears to be generally accepted that there has been a very substantial falling-off in attendances to such an extent that there has been quite a serious danger of a number of them actually closing down. I think that the reliefs given have not enabled the proprietors to pass on any benefit to those attending the cinemas. Consequently, while the reliefs may be of value so far as the proprietors' problem is concerned, from the point of view of their essential expenditure, they have been of no help whatever from the point of view of keeping up attendances.  Surely this is the aspect of the matter which will affect this industry, particularly in the urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is almost common knowledge that, generally speaking, except for one or two days in the week, the <Col N="228" /> cinemas have half or three-quarter empty houses, with the exception of one or two.  I think it would not be incorrect to say that the standard of films generally has fallen&mdash;possibly because the cinema proprietors are not able to supply the higher standard through economic causes.  However, it appears generally to be the position&mdash; in the city, anyway&mdash;that the attendances are falling.  I do not know whether the Minister has any up-to-date information on this matter and whether he would consider it from the point of view of assisting this industry to help its own development or its own existence by being able to offer to the patrons some attraction by way of reduced prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any information about the attendances since last March.  I could not give the Deputy any information on that.  I am afraid it would cost a very big amount to enable the cinema proprietors to reduce the price of seats.  So far as I know, there is no hope of that at all. When I was speaking to them, it seemed that their only hope was to leave the seating prices as they were and to pay less in tax.  Some proprietors told me that there was a tendency for people to go to a higher-priced seat than was their habit heretofore. Whether or not that is because they are better off now than formerly, I cannot say.  I think they took that as an indication that they would not necessarily have to reduce the price of the seats.</P>

      <P>As I said on the Second Stage, the Minister in his Budget speech got away with murder in this connection.  He succeeded in giving the impression to everybody who read the Budget speech the next day and all who heard it then that he was making some very striking remissions in relation to import levies. In fact, he did nothing of the sort and by and large what has been done in relation to the levies since Deputy Dr. Ryan became Minister for Finance has been divisible in three ways.  A small amount has been remitted altogether; a large amount has been converted from temporary taxation into permanent impositions; and a further <Col N="233" /> amount is now continued as levies here.  I want to get some clarification in relation to some of these levies that are now imposed by the Order.  I have the various notices that have been issued by the Revenue Commissioners and while I am sure there was every anxiety when these notices were being prepared to make them as clear as possible, they may be understandable to some people, but to my limited intelligence they appear to have passed beyond the language of ordinary everyday trade and commerce.</P>
      <P>I am not too clear, for example, what is the position in relation to imported newspapers.  I shall spare the Minister the castigation he deserves in regard to the levy on newsprint. I say &ldquo;the castigation he deserves in respect of the levy on newsprint&rdquo; because I remember what he said about it in 1956 and in 1957 when he was in Opposition.  I want to be quite clear what is the position in respect of the competition by imported newspapers with the home, nationally-produced article.  First of all, let me come to Statutory Instrument No. 63 of 1959 which is the one we are here confirming and Section 11 of that Article together with the interpretation that is set out on page 3 of the neostyled notice that was issued by the Revenue Commissioners originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that an Irish newspaper has to pay the 5 per cent. newsprint duty regardless of the size of the circulation.  On the other hand, a newspaper or a priodical&mdash;as far as I can understand the situation, it applies to periodicals just the same as newspapers &mdash;that is produced outside the State, if its circulation in the State does not exceed 6,000 copies, does not have to pay it on them.  It seems to me that there is a preference in favour of that imported newspaper or periodical.  It is entirely illogical that that should be the case.  The position would arise particularly also in respect of weekly newspapers which are printed just the other side of the Border in the Six Counties.  Some of those are ones with which I have little in common.  Some of them are good newspapers but whether they are ones of which I approve or of which the Minister approves, or whether they are ones of which the <Col N="234" /> Minister or I disapprove, it is entirely wrong that they should be enabled to compete on terms that are unfavourable to, say, Donegal weekly newspapers. I should like to hear from the Minister what will be the future policy in that respect.  The time has certainly come to remedy that anachronism.</P>
    <P>There is also a position, I believe, in respect of which an Irish newspaper produced in the State pays its newsprint duty on returns.  It has, in fact, paid newsprint duty before the paper was printed.  A foreign newspaper, if I may use that phrase for the purpose of describing something that is not produced here, brings in its paper.  If it does not sell it here, I understand that it can export the returns and obtain a drawback of the levy previously paid.  If that is the position, and it is only in comparatively recent times that I have been informed it is&mdash;I certainly did not know it was the position in 1956 or in 1957&mdash;that should be changed.  There should be the same provision relating to returns of each paper so as to provide, for example, if there was a difference in the levy between the one and the other, that the amount of the drawback would be limited to such a sum as exceeded what would be the 5 per cent. tax on that newsprint, as if it were for the newsprint duty instead of for the individual duty.</P>
    <P>I should like also, apart from that, to have some indication from the Minister as to what some of these references mean in this because I found it very difficult, indeed, to understand them.  Do I understand that the provision in the Order which makes golf caddie-cars and component parts liable to duty similarly exempts wheelbarrows and handcarts?  I cannot see what the analogy is between the two.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable that the Minister should make clear for the benefit of the House what is the ordinary licensing provision and the special manufacturing licensing provision.  Those, I think, were two different types of licensing provisions that were introduced for the first time last year.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us a list of the items, subject to levy, that are not <Col N="235" /> produced in this country or, if it is easier for him to do it the other way round, the list of the articles that are produced in this country which are also subject to levy?  It seems to me that the pattern there was in relation to special import levies has become entirely distorted now and that the special import levies are being utilised not merely by budgetary calculations for the purpose of providing revenue to balance the Budget but also that the articles upon which the levy is being imposed are being considered now from the revenue point of view rather than from the deterrent point of view.</P>
    <P>When these levies were first imposed for the purpose of remedying the deficit in our balance of payments, they had a twofold effect.  There was, first of all, the deterrent effect because it meant that the price of the article that was going to be consumed&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; in the technical sense&mdash;would be higher. Naturally, when the price of the article, as a result of the levy, was higher, less was going to be consumed.</P>
    <P>There was also a second effect.  The levies were designed to have and did have this effect.  The transfer of the amount raised from levy to capital account was going to prevent any inflation that might arise because of the amount of the capital expenditure by the State.  The Minister has changed from that, has abandoned the second completely and the anti-inflationary effect that was there has gone altogether.  To that extent, therefore, in so far as the levies are retained under the name of levy or duty, I think they would be about £3,000,000.  I think that £3,000,000 advantage in fighting against the balance of payments deficit has been thrown away completely.  I think I am right in saying that the amount involved now is a little over £3,000,000.  The amount that is left in relation to levy as such is nothing like so great but the Minister has transferred the many levies into the permanent customs duty code and in considering the advantages from a balance of payments point of view it is proper that those should be included.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister has <Col N="236" /> terminated certain levies and transferred them to permanent customs duties.  I am inclined to the view that a great deal of that determination is a breach of faith with the arrangements made at the time the levies were imposed. The Minister is aware, of course, that the levies were imposed because we were able to take advantage of the escape clause in our trading agreement.  So long as we were imposing levies for balance of payment purposes&mdash;nobody can deny they were so imposed in 1956&mdash;we were enabled under our trading agreements to do that.  Once we no longer deal with them on a balance of payments basis, once we are imposing levies purely for the purpose of obtaining revenue, once we have abandoned the second part of the reason for those levies to finance <i>pro tanto</i> the capital programme, then I think we are laying ourselves open to a charge of a breach of faith.  That is not a thing that should be done. It is one that may militate considerably against us in relation to future discussions for a future trading agreement or in relation to future action it may be necessary to take, if and when another balance of payments difficulty should arise.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss under this section the general balance of payments situation.  All I am going to say to that is that the Minister himself acknowledged in his Budget speech of May, 1957, that when he took over office, we were in balance on our external account but we are certainly not in balance now.  We are certainly in the red.  The extent to which we are in the red for abnormal causes is a matter upon which the Minister and I might disagree, but the Minister cannot disagree with me when I say he took over an external account on balance, because he admitted it himself in May, 1957, and that he has now got an external account that is out of balance.</P>
    <P>That is a sad commentary on a period of little over two years during which the terms of trade have been moving in Ireland's favour.  During the whole of the period, since February 1957, import prices have been gradually dropping and export <Col N="237" /> prices gradually rising.  It is in those circumstances, in which everything was in our favour, that we now have a trade deficit for the first five months of this year of some £11,000,000 more than last year.  Even allowing for the fact that some of that deficit may be accounted for by abnormal imports it is one which is substantial and which shows a drift in the wrong direction. We can only hope that for the sake of the country the drift is not one that will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I just want to say a word about the newspapers. Some time ago some of the proprietors of the newspapers published on the Six County side of the Border, which have a circulation on this side of the Border, made representations that they were suffering a great disadvantage because of the tariff charged on these papers.  After consideration I thought we should allow them continue to circulate without getting any advantage over the papers produced on this side of the Border.  As a result they were permitted to send their papers across subject to a tariff of one halfpenny a dozen.  I believe that is slightly more than the papers on this side have to pay as duty on newsprint. It is negligible but still it is a bit more.  With relation to the British newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to be a rough approximation, is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  With regard to the British newspapers, the British dailies pay two-thirds of a penny duty plus five-sixths of a penny import levy, which is a penny halfpenny. The Sunday papers pay three-farthings. There is no ordinary duty, I think, only an import levy.  On the sale or return of these papers they get a refund: it has been about 7½ per cent. over the last year or so.  It is far and away a much higher levy than the Irish newspapers have to pay.  It has been calculated at some 20 times more than the Irish newspapers have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Sweetman in regard to converting the levies into ordinary duties.  In most <Col N="238" /> cases they are protective duties and, in the case of protective duties, I do not think that it could be regarded as a breach of faith because our policy is to build up our industries and when it comes to the time when we can produce an article for ourselves we bring in some measure of protection. That is what happened in the great majority of these cases.  We were approaching a point where we could produce these articles here and we converted the levy, as it were, into a permanent protective duty.  I do not think it could be regarded as a breach of faith because we would have done it in any case, even if the levies had never been there.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to two matters of licensing.  This may be the answer. There is the ordinary licensing provision which also holds for articles to be imported free of duty.  I think we discussed this matter already on this Bill. Usually the licence is given by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and usually the reason given is that the articles are being used in some manufacturing process.  Under the import levies there is a different type of licence.  There is the special licensing provision but it can only be exercised where the articles are used for manufacturing.  There is no discretion whatever outside that.  There is a different form of licence used in the two and I think these are the two referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must excuse me for that.  The Deputy gave the impression that we had not done very much in this clause in freeing articles from the import levy.  Well, the list of articles is quite impressive.  I think I gave an estimate at the time that we would lose, by way of revenue, about £200,000 this year as a result of freeing these articles.  The amount collected is comparatively small because the list of articles is small.  The list is available in the library for any Deputy who wishes to see it.  The Deputy asked me for the list which is still remaining.  I have not got it with me but I shall send it to him.  It is comparatively small <Col N="239" /> and consists only of about 20 remaining articles which are subject to the import levy.  Some of these are articles which yield a substantial return and I shall let the Deputy have the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about 10 per cent.&mdash;£200,000 out of £2,700,000, if the Minister looks at the Schedule to the Order.  I do not quite understand this licensing situation still.  If the Minister looks at the Schedule he will see under the first item&mdash;&ldquo;Non-alcoholic beverages&rdquo;: &ldquo;The ordinary licensing provision applies to the duty mentioned at this reference number.&rdquo; That I can understand is the ordinary licensing provision.  If one goes to item 3 (a) it begins by saying that &ldquo;The ordinary licensing provision applies to the duty mentioned at this reference number&rdquo;.  Then it goes on immediately&mdash;I am reading from the neostyle, I do not know whether or not the Minister has the same one as myself&mdash;: &ldquo;The special manufacturing licensing provision applies to the duty mentioned at this reference number in so far as it is chargeable on articles other than those mentioned in the foregoing provision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot understand which articles have the ordinary licensing provision or which have the special licensing provision.  I am speaking about item 3 (a) at the bottom of page 8 and the top of page 9 of the neostyle that was circulated at the time of the Budget. I do not know if a printed copy has become available since or not, but certainly I have not seen one.  These were ones that were made available by the Minister at Budget time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the difference in having the special manufacturing licensing provision and the ordinary licensing provision both applicable in respect of the same class of articles, that is to say, those in Reference 3 (a), which appears to me to be the situation there.  The same situation, as far as I could see, does not apply in respect of any of the other references to the heads of duty.  In relation to the others, we appear to have either the ordinary licensing provision and in respect of No. 4, the special manufacture licensing provision.  Similarly <Col N="240" /> in No. 5 it is the ordinary one&mdash;No. 6 the special, No. 7 the special, No. 8 the ordinary and No. 9 the ordinary.  I should like to ask the Minister to make it clear to me why, of all the classifications, only No. 3 appears to have both licensing provisions and not any of the others.  I do not quite understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a long list of articles.  There were some articles in respect of which levy was terminated and duty was not imposed again&mdash;walking sticks, rods, pickles. The poor unfortunate taxpayer may now bring in rods and pickles but, seriously, the list of things excluded from levy is long in number but trifling in importance and the levy, as now existent, appears to be collectable to the extent of about 9/10ths of the amount collected last year.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister on this section&mdash;it is as good a section as any other on which I can make the request&mdash;what is the explanation of the customs figure that has appeared in recent weeks in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>?  I understood, as the result of the freeing of certain articles from levy, and as the effect of transferring the liability from levy to one of duty, that it was likely that the customs duty this year would be running at a higher rate than last year, but customs duty as well as levy are running at a substantially lower rate. The answer may well be that it is the effect of the tobacco provision that we discussed already.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 20, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (c) of section 35 of the Finance Act, 1941 (No. 14 of 1941) is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;£2,500&rdquo; wherever the latter figure occurs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase or raise the exemption limit for corporation profits tax from the present figure of £2,500 to £5,000.  I had a similar amendment down 12 months ago and on that occasion the Minister, while sympathetic, regretted that he could not afford to give the concession.  I should like to reiterate the arguments I put forward on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, this amendment is intended to assist the small and middlesized business, particularly the family business.  Having regard to the fact that the exemption limit of £2,500 has <Col N="242" /> been in vogue since 1941, that is, 18 years, it is high time the figure was revised upwards to at least the figure I have suggested, £5,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers have pointed out the necessity for creating dynamic progress, particularly in the private sector of the economy, and I suggest that this comparatively small amendment would be something towards that end.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, if a firm make a loss in one particular year and the following year make a profit, they cannot carry forward the loss for the purpose of corporation profits tax and that is another valid reason why the exemption limit should be raised, if not done away with altogether.  During the past 12 months, corporation profits tax has been completely done away with in England and that makes our position here more invidious than it was up to 12 months ago.  Again, I should like to point out to the Minister the desirability of revising this figure substantially upwards and I would suggest that the limit of £5,000 is a reasonable one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the companies could complain.  During the past two years, we have given them a number of reliefs which now amount to £1,000,000 in the present year.  These reliefs have been built up, as I say, over the past two or three years and this year, for instance, the reduction of 6d. in the ordinary rate of income tax will benefit a company with £5,000 profits&mdash;which Deputy Russell proposes to relieve to the extent of another £162 &mdash;to the amount of £119.  We have done something for small companies. We have almost done as much as the Deputy suggested last year.  I do not think I could agree with the Deputy that Britain has done away with this tax.  This is a profits tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather involved. Where the profits come in between £2,000 and £12,000, there is a sort of formula for reducing the amount.  Take <Col N="243" /> the two countries in comparison.  A firm with £2,500 profits here would pay £875 and a firm with the same amount in England would pay £1,028.  On £4,000 in England, a firm would pay £1,790 and here £1,497, so that actually they pay a little more on profits in England than they do here.</P>

Ar na gaol-aicmí dá ndearnadh soláthar i gCuid II níor áiríodh leanaí buan-easlána agus beartaítear anois in Alt 8 den Bhille, liúntas de £125 sa bhliain a dheonadh do mhac buan-easlán amháin nó, más neamhphósta nó ina baintreach di, d'iníon bhuan-easlán amháin d'aon duine marbh a mbeadh feidhm ag Cuid II ina leith.  Beidh sé ina choinníoll ar aon dámhachtain dá leithéid sin an bhuan-easláinte a bheith ar an leanbh, más mac é, sula raibh 18 mbliana slánaithe aige agus, más iníon í, 21 bliain&mdash;is é sin le rá, le linn <Col N="245" /> an leanbh a bheith go fóill i gcleithiúnas ar an athair, de réir prionsabail na nAchtanna Arm-Phinsean.</P>
    <P>Toirmisceadh roinnt iarratas faoi Chuid II den Acht 1953 mar gheall ar an teorainn ama a leagadh síos sa Chuid sin.  Le hAlt 9 den Bhille seo, tá an teorainn ama sin á fadú.  Glacfar le hiarratais a dhéanfar laistigh de dhá mhí dhéag tar éis don Bhille seo teacht ina dhlí.</P>
    <P>Baineann Alt 10 le teorainn ama freisin.  Mhaolaigh an tAcht 1953 na coinníollacha maidir leis an dáta pósta chun cáiliú le haghaidh pinsin phósta i gcás duine a raibh seirbhís aige roimh an sos ach níorbh fholáir do dhaoine a bhí i dteideal chuige agus a raibh pinsin mhíchumais ach nach raibh pinsin phósta acu, iarratas a dhéanamh laistigh de dhá mhí dhéag tar éis an tAcht a rith.  Tharla i gcás duine a raibh pinsean míchumais aige sula dtáinig an tAcht 1953 ina dhlí, gur cuireadh an pinsean sin ar fionraí, áfach, i rith na teorann ama ar an ábhar, mar a bhí an scéal, gur thit grád a mhíchumais faoi bhun na teorann inphinsin.  Tugadh an pinsean thar n-ais ina dhiaidh sin ach, má tugadh, bhí sé ró-dhéanach aige ansin iarratas a dhéanamh ar an bpinsean pósta.  Ceartóidh Alt 10 an cás sin anois agus, ina theannta sin, déanfaidh sé soláthar do chásanna eile den sórt céanna, a fhéadfadh tárlú, i gcúrsaí áirithe, san am le teacht.</P>
    <P>I Scéim Óglaigh na hÉireann (Pinsin) lenar ghlac An Dáil agus An Seanad le déanaí, rinneadh soláthar trína ndéanfaí, faoi réir coinníollacha áirithe, féachaint ar leanaí a uchtaítear faoin Acht Uchtála, 1952, amhail is dá mba leanaí iad a rugadh de phósadh dleathach do na tuisimitheoirí uchtála. Tugann Alt 13 den Bhille seo an prionsabal céanna isteach chun críocha na nAchtanna Arm-Phinsean.</P>
    <P>Is é an lamháltas deireanach atá agam le lua, gach teorainn ama a bhaint amach maidir le hiarratas a dhéanamh ar Bhonn Seirbhíse (1917-1921), a gcuirfeadh a bhronnadh an duine a gheobhadh é i dteideal iarratas a dhéanamh ar liúntas speisialta. Labhras ina thaobh seo agus Meastachán an nArm-Phinsean á thabhairt <Col N="246" /> isteach agam tamaillín ó shin agus is ar éigean is gá dom a thuilleadh a rá mar gheall air anois.  Bainfear amach an teorainn ama de bhua ailt 14 agus an Sceidil.</P>
    <P>Tá na hailt eile den Bhille teicniúil iontu féin.  I leith forálacha áirithe de na hAchtanna, leagann amach ailt 5, 7 agus 12 an prionsabal ginearálta a rialaíonn cód iomlán na bPinsean&mdash;is é sin, nach féidir dámhachtana a dhéanamh a bhfuil baint ag pósadh leo ach amháin nuair a rinneadh an pósadh roimh an dáta urscaoilte i gcás galair nó roimh dháta na créachta i gcás créachta.  Beartaítear a chur as an tslí le Alt 10 rud is deacair a léiriú.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned in the main with the granting of concessions and the removal of anomalies in matters affecting the Army Pensions Acts, and I feel sure that Deputies will find no difficulty in accepting it.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide for the award of allowances to widows and children in certain cases under the Acts of 1923 and 1927 in which heretofore, owing to prescribed conditions as to dependency, only gratuities could be awarded or no award could be made at all.  This difficulty arises in some cases only; it does not, for instance, occur in the Act of 1932.  I think it will be agreed that, where widows and children are concerned, any question of dependency on the deceased husband or father is largely artificial, and the effect of Sections 2 and 3 is to remove the dependency conditions.</P>
    <P>In the same way, Section 4 is designed to adjust a position under which certain orphaned children of members of the Forces under the prescribed ages cannot qualify for allowances because, owing to the operation of the particular Acts under which the father received his pension, he was not in receipt of a married pension when he died.  This difficulty, again, is not of general application.  It arises only in the case of two of the Acts&mdash;those of 1946 and 1949&mdash;and there is a very strong case for its removal.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the &ldquo;prescribed annual sum&rdquo; for special allowance purposes is, in the case of persons married on or after the 1st October, 1942, the same as that for <Col N="247" /> unmarried persons.  The distinction operates to the disadvantage of such married persons and has no validity now, whatever its justification may have been when special allowances were first introduced.  By section 6 of the Bill, therefore, the distinction is being removed, and for the future, the appropriate annual sum will be the same for all married persons, irrespective of the date of marriage.</P>
    <P>In Part II of the Act of 1953, provision was made for the payment of allowances to certain relatives of deceased persons who had pre-truce service and who died as a result of circumstances attributable to service during the 1916-1923 period.  The classes of relative covered by Part II did not include permanently invalided children, and it is now proposed, in section 8 of the Bill, to grant an allowance of £125 a year to one permanently invalided son or to one permanently invalided daughter, provided she is unmarried or a widow, of any deceased person in respect of whom Part II would apply.  It will be a condition of any such award that the permanent invalidism existed before the child, if a son, attained the age of 18 years, and if a daughter, the age of 21 years&mdash; that is to say, while the child would still, in accordance with the principles of the Army Pensions Acts, have been dependent on the father.</P>
    <P>A number of applications under Part II of the Act of 1953 have been debarred by reason of the time-limit laid down in that Part.  By Section 9 of the Bill, the time-limit in question is being extended.  Applications will be accepted if made within twelve months after this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Section 10 also relates to a time-limit. The Act of 1953 relaxed the conditions as to the date of marriage for the purpose of qualifying for a married pension in the case of a person with pre-truce service, but application had to be made within twelve months of the passing of the Act by eligible persons who had disablement pensions but not married pensions.  A case arose of a person who, before the Act of 1953 became law, had a disablement pension which <Col N="248" /> was, however, suspended during the period of the time-limit because, as it happened, his degree of disability had fallen below the pensionable limit.  The pension was subsequently restored, but it was then too late for him to apply for the married pension. Section 10 will now adjust this case, and will also cover other such cases which, in certain circumstances, could arise in the future.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme which was recently approved by the Dáil and Seanad, provision was made whereby children adopted under the Adoption Act 1952 would, subject to certain conditions, be regarded as if they were children born in lawful wedlock to the adopting parents.  Section 13 of the present Bill introduces the same principle for the purposes of the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>The last concession which I have to mention is the removal of any time-limit for applying for a Service (1917-1921) Medal, the award of which would render the recipient eligible to apply for a special allowance.  I spoke about this matter when introducing the Estimate for Army Pensions a short time ago, and it is hardly necessary for me to say any more about it now. The time-limit will be removed by virtue of Section 14 and the Schedule.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are technical in nature.  Sections 5, 7 and 12 set out, in respect of certain provisions of the Acts, the general principle which governs the entire pensions code, namely, that awards affected by marriage may be made only if the marriage took place before the date of discharge in the case of disease or, in a wound case, before the date of the wound.  Section 10 is intended to remove a difficulty of interpretation.</P>
    <P>I hope that, taken in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, my remarks will have made its provisions quite clear to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the memorandum accompanying the Bill, one is forced to the conclusion that it is as clear as mud.  I doubt if there is <Col N="249" /> a single member of the old I.R.A. or of the Defence Forces to whom this Bill applies who could say whether it applies to his particular case or not. I should much prefer that the Minister, in his memorandum or in his statement introducing the Bill, had given us a picture of the types of cases he has in mind and in whose favour this Bill will operate.  It appears that it will be of benefit to a number of people, but who they are or what the type of officer, N.C.O. or man is, it is impossible to say.  I may be dense, but I have gone through the Pensions Acts to try to find out exactly to what type of person this Bill refers, and I find it very difficult to decide.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his statement, I admit, gave us some indication of the nature of the Bill.  The nature of the Bill can be summed up in these few words, that it will be of benefit to somebody and that the number is not large.  I should like the Minister to say how many are likely to be involved and what the types of cases are.</P>
      <P>I know that there is some part of the Bill that we can accept right away. The Minister says he is removing the time-limit on applications for a military service medal.  That was clear enough and that is a thing he has announced already as being his intention. It is a right thing to do and everyone can accept it.</P>
      <P>Again, in the case of children, where the question of dependency had to be proved, he is removing now a very unreasonable disability which applied to these children.  It is right that that should be done; but again, we have no indication as to the extent of its operation.  Are they to apply? How is application to be made?  How are these people to get information relating to this?  Will they be informed that, because they had applied before, there is a record in the Department, that this is so and so's widow who had some means at some stage or when her husband died in the Forces and therefore she was not regarded as totally dependent and entitled to a gratuity, and so on?  Will they be informed?  I think the Minister should tell them.</P>

If that is not done, it will be argued that some people, because of political affiliations or something or another, are the only ones who will benefit.  I object thoroughly to that, no matter what Government does it.  When a measure like this is brought in, it should be for the benefit of all who come under it.</P>

      <P>This Bill brings the 1923 and 1927 Acts into line with the 1932 Act.  There is nothing political about that, surely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of that.  The Minister has said that he is amending those Acts, but the extent of the amendment is as clear as mud.  To find out to whom the Act applies would tax the ingenuity of the most intelligent back-bencher over there.  If he did not have a talk with the Minister he would not know to whom it applies.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Bill because there are widows of officers, N.C.O.s and men of both forces who for one reason or another were unable to qualify.  There has always been a promise that an amending Act would bring them in at some stage but this Act does not do that.  There are people in both forces who are not covered yet. However, I suppose we must be grateful for what we get.  Every effort made to alleviate the hardship and suffering of the children and widows of those who serve the State is to be commended and I commend the Minister in so far as he has gone.</P>
      <P>I am aware of cases concerning officers who had disability pensions for pre-Truce service and who got married subsequent to 1922.  When they died their widows were not covered.  The point of view is that the widow knew she was marrying a person with a disability at the time she married him.  That matter should be re-examined.  I am aware that the Department know something about it and I should be glad if the Minister would direct the Department to have a look at it so that, even at this late stage, it might be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> The extension of the time and the increase in regard to the special allowance are very welcome.  I am surprised to learn that the number of applications is so large.  The Minister was wise in removing the time-limit. Whenever there is evidence substantiating a person's claim to a medal, he should get it.  I believe that is the correct view.  I have always held that view and I am glad that the Minister is taking it now.</P>
    <P>On the question of the allocation of medals, I am still dissatisfied.  There is grave dissatisfaction in regard to the whole question of verification.  I mentioned it when the Minister's Estimate was going through.  There must be some method that will give satisfaction and appear to give justice.  There is dissatisfaction that verification is not as it should be and is left to certain people in certain areas. I know for a fact that people who have been asked to verify members of the volunteers were people who could not possibly be in a position to give any information personally.  What they had to do was to inquire from somebody else.  That is unsatisfactory because if there is any dispute, either political or otherwise, between them, you can very easily get an adverse report.  Sworn affidavits, by people who had service, who are aware of every fact about the person concerned and in a position to testify whether or not he was a member of the Defence Forces, should be accepted.</P>
    <P>It is sheer nonsense to accept a report from anybody on this matter. That might open up a very wide field but where a volunteer is arguing and saying he is entitled, then I think sworn affidavits should be the order of the day where there is any doubt. Let there be an explanation as to why the name was not on the roll in the 1924 Act.  Everybody knows some doubtful names were included in that Act and other names left out.  I do not think that was done maliciously, but at the same time there is evidence to substantiate that.  I feel this is merely a piecemeal amendment.  I should like to have more time to examine the Minister's introductory speech and his reply before saying <Col N="252" /> whether I accept the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>

I hope the Minister will avail of Deputy MacEoin's invitation and explain by example how the legislation may affect individual cases.  My real purpose in intervening in this debate is to raise one case, not in relation to any individual, but as the type of case which should be covered by this type of amending legislation.  I hope I shall not be told before I deal with it that it is not in order.  I am concerned with the case&mdash;and I believe there are a number of them&mdash;of a widow who is entitled to receive a pension by reason of the services given by her husband in the Defence Forces of this country.  If a person who is entitled to a widow's pension under our present legislation becomes a widow at an age which permits her to do so, and takes up employment from which she receives payment from the Central Fund&mdash;do not stop me for a moment&mdash;she now finds that she is not entitled to receive her pension.  I have been trying to raise this matter from time to time but I have always been told it was the wrong occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, to my mind, is very desirable and welcome legislation in so far as pensions are concerned because, in recent years, a number of anomalies and difficulties of various kinds have come to light under the heading of disability pensions, and the Bill goes a fair way to meet such difficulties.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy MacEoin in connection with the very limited number of applicants for service medals who have been refused because satisfactory verification was not forthcoming.  I find from my short experience in the House, dealing with applications of this kind as a Deputy, that the Department of Defence is inclined to refuse the issue of a medal in circumstances where one of a panel reports unfavourably on an applicant's eligibility.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, the application forms, which are issued to applicants for medals under this heading, require the applicant to state the names of four people who were officers, or who are competent to verify his application. We find, however, from our experience, that the Department take it on themselves to issue query forms to other verifiers outside the four mentioned. It is quite understood, of course, that where any of the four might not be available&mdash;one might be dead or have left the country&mdash;it would be quite reasonable for the Department to substitute the name of another person and send queries for the relevant information.  I find, however, that, in quite a number of cases, information is sought from persons who could not reasonably be expected to be in possession of any facts which might make it possible for them to speak for or against the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a number of those cases also where one of the four or five people invited to give information might report unfavourably and the other three might report favourably, and the report of the person who reported unfavourably was very often taken.  There are certainly a number <Col N="255" /> of cases where applicants were refused in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill makes provision for the re-hearing of these cases.  The Minister could devise some machinery under the authority of the Bill to reexamine them.  I often feel myself that a very desirable way of dealing with such applications would be to have them examined at local level. The Minister would be justified in setting up a panel of inquirers to visit a particular district and notify such applicants to come along to be examined by this inquiring body, with a view to ascertaining whether or not they could qualify for the issue of a medal.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, the inquiries have been carried out through the post and an applicant was not informed of the exact reason which justified the Minister in refusing his application.  He was merely told that from the evidence available, he did not appear to qualify for the issue of a medal and beyond that, he got no information.  There is, to my mind, some justification for the appeal which has been made by Deputy MacEoin that such cases should be re-examined and that applicants, some of whom have been pushing their applications for a number of years, should now get an opportunity of a re-hearing.  The Minister, I would say, should give them the benefit of the doubt whenever there is any doubt in such cases.</P>
    <P>An appeal was made also for some amendment of existing legislation with regard to the payment to widows of disability pension allowances where the date of marriage was later than that already stipulated.  I know one case myself where, because of the second marriage of the applicant, his dependants would not qualify for the allowance, whereas if he had not married the second time, his first wife would qualify.  That probably is an unusual type of case, but there are a limited number of such cases throughout the country.  I should be inclined to suggest that the number is not very large and that the financial implication would not be considerable if the Minister were in a position to make provision <Col N="256" /> for border-line cases of that kind. These people are suffering from a sense of insecurity at the moment and just because the date of marriage happens to be a little later than that which was set down some ten or 15 years ago, they have no hope of being in a position to get something which would otherwise be forthcoming.  I sincerely hope the Minister will find it possible to examine into this point and try to give some relief in regard to it.</P>

      <P>It is wise to have the period extended and, from that point of view, this Bill is welcome.  There cannot be so many left now.  I am concerned mainly with two or three cases in which guarantees were given, either by the Minister or his predecessor, both to me here in this House and to Senator Ted O'Sullivan in the Seanad in relation to the dependants of men who lost their lives, who were murdered by the British Forces here.  I have one case in mind in the Carrigtwohill area where due to the circumstances in which an unfortunate man was murdered his child is still dependent upon charity.</P>

      <P>I think Deputies will find in the statement I made that the provisions in the Bill have been explained as well as they can be explained.  The case mentioned by Deputy Corry is being dealt with.  As Deputies know, the Act of 1953 included a provision whereunder an annual allowance of £125 would be paid to certain dependants of people who lost their lives or incurred disability in the period 1916 to 1923 on active service.  However, permanently invalided children were not included and we are now, in this Bill, extending the application of the section to include one permanently invalided son or one permanently invalided daughter of such people.  A son or daughter will now <Col N="257" /> be entitled under this Bill to an annual allowance of £125.  The Bill also extends the time limit for applications for allowances under the particular section by 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Army Pensions Act of 1953 relaxed the conditions relative to the date of marriage for the purpose of qualifying for married pensions.  There was a time limit of 12 months in which to make these applications.  A case arose where a person who had a disability pension prior to 1953 had not got this pension during the period this time limit was in existence.  In other words, his pensionable disability had fallen below the grade which qualified him for a pension.  The result was that during the period of this time limit he had not, in fact, got a disability pension, but the pension was restored later because the percentage disability increased later.  He was then too late to apply for a married pension.  We are now covering that case and any other cases of a similar nature which may arise in the future.  At the moment we know of only one case.</P>
      <P>I think the provision with regard to the appropriate annual sum for special allowances is clear and there is no need for me to go into it any further.</P>
      <P>Two other provisions deal with the removal of the necessity for the widow or children of a deceased officer or soldier to prove absolute dependency. I do not know how many will be affected.  At the moment we know of only one case which will be covered by Section 2 and three cases which will be covered by Section 3 of this Bill. Others may arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the extension of the time limit for applications under Part II of the 1953 Act, we know of 37 late applications in that respect.  There may be more.  Others may not have applied because they knew that the time for making applications had lapsed.  I cannot give any estimate of the number of new cases that may be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that marriages taking place at any time should qualify for married pensions.  That would be quite contrary to the principles which have always operated.  It universally applies, I think, that the married pensions <Col N="258" /> element in a disability pension is paid only if the marriage takes place, in the case of a wound, before the date of the wound, or, in the case of a person who retired due to disability, before the date of retirement from the Army.  In the 1953 Act, a big concession was given; the date was in fact extended to 10th December, 1932.  I think it is unreasonable to ask now that it should be extended still further, particularly when a second marriage is involved which took place after the 1932 Act had actually been passed.  The justification for extending the date to 10th December, 1932, in the 1953 Act was that the 1932 Act was the last of the principal Acts relating to disability arising from 1916-1923 service and it was felt desirable to fix the date of that Act as the latest qualifying date by which marriages should have taken place.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate for Army Pensions we had arguments about the verifications for medals.  I pointed out the difficulties then.  The present system seems to be the most satisfactory that can be devised.  When there is a conflict of evidence, there is no way that I know of in which to resolve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man will deliberately verify a person whom he knows in fact not to have been a member, it is doubtful if swearing will make very much difference.  It is wrong to suggest that, if there are three who verify but one who does not verify, we automatically rule such cases out. There is always some other consideration, such as the absence of the name from the rolls that were submitted. Certainly, I have gone through a number of these cases in very great detail and I feel quite satisfied that in any case where the due award of a medal has been refused the person had not in fact been a member as, otherwise, it <Col N="259" /> should have been possible to prove it. I certainly cannot think of any better system of verification and I do not think that the idea of looking for sworn affidavits in all these cases&mdash;and there is a very great number of them &mdash;would prove effective.</P>
      <P>The question that Deputy O'Higgins raised is not, as I said, appropriate to this Bill but he will be able to raise it when the proposed amendment to the Defence Forces Pensions Scheme is being brought in in the next session.</P>
      <P>Deputies will find, if they study the matter, that what we are doing is reasonably clear and, as I said in reply to Deputy MacEoin and Deputy O'Higgins during the debate, in any cases that we know of, where applications have been turned down because they were not covered up to this and which are now covered, the persons concerned will be notified of the present position and, in regard to other people whom we do not know of, there will be an advertisement published in the papers.  I do not see what else we can do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress on this Estimate on 11th June, I was dealing with the question as to whether or not it is possible to attach any value to the investigations that had been made into the costing of milk production.  I mentioned that even though it was not possible to reach the finality required in order to publish a report, nevertheless, the information that was obtained as to the costing of milk production at that time should be of some value.  It is, of course, unfortunate that there is not an agreed basic price fixed for milk or that we cannot get general agreement as to the average price at which milk is produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we found that, apart from the question as to whether or not the Exchequer should continue the subsidy that had been given for many years, <Col N="261" /> other complications arose.  One of our competitors on the British market had objected to Great Britain buying our butter when it was subsidised to the high extent that it was.  A very serious problem then arose and our Ministers dealt with the problem as satisfactorily as could be expected on that occasion. The outcome was that, instead of the subsidy continuing at the existing rate, a new arrangement had to be devised. The Minister then found it necessary to ask the dairy industry to carry a portion of the subvention which was necessary to enable the existing price of milk to be maintained.  That arrangement has continued over the past 12 months.  In the meantime, the price of butter on the British market has increased.  My information, for what it is worth, from people closely associated with the industry, is that the present price of butter on the British market is around 330/- per cwt., whereas it was only 305/- at the time the levy of 17/- was introduced.  The dairy farmers therefore now make the point that the situation has changed radically within the past 12 months and that that is a very good reason why the Minister should find it possible to consider suspending the present levy of 17/- on butter.</P>
    <P>We all know, of course, that the production of milk diminished rather seriously in the early months of this year.  According to the official returns which have been published here in response to a Dáil Question that was tabled some time ago, the approximate quantity of milk delivered to the creameries for the five months up to the end of May was 53,000,000 gallons and the figure for the previous year was 66,000,000 gallons, showing a fall of 13,000,000 gallons in that period. We also know, of course, that the bad weather experienced in the latter part of last year and the early part of this year was responsible for that serious decline in milk production.  However, it is a matter that we have to take notice of.</P>
    <P>The decline, too, may to some extent be due to a falling off in the cow population.  If it is in any way due to that factor, it is rather serious because requirements in connection <Col N="262" /> with the replacement of cows and store cattle would mean that the target which has been set here in the White Paper could not be reached or even approached.  That would be a very serious position because the store cattle trade is very important not alone directly to the agricultural industry but to the general economy of the country.  It contributed very substantially during the past few years to arrest the serious position that obtained then in our balance of payments. It is one of those very important sources we have to look forward to in the future.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is very essential that dairy farmers should be encouraged in every way possible, above all to maintain and if possible to increase, the number of cows under milk.  There has been a fear, not today or yesterday but for many years, on the part of dairy farmers that if they were to increase the milk yield they would eventually find themselves faced with a position whereby the price of the milk produced would automatically go down.  I do not know the reason or the grounds for that feeling but, if at all possible, I think it should be completely removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did ye not cut the price by 1d. a gallon this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later.  I shall make my speech now without any help, good, bad or indifferent, from the Deputy.  I am sure he will make his own contribution to this debate later.  Therefore, I suggest we continue in that way.  I was dealing with the encouragement I feel dairy farmers should get in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the cost of milk production in this country, compared with international standards, is rather high. I fear that that is something we cannot do very much about.  There is a variety of reasons for that position, which has been under review by successive Ministers here over the years. I am quite sure it was something they were very anxious to settle but, because of the difficulty in getting the co-operation that was necessary to bring about an improvement in that <Col N="263" /> trend, it was not possible to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the falling-off of dairy stock at the present time.  We know that the Government policy in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis has been that, if the stock-owners co-operate as they should, we shall have a very big problem to try to keep pace with the replacements necessary to maintain our animal population to the desirable level.  The people who are engaging almost exclusively in milk production are in the front line trenches.  The type of cow that seems to be generally popular in this country at the moment is known as the dual purpose cow.  It produces a reasonable quantity of milk and provides a suitable type of beast for export, or as the case may be, for dairying thereafter.  That type of farmer is generally on the small side and is dependent almost entirely on the revenue he receives from his sales of milk through the creameries.</P>
    <P>The price of that milk was actually reduced because of the levy that had to be imposed during the past 12 months.  There is also, and I would like the Minister to take note of the fact, a little reduction beyond that because creameries were obliged, during the past couple of years, particularly, to increase the range of their equipment to take care of the pasteurisation requirements of the Department and were also obliged to meet certain increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And storage charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>That had to come from the person producing the milk and it reduced, by a slight margin&mdash;I would say, 1/2d. per gallon&mdash;the price that would normally be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the case made at the moment by the dairy farmers with regard to the possibility that there will be very little export liability this year is correct.  I feel the Minister might reasonably examine the request they have put forward for a suspension of the levy during the <Col N="264" /> present year.  If he were to do so it would help considerably to secure the co-operation of all dairy farmers in the drive for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  I think the scope of cooperation which is at present forthcoming is only reasonably satisfactory. On the whole, dairy farmers realise that this is something that is imperative. Indeed, they have some reason to be very grateful for the extension which has more or less been given to the live stock industry in this country in so far as the final date for clearance is concerned.  It is a very reasonable extension.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the breeders and owners of all such stock to lose no time in putting their house in order in that connection.  I am quite certain there will be no further extension and that when the final date arrives we shall find ourselves in a position that if our stocks are not attested and accredited in every way the British market will be closed to our cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the question of milk, I would like to refer to the Dairy Disposal Company.  I congratulate the Minister on the efficient way in which the Dairy Disposal Company performs the job the Government assigned to it some years ago.  By and large, the farmers who happen to be suppliers to the Dairy Disposal Creameries are very pleased with the manner in which the creamery deals with them.  From time to time, encouragement has been given here by successive Ministers to suppliers to come together to form a co-operative organisation to buy out these creameries if they feel so disposed.  With the exception of one or two areas, I think the response to that encouragement indicates that the people are perfectly satisfied to let very well alone.  The relations between the staffs of the Dairy Disposal Creameries and the suppliers are very satisfactory in every way.  I feel they serve the purpose for which they were set up as also do the <Col N="265" /> co-operative organisations in their own areas.</P>
      <P>I think, however, the time has arrived when the Dairy Disposal Company should extend its scope to some extent.  If it were to continue merely as the receiver of milk for manufacture into butter I am afraid the position could not be regarded as satisfactory. We all know that co-operative creameries have more than ever in recent years extended their activities very considerably.  They have gone into many fields of industry, of course closely connected with the dairying industry in general, with great advantage to their suppliers.  They have embarked, collectively, on the supplying of manures suitable for tillage and grass and have been able to supply these commodities by virtue of that collective bargaining at very low prices.  Also, they have been giving these goods to the suppliers on a satisfactory credit-term basis.</P>
      <P>The Dairy Disposal Company has entered this field of activity too and with remarkable success.  They have also taken charge of other services such as insemination but there are yet many fields of activity which they could usefully enter.  In that connection the Minister would be well advised in due course to consider extending the number of personnel on the Dairy Disposal Board.  The present Board is a very efficient body doing very useful work but other interests should be represented on that Board.  I have always had a strong feeling that the milk producers as such should have direct representation on the Board, say one member.  I see no objection to it.  I see many advantages because it would create a better understanding in time of difficulty between the Board and its suppliers, thus giving the milk suppliers the feeling that they had representation to put certain matters which would normally have to be dealt with as at present through other sources.  Now that we have a responsible and representative milk producers' organisation I am sure they would only be too glad to co-operate and would appreciate any recognition the Minister might see fit to give them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with creamery organisation, <Col N="266" /> from time to time most Deputies have dealt with cases where milk suppliers, having withdrawn their support from one creamery and passed on to another, find that when they approach the other creamery, whether it be a dairy disposal creamery or a co-operative creamery, the manager is reluctant to accept the milk of that supplier.  In many cases the managers have refused to accept such transfers of milk and very often undesirable developments have followed.  These suppliers who transferred, and in nearly all cases transferred for some very good reason, continue to supply their milk to the new creamery and find difficulty in getting paid.  I do not know whether there is an arrangement in theory but in practice managers of the various creameries like to keep their own suppliers and do not take kindly to other suppliers coming to their creamery.</P>
    <P>Due to circumstances over which a manager has sometimes no control, occasionally a supplier will attempt to transfer.  Eventually the creamery to which he has transferred accepts him and pays him the money due for his milk and as a result a certain amount of suspicion and friction arises between the managers of both creameries. This is a matter that should be settled by arbitration and I should like to see some such machinery set up.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that a small board composed of two or three representatives, say one from the Dairy Disposal Board and one from the Irish Agricultural Society or whatever society represents the co-operative creameries, together with an independent chairman, should be set up to hear such cases and make a decision which would be binding on both parties.  This has been a rather vexed question for a number of years. There are a number of such cases in my constituency and I am sure in other constituencies.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to take some action in that connection in due course.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made recently for the publication of the findings of a number of advisory committees which were set up in the past couple of years in relation <Col N="267" /> to the marketing of agricultural produce.  We have in the past week or fortnight received two such reports. The milk producers feel that the report in connection with the marketing of milk products should be published as soon as possible.  It is hoped that when that report is published it will contain, like other reports, some suggestions as regards the marketing of creamery butter.  Those engaged in that industry have not been helping out the Minister as well as they might.  They are depending on a rather old arrangement which has not been revised very much, if at all, in recent years for the disposal of our butter in the British market.</P>
    <P>I trust that some body will be set up very shortly to push the sales of Irish butter in certain cities in England where it has not a high place at present in the market.  I understand there are a number of cities in England and Scotland where the sale of Irish butter could be pushed successfully. We should be in a position to keep up a continuous supply to these markets.</P>
    <P>If we established our own shops and kept those shops stocked with butter the whole year round, not alone could we sell our butter but we would be able to sell it most times at a better price than it has been able to fetch up to now.</P>
    <P>There are one or two suggestions I wish to make in relation to cattle and livestock generally.  The policy with regard to the various breeds of cattle has never been settled and from year to year the difference of opinion seems to grow wider.  It is generally accepted that a particular type of cow seems to suit our economy best but it is a very controversial point.  The ordinary man has no authoritative opinion available to him in this regard.  I hope the Agricultural Institute will examine that aspect of the problem so that there would be some reliable opinion available as to what is the proper breed of cow for this country, one that will meet our various requirements under existing circumstances and one that will be economical to maintain.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Agricultural <Col N="268" /> Institute was a step in the right direction and one that was overdue.  Our farmers are looking forward to the deliberations of this body and feel that quite a lot of information will be forthcoming in the course of time.  Let us hope that when the Institute has any findings to promulgate, those findings will be published in pamphlet form and distributed to every farmer either through the auspices of the County Committees of Agriculture or the local creameries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I carefully perused the speech of the Minister for Agriculture in introducing this Estimate.  There are certain queries I should like to address to him.  There is one fundamental question that I should like to ask Dáil Éireann.  Everybody in this House from the Taoiseach down seems to regard it as a desirable end to be aimed at that industrial development in this country should be based on the objective of a 40-hour week for industrial operatives at a trade union rate of wages, with overtime at appropriate rates for any industrial community which is called upon to make that contribution, but that in agriculture the aim should be that we should emulate the Dutch, the Danes or anybody else we think of in prescribing that the average small farmers should labour 14 hours a day to produce the maximum he is capable of producing at whatever price international markets are prepared to pay him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot reconcile these two concepts, more especially when I reflect that the fixed limited working day, with the rigidly negotiated trade union rate of wages, is, in the majority of cases, paid for behind high tariff walls, amounting in some cases to 125 per cent., supplemented, where necessary, by rigid quotas.  It is paid by the small farmers of this country for the clothes they wear, the utensils they use and actually for some of the raw material which they require for agricultural production upon which we ultimately depend.  When I recall that the farmers of this country between the years 1947 and 1957 contributed between 80 per cent. and 90 per cent. of our total exports and <Col N="269" /> that they doubled their volume and trebled their value in that decade, I wonder how long will this House continue to expect that the small farmers will respond to exhortation to work unlimited hours for uncovenanted reward in order that we may progress still further towards a 40-hour week for industry, with guaranteed rates of wages and appropriate adjustments for any overtime they want.  I think that is a very fundamental thing.</P>
    <P>I recall that the Emperor Hadrian was once heard to say that, having considered the livelihood of man, he came to the conclusion that society would not long survive without the institution of slavery and that, therefore, he was in favour of maintaining it.  He went on to say that if in any future generation this necessary institution were abolished, he could imagine a worse fate overtaking men and that was that slaves, having been liberated, should, as free men, be persuaded that all the conditions of servitude were desirable.  He went on to say that so long as a man is a slave by <i>force majeste</i>, he always has the prospect of deliverance by revolt, but if free men ever accept the concept that conditions of servitude are in themselves desirable, then they have no prospects ever of deliverance.</P>
    <P>I should like to see everybody work hard at his job but I should like to see him work under reasonable conditions. I should like to see everybody get a proportionate reward for the work he does.  If all sections of the community are dependent upon the output of the agricultural community, as they certainly are, then I think that common sense, quite apart from abstract justice, should constrain us to ensure that the agricultural community will get an adequate reward for their output, because, leaving abstract justice out, nothing is more certain than that exhortation will not achieve increased production unless those producing see the prospects of a fair reward.  It is equally certain, as has been demonstrated, that, given the prospects of a fair and certain reward, our farmers are capable of doubling and trebling their output and perfectly willing, by sustained effort, to do so.</P>
    <P>I recall to Deputies the admirable <Col N="270" /> demonstration we had of this in the case of eggs.  We made a trade agreement with the British whereby it was possible for us to offer our people, not an extravagant price, but a certain and moderate price for all the eggs they produced.  I think the value of our export of eggs rose nearly £5,000,000, if it did not go higher.  It showed every prospect of further expansion until the British themselves saturated their own market by a system of internal subsidies and created in the British market a situation of surplus in which they themselves became exporters of eggs, with the consequent destruction of our export of eggs to Britain.</P>
    <P>The important fact was that the moment the guaranteed price was provided, not of an extravagant character at all&mdash;2/- a dozen less, I think, than was being paid in Great Britain&mdash;at a level which gave our people a fair margin of profit ensuring them a very modest standard of living, output shot up.  To get that increased output required little or no exhortation.  Nothing was required other than the prospect of a moderately remunerative market in which to sell their output.</P>
    <P>I hear a lot of talk here about exhorting the farmers to increase their output.  It is talk to which I am prepared to subscribe conditional on one additional undertaking and that is that if our output be increased a market will be provided for it.  We heard a great flourish of trumpets two years ago when £250,000 was provided to carry out marketing research.  We have got the first two reports on market research, one on shell eggs and liquid eggs and the other on bacon and pig meal.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputies have read these two reports.  There is certain valuable statistical material contained in the report relating to eggs but does anyone find in this report any prospects of securing a market anywhere for eggs? There is a proposal to revive Eggsports, the central egg marketing machinery which the Fianna Fáil Government wiped out of existence when the late Deputy Tom Walsh was Minister for griculture.  There is a proposal to abolish the code marking <Col N="271" /> of eggs for the domestic market and there is a kind of half-hearted proposal to do away with the system of barter in eggs in rural areas, although I gather when it comes down to fundamentals they are not prepared to recommend that that should be done now.</P>
    <P>Suppose we do establish a central marketing organisation, where are we going to market the eggs?  They speak of providing a guaranteed price.  Suppose you do provide a guaranteed price what are you going to do with the eggs?  There are many people bouncing around the country talking about alternative markets for eggs.  There is no alternative market for eggs.  The British have too many.  The Continental countries will not take them.  I know, because I have tried to sell eggs in Germany.  I have tried to sell eggs in France.  I have tried to sell eggs in Spain and I have tried to sell eggs in Italy.</P>
    <P>There is some talk of a market for liquid eggs.  I should like to find out where it is.  I never found it.  If anybody really imagines that over the last ten or 15 years the Department of Agriculture has not examined, exhaustively, all that is here proposed they are just raving.  The Department of Agriculture has been looking for alternative markets for eggs for the last 20 years.  The Department of Agriculture has always thought that barter in eggs should be abolished in rural Ireland but successive Ministers have told them it was not practicable to do so.  It is far less practicable now when there is no export market for eggs than when there was a considerable export market.</P>
    <P>I always thought it a mistake to wind up Eggsports.  It seemed rather odd because at that time we had eggs to export.  I thought central marketing was useful and helpful but my successor in office in 1951 decided to wind it up, and it was wound up at great cost.  This proposes that it should be restored again.  The proposal to abolish the code marking of eggs on the domestic market has been considered 100 times in the Department of Agriculture.  I remember discussing <Col N="272" /> it myself and I took the view that it served no useful purpose but it was unanimously held by everyone representing consumers that it did serve a very useful purpose and my recollection is that all the technical advice I received was on the advisability of retaining it.</P>
    <P>So far as the report is concerned, there is nothing in it that I have not heard canvassed time and again up and down the corridors of the Department of Agriculture.  One question it does not answer is: if the people produce more eggs where are they going to sell them?  It is certain that if we provide a guaranteed price of 3/- a dozen&mdash; certainly there is no use guaranteeing anything less than that&mdash;that guarantee produced, in 1950, 8,497,000 long hundreds of eggs of which we consumed at home 5,000,000 long hundreds and exported 3,000,000 long hundreds.  Such a guarantee today would, in my judgment, with the increased facilities now available, produce very quickly an output of 10,000,000 long hundreds of which we would still continue to consume 5,000,000 and have 5,000,000 to dispose of elsewhere.  I wish somebody would tell us where to dispose of them.  If they did, there would be no difficulty about producing them but I found nothing in a close perusal of this report which suggested to me any advice as to how we should dispose of them.</P>
    <P>Then I came to the report on the export of bacon and other pig meat. I do not want to go through that in detail.  I think there is something to be said for considering central marketing but there is a great deal to be said on the other side for the value of existing marketing channels.  There is one thing which I am certain is a mistake here and that is the proposal to subsidise the export of Grade B bacon.  It may be done but, if it is done, it is going backward on a decision which was difficult to take in the first place and extremely difficult to maintain thereafter and which had the dramatic consequence that we increased the intake of Grade A pigs in the factories from something like 56 per cent. to 71 per cent. which I believe is a percentage which compares <Col N="273" /> favourable with any Continental producer.</P>
    <P>We know that that was a difficult matter to carry to a successful issue but I am satisfied it was worthwhile. If there was any change to be made in it, the only change I would suggest to the Minister is that I believe, as I said to him before, that the element of certainty which has so materially helped in stimulating the output of grade A pigs is being undermined by a lack of confidence in the producers in the system of grading operating in the factories.  I admit that while I was Minister for Agriculture I kept that perennially under review and felt myself that, by and large, it was operating reasonably satisfactorily and certainly that there was no element of abuse substantial enough to justify the introduction of a more elaborate system of inspection than obtained then and which obtains now.  I am not satisfied that that is so now and if the output of pigs is to be maintained there ought to be some steps taken to provide independent and effective supervision of grading in the factories.  Unless it is done, there will remain amongst producers a degree of doubt which will militate seriously against the expansion in pig output which is so eminently desirable.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a very significant and grave statement made by the Minister for Agriculture when introducing this Estimate, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 175, column 1398 :</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that Continental countries produce by and large the same products as we do ourselves.  In most cases, the whole range of their agricultural prices is supported at a comparatively high level and, consequently, their output, which is almost entirely for home consumption and independent of the vagaries of export markets, is very high.  Their import requirements are, therefore, marginal and their internal price structure is protected by quotas and other import barriers.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, these markets are quite important.  They have, for <Col N="274" /> example, provided useful openings for certain types of cattle and sheep. Deputies will also realise that when markets tend to be weak even a small extra opening frequently has a very marked effect in improving the tone of prices here.  We have, therefore, been following keenly the deveolpments in the Common Market in relation to agriculture. Taking account of the inherent conditions in agriculture in the Common Market countries and the policies indicated in the Rome Treaty, it is to be feared that there is little prospect of any substantial increase in our exports to the Continent.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I agree with the Minister in that estimate of agriculture and I would not sit down and simply lament these deplorable developments and throw my hat at them. If that estimate of the situation is true, and I have no reason to doubt it, what does the Minister propose to do about it?</P>
    <P>If it is true there is no prospect of substantially increased output if markets are not found to dispose of the increased output, and if we have come to the conclusion that there is no prospect of materially increased markets to be had on the Continent, what does that suggest to everybody? Is it not time we faced the fact that at Paris we expressed our readiness to enter into a free trade agreement with Gt. Britain, the Scandinavian Countries and the Rome Treaty countries?  The Rome Treaty Countries have withdrawn. Apparently the Scandinavian Countries, which are now known as the &ldquo;Seven&rdquo;, have some alternative proposal which the Taoiseach says does not interest him.  Is it not time we went to Gt. Britain and said : &ldquo;If you were prepared to negotiate a Free Trade Area for the whole Continent of Europe and ourselves, and the Continent of Europe have backed out, are you prepared to negotiate such a treaty with us?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mind you, we approach such negotiation in no mendicant attitude. We are the second biggest customer Gt. Britain has on the Continent of <Col N="275" /> Europe for industrial goods, and I directed the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that the British themselves are awake to the fact that if they want to maintain their present volume of exports and expand them, as I believe they do, they must have present in their minds that anything which contributes to the rise of standards in the countries where the bulk of their exports go will operate greatly in their own favour.  Therefore, it is in the interest of Great Britain to assist us to procure for our agricultural community stability of prices for all increased output, the maximum volume of which could never provide the British market with more than 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of its total requirements.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for External Affairs were discussing with Mr. Maudling last week in London, but one of the things which makes me exasperated is to read in this morning's paper that the Taoiseach gathered the whole Press of Ireland to engage in a whole lot of <i>brouhaha</i> about what lie is going to do, the hopes and the views he is going to entertain, the corners he is going to turn and the stones he is going to turn to see that no opportunity is lost, and there is not a bleeding word about the discussions that took place, apparently of most urgent character, last Wednesday in London between the Paymaster General, Mr. Maudling, on the one hand, and the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for External Affairs on the other, affecting the fundamental industry upon which all the industrial life of the country depends for its survival.</P>
    <P>You would imagine that nothing happened in London or you would imagine these two men had never gone to London or, if they had gone, that they had never come back.  Is it not exasperating that the same Taoiseach will get up and read phonetically orations in Irish to us and the man does not know B from a bull's foot in Irish and states he is going to be more Gaelic than ever he was?  At the same time, he tells us his heart beats passionately for agriculture and yet, at the first conference he gave after his Minister <Col N="276" /> for Agriculture and Minister for External Affairs went to London to discuss the impact of these developments on agriculture, there is not a whisper about them and <i>Pravda</i>, the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda</i>, is covered with headlines this morning about all the lovely things the new Taoiseach is going to do for Ireland but they have all forgotten the existence of mundane matters like pigs, and butter, and eggs, and fowl.</P>
    <P>Is it not amazing that Deputy Vivion de Valera is not here to tell us that the bottom has fallen out of the price of cattle?  He did, you know, when it had not fallen out of cattle at all, but now that it has fallen out, not only the bottom out of the price but out of the demand, there is not a peep out of Deputy de Valera and <i>Pravda</i>, over which he is now controlling director.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture would have no responsibility for these statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I understand Deputy de Valera is the controlling director.  The Minister for Agriculture, however, ought to have some responsibility for the fact that temporarily the bottom has fallen out of the price and the demand for cattle. My, my! If I were to be Minister for Agriculture at the present time, I can picture Deputy de Valera, instead of being perched above in the lobby, down here, tearing passion to tatters in these benches, and Deputy Moher, instead of sleeping blandly over there would be roaring like the Bull of Bashan about the awful circumstances of the farmers in Cork; but there is not a peep out of any of them.  Even Deputy Moloney here explains to the Minister for Agriculture that he would not wish to vex him for thousands, but he does venture to say to him he should give an extra penny for a gallon of milk, or, if he gave it back to him, he would be very grateful.  My goodness, it often makes me wonder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister for Agriculture, when he is concluding this discussien, what happened in London last Wednesday.  I have put down a Parliamentary Question <Col N="277" /> to the Taoiseach asking for that information to-morrow, but really I think it would have been appropriate if, for the purpose of this discussion, some information had been provided before now.</P>
    <P>I see at column 1399 the Minister has an announcement to make about the teaching of veterinary medicine.  As far as I know the teaching of veterinary medicine has been in the hands of the Universities for the past seven or eight years and all the professors of the Veterinary College were professors of National University or Trinity College. The only difference that I now see is that the professors in future are to be appointed by the two Universities and not by the Department of Agriculture. I hope the procedure of appointment in the future will be as good as the procedure that operated heretofore.  Professors chosen for this College under the procedure laid down by the Department of Agriculture were chosen by a commission set up for the purpose and representative of the best veterinary opinion in Great Britain and Ireland and whoever was the best man got the job.  The staff was very considerably expanded two or three years ago and I think compared favourably with any Faculty of either University.  I hope that under the new dispensation a similarly high standard will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that in connection with the reciprocity agreement with the British Veterinary Medical Council I gave their President an undertaking that, if there was any fundamental change in the basis uf veterinary education, I would give him full and fair notice of it so that they would have an opportunity of withdrawing reciprocity if they did not think it corresponded to the original agreement on which reciprocity was founded.  From what the Minister in his opening statement said I do not think there is any such change but it might be expedient to have the opinion of the British Veterinary Medical Council so that reciprocity can be in future maintained on the same basis of cordiality as obtained in the past.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the announcement he is in a position to <Col N="278" /> make at column 1401 on the benefits of artificial insemination:</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of artificial insemination can be seen from providing the service in parts of the West and North-West, where infertility had been a very serious problem and the use of communal bulls a risk.  In these areas such as Inisboffin and parts of County Mayo, the calving percentage has been successfully restored in a short time.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the farmers in that area will recall with gratification that the insemination centre was inaugurated by the inter-Party Government and that the excellent work which has borne such abundant fruit was established by the inter-Party Government. I think I had the privilege of inaugurating the service myself in the insemination station near Sligo.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister's statement at column 1406 when he referred to the abolition of Part B of the Land Project.  Let me say at once that no matter what is done in that regard the Minister can never undo the fact that, in his despite and that of his colleagues, we effectively reclaimed 1,000,000 acres of the land of Ireland. Nothing they can do can change that unalterable fact.  It is some satisfaction to reflect that 100 years hence when we are all dead and buried the monument will remain to the two Governments of which I had the honour to be a member that they inaugurated and prosecuted the Land Project to the point at which it was when Fianna Fáil began the process of dismantling it which they are now maliciously pursuing.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to the Minister. It was a vicious thing to wind up Section B of the Land Project with no notice whatever.  There is not the slightest doubt that the Minister's predecessor, the late Deputy Tom Walsh, when he distributed the machinery which was being operated by the Department itself pressed a large number of young fellows in this country to buy that machinery and to buy new machinery to operate as contractors for the Department under Part B of the scheme.  I know of a person <Col N="279" /> who had saved a bit of money in England and who came home at that time and invested that money in machinery and married here.  I know of two brothers, one of whom is married, one of whom is still a single man, who came home and jointly invested their entire savings in machinery designed to service Part B of the Land Project.  Both of them must now go back to England penniless because they cannot sell the machinery, one of them leaving a wife and children here after him.</P>
    <P>That is just vicious; it could not have made all that difference to the Minister to have given these men, say, two years' notice.  If he had done that it would have been possible for a great many of them if they wanted to get out to dispose of their machinery at some sort of reasonable price and then go back to England or try to make a living at something else.  But it is a vicious thing when young fellows come home trusting to the invitation of their own Government&mdash;and, mark you, it was an invitation issued not by me but by my predecessor and the Minister's colleague, the late Deputy Walsh, with I am sure full approval of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not now claiming any special information from my knowledge of the contents of the Department's files.  I am standing exclusively on what appeared in the public Press, and if my words are not vindicated by what appeared in the public Press there is no basis of foundation for the allegations I am making. I am not referring to any document or information in the Department's files. I am simply saying that there appeared in the public Press exhortations from the Department of Agriculture, when the late Deputy Tom Walsh was Minister, urging people to buy this <Col N="280" /> machinery that the Department was selling off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that is so and I assure him that a scheme of loans was inaugurated by myself to enable fellows to equip themselves and that the facilities of that scheme were made abundantly available to the applicants who proposed purchasing machinery of which the Department wished to dispose.</P>
      <P>I remember the present Minister's leader, now President de Valera, when he was Taoiseach and was being pressed hard on one occasion gave way to irritation and said: &ldquo;We cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;That is lovely, provided you are not an egg.&rdquo;  What shocks me about Fianna Fáil is the way they will kick people to death with complete indifference if these people are not a powerful vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no need to do what the Minister has done.  Whether it was done without thought or consideration I do not know but to see the individual tragedies that are involved in rural Ireland fills me with dismay.  It is peculiarly exasperating when one realises that the people most hurt are those who most readily responded to a request from their own Government.  I remember fellows coming home from Egypt, from the Sudan, North Africa, to work for the Department when we inaugurated the Land Project, and first formed a pool of trained men and machinery.  I must say it is humiliating to see these fellows sent back to their employers in North Africa and Egypt, cap in hand, begging back their jobs which they abandoned in order to come home to work heavy machinery here and teach others to work it.  That was bad enough but now, without thought or care, it is still worse to hurt the individuals I have described here when the simple precaution could have been taken of saying: &ldquo;As from April 1st 1961 Part B of the Land Project will be wound up.&rdquo;  It could not have cost the State any substantial sum, but would have kept all those fellows in employment and relieved them of the crushing financial loss <Col N="281" /> which individuals amongst them must now face.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it seems to me to be an act of criminal irresponsibility for the Minister for Agriculture, who well knows that under Section B of the scheme, there were two most valuable adjuncts to the actual value of reclamation.  They were that farmers who needed credit to get this kind of work done could get it under Section B and they cannot get it under Section A; and, secondly, under Section B, a very large volume of rural employment was provided in scattered areas where alternative employment of this character does not exist.  Unless a great many of the fellows who were working on this Section B work are found work breaking stones on the road, they will either have to emigrate or draw the dole; and the bulk of the fellows working on this do not want to draw the dole and do not want to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It seems to me utterly fantastic for one Minister to proclaim his intention to provide more and more employment in rural Ireland and for his colleague, by his own positive act, to throw hundreds of men out of useful work which they were doing for decent wages under Section B of this Land Project.  I have not the slightest doubt that the primary reason for the Minister consenting to the Department of Finance pressure to put an end to this was a desire to destroy something which was indissolubly associated in the people's mind with the inter-Party Government; but it is a contemptible thing to do and will greatly injure rural Ireland, which should be the concern of us all.</P>
    <P>I notice that at Col. 1409 the Minister announced that the product Trolene has now been pretty exhaustively tried out for the control of warble fly.  I should be glad if the Minister could tell us when that product will be generally available for farmers.  When it is, we will very quickly eliminate the warble fly from the cattle population; and until it is, we will not be able to do so.  I remember that when I was Minister for Agriculture there was a body called <Col N="282" /> the Hide Improvement Society.  This Society, in consultation with the Taoiseach&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as he was then&mdash;had succeeded in establishing a glorious racket, which amounted to this, that nobody could sell a hide in this country except through the Hide Improvement Society.  I inquired into the Society and I asked: &ldquo;What is being improved by the Hide Improvement Society?&rdquo; After very careful inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the only things being improved were the five members of the Hide Improvement Society.  I remember that they were quite indignant when I said that to them.  They said their sole concern was to improve the quality of Irish hides.  I said: &ldquo;What are you doing about it, and what are you prepared to do about it?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;We are prepared to deal in the hides.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;That is very nice, but are you prepared to do anything else?&rdquo; They said : &ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that stage, I had no very ready reply, because I never believed that you could control the warble fly through the use of derris powder.  I used to look reluctantly at the annual Department advertisement exhorting the farmers to dress their cattle with derris powder.  I thought it was all a cod.  I did it myself once, and never again, because I did not see the point of killing the warbles on the backs of my cows after they had come out through the skin and made a hole. Then there was my neighbour who would never kill a warble in his life and if I killed all the warbles on my 49 acres, all my neighbours would provide abundant substitutes the following year.  So there was no use in derris powder.</P>
    <P>Now there is a product here which enables any farmer to protect his own cattle, even though they have been attacked by the warble fly, from ever developing any warble.  I shall make a suggestion.  I do not know if the Hide Improvement Society is in existence.  I doubt it.  I succeeded finally in abolishing all restrictions on the export of hides, to the great fury of the Hide Improvement Society; and I think they went out of existence.  I am not sure. If they are still in existence, I make <Col N="283" /> this proposal now, and will give an answer to the question they asked seven years ago: &ldquo;What can we do to help?&rdquo; Let them distribute Trolene for a shilling a gallon to the farmers and that will be a real contribution to the elimination of the warble fly.  It is a constructive proposal.</P>
    <P>Remember, practically every penny of the improvement in the quality of the hides will come back into the pockets of the hide merchants and the butchers and it is extremely difficult to channel back to the farmer the additional value of Irish hides consequent on the elimination of warble. There is a practical proposal to share some of the supplementary value which will accrue to the hide dealers and butchers.  If the hide merchants want to collaborate with the farmers, let them collaborate with the Department to distribute Trolene at a moderate price to the farmers.  Provided they are prepared to do that, the Minister might rationally concern himself to promote the use of this preparation, so as to eliminate the injury to Irish hides which the warble fly undoubtedly has done in the past.</P>
    <P>With that, I come to the end of the Minister's speech in introducing his Estimate.  I do not deny that he circulated a White Paper, on which I congratulate him, as did some of his colleagues,&mdash;though I missed their courteous desire to recall the origin of that annual White Paper.  I would have thought it comely on the part of Deputy Moher&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a good bugler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who now reveals that he well remembers the source of that White Paper, to have congratulated his Minister on having followed the excellent example initiated by his predecessor&mdash;but Deputy Moher has maintained an ungenerous silence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a good idea that the suggestion be made to the Minister, that the White Paper might be circulated a few days before he introduces his Estimate for consideration.  I know how difficult it is to get all that material prepared in addition to the <Col N="284" /> Minister's own brief which the Department has to produce at that time of the year.  However, it would assist if the Minister circulated it some days before the debate.  I admit that, being human as all Ministers for Agriculture are, they sometimes ask themselves: &ldquo;If we circulate too much, will we not stimulate to many enthusiasts to say too much?&rdquo; There are many Deputies who, given the White Paper have the material for a fine speech and who, without it, would find themselves pretty tongue-tied on this Estimate.  Still, if I were Minister for Agriculture, I would take the risk.  Deputies appreciate the contents of that document and show a real interest in the doings of the Department and I believe they would appreciate that show of confidence in them if this material were placed in their hands a little earlier than it is.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture this, and I am entitled to a reply.  The Taoiseach is bounding around the country with his Programme of Economic Expansion.  I am told to look to the White Paper to know the Minister's policy for agriculture. When I look to Appendix I. I find there is an appropriation of £7,000,000 for a nitrogenous fertiliser project.  I believe that the project in mind will cost something like £9,000,000.  It is designed to produce the least suitable nitrogenous fertiliser that could be produced at a capital cost which makes it absolutely necessary to export a large part of the factory's total output into an export market the production capacity of which is 20 per cent. in excess of existing world demand.</P>
    <P>Picture the prospect for the farmers of this country.  There will be a capital investment of £9,000,000 to produce ammonium nitrate, the commodity that blew up the port of Texas when the ship containing it exploded there four or five years ago.  Ammonium nitrate cannot be mixed and, therefore, cannot be used as a compound.  If it is used for the purpose of a compound, it turns into rock.  The minimum output of the minimum industrial unit capable of producing this fertiliser will be of a dimension that will involve the export of a considerable part of that output <Col N="285" /> on a market already oversupplied by 20 per cent. with nitrogenous fertiliser.</P>
    <P>That means that we have to take on the world market for a considerable part of this unit's output whatever prices we can get.  And as certainly as there is an eye in a goat, the farmers will be told that they must pay for the residue consumed here whatever price is requisite to make up the losses in the export, just as the butter exporters at present are being levied to meet the cost of exporting butter.  We shall get a situation in which, from both ends, the farmers will be called on to balance the cost of excess production of this fertiliser and, at the other end, to balance the cost of exporting the end product of the user of this fertiliser. Is the Minister for Agriculture in favour of this project for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate?  He was not when he was last in office, nor was any of his successors or any of his predecessors.  He ought to tell us now, as Minister for Agriculture, what his opinion of it is to-day.</P>
    <P>I am told that if I want to know the Minister's policy for agriculture I should turn to Part II of the White Paper and the Programme for Economic Expansion laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas.  That I now propose to do. I am obliged to say at once that there is very little in this programme from which I can differ.  It is the omissions I deplore rather than the positive proposals, through which I now propose to go in some detail.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 15 says:</P>
    <P>The main objective of agricultural policy in the years to come is not only to maintain...</P>
    <P>&mdash;mark the words &ldquo;not only to maintain&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>...but to intensify the welcome upward trend in agricultural output which has been evident in recent years.</P>
    <P>Let us check that.  The figure for agricultural output is quite interesting. Many people forget that since 1947 our agricultural output was increased by about 26 per cent., slightly in excess of 2½ per cent. per annum.  The increase <Col N="286" /> began in 1947 and was maintained with ups and downs, but with a constant upward trend, until 1957.  I do not blame the Minister for the catastrophic reversal of that trend in 1958. It was not his fault.  It was the fault of the deplorable season through which we had to battle, but I hope it is not significant for the future.  I would remind Deputies that the foundation of this Programme for Economic Expansion is the &ldquo;welcome upward trend in agricultural output which has been evident in recent years&rdquo;, which, being interpreted, means &ldquo;which began in 1948 and has continued until 1958&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When I pass on to paragraph 17, I find this Plan for Economic Expansion says:</P>
    <P>By far the greatest proportion of our agricultural land has always been and will continue to be under grass. At present 15 per cent. of our agricultural land is tilled while 85 per cent. is under grass.  Variations will of course occur in these percentages in the future but it is highly unlikely that even in times of emergency more than about 20 to 25 per cent. of our total land will be tilled. Climatic and marketing influences combine to make grass the most important feature of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is a wonder that Fianna Fáil Deputies would not turn inside out to hear those words read out.  How long did Deputies of Fianna Fáil combine to bewilder and defraud our people into the belief that grass was almost an unpatriotic crop to grow?  How long did they maintain that nauseating fraud that grass is an evil thing?  Mind you, it is no subject for amusement because there is no doubt that they sold that idea to our people, with the result that, from 1936 up to about 1949, the practice of applying phosphates to grasslands in this country had virtually stopped and everyone knows that was the work of Fianna Fáil.  That great reservoir of fertility that could have been created in this country was destroyed by the vicious propaganda that grassland was a reproach to the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is an astonishing and gratifying thing that in six short years we taught the Fianna Fáil Party and their <Col N="287" /> Government the concept set out in paragraph 17 of this report:</P>
    <P>Climatic and market influences combine to make grass the most important feature of Irish agriculture, and future agricultural expansion will depend mainly on a dynamic policy of grassland development.</P>
    <P>That is true but a great deal more of that could and should have been done but for the disastrous Fianna Fáil propaganda which deluded so many of our people into withholding adequate fertilisation from the grasslands of this country.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 18, I read :</P>
    <P>While there are many factors involved in successful grassland management... the first and basic essential is the presence in the soil of a satisfactory level of lime and nutrients, mainly phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen, to ensure satisfactory sward development.</P>
    <P>I do not believe nitrogen is necessary to ensure satisfactory sward development&mdash;I mean nitrogen in the form of artificial fertilisers.  I believe it can best be provided by the fixation effect from the abundant presence of a healthy clover stock.  This paragraph says :</P>
    <P>Phosphorus is the key nutrient. The liming programme followed in recent years has made considerable progress, with the result that we are one of the largest users of lime per acre in Europe...</P>
    <P>Would the agricultural Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party brood on that and recall to themselves that, in 1948, there was not available in this country enough ground limestone to fill an eggcup, but in the 1958 Programme for Economic Expansion the Fianna Fáil Party claim that we are now &ldquo;one of the largest users of lime per acre in Europe&rdquo;?  I should like to add to that &ldquo;and up to the time that Deputy Smith, Minister for Agriculture, took over the Department of Agriculture approximately at the lowest price payable for ground limestone in any country in Europe&rdquo;.  There has been a <Col N="288" /> slight increase in that price since the Minister took office.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 19 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Our rate of use of phosphate fertiliser is far below the average for Western Europe.  It is considerably less than half the rate of consumption in Britain, where climate and physical conditions closely resemble ours.</P>
    <P>I want to question that statement.  I do not think that climate and physical conditions throughout Great Britain closely resemble ours, except perhaps in some of the western counties.  I remember when I had to deal with the mysterious problem of eyespot, I asked a lady world scientist to give me her opinions with a view to determining what we might do to correct and eradicate it.  I remember her asking me what was the average annual rainfall of this country.  I told her it varied between 30 and 60 inches in different areas, with a national average of 40 to 42 inches.  Her reply was: &ldquo;If you grow cereals in that climate, what do you expect?  We grow them in areas that have an average annual rainfall in the order of 21 inches.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Too many people in this country have forgotten over the years that Denmark, Holland and other Continental countries have an average rainfall of 21 inches and that to try to emulate these countries is just cracked when, in fact, our average annual rainfall is in the order of 42 inches. With the exception of limited areas in the vicinity of Rosslare, where you have an average annual rainfall of 32 to 34 inches, the average for the country is 40 to 42 which rises in certain parts of the west to 60 inches.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in paragraph 20 that this statement occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Not only is phosphorus of itself an essential nutrient but it has highly important secondary effects.  By stimulating the growth of clovers it adds nitrogen to the soil (and clovers are by far the cheapest source of nitrogen) and improves both the yield and protein content of grass.</P>
    <P>That is the source from which we ought to get our nitrogen for the grasslands <Col N="289" /> of this country and not out of the £9 million plant to produce the wrong kind of nitrogenous fertiliser at the highest possible price.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the matter of fertilisers, I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to a specific and important matter to which my attention has been directed in the recent past.  It comes as a complete revelation to me and it is a matter of the utmost gravity.  I rebuked my informant for not drawing the Minister's attention to the matter.  I am informed that in highly qualified medical circles here and in Britain there has emerged evidence which connects the occurrence of leukemia in human beings with contact with certain fertilisers. It is not clear to those authorities whether that leukemia is to be associated with some constituent of the fertiliser or with some radio-active quality of the fertiliser.</P>
    <P>I make no bones about it.  I never heard that any fertiliser had that radio-active quality; but I should like to inform the Minister that when that observation was made to me, I asked the person responsible had he got in touch with the Minister for Agriculture so that appropriate inquiries could be made and research conducted.  He said, like many another, that he had not done so, so far.  I said: &ldquo;This day will not pass wihout my giving our Minister at least an opportunity to do his part in dealing with this matter and if I am familiar with the past performance of the Department of Agriculture, even under his direction, appropriate measures will be taken.&rdquo; Accordingly, I fix him with notice of that belief which I assure him has been communicated to me by a completely reliable person.  I am free to give him the source and I shall be happy to do so.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Paragraph 26 of the Programme for Economic Expansion and, mind you, really it is hard to bear in mind that this is a Fianna Fáil Programme for Economic Expansion and the Taoiseach is trotting around the country and puffing himself up as being its author. In Paragraph 26, I read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>During the past hundred years the number of milch cows has remained <Col N="290" /> virtually stationary at around 1,200,000.  The number of store cattle has increased considerably because of the great improvement in the survival rate of young cattle...</P>
    <P>Does anyone hear the words Hexachloro-ethane and phenothiazine? Does anyone remember that for 20 years the annual average calf mortality in this country from disease and the Fianna Fáil throat-cutting operation was 80,000?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 26, the Fianna Fáil Programme for Economic Expansion rejoices in the great improvement in the survival rate of young cattle.  That improvement is due to two things: first, to the closing down by me of the Fianna Fáil calf factory in Millstreet. Do Deputies realise that when I first became Minister for Agriculture there was a calf factory designed to handle the carcases of calves slaughtered by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture?  One of the first activities I engaged in when I became Minister for Agriculture was to close down that calf factory.  It was there to dispose of the calves slaughtered at the behest of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture.  The owners used to get ten bob apiece for the calves.  So far as I know, the meat was converted into meat meal; the hides were disposed of to those who dealt in hides.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, an enormous annual mortality rate from fluke and parasitic disease.  We stopped the slaughter.  We instituted treatment for the fluke and parasitic diseases. Paragraph 26 of the Fianna Fáil Programme for Economic Expansion rejoices in the great improvement in the survival rate of young cattle.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The objective of policy will be to increase cow numbers progressively to at least 1,500,000 by 1964. The retention for breeding of an additional 50,000 heifers per annum would enable this objective to be attained without undue disturbance to the farming economy or to the export trade, though the progress of <Col N="291" /> the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, involving the slaughter of considerable numbers of cows before the end of their normal life, will for a time be a complicating factor.  It is important that these additional cows be bred for beef rather than milk.</P>
    <P>It is not so long since we were to wipe out the Shorthorn breed altogether. Do Deputies remember that psalm which began with the Fianna Fáil thesis, laid down as if it were the law of God&mdash;in fact, it was widely proclaimed to be the law of God, the natural law&mdash;that one could not breed beef and milk in one hide?  That should appeal to Deputy Russell.  It was inaugurated in this country by the Friesian breed psalm.  I still remember Deputy Moher and poor Deputy Corry wagging their heads and saying: &ldquo;You cannot breed milk and beef in the one hide.&rdquo;  And that was meant to be like the voice of Moses coming down from the mountain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is the only Moses.  He has the whisker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I had many Moses in front of me in those days and each one of them was prepared to split the rock, or do anything else, in order to lay down the thesis that one could not breed milk arid beef in one hide and we were, therefore, to just = "right" li = "1" ri = "3"&gt;&mdash;slaughter all the Shorthorn cows in the country, because there was no such thing as a dual purpose cow, and substitute therefor the Friesian.  That was the thesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lo and behold, the next proclamation of the law of God was that the most perfect dual purpose animal in the world was the Friesian cow.  The very self-same people who laid down the natural law that one could not breed milk and beef in one hide are now stumping the country to maintain that the most perfect dual purpose cow in creation is the Friesian, the cow which they prescribe for the purpose of breeding milk and beef in one hide. There is plenty of room for legitimate differences, but I know something of the livestock industry of this country.  I <Col N="292" /> know something of the dairying industry. I want to go on record again, as I have gone on record many times in the past, that I have no doubt whatever that for the average small and medium farmer in this country the 600 to 800 gallon Shorthorn cow is the most economic creamery cow that money can buy.</P>
    <P>The heavy yielding Friesian or the heavy yielding Shorthorn, giving over 1,000 gallons, requires supplemental feeding to produce those 1,000 gallons, supplemental feeding for which the price of creamery milk will not pay. If you are like Deputy Corry, supplying Cork City with liquid milk at relatively fancy prices, I agree you can afford to feed cattle with concentrates, and pay high prices for them; but it is only the exceptional farmer living within the environs of the city, where the demand for cream and milk exists, who can do that.  For the average farmer, the most economic cow is the 600 to 800 gallon Shorthorn which not only produces milk in that volume from grass growing, ensiled and in hay, without any supplemental concentrated feeding at all, but also produces a calf which can be sold for anything from £20 to £25, and that on the 600 gallon cow represents approximately a supplement of 6d. a gallon to the creamery price of milk.</P>
    <P>I pass on then to paragraph 29 of the Fianna Fáil Programme for Economic Expansion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The development of the export trade in pedigree breeding stock will be encouraged by continuing to lease top-quality stock bulls to breeders...</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that policy was inaugurated in 1949.  Prior to that year, it had never been known in this country.  I am not talking about the special term bulls distributed all over the country since the days of the Congested Districts Board.  These are top-quality stock bulls leased to pedigree breeders.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to a recent incident which calls for explanation. There was a very intensive drive to export pedigree stock to the United States of America.  I am sorry to say that a substantial consignment of Irish Aberdeen Angus heifers arrived in <Col N="293" /> New York some few weeks ago and were there tested for brucellosis, and a very considerable number of them reacted.  That was bad enough, but that we should have all the attendant publicity of their being slaughtered in the Port of New York after a veterinary surgeon of our staff went out to attend at the second tests, without any comment from the Department of Agriculture or any explanation of how that situation could have come to pass, is something which I find quite shocking.</P>
    <P>None of those cattle would have left this country without a certificate&mdash;I assume they could not&mdash;derived either from our Agricultural Research Station at Abbotstown or the Veterinary College.  Whatever source the certificate came from, it is directly or indirectly the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.  How what happened could have happened I find it difficult to understand.  If it did happen, I find it almost impossible to believe that it happened through any failure of duty on the part of the Department of Agriculture.  I think they have a duty to our own people who have always had high confidence in them to give the people the full facts so that we may fully understand how it came to pass that the first substantial consignment of pedigree cattle from this country to the United States of America was, as to more than half of them, slaughtered by the port veterinary authorities in New York for failing to measure up to their requirements of freedom from brucellosis.</P>
    <P>I do not know but I think very probably the test employed at New York was of a character which, if fully understood, revealed, not any diseased condition in our cattle, but a condition of immunity engendered by vaccination which may produce a reaction there which corresponds with the standard reaction which they associate with the diseased condition.  It is important that there should be an authoritative statement from our Department of Agriculture to make the position clear to all who are concerned about it.</P>
    <P>I read in Paragraph 30 that the number of sheep and lambs has been <Col N="294" /> increasing steadily in recent years. &ldquo;The 1958 figure was the highest recorded since the beginning of the century&rdquo;.  Deputies will wish to have the figure.  In 1947, there were in this country 2,094,000 sheep.  In 1958, there were 4,174,000 sheep.  When you recall that at the same time in 1947 there were 3,950,000 cattle and, although in the interval the volume of our exports had been doubled, in 1958 we had 4,466,000 cattle and when you also recall that in 1947 we had 457,000 pigs and in 1958, 947,000 pigs, I think it is desirable to recall that these are the results of a policy that had been operated in this country during the previous decade.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Paragraph 32 of this Programme envisages.  It begins by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are serious problems to be solved in the dairying industry.</P>
      <P>I am sorry poor Deputy Moloney is not here.  He was expressing anxiety about the penny a gallon that had been taken off milk suppliers in the previous year.  He never put it so crudely.  He said: &ldquo;The little adjustment that had taken place as a result of the slight request that was made to producers to contribute something to a certain fund which had resulted in a certain development which affected the general intake of money by those who were selling milk to creameries.&rdquo; He could have said all that by saying: &ldquo;The penny you took off the price of a gallon of milk.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 32 says:</P>
      <P>There are serious problems to solve in the dairying industry.  Milk yields, though not high by international standards, have been rising steadily in recent years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Ó Briain is not here. I would like to read this for him:</P>
      <P>and there has been some increase in the number of dairy cows.</P>
      <P>This is almost as tactful as Deputy Moloney:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time there has been a serious slump in the export market for the main milk product, butter. As a result, the State support of butter export prices&mdash;at present two-thirds of the difference between export and home prices&mdash;will cost about £2½ million for 1958-59; a <Col N="296" /> subsidy of this magnitude imposes a severe burden on the rest of the country.  A grassland improvement programme, while aiming mainly at an increase in meat output must also have the objective of reducing milk production costs.</P>
    <P>I wonder does that ring any minatory bell in the ear of Deputy Moloney? If they took a penny a gallon off last year without any preliminary rumbling, what are they thinking of doing now that they have sounded off with paragraph 32?  I hope Deputy Moloney will join with me in pressing the Minister for Agriculture to tell us something about his intentions.</P>
    <P>I pass on then.  Sir, to Paragraph 37 which, I remind you, is from the Programme for Economic Expansion provided by the Fianna Fáil Party:</P>
    <P>In recent years, policy has been based, on the one hand, on the maintenance of a guaranteed minimum price for Grade A pigs and a corresponding export price guarantee for Grade A bacon, and, on the other hand, on the encouragement of the use of home-grown barley for feeding by means of a guaranteed minimum price for the crop.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputies recall who inaugurated the guaranteed price for Grade A pigs and the guaranteed price for the feeding barley which was introduced into this country by the Government which guaranteed it?  The price for pigs was guaranteed by the inter-Party Government, as was the price for barley and the variety of barley which made that price guarantee possible and practicable was introduced into this country by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat shocked recently to hear that the Minister for Agriculture had pressed upon the Grain Board a plan to export Irish barley in exchange for imports of maize.  I find it hard to believe but I am told it is under way. I do not conceal from the House that when I was Minister for Agriculture I took a policy decision that the time had now come to move the pig industry over to home barley and, even when the home crop was insufficient <Col N="297" /> to meet our domestic requirements, I elected to import barley in preference to maize.  Indeed, my predecessor in office, the late Deputy Thomas Walsh, did the same thing, I think, and was criticised here but not by me because I knew what he was trying to do and he was right and I did it when I was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Has that policy decision been reversed and are we now actually to export home-grown barley and to purchase maize?  If that is his purpose, the Minister is making a great mistake.  There was a strong natural prejudice in certain parts of the country for Indian meal.  It is extremely difficult to get farmers in West Cork, Cavan, Monaghan and parts of the West to accept barley meal as an adequate substitute for maize meal.  In the vast majority of these areas, acceptance has been almost complete and, if the Minister should reverse that policy now and make us dependent again on imports of maize meal, I think in the long run he will do the country a disservice although I fully sympathise with him that we have to bear in mind that the cost of foodstuffs to the pig producer is a matter of vital concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister is perfectly right in insisting that due regard will be had to that when the price level of home-produced barley is under consideration. The way to deal with that situation is to encourage the pig producer to grow his own barley.  The great mistake the Minister is falling into, if he introduces maize meal is that he will undo all the effort of trying to get the pig producer to produce his own barley.  The cheapest foodstuff of all that the pig producer can have is his own barley. Next to that comes maize, purchased thirftily on international markets in the Balkans, by those who understand the trade and, lastly, perhaps, domestic barley which has to be stored and graded in this country.</P>
    <P>The way to bring down the cost of foodstuffs to the pig producer in this country is to persuade him to grow his own barley.  Rather than that he should revert to the practice of importing maize meal, I would seriously <Col N="298" /> consider centralising the market of home-grown barley with a view to making the price economic in the light of the guaranteed price for bacon exports.</P>
    <P>I should not pass from Paragraph 37 until I direct the attention of Deputies to another premonitory rumble to which they would be well advised to pay close attention now before the rumble develops into Fianna Fáil action.</P>
    <P>The last part of Paragraph 37 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The cost to the taxpayers of the price support for pigs and bacon in the present financial year will not be far short of £1,000,000.  The expansion of the industry would be more soundly based if it were no longer dependent on subsidisation.</P>
    <P>That is the Fianna Fáil programme for expansion.  I want to remind the Minister of what he himself said in the introductory paragraph of his own speech on this Estimate, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In most cases, the whole range of their agricultural prices is supported at a comparatively high level and, consequently, their output, which is almost entirely for home consumption and independent of the vagaries of export markets, is very high.</P>
    <P>He knows, as does every informed person, that operating on the Continent of Europe there are all sorts of abstruse and labyrinthine systems of subsidisation not only on the domestic market but on the export market as well.</P>
    <P>I defy anyone to tell me on what basis the export price of Dutch or Danish bacon is established.  I defy anyone to tell me what relation there is between the price paid to Dutch or Danish farmers for their pigs and the price realised on the London market. I do not believe there is any living creature outside the most confidential circles of the Dutch and the Danish Governments who can give that information. They take a great deal of trouble to wrap all that up in the most abstruse and labyrinthine devices <Col N="299" /> for the simple purpose of concealing from the outside world the character of their policy of subsidisation.</P>
    <P>It would be well worth Deputies' time to undertake a study of the French system of subsidisation of exports.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that, if you are investigating the price at which French exports of cheese are being marketed on the world markets, you would want to know the current prices of cabbages in Marseilles and pigs' ears in Lyons&mdash; and all that is carefully interwoven and concealed from the public view for the purpose of inducing pious public servants in the shadow of the Department of Finance to express the excellent sentiment that the expansion of this industry would be more soundly based if it were no longer dependent on subsidisation.  That is almost like saying that the world would be a better place if nobody committed sin.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to subscribe to that doctrine without qualification provided everybody else will, in precept and in practice.  All of them will subscribe most passionately to that doctrine but unfortunately, not being omniscient, none of us can be sure that they observe that injunction in practice. In the absence of such assurance, it is only cutting our producers' throats to ask them to go into competition with European exporters who are prepared, in my judgment, to provide almost any level of subsidisation to maintain their stranglehold on the British market into which it is so vitally important for us to enter on an increasing scale.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Paragraph 38 where the Minister for Agriculture congratulates himself on the quality of our Irish Large White pig.  He says the Landrace has been introduced but there is no doubt, the Paragraph says, that in the Irish Large White breed there are strains which will stand comparison with the best pigs of any other breed in any country.  I agree with him entirely.  The Paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, of the highest importance to identify the best strains in the breed by means of progeny testing and to propagate these strains by means of artificial <Col N="300" /> insemination as well as by ordinary breeding methods.  With the establishment of the first pig progeny testing station at Cork, a beginning has already been made with this policy.  It is intended to erect another station in the near future.</P>
    <P>I see the glow of recognition in the faces of the Fianna Fáil Deputies of the fact that the pig progeny testing station was built by the inter-Party Government and that, prior to its advent to office, there was no such thing known in Ireland.  As I recall it, the present Minister for Agriculture or his predecessor was polite enough to invite me to the opening of the pig progeny testing station, which was a civil gesture, and, as I have already reported, to the House I declined the invitation on the grounds that I believed that such occasions were best proceeded with without the attendance of ghosts.</P>
    <P>I am rather concerned to hear from the Minister's statement that the second pig progeny testing station is to be located in Thomdale.  Why should you put a pig progeny testing station in Thomdale when we have just got out of Thomdale on the grounds that it is overrun by the expanding city ? Thomdale is the old agricultural research station up in Drumcondra and it was decided we had better get out of it because the city was closing in around them and it was quite unsuited from the point of view of the kind of isolation desirable for a veterinary research station.  We bought Abbotstown and at great expense equipped it to provide alternative accommodation to Thomdale.  I think there is on the records of the Department of Agriculture a promise I made to the Minister for Finance that if he would give me the money to equip Abbotstown I would sell Thomdale.</P>
    <P>I rarely invoke the Department of Finance in defence of rectitude and common sense but surely it is madness to put a pig progeny station above in Drumcondra?  I can see what will happen. This is an old Georgian house, rather a nice house, which was handed on to us, I think, by the British administration. Because we have Thomdale it is considered that the correct procedure <Col N="301" /> is to put the pig progeny station there. The sensible thing is to call in a firm of auctioneers, sell Thorndale and put the pig progeny testing station in a suitable rural place where you can have the degree of isolation necessary and where the sweet aroma can be scattered on the breeze or at least tendered to those who appreciate its delicious quality, but to present it to the surbanites of Glasnevin and Drumcondra seems to be quite insane.  It will cause great annoyance.  It is an eminently unsuitable location and it has nothing to commend it.</P>

      <P>I cannot imagine Deputy Haughey is so hard pressed, now that we have preserved P.R., that he would require the votes of the three or four persons who will get the jobs available in the pig progeny testing station.  In any case I do not believe he would be able to find four people who understand pigs to vote for him even in Drumcondra.  I think Deputy Haughey must be mistaken.  There is some other purpose behind the Minister for Agriculture's activities.  He is a shrewd operator.  He was a pretty hot performer when he was a Parliamentary Secretary but since he became a Minister he delegates such indelicate functions to bodies like Bord na gCon. If the Deputy wants votes from his constituents I suggest to him that he asks Bord na gCon to transfer their headquarters there.  I will guarantee that 95 per cent. of their staff will vote for him.</P>

      <P>Or if they do not they will not survive.  I would urge on the Minister, seeing that Deputy Haughey can get along without them, to build a new station in a suitable location and sell Thorndale.  It is now no longer suitable for use by the Department of Agriculture and the sale price of it, I <Col N="302" /> believe, considering its location, would almost certainly produce a capital sum sufficient to finance the erection of a proper pig progeny testing station on a more suitable site.  Paragraph 39, which deals with feeding barley, says:</P>
      <P>A successful industry must also be based on an abundant and moderately priced supply of feeding stuffs. By growing our own feeding grains, we save foreign exchange and at the same time give domestic grain growers an assured market for their crop.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that that 39th Paragraph owes its existence to the activities of the Fine Gael Minister in the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>Then I come to the part of this Programme for Economic Expansion of the Fianna Fáil Party dealing with poultry and eggs.  Paragraphs 43 and 44 point out that the export market has practically collapsed, and Paragraph 45 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are, however, prospects of developing an export trade in broilers (table chickens reared intensively for about ten weeks) and day-old chicks.  Broiler production has increased considerably in the U.S.A. and the industry has now spread to Britain and other European countries.  Foundation stock of suitable strains of birds for the broiler trade were imported by the Department of Agriculture some time ago from the U.S.A., subject to veterinary precautions and the propagation of these birds is now on a scale adequate for building up the trade.</P>
      <P>It will cause the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party no surprise to learn that these stocks were imported by the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>When we come to Paragraph 47 of the Fianna Fáil Programme for Economic Expansion we discover:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Production of turkeys has not suffered the same setback as that of ordinary fowl despite occasional ciably above the pre-war level and efforts are being made, as in the market gluts.  Production is appre-case of broilers, to expand the <Col N="303" /> market demand by developing improved strains of smaller birds.  The Department of Agriculture has imported foundation stock of such strains from the U.S.A. and these are now available to producers generally.</P>
    <P>Deputies will not be surprised to learn that that refers to the white turkey imported by the inter-Party Government, strains of that bird that were never known here prior to that importation.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of wheat.  Here Deputy Corry will be a great help.  I remember his making an explanation in my presence on one occasion in Killeagh.  I was addressing a meeting in Killeagh in 1957. Deputy Corry was prowling in the streets like a hungry lion, for the news had reached Killeagh that I was to speak there and Deputy Corry had come to the scene so that he could speak after me.  I mistook the hour of the meeting and Deputy Corry, having prowled for some considerable time, could bear the strain no longer and got his barrel and climbed upon it.  As I entered the streets of Killeagh the raucous sounds of Deputy Corry's voice were ringing and I remember the consternation and dismay as he saw me arriving into the town as he was orating from the barrel.  It was then too late to do anything.</P>
    <P>He was telling the farmers of East Cork from his heart that he was yearning for the day when Fianna Fáil would be returned to office so that the downtrodden farmers of East Cork could get restored to them the 10/- a barrel, if not more, that he confidently anticipated they would receive from a Fianna Fáil Government.  Remember this was in the early part of the spring. Nothing less than 45/- a barrel for feeding barley would be considered by him.  That is as far as he went.  You had the greybeards looking up with admiration at the future Minister for Agriculture on the barrel giving that undertaking.  With the full knowledge of the facts as Minister for Agriculture, as I then was, I thought Deputy Corry's anticipations were ill-founded. In any case, even if they were returned <Col N="304" /> I did not believe Deputy Corry would redeem that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I saw the poor creature come in here afterwards when Deputy Aiken was functioning temporarily as Minister for Agriculture.  I saw Deputy Corry get up in this House and ask Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Agriculture, when he was going to implement the undertaking to the farmers who, he said, had planted an increased acreage of wheat in anticipation of the certainty that they would get a fair price.  He asked when that promise was to be implemented.  Deputy Aiken treated him like a bad smell and said it was not proposed to do anything about it. I was sorry for Deputy Corry.  I would be sorry to see anyone so affronted and humiliated by his own.  They might have taken the trouble at least to show him the courtesy of a considerate reply but you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.</P>
    <P>I think that is the rotten quality of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They used him to deceive the people and having used him for their dirty purpose they discarded him like an old shoe.  For the first time in my life, I felt some spark of admiration for him because, as they kicked him down the stairs, unlike the rest of them, he showed what they had not got&mdash;unfaltering loyalty.</P>

      <P>All these promises were forgotten.  The guaranteed price for barley was cut by 2/- a barrel instead of being increased.  The guaranteed price for wheat was cut.  I understand it is now proposed to put it upon a contract basis for the future.  In fact, in a short time wheat will become the confined preserve of a minority of well-to-do farmers.  The middleman will be squeezed out and only the man who is in a position to undertake a substantial contract justifying the user of heavy machinery will be considered in future for the guaranteed price for wheat.  When that day comes, I shall be interested to hear the loyal comment of Deputy Corry and I shall be even more interested to know the sympathetic reaction of the Minister for Agriculture to whom he is responsible.</P>
      <P>When you pass on to Paragraph 51, you reach that part of this Programme for Economic Expansion which deals with horticultural crops.  It says:</P>
      <P>As horticultural crops give a high monetary return per acre and provide a good deal of employment, they are of particular importance in the economy of small farms.  Production has expanded in recent years, mainly as a result of measures taken to provide assured markets, the work of the county advisory services and of the Department of Agriculture, and the promotion of cooperative undertakings with State assistance, such as that for onions in County Kerry and the County Waterford apple project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will recall with satisfaction that both of these were initiated by the Inter-Party Government. <Col N="306" /> Neither had existed in this country before their inauguration by that Government.  It is a gladsome thought that this paragraph ends:</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to promote the development of horticulture in every way practicable, particularly where there appear to be export possibilities.</P>
    <P>That is the Fianna Fáil Programme for Economic Expansion.  I find myself in some difficulty.  As a member of a constructive Opposition, I find it rather difficult to offer constructive opposition to a policy for which I myself am very largely responsible.  I can only congratulate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially I say for all those parts of it that matter.  For the brouhaha &ldquo;No&rdquo; but for all that matters &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I am glad to congratulate the Minister for his late animadversion.  My only anxiety is that the speciality of Fianna Fáil is talk but action is what matters.  The mistake we may have made was that we did too much and talked too little. I sympathise with the Minister's spasms of delight, recalling the occasion when he once addressed me, from where I now stand, for six hours.  Of course, on that occasion he was not uniformly coherent.  I like to imagine that most of what I say here will not require correction when it appears in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 55 deals with agricultural credit.  I am glad that it takes the precaution of saying:</P>
      <P>While it would, of course, be foolish for a farmer to run into debt lightheartedly, the tendency in this country has been over-conservative in relation to the use of credit;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to believe all that Fianna Fáil says, every farmer in the country can now get all the credit he wants, hire purchase, credits for the purchase of anything, including livestock, almost without limit.  I rejoice however, to notice that where credit is given under State auspices, &ldquo;the borrower will be required to avail of the services <Col N="307" /> of the agricultural instructor in planning his farming programme.&rdquo; That was incorporated in the credit scheme inaugurated by us just before we left office and I am glad that it is being adhered to now.  There is a danger that if credit is forced on farmers on too liberal a scale, without careful preliminary consideration they are in as great a danger as any other <i>entrepreneur</i> of using such credit to their own ultimate detriment.</P>
    <P>I come now to Paragraph 56 which reads:</P>
    <P>This White Paper does not deal with the important and complex problem of the marketing of agricultural products, as this is under examination by an Advisory Committee established in 1957.  There is no doubt, however&mdash;</P>
    <P>and I hope the Deputies will mark this well&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the bulk of our agricultural exports will continue to be marketed in Britain, and our trade relations with that country are, therefore, a matter of prime importance.</P>
    <P>What a tragedy it is that that fundamental fact of our economy was discovered by Fianna Fáil 20 years too late.  What a tragedy it is that Fianna Fáil campaigned this country in its day on the slogan &ldquo;The British market is gone forever, thanks be to God,&rdquo; and that only three short years ago, the Minister for Lands, then Deputy Childers, and Deputy Vivion de Valera, were proclaiming from these benches that the bottom had fallen out of the livestock market and that farmers of this country had better make up their minds to get along without it. I only hope the fact that their conversion from that form of insanity as then enshrined in the printed word will provide that, whether in Government or in Opposition, they will never fall into the error of their past.</P>
    <P>The eradication of bovine tuberculosis is dealt with in paragraphs 58 and 59 and I recall with gratification that the campaign for that eradication was inaugurated by our Government in the summer of 1954.  That brings me to a matter of considerable <Col N="308" /> moment.  There is no use blinding our eyes to this fact, that both the Minister and I accepted it as necessary that in the initial stages of this campaign we should concentrate our efforts on those areas where there was a fair prospect of effective eradication through the purchase and the slaughter of reacting animals.  That does not alter the fact that in Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, and parts of Waterford and Kilkenny, there remains a problem of such magnitude that unless preliminary progress is made the task of the eradication of reactors will be almost impossible.</P>
    <P>There are districts in these areas where the incidence of tuberculosis amongst cows is up to 50 per cent.  I want to put a proposal to the Minister. He has subtracted from the current price of creamery milk a levy which he says he wants to use in the event of his having to subsidise exports of butter this year.  At present there is no prospect of there being any substantial exportable surplus.  It is quite true, as the Minister said, one cannot say with confidence that there will not be any exportable surplus until we have seen the end of October, but we are dealing with a very urgent situation in which I think the Minister would be justified, amply justified, in taking a risk and I think I am in a position, on behalf of the Opposition, to gurantee our support, if he takes it. Unless there is some preliminary elimination on a voluntary basis of T.T. reactors amongst the dairy herds of Munster, it will not be possible to eradicate T.B. in those four counties in time, or in anywhere near time, to meet the deadline of 1964.</P>
    <P>Therefore I put it to the Minister that he might, with perfect propriety, inaugurate a scheme forthwith, analogous to that which operated in the preliminary years in Great Britain, designed to induce farmers in the creamery areas to eliminate from their herds all reactors by offering a bonus of 2d. a gallon on creamery milk supplied to creameries from T.T. tested herds.  Unless something of that kind is done, then when the Minister comes around to deal with these creamery counties, he will find a problem quite beyond the ability of <Col N="309" /> the industry to deal with, and indeed, of the Exchequer.  However, if during the remainder of the period in which he was clearing up the area west of the Shannon and the Ulster midland counties, there was in the dairy counties a gradual process of eradication which held forth to the farmers who undertook it the prospect of some real advantage to them, then when the Minister, whoever he might be, came to turn his attention to these counties, he would find a residual problem with which it would be possible to deal on lines similar to those at present being followed in the intensive eradication counties.</P>
    <P>I want to say most categorically that I agree entirely with the Minister for Agriculture in saying that there is no time left for complacency and that it is a complete illusion to imagine that the five years period of grace accorded to us under the agreement effected with the British Government is a sufficient time to complete the process of T.B. eradication in this country.  Without the best possible effort we will not succeed in meeting that, but unless some interim measures are taken in the intensive dairying areas I think the problem is going to be more acute than it must inevitably be, and I urge the Minister, particularly in the light of the present export situation, to take a risk on the proposal I now adumbrate to him.  I believe in the long run it will pay off well.</P>
    <P>It would suit me best to make no reference to another matter, but I think I would be running away from my clear duty if I were not prepared to advert to the deplorable situation which exists between the veterinary profession and the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot touch upon that topic without expressing my profound regret to learn of the untimely death of the distinguished director of the veterinary services of the Department of Agriculture, Mr. P.A. Rogan.  I know that matters of this kind are extremely difficult of adjustment, and I have perused the correspondence circulated by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I believe I was in some small measure instrumental in persuading the <Col N="310" /> Minister for Health to overcome a somewhat similar problem with the medical profession, by waiving all prior requisitions upon them and simply inviting them to meet him and discuss the situation, the differences between both sides.  I believe that invitation has been issued and I hope that out of it will come a satisfactory settlement of the difficulties that did exist.  I fully appreciate that the problems involved in this dispute with the veterinary profession are event more complex and difficult, and I cannot see how a difference of this kind can be equitably settled except on the basis of arbitration.</P>
    <P>As I understand the situation, arbitration was offered by the Government with the additional undertaking that, in anticipation, the Government would hold itself bound by the award of that arbitration, and they have so held themselves bound.  I appreciate that the members of this profession, largely as a result of the exertions of the Department of Agriculture, have all the benefits of reciprocity with Great Britain and thus are tempted to compare the rates of remuneration available in public service in Great Britain with the rates available here. I do not believe the differential between them is very great, considering all the attendant circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do believe that all of us have a certain duty to our own country and, though I would not want to restrict any man carrying his talents to any part of the world where he can best use them, I think the members of this great and important profession must have present in their minds the immense importance it is to our people, as a whole, to have this problem of bovine tuberculosis eradication expeditiously dealt with.  It cannot be expeditiously dealt with without the assistance of the veterinary profession and, if the veterinary profession find themselves in a difficulty at the present time, they ought to make some proposal, either to the Minister or to some intermediary, on the basis upon which they would be prepared to resume the normal relations which the Minister for Agriculture in this country is entitled to expect of them with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> I do not want to say a word calculated to make a difficult situation more difficult, but I cannot depart from this matter without saying that in my dealings with the profession I found a ready willingness to collaborate. I want to say that at that time I knew a great many of the prominent members of the profession did not agree with my political beliefs and yet I had at their hands professionally, and in their corporate capacity, a ready willingness to collaborate but I think, on reflection, they must be bound to say it was not illiberally reciprocated by the Department of Agriculture and even by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Even if it involves them in some difficulty I would urge upon them, for the sake of the public interest generally, to take the initiative now themselves and to make some proposal to the Minister for Agriculture on the lines that, inasmuch as the arbitration award was not exhaustive but left some marginal matters outstanding, if they would accept the arbitration award, in so far as it was definitive, the Minister might discuss with them the marginal matters which were not definitively settled by arbitration and that, as a result of such an agreement, normal relations would be promptly restored.  I hope they may see their way to make some gesture on those lines.  I do not think I go beyond the limits of prudence in saying that less than that would be less than I would confidently expect of a profession which has so admirably served the farming community in the past and which, I have no doubt, is eager similarly to serve them in the future.</P>
    <P>I have made one concrete suggestion to the Minister this evening and I want to make another.  It is pretty well agreed amongst us that if there is to be increased production an indispensable <i>sine qua non</i> is evident &mdash;markets in which that increased production will be profitably disposed of.  I believe it is not impossible to attain to that by negotiation of a trade agreement along the lines I have suggested.  But, assuming we have achieved these two ends, I think there remains one vitally important additional <Col N="312" /> adjunct to our present policy without which increased production, on the right lines, cannot be hoped for in the sufficiently early future.</P>
    <P>The present system of agricultural advisory services is not adequate.  Its inadequacy is largely due to the fact that there is no central control or direction, and its effectiveness varies with the efficiency of the various county committees of agriculture.  In some counties you have admirable committees of agriculture who take a genuine interest in the advisory services. In others the very reverse is true but there is no consistent policy, no consistent direction and, I am sorry to say, in many cases there is no adequate, effective inspection and no proper relationship of the activities of any adviser to his own area.  I believe that sooner or later, and the sooner the better, we ought to have a national agricultural advisory service and that should be based, in the initial stages, on one adviser to every three parishes, our ultimate objective being one adviser to every rural parish involving ultimately the employment of 800 agricultural advisers for the whole country.</P>
    <P>I think it is a tragic thing at the present time that a large number of highly trained agricultural graduates are emigrating to Canada, Rhodesia, and the colonies in Africa because they cannot get employment in their own country while, at the same time, large areas in this country are virtually bereft of that kind of advice which, if it were available, could help materially to reduce costs of production and to expand production from our existing area of arable land.  That whole project seems so self-evident to me that I find it hard to produce extensive arguments to support it.  It is almost like seeking to delineate arguments to prove the inevitability of two and two making four, but it is urgent, it is necessary, and sooner or later it will have to be done.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture expresses the view that once he felt that if you went too fast you could outstrip the people's willingness to accept guidance in these matters and again he preferred to leave this to county committees of agriculture.  I think it is too <Col N="313" /> important a matter to leave to anybody else but himself.  I am quite convinced that though people in certain areas may at first evince reluctance to avail of such services, they should never be thrust upon them but, if the services are made available, the initial reluctance to avail of them very quickly evaporates.  I strongly urge upon the Minister that he should fix notice for such services and put it into operation without delay.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to say that I am sick listening to people like the Taoiseach speaking of the agricultural industry and its featherbed.  I am sick of listening to the Taoiseach and those who think they can lecture the farmers on the necessity for more hard work, lower costs and a greater readiness to compete in the markets of the world at a time when we have a tariff structure of the kind that at present exists.  Nobody knows what protected industry collects from the consumers here annually.  It must run into tens of millions, the bulk of which is paid by the small farmers and their equivalent, the agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>All existing industry depends for its supply of raw materials on the purchasing power of the agricultural industry. We can get almost unlimited production from our land if we give the farmers who own it and work it a reasonable reward for their labours. They do not aspire to the 40-hour week; they do not aspire to overtime rates of pay for overtime work.  It is their nature and custom to work as long as is necessary to get the result; what they do require and are quite determined to have is a fair reward for the produce they have to offer for sale.  The time is long past, as most rational people here realised years ago, when domestic price levels are the exclusive controlling factor.  In the last analysis, and as the agricultural industry is directed to capacity, it it the export price which will control the general price level of every branch of agriculture.  We are not in a position to control the actual price realised in the export market and it is a wholly specious appeal to make to our farmers to say that they are as well able to produce as the Danish or <Col N="314" /> Dutch farmers with whom they compete in our principal market which is the British market.  While the Danish and the Dutch farmers do so produce there is no Deputy in this House who really knows all the facts about the price they get for their end product.</P>
    <P>We have had one strange example in a certain gentleman of Danish extraction who occupies a very well remunerated industrial position in this country.  He wanted to give us, the &ldquo;ignorant Irish&rdquo;, a slight demonstration of what modern Danish methods could do if employed for the edification of the &ldquo;ignorant Irish&rdquo;.  So, with the unlimited capital of a large industrial concern he bought a farm in the richest part of Ireland and equipped it without counting the cost to run it, I believe, as a dairy and a pig farm so that the &ldquo;ignorant Irish&rdquo; might learn how these things really ought to be done.  He has lost £40,000 to date while the &ldquo;ignorant Irish&rdquo; are still carrying on.  He suddenly discovered what farming in our conditions requires. He suddenly discovered that skills exist outside his ken.  He discovered that the chronic inferiority complex that afflicts the Fianna Fáil Party, which persuades them that anything from abroad is better than the domestic product, operated to deceive even the omniscient Dane who had begun to believe that too.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be discussing the affairs of a private individual in this country.  I do not see how it arises on this Estimate.  Surely the Minister is not responsible for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be a bit surprised if he were.  It is the kind of daft thing in which he would be involved.  I am trying to demonstrate that the methods of Denmark are not necessarily superior to the methods of Ireland in the case of Ireland's agriculture and that there are a lot of deadheads walking around saying that we should emulate the marvellous example of Denmark who do not know what they are talking about. That even goes for the Danes who fall for that kind of tripe also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not often get the chance of getting these things tried out.  Our <Col N="315" /> people are too cute to get involved in that kind of folly.  They are quite prepared to tell their neighbour to do it, but they never do it themselves. This Dane turned up and he not only told us how to do it but he proceeded to show us how he could do it.  We do not have £40,000 on most of the farms here and so we do not do it.  But we must meet the stiff competition presented to us in the markets abroad. What I am concerned to say to the Minister is that he should stipulate to the Government that, whatever device is employed, producers here will get a fair price for any increased production they make available.  If they can get an unqualified guarantee along these lines, the Minister will get production and exports, and that is the only basis.  There are those who would say to producers that they would be much more fortunate if all this production were done on the basis of unsubsidised foreign sale. They ought to make two replies to that.  One is that that goes for none of their competitors.  Secondly, they are carrying on their backs all the protected industrialists in this country, and they cannot afford to do it at world prices fixed by the subsidised exports of their competitors.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputies that there is an adverse balance of payments running at the present moment at the rate of between £30 million and £40 million per annum.  I am not talking now about an adverse balance of trade: I am talking about an adverse balance of payments, after full credit has been taken for all our invisible exports.  There are only two ways of bringing that adverse balance of payments under control.  One is by further expanding our agricultural exports.  Prices at the moment, or up to recently, have been fairly good for the kind of products we have to market.  Although prices for cattle are faltering at the present time, and although demand is not strong, in my opinion&mdash;and I should be glad to hear the Minister's view on this&mdash;that will correct itself towards the end of the year and there is no reason for anyone to panic about it.</P>
    <P>The alternative to expanding agricultural <Col N="316" /> exports is to impose quantitative restrictions on imports.  When you come down to the job of determining what imports you are to restrict quantitatively, to make any serious impression on the balance of payments, you will find that there is no such thing as unnecessary imports in a volume adequate materially to affect the balance of payments.  If you want to make a substantial inroad on an adverse balance of payments by quantitative restriction, you have to go for motor vehicles or something on that scale; and the moment you do so you are going to be faced with immediate, direct, consequential unemployment and incalculable indirect unemployment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the dilemma which is opening up before us in this year is an early facing of the fact that imports will have to be controlled or exports materially expanded.  There is no hope of getting any material expansion of exports on the industrial front. There is no insurmountable difficulty in getting them this year and next year on the agricultural front, but if they are to be got and retained, certain urgent measures, such as I have outlined, require to be undertaken now.  Let us all remember this.  If by 1964 we are not in a position to retain our place in the livestock market of Great Britain, there will be a catastrophe in respect of the standard of living of our people unlike anything this generation has ever seen.  I do not believe any such catastrophe is necessary, but I sincerely urge upon the Minister for Agriculture that some preliminary work must be done in the dairying areas now, if he is to have any prospect of dealing effectively with them on an exhaustive basis in two or three years' time.</P>
    <P>I have always believed, and I still believe, that this country has a rosy future so long as we have the land we have, with the market potential at our door and the people to work it.  Deputy Brennan once said that the mistake I made when I was Minister for Agriculture was to claim that I was in a position to help everybody over every stile. I am not sure that that is a charge I am particularly anxious to repudiate. I thought it was a great privilege and <Col N="317" /> I thought it was great to be Minister for Agriculture in this country.  I did feel, as I still feel, that there are very few farmers on the land of Ireland who are not the better for contact with their own Department of Agriculture.  I sometimes feel as if that splendid organisation were grinding to a standstill. Perhaps in my day I claimed too much for it.  If I did, I think it was a better mistake than to claim so little that it almost appears to cease to exist at all.</P>
    <P>I do not associate that with the modesty of the Minister.  I do not believe the Minister wants to be in the Department of Agriculture.  I do not think he gives a damn about the Department of Agriculture.  I think he wants to get out of it.  If that is so, his seniority in the Government would entitle him to make that requisition on the new Taoiseach to shift him now. If he is not prepared to do any more than he has been doing in the recent past, then I would urge him, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the Department and even for his own sake, to get a transfer and make way for a better man.</P>

    </P>
    <P>(1)  The Board has no special scales for children but extras and special diets are prescribed by the Medical Officers in individual cases as required.</P>
    <P>(2)  Figures in respect of vegetables other than potatoes are not readily available.</P>
    <P>(3)  The cost of meat has not been included in the table as the cost would depend on the cuts used.  In addition, some of the meat is bought in carcass form and consequently a retail price cannot readily be obtained.</P>

    <P>Notes regarding basic wage rates:</P>
    <P>(a) The basic weekly rates as set out above are those obtaining for time work, i.e., they exclude additional earnings under the Incentive Bonus Scheme.</P>
    <P>(b) In Counties Dublin and Kildare the present basic rates are lower than the former rates; any employees who enjoyed the former rates retain them in the form of a special allowance, which when the Incentive Bonus Scheme has been applied at their Forests guarantees total earnings not lower than the previous rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> As regards part (e) of the question, application of the Scheme in the next six months will be concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of the country in Counties Wicklow, Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork and Kerry.  The Scheme will also be introduced at pilot Forests in other parts of the Country.  It would be misleading to furnish a nominal list of Forests where the Scheme is likely to be introduced in the period since application planning must necessarily be flexible and subject to adjustment as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>Average bonus earnings for Forests where the Incentive Bonus Scheme was in operation for each month of 1959 to date were as follows:&mdash;</P>
