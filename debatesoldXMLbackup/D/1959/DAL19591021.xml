    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in the light of the establishment of two separate trading groups in Europe, viz. the Economic Community of six nations and the Outer Free Trade area of seven, and the fact that Ireland is not associated with either group, he will state if further negotiations for a wider Free Trade Area for Europe are in progress, and if Ireland is taking part in such discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has considered recommendation No. 210 (1) of the Council of Europe dealing with the European Economic Association; and whether he will state the intentions of the Government in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is in favour of <Col N="2" /> renewed negotiations for the creation of a multilateral trading agreement among all O.E.E.C. countries; and, if so, whether he proposes to take any steps to encourage renewed negotiations, either in the O.E.E.C. or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any calculations have been made of the likely effects on the Irish economy of the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Outer Seven countries; and, if so, if he will publish such calculations in the form of a White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what is the present position concerning the negotiations for the proposed European Free Trade area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="3" /> to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations for a wider Free Trade Area are not at present in progress.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the terms of Recommendation 210 of the Council of Europe.  The Recommendation is, of course, addressed to all members of the Council of Europe, and it would be premature for the Government to endeavour to define now their attitude in relation to it.</P>
      <P>We have already made it clear that we would be prepared to consider participation in a multilateral trading agreement among all the member-countries of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, subject to the inclusion in such an agreement of provisions in regard to this country which would take our special circumstances adequately into account.  The Government do not feel called upon to take any steps to promote the early resumption of negotiations in this regard.</P>
      <P>The members of the proposed European Free Trade Association are engaged in discussions in Stockholm with the aim of completing, by the 31st instant, the drafting of the Convention to be adopted by member Governments.  A preliminary examination has been made of the likely effects of the establishment of the Association on the Irish economy.  It is not proposed to publish the conclusions arrived at as a result of this examination, which are, necessarily, of a provisional and tentative character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if we have sent a special representative to Stockholm as an observer in these negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not an observer at the negotiations.  We have officers of the Irish Embassy in Stockholm who are, of course, keeping us informed of the events happening there so far as they know of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If any decisions are taken they will probably be taken at political level.  Does the <Col N="4" /> Taoiseach not consider it desirable that Ireland should be represented at any discussions that are taking place or will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I have already expressed the view that the type of agreement which appears to be contemplated at Stockholm would not be one which would be likely to be acceptable to us.  I think it would be undesirable to give the impression now that we would be prepared to participate in that agreement by having representatives at these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assume that the preoccupations arising out of the subject matter of these five Questions will not operate to delay or hinder the important bilateral negotiations that are proceeding between our Government and the Government of Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to an open letter addressed to him by the Irish Medical Association; and if he has any comment to make on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <P>I have received the communication referred to in the Deputy's Question.  The Deputy will have noted the character of the communication and the fact that it was sent to the newspapers at the same time as it was sent to me.  Apart from mentioning these unusual features of the matter, I have no comment to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the Deputy address that question to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the number of public functions in the State and abroad attended by him or by other members of the Government since 1st July, 1959; (b) the member or members of the Government who attended each function; (c) whether any State officials were present, and, if so, the number on each occasion; and (d) the total cost to the State on each occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;public functions&rdquo; used in the Deputy's Question is not sufficiently precise to indicate with any exactitude the type of information that he requires.  If he will give notice of a Question containing a more precise definition of what he has in mind, I shall consider what information can be supplied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach how the figure for emigrants' remittances in the official statement of the balance of international payments, published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal,</i> is arrived at; and what machinery exists for checking the accuracy of the published figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for emigrants' remittances and legacies in the official statement of the balance of international payments are compiled mainly from data collected by the commercial banks and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The banks record the sterling equivalent of drafts, foreign currency notes, telegraphic remittances, etc., cashed or lodged with them, which are believed to have been sent by persons resident outside the State to friends or relatives resident in Ireland for no consideration, e.g. as gifts, legacies, etc.  Remittances received in payment for goods or other valuable consideration, where such is apparent or known, are not included.  Foreign <Col N="6" /> money orders and postal orders are omitted from the banks' figures and separate particulars in respect of these items are recorded by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The total of all such money orders and postal orders received is included as emigrants' remittances.  In addition to the figures compiled by the banks and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a conjectural estimate of the amount of emigrants' remittances sent in the form of sterling notes through the post is also included.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to check the accuracy of the published figures from independent sources since no other data are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct up to recently in any case.  Every bank, having tendered to it an American draft, asks the question whether it is a gift or for consideration.  If it is for a gift there is a slightly higher exchange rate than they would get if it were for a consideration.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the duty of determining the eligibility of persons for medical cards rests solely with the individual health authorities.  It is inevitable that the standards adopted in determining eligibility will vary as between one health district and another and, as I have no functions in connection with this matter, I am not in a position to furnish particulars of the standards applicable in individual areas.  The Deputy may have in mind a general standard by which eligibility for medical cards is determined.  In reply to a question raised by Deputy Norton in the House on 14th July last, as recorded in Volume 176, Column 1009 of the Official Report, I stated that I was not aware of any general scale adopted by County Managers setting out income limits for eligibility for medical cards, and the position has not altered in the meantime.  I am aware that in certain areas, in order to facilitate the early issue of cards in clearly eligible cases, income scales have been drawn up and cards are issued automatically where the income is within those scales, but I am given to understand that, where such a scale exists and an applicant, by reference to the scale, is not automatically regarded as eligible for a medical card, the case is fully examined on its merits, and the final determination is made in the light of all the relevant circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state what arrangements are made by the Wexford County Council to provide dispensary services for an unemployed person who, if he were in employment, would not be entitled to a medical service card according to the means test applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is properly one for answer by the Wexford County Council.  However, I have had enquiries made from the Council and I understand that the position is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every application for a medical card whether it is a new application <Col N="19" /> or from a person who has already been refused a card, is first examined by the Assistance Officer.  He furnishes a report and recommendation to the County Manager for a decision. The time taken between making the application and issuing or refusing a medical card depends on what enquiries have to be made into the circumstances of the applicant but is normally seven to ten days.  If, however, the applicant is in immediate need of medical attention, he is issued with a direction which entitles him, or any of his dependents, to a general practitioner service either in his own home or at the appropriate dispensary. The direction remains in force for one month unless it is previously cancelled by the health authority or by the person who issued it.</P>
    <P>If the application is from a person who is temporarily unemployed and the County Council is satisfied that the unemployment is total, the Council issues a medical card which remains in force for a limited period, after which it may be renewed if circumstances warrant it.  If, before the expiry of that period, the Council becomes aware that the person's circumstances have improved, e.g. due to renewed employment, so as to render him ineligible to hold a medical card, the card is then withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that in some cases it takes between seven and 10 days for a local authority or county manager to make up their mind as to whether or not a card should be issued.  I am sure he is not aware of the fact that in many cases it has taken three or four months for a manager to make up his mind as to whether or not a card should be issued.</P>

      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, this is not the first occasion on which an inquiry has been made in regard to the Dromore River. Could the Parliamentary Secretary, on the occasion of his first answer to this House in his new office, break precedent and be a little more specific as to the date on which he hopes to give relief to the persons living beside this river whose lands are habitually flooded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Dromore River is part of a comprehensive catchment area.  It is part of the Erne catchment, and the Deputy will appreciate it would hardly be either economic or wise to upset the general survey which is being carried out with a view to having a scheme for the entire area put into operation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a survey in the Parliamentary Secretary's Office which shows that it is quite possible, by using balancer lakes in the stream, to give very material <i>ad interim</i> relief to the people living on the banks of this river pending the undertaking of the comprehensive Erne scheme?  Is it not so that this relief could be given without any interference with the main arterial drainage problem of that catchment area?</P>

      <P>I do not agree it <Col N="29" /> could be done without any interference with the main catchment scheme.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that many worthwhile and necessary works under the auspices of the Special Employment Schemes Office have from time to time to be abandoned <Col N="30" /> because of the refusal of certain landowners to give the necessary consent; and, if so, if he will make arrangements, if necessary by the introduction of legislation, to empower the Special Employment Schemes Office to resort to compulsory powers of acquiring right-of-way in such cases in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken as a whole only a very small percentage of the proposals submitted to the Special Employment Schemes Office have to be abandoned because of the refusal of certain landholders to give their consent to the work, and it is found from experience that many such objections are withdrawn after the lapse of a period of time.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation to empower the Special Employment Schemes Office to resort to compulsory powers of acquiring rights-of-way.</P>
      <P>The State is always jealous of any interference with private ownership, and would, no doubt, insist on measures to safeguard individual landholders against the danger of arbitrary actions; so that the exercise of compulsory powers would necessarily involve a whole legal procedure:&mdash; the serving of preliminary notices, the hearing of objections, the question of compensation and its assessment, and probably a right of appeal.  An elaborate procedure of this kind would be out of place in regard to the relatively small works which are undertaken under the minor schemes.</P>
      <P>Moreover, an imposed settlement would probably accentuate the bad feeling amongst neighbours which is very often the cause of the original objection.</P>
      <P>In some cases, as for instance when the work involves the construction of a new section of road or the widening of an existing road, the objection may not be unreasonable, as the objecting landholder may find that he would have to surrender an undue proportion of his land in order to accommodate landholders who would not have to give anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.  The number of workers recruited from the Employment Exchanges for schemes carried out by the Special Works Department of the Dublin Corporation in the four months period June to September for the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 were 144, 115 and 80 respectively.  It is not correct to suggest that no workers have been recruited since June, 1959.  In fact, I have been informed that 116 men have been recruited since the end of June. The average total number of men at work weekly in Dublin on employment schemes during the four months period June to September was 152 in 1957, 108 in 1958 and 162 in 1959, of whom the men formerly in receipt of unemployment assistance were respectively 101 in 1957, 69 in 1958 and 102 in 1959.</P>
      <P>No employment schemes have in recent years been carried out by contractors for the Dublin Corporation. If any future employment scheme should be done by contract, the contractor would be required to comply with the usual conditions of employing unemployment assistance labour through the Employment Exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> As regards further employment schemes to be provided by the Dublin Corporation, I have authorised an allocation of £120,000 State grant, subject to a local contribution of £30,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, only limited export markets are available for ware potatoes and prices generally are not attractive.  The Irish Potato Marketing Company which has already arranged for the export of some small consignments to the West Indies, Majorca and the Canary Islands, is in close touch with the position in potato importing countries and as suitable outlets are found will be prepared to purchase ware for export at prices related to those obtainable on the export market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see the force of that, but I am wondering if the Minister would agree with me that the knowledge that such exports can go on does create a desire in the counties that habitually deal in ware potatoes for some guidance on the price of such potatoes destined for export.

      <P>I am well aware of the fall in prices of sheep and lambs this season.</P>
      <P>As is fairly well known, the position is that in Britain the price of sheep fell very steeply because of a glut of supplies caused by heavy home slaughterings and increased imports. It is said that the heavy slaughterings were due not only to increased production but to the very poor pasture conditions resulting from the very long spell of dry weather.</P>
      <P>While store sheep exported to Britain are eligible after three months for subsidy under the British fatstock guarantee scheme, the market for stores has been adversely affected by the situation in Britain as I have described.</P>

I fully appreciate the difficulties with which the Minister has to contend.  Take the case of a man with sheep on a mountain who cannot get any market for them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  This type of question is the very one on which, as Minister, I should be very careful about giving that sort of reply.  There are so many people in the country who have the same means of calculating what the market conditions are likely to be as we have, and in some cases better, that I hesitate to prophesy what the future holds.  It could be very misleading; it could be very inaccurate.  In certain circumstances, it could do good and in other circumstances, it could do harm. Therefore, I should fight shy of it but not because I am afraid to make a prophecy if there is justification.  In this case, I do not feel I should.</P>

The one element in the community with little or no guidance as to market prospects consists of the small producers.  While I sympathise with the Minister's reluctance to prophesy, would he not consider at some stage seeking to give to the small unorganised producers some forecast analogous to that which will be available to dealers and experienced operators on the turkey market?</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind the new arrangements in regard to reactor cows in Counties Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, which came into operation on the 1st October.</P>
      <P>For some time previously, there had been criticism in the South of the existing arrangements for the taking up of cow reactors under compensation, and it had been strongly represented to me that the herd-owner should be free to dispose of his reactors himself at the best price obtainable, and should, in addition, receive a flat cash payment from the Department over and above the market price.  I accepted this proposal, and, on the basis of the reactor cows being sold to a cannery, I agreed to pay a headage grant of £15 in respect of each cow reactor, on top of the commercial price.  I also undertook to protect the herd-owner against loss through condemnation of the carcase, or part of it, by indemnifying the canning firms against such loss. Moreover, I agreed to pay a bonus of £8 per cow reactor removed, or £4 per cow in the herd, when the herd had a clear test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals were discussed beforehand with the representatives of the farmers' organisations for the area, <Col N="46" /> who accepted them as on the right lines.

From the Second Reading debate I know what categories are excluded, but representations have been made to me about the position of small undertakings, such as a grocery shop where there is an apprentice or two.  Do the terms of this measure apply to an undertaking of that sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about 12 months since the House was told that this Bill was urgent.  I suggested then that instead of trying to push this measure through the Dáil like a bull in a china shop, the intelligent way of dealing with it would be for the Department of Industry and Commerce to sit down with representatives of the Trade Union Congress and the Federated Union of Employers and endeavour to work out some kind of agreed Bill.  However, the present Taoiseach was rather temperamental on that occasion and said no, this had to be done quickly and examination of it had to be done speedily. When the temperament passed and sweet reasonableness prevailed, everybody realised that the best thing to do <Col N="76" /> was to get the unions, on the one hand, and the employers, on the other, to work out an agreed Bill, because no Bill that is not an agreed Bill between the unions and the employers can be made to operate.  That apparently dawned belatedly on somebody.</P>
      <P>We have a committee of the Federated Union of Employers and the Congress of Irish Unions and I understand that it met on many occasions and that a very substantial area of agreement has been arrived at.  The Minister has had no opportunity of telling the House of the work that has been done or what area of agreement has been reached, whether the amendments represent agreement between the two bodies or in what instance the amendments are, in fact, decisions by the Minister rather than the result of agreement between the two sides.</P>

To go forward to Section 13 for a moment, as drafted it provides for the disqualification of a member of the Oireachtas from being either chairman or an ordinary member of An Chomhairle but since the chairman will be the only full-time member it is proposed that the disqualification should be confined to the office of chairman. That is the effect of this amendment. As a corollary, it is proposed that Section 13 should be deleted from the Bill and I think that will meet the wishes of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I would like amendments 4 and 11 to be discussed together.  The purpose of amendment 11 is to provide for superannuation benefit for the chairman of An Chomhairle.  This is being done by bringing the post within the ambit of the Superannuation Acts and the effect of the provision will be to preserve the continuance of superannuation rights and entitlement of any civil servant who might be appointed chairman.  If a non-civil servant is appointed chairman, he would accumulate superannuation entitlement according to the normal Civil Service rate, which is one-eightieth of his salary on retirement for each year's service subject to a maximum of 40/80ths and a lump sum in the case of a man.  In the case of a woman, the superannuation may, as an option, be calculated on the basis of 1/60th of the salary for each year's service and subject to a maximum of 40/60ths and no lump sum.  A non-civil servant would not accumulate any pension rights until he had served for ten years.  After five years, however, the dependents of a non-civil service chairman would qualify for a lump sum payable on death.</P>
      <P>The provision of the Superannuation Act of 1956 under which a person may surrender part of his pension in return for a pension in favour of his wife or dependents is being applied to the office of chairman.  It is also being provided that if a pensionable officer of a local authority is appointed as chairman he will retain his superannuation entitlement and he will continue to accrue such entitlement while serving as chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is consequential on amendment No. 11.  The Superannuation Acts can only be applied in relation to people whose remuneration is borne on a Departmental Vote. <Col N="85" /> The section as originally drafted provided that the remuneration of the chairman of An Chomhairle should be met out of moneys at the disposal of An Chomhairle.  The effect of amendment No. 4 is to ensure that the remuneration of the chairman shall be paid out of the appropriate Vote, that is the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The aim of that is to qualify and entitle him to superannuation benefits as I have indicated. Otherwise, the Superannuation Acts would not apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a change in policy indicated here?  The provision in respect of superannuation may, in fact, operate disadvantageously in the case of a person appointed at a certain age.  For example, the amendment provides that the person concerned shall retire when he reaches 65.  Suppose he is appointed at 45, then serves for only 20 years and his annual pension is calculated on the basis of 1/80th for each year, so that he can only get 20/80ths, or a quarter of the salary on retiring at 65.  The whole scheme of Civil Service superannuation was conceived against the background that the person would be recruited early in life, at about 18, 19 or 20, and that he could obtain full pension on retiring at 60 or 65.  In this case, if you appoint a person at 45, he could only get one-quarter of his salary and the pension is less still if he is 50 years of age.  It might be found in practice that some person with mature experience in this field would be the, ideal chairman but would that be an attractive pension to offer that person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of some of the State-sponsored bodies, an entirely new system of pensions was offered to the employees.  Admittedly they had no lump sum but the scheme of superannuation was based, I think, on 1/48th for each year of service so that if a person gave 24 years' service on such a body he got 24-48ths or in other words half his salary for pension purposes. This provision seems not to give the person any chance of availing of that type of superannuation scheme which is operating in quite a number of State-sponsored bodies, so far as I <Col N="86" /> know.  If the Minister has in mind the appointment of a civil servant to a post of this kind this scheme of superannuation is all right but if it is intended to find somebody outside the Civil Service the pension scheme provided here is not very attractive for the person recruited to the post at about 50 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, if a civil servant or a local authority employee is likely to be chairman he will not come out any worse&mdash;in fact, possibly much better.  The likely superannuation benefit can be taken into account in fixing the chairman's salary. However, I appreciate the anxiety the Deputy expresses and I shall have this matter looked into between now and the Committee Stage to see whether or not some provision might be made in the case of a person who is not a civil servant or a local authority employee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> In subsection (3), page 6, line 20, after &ldquo;five&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;members (being members who are entitled to vote at the meeting)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 10 together.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is the main one. It proposes to insert three new sub-sections as a result of recommendations made by the joint committee concerning the voting power of members of An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>The first two of these sub-sections give voting power to the chairman and to the employers' and workers' members but not to the educational members, except that an educational member who acts as chairman of a meeting, in the absence of the regular chairman, will have a vote on that occasion.  The joint committee took the view that the educational representatives on An Chomhairle should act in an advisory capacity only.  They said that the real training of apprentices is carried out by employers and craftsmen on the job and not in the technical schools.  They expressed the view that the workers and employers in a trade have a vital interest in apprenticeship because it is a matter closely connected with their livelihood.  They felt that the giving of voting powers to educational members would upset the existing balance between workers and employers.</P>
    <P>I may say that I was a little surprised to learn that the joint committee took this line.  However, there is little doubt that the co-operation of both sides of the industry in this matter of apprenticeship is an essential to progress and I feel that there is no alternative but to accept the recommendation which has been made.</P>
    <P>The third new sub-section implements the joint committee's recommendation that there should be provision for pairing to ensure equality of voting power between employers and workers.  This provision is similar to a corresponding provision relating to joint labour committees in the industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is consequential on amendment No. 8.  The acceptance <Col N="90" /> of amendment No. 8 means that the educational members of An Chomhairle will not have a vote.  It is, therefore, necessary to clarify that the quorum of meetings of An Chomhairle must consist of five members who are entitled to vote at the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a substantial improvement on the Bill as originally introduced.  The scheme for providing for equal representation between unions and employers and then throwing in three educational folk into a committee to determine matters of which the educational folk have no experience and no ultimate responsibility was calculated to burst this thing wide open.  The employers would say that they had to pay the fellow and that they were entitled to say what he was going to do; the union people would say that their members had to train them and that they were entitled to have a say in the matter also.  The educational people had no further concern with the person, once he was registered as an apprentice.  I think the solution is a happy one of an awkward situation which would not have worked and which, I think, would have burst the whole thing up.  The solution has been achieved by this device and I think it will work.</P>

It will ensure absolute impartiality on behalf of the vocational representatives.  I think it will recommend itself particularly to the workers' representatives.  It will remove all fear of unequal representation, either on An Chomhairle or on the district committees.  Having regard to the other amendments by the Minister, I do not think my amendment is necessary.  If it is not, I shall not move amendment No. 10.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 goes with amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 47.  I would refer Deputies to Section 53 of the Bill as drafted.  That section provided that An Chomhairle and apprenticeship committees that would be set up by An Chomhairle would have power to exempt individual employers from the requirements of the Bill or of rules made under it.  The joint committee felt that there was a danger that widespread exemptions from rules might be granted.  They recommended, therefore, that either An Chomhairle or an apprenticeship committee should not exercise their power to grant exemptions unless the chairman and the majority of employers' and workers' members agreed so to act.  The purpose of amendment No. 47 is to give effect to that recommendation.  It is necessary as a corollary to Section 14, subsection (5), to insert a saver for this departure from the normal voting procedure.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

It is obviously desirable in the interests of flexibility and to avoid the causing of hardship in individual cases that there should be some power of exemption.  The safeguards provided by amendment No. 47 should ensure that the power of exemption will not be abused and, therefore, I think Deputy Lemass can <Col N="94" /> withdraw his amendments, if he agrees to do so.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Service by a person in the office of chairman of An Chomhairle, excluding any service rendered by him after the expiry of three months from the date on which he reaches the age of sixty-five years, shall be deemed for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1956, to be established service in the civil service, and the Superannuation Act, 1956, shall apply to or in respect of the chairman of An Chomhairle in like manner as that Act applies to or in respect of an established civil servant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of suggestions.  I am not sure on what section I should <Col N="96" /> make them but it seems to me that Section 19 is the appropriate one. There are a couple of functions which might be attributed to An Chomhairle and, as this section deals with making grants available to An Chomhairle, I would suggest that the grants which will be made to An Chomhairle should cover the following two things. I think An Chomhairle could do very useful work in publishing, for the guidance of parents, careers which their children can follow in the various trades, giving an outline of the period of apprenticeship, the manner in which the child can enter the trade and information of that sort.  The second thing I should like to see An Chomhairle do is in connection with any trade.  It would be desirable if it had the power and the finances to publish textbooks or manuals for the trade which would be available to apprentices learning the trade and even to tradesmen.  These two types of publication could with advantage be undertaken by An Chomhairle.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to see An Chomhairle with the authority and the money, where necessary, to make grants to local authorities for the provision of certain types of equipment and gear for the proper training of apprentices and the running of apprenticeship courses in vocational schools.  Would the Minister consider whether it is necessary that the functions which I should like to see attributed to An Chomhairle should be actually incorporated in this Bill or whether the specific power should be given to An Chomhairle to carry them out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to require An Chomhairle to carry out such functions by way of legislation. An Chomhairle can undertake certain activities such as those outlined by the Deputy as long as they are not inconsistent with the main purposes of the Bill and it would be better, I think, to await the setting up of An Chomhairle to see what activities of that nature they feel they ought to engage in.  I should like to direct the Deputy's attention to Section 61.  An Chomhairle are entitled to receive gifts.  If the Deputy felt in a benevolent mood, he might give effect to his brain child.</P>

      <P>I still think I have a point.  I can imagine An Chomhairle, once it is set up, confining itself to carrying out only the functions specifically attributed to it in the Bill.  They can very well say, if they are asked to do the type of work I have in mind, &ldquo;We have no statutory authority to do it and no funds available for it.&rdquo; It seems to me that these two particular things I have mentioned are very important and that An Chomhairle could do untold good in that way towards helping parents and vocational schools.</P>

    <Col N="98" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say at this stage&mdash;it may be more appropriate later&mdash;does it follow from what he says that An Chomhairle will have funds at its disposal and that it is possible assistance might be given to vocational education committees? If so, will An Chomhairle take into account the fact that State grants are already available?  Will there not be over-lapping in the contributions of the moneys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have distinguished between the proposals made by Deputy Haughey.  The first was that An Chomhairle might usefully apply themselves to issuing brochures and publications concerning apprenticeship schemes.  An Chomhairle would have that function and could contribute moneys.  At this stage I do not exclude the possibility of their providing certain moneys to assist vocational education committees; on the other hand, they must have regard to the fact that moneys are already provided out of the Vote for the Department of Education.  To say that I do not exclude the possibility is not the same as saying that I envisage it.</P>
      <P>I can reply to Deputy Norton's question now.  Out of the grant, which I said would amount annually to £4,000 or £5,000, An Chomhairle would have to pay the fees of the Chairmen of the Apprenticeship Committees and the travelling and other expenses of the ordinary members of An Chomhairle. They will have to pay fees or allowances to supervisors&mdash;that will be mentioned later in Section 50&mdash; gratuities to employers, scholarships and other awards to apprentices and other administrative and incidental expenses.  Again, these will be specifically dealt with in other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be much money left for gifts there. The bulk of that is obviously administrative, with something available for awards.  The way in which the Minister replied to this matter in the first instance gave me the impression that An Chomhairle could be looked to as a body to be approached from time to time and asked to dispense sums of money to vocational education authorities in order to help them <Col N="99" /> whenever they wanted to do something which involved money.  Are we to have three methods of injecting money into vocational education authorities? Firstly, the local council through the local authority rate; secondly, the Department of Education and now, thirdly, permissive through An Chomhairle.</P>
      <P>That does not seem to be a very efficient way of dealing with the matter.  So long as the local authority can raise money or grants can be got from the Department of Education, these ought to be the financing sources.  To allow An Chomhairle to be approached from time to time as a body that might pass out a cheque here and there is not, I think, calculated to earn them a good reputation, because of the number of refusals they would have to give.  Nor is it wise to give the impression that the ability to equip classes and purchase goods or machines is related to the ability to squeeze some money out of a body that has got no money to be squeezed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that they get certain registration fees from apprentices that ought to swell their coffers.  I want to say again I do not anticipate that they would be required to subsidise vocational committees, but when questions are put to a Minister in the course of a Committee Stage or Second Reading debate I, for one, would not like to exclude the possibility of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the question. On the other hand, I would not like my remarks to be interpreted as a directive to An Chomhairle that they should in any way finance vocational education committees.  It is possible that in some instances, for purposes associated with apprenticeship schemes, they might find it desirable to do something of that nature.  Any remarks I made today were designed not to exclude that possibility; on the other hand they did not suggest it was a probability.</P>

      <P>I should like to make my point a little clearer.  I was not asking the Minister if An Chomhairle would subsidise vocational <Col N="100" /> education committees.  I could visualise a situation where one specific item of equipment might be wanted for a particular trade.  As a matter of fact, I have one specific item in mind.  No one vocational education committee might be disposed to buy it.  An Chomhairle in that special case might be enabled to buy that item.  I feel it should be given the funds to do so if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Norton.  It will undoubtedly lead to over-lapping.  The position will arise that having failed with the Department of Education, the next thing will be to try An Chomhairle.  I would rather be quite specific and say it is not the intention to supply equipment in any shape or form that is normally supplied through the Department of Education.  The question of the publication of literature is a different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In case my remarks might be interpreted in any way as enabling An Chomhairle to do anything like that and having regard to the views of Deputy Norton and Deputy Russell, I want to say that as far as I would have any influence over the expenditure of An Chomhairle, I would not expect them to equip vocational education schools with any special equipment that should be provided in the ordinary way through the finances of vocational education committees.</P>

If I can see any other body which could come in and supply them with more equipment, I would be delighted, whether it was overlapping or not.  In conclusion, I should like seriously to recommend to the Minister my other suggestion regarding the publication of a guide to careers for parents and the information of trades generally and also the publication of a manual of instruction.</P>

Has the Minister considered any provision whereby, at the request of the two parties in any particular trade, An Chomhairle would proceed to carry out an examination?  As the section stands, it is An Chomhairle which will take the initiative.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete subsections (3) and (4) and insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  An order under this section shall, as respects an apprenticeship committee established by it&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  provide that the committee shall consist of a chairman and a specified number of ordinary members,</P>
      <P>(b)  provide that An Chomhairle shall appoint a person to be the chairman of the committee and that he shall be a person who is not representative of either workers' or employers' interests,</P>
      <P>(c)  provide that the ordinary members shall include a specified number of workers' members, a specified number of employers' members (which shall be equal to the specified number of workers' members) and a specified number of educational members,</P>
      <P>(d)  provide that An Chomhairle shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  after consultation with the Minister, designate, in respect of each workers' member, an organisation representative of trade unions of workers to nominate a person for appointment as a workers' member and shall appoint the person so nominated to be a workers' member,</P>
      <P>(ii)  after consultation with the Minister, invite organisations representative of employers to nominate persons for appointment as employers' members and shall appoint the appropriate number specified in the order of the persons so nominated to be the employers' members,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  after consultation with such educational bodies as An Chomhairle considers suitable, appoint the appropriate number <Col N="104" /> of persons specified by the order to be the educational members,</P>
    <P>(e)  provide for the term of office of the members,</P>
    <P>(f)  provide that a member whose term of office expires by effluxion of time shall be eligible for re-appointment,</P>
    <P>(g)  provide that An Chomhairle may remove a member from office,</P>
    <P>(h)  provide that a member may resign his office as member by letter addressed to An Chomhairle and that the resignation shall have effect as on and from the date of the receipt of the letter by An Chomhairle,</P>
    <P>(i)  provide that a member shall be disqualified from holding office and shall cease to hold office if he is adjudged bankrupt or makes a composition or arrangement with creditors, or is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal servitude or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State,</P>
    <P>(j)  provide that, where a casual vacancy occurs among the workers' members, An Chomhairle shall, after consultation with the Minister, designate an organisation representative of trade unions of workers to nominate a person for appointment to fill the vacancy and that An Chomhairle shall appoint the person so nominated to fill the vacancy,</P>
    <P>(k)  provide that, where a casual vacancy occurs among the employers' members, An Chomhairle shall, after consultation with the Minister, invite organisations representative of employers to nominate persons for appointment to fill the vacancy and that An Chomhairle shall appoint a person from among the persons so nominated to fill the vacancy,</P>
    <P>(l)  provide that, where a casual vacancy occurs among the educational members, An Chomhairle shall, after consultation with such educational bodies as An Chomhairle <Col N="105" /> considers suitable, appoint a person to fill the vacancy,</P>
    <P>(m)  provide that a person appointed under the provision made under paragraph (j), (k) or (l)  of this subsection shall hold office for the remainder of his predecessor's term,</P>
    <P>(n)  provide that at a meeting of the committee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the chairman shall, if present, be chairman of the meeting,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if and so long as the chairman is not present or the office of chairman is vacant, the members who are present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting,</P>
    <P>(o)  provide that the chairman, each workers' member and each employers' member at a meeting of the committee shall have a vote,</P>
    <P>(p)  provide that an educational member at a meeting of the committee shall not, except where such member is chairman of the meeting, have a vote,</P>
    <P>(q)  provide that, if at any meeting of the committee the group of workers' members does not equal in number the group of employers' members present&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  whichever of the said groups is in the majority may arrange that any one or more of its number shall refrain from voting so as to preserve equality,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if no such arrangement is made, the chairman or, in his absence, the person who is chairman of the meeting, may adjourn the voting on any question to another meeting of the committee,</P>
    <P>(r)  provide that, subject to the provisions of the order, the committee shall regulate, by standing orders or otherwise, the procedure and business of the committee,</P>
    <P>(s)  provide for such other <Col N="106" /> matters as An Chomhairle considers necessary for the proper performance of its functions by the committee.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment it is proposed to insert a new subsection in place of the original subsections (3) and (4). The new subsection contains provisions relating to the constitution of apprenticeship committees, the procedure for appointing members, the circumstances in which membership may be terminated, the filling of casual vacancies, the voting powers of members and the procedure at meetings.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give effect again to a number of recommendations made by the joint committee.  These were that the educational members should not have votes; that there should be specific provision that the chairman of the apprenticeship committee should be independent of either workers' or employers' interests; that there should be provision for the pairing of votes, as outlined in a previous section; and that An Chomhairle should use the same method of appointing employers' and workers' members on apprenticeship committees as the Minister will use in appointing such members of An Chomhairle itself.  There are also a number of new paragraphs being inserted to bring the provisions relating to the establishment of apprenticeship committees into line with those for the establishment of An Chomhairle. Again, this amendment is as a result of the agreed proposal of the joint committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> In page 9, subsection (5), line 31, after &ldquo;determines&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, in the absence of the chairman from a meeting of the committee, the fee that would be payable to him may, if An Chomhairle thinks fit, be paid to the person who acts as chairman of the meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for a situation during which the chairman of an apprenticeship committee is unable to attend meetings over a period.  Provision must be made for An Chomhairle to pay the fees of the member of the committee who acts as chairman over that protracted period.  The provision in the amendment is permissive and would probably be availed of by An Chomhairle in cases where the same person consistently acts in place of the apprenticeship committee chairman proper who is consistently absent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the Minister get the idea that it is only payable where there is prolonged absence?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 25 provides for An Chomhairle to make educational rules and in consultation with the Minister for Education, the joint committee recommended that An Chomhairle should be required to consult with the Apprenticeship Committees before making educational rules under this section.  This recommendation is being accepted by amendment No. 15.  Provision for consultation with the Minister for Education previously included in subsection <Col N="109" /> (1) is being deleted from that subsection by amendment No. 14 and is included in the new subsection proposed by amendment No. 15.  The net effect is that the joint committee recommends that An Chomhairle consult with the Apprenticeship Committee before making educational rules.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of this section as drafted empowers An Chomhairle to make rules specifying the minimum age at which employment by way of apprenticeship in designated trade may commence but does not require An Chomhairle to make such rules. The main reason for the permissive nature of the original provision was that where An Chomhairle decided 14 years&mdash;which is the statutory minimum school-leaving age&mdash;should be the minimum age for commencement of apprenticeship, no rule would be necessary.  However, I now feel that for the guidance of those concerned with the trade it would be preferable that the minimum age as well as the other requirements should be clearly set down.  The effect of the amendment is to make it mandatory rather than permissive on An Chomhairle to <Col N="110" /> fix the minimum age for commencement in each designated trade.</P>

      <P>This amendment is another amendment giving effect to a recommendation by the joint committee that An Chomhairle should be required to consult with the Apprenticeship Committee before making rules under Section 26, regulating the minimum age of entry into apprenticeship.  An Chomhairle would, no doubt, undertake such consultation even if there were no statutory provision requiring it but since it was recommended by the joint committee, I am inserting the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to make it mandatory on An Chomhairle to make <Col N="111" /> rules regulating the dismissal of apprentices.  The section as originally drafted was permissive.  The employers' representatives on the Joint Committee were doubtful about this provision and their doubts mainly arose from the fear that An Chomhairle might neglect to make rules, in view of the permissive nature of the subsection. This possibility will no longer exist, if this amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>This is really a drafting amendment and I ask your permission, Sir, to take amendments Nos. 21 and 49 with it. It is a requirement that the committee should post rules but the amendment requires them to keep the rules posted.  In other words, under the original sections or section, they need only put them up once and take them down, but now they have to keep them in a prominent position.</P>

    <P>As the section stands, it provides that employers should be required &ldquo;to train and instruct&rdquo; apprentices.  In view of the fact that many employers do not themselves carry out the training of apprentices, the joint committee decided that it would be more consistent with such a situation, and equally effective, if the words &ldquo;to ensure the training and instruction&rdquo; were inserted instead of &ldquo;to train and instruct&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>An apprenticeship committee may make rules prohibiting persons carrying on the trade, for which the committee is established, in the district of the committee from taking any premium, fee or other consideration in respect of the employment by them of any person by way of apprenticeship in the trade and in the district.</P>
      <P>Amendment 50 would also go with this and I ask permission to take amendments Nos. 22 and 50 together. The taking of substantial premiums by employers from apprentices is no longer the common practice.  It is proposed, however, that apprenticeship committees should be given power to prohibit the taking of such premiums so that they will be able to prevent any abuses in the event of the reintroduction of that practice.  There was a similar provision in the Act of 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 50 makes the breach of a rule about the taking of premiums an offence punishable by a fine.  It does not indicate that this was an agreed <Col N="113" /> recommendation but I think it is necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doubting that. Notwithstanding what they may say to the effect that this practice is nearly dead, I am sorry to say it is far from dead.  A number of enterprising operators think that a good way to finance their doubtful activities is to advertise for an apprentice.  They get credulous mothers and fathers to dig their hands deep into their pockets in order to draw our an apprenticeship fee for their son, with the assurance that he shows a marvellous intellect and a great aptitude for acquiring the trade which the receiver of the fee promises to impart.  Only too often, the fee is sometimes used to keep the wolf away from his door or to stop some other gap in his finances in some places far removed from his trade.</P>
      <P>I have received letters from people who paid apprenticeship fees for their sons and daughters to learn a trade but not only could they not learn the trade but they could not even get back any portion of the fee by way of remuneration. In recent years, the collection of the apprenticeship fee in many instances has gone hand in hand with very shady practices.  I am glad that this section will prohibit that and make it an offence for persons to accept fees in such circumstances.  It should put an end to an abuse that has existed for too long in many cases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>( )  An apprenticeship committee established for an apprenticeship district for the purposes of a designated trade in which contracts of apprenticeship <Col N="115" /> are normally effected by deed may make rules specifying the form of the contract to be used when a person is taken into employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade and in the district of the committee.</P>
    <P>The section deals with the written forms of contract of apprenticeship. It is understood that these written forms of contract are now not in general use, but where they are still used, it is necessary to ensure that their terms do not conflict with any of the provisions of this Bill or any of the rules made under it.</P>
    <P>The section as originally drafted empowered an apprenticeship committee to determine the form of written contract to be used and made it an offence for an employer to use any other form of contract.  The joint committee felt that the section as originally drafted might enable an apprenticeship committee to require a contract to be effected by deed where this was not the practice.  This amendment is designed to meet the committee's viewpoint and to make it clear that the power is permissive and will be used only where it is necessary to use it.</P>

You will work for five years at your trade.  Then you can go.  You will be a journeyman, a fitter or a carpenter, as the case may be.&rdquo;  What is his ability under this Bill to get a legal document to the effect that he is and is deemed to have been an apprentice to that person when he holds no such document at the moment?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister look into it?  I know of at least one case where a person is employed as an apprentice.  He has no document to the effect that he is so employed.  He learns the trade and is paid a certain rate of wages from year to year.  He hopes in five years to be fully qualified <Col N="116" /> but he has no document saying he is an apprentice.  As far as he is concerned, his apprenticeship depends on the whim of the person who employs him.  Can he in the future require the employer to issue to him a certificate to the effect that what he has been doing and still is doing is part of his scheme of apprenticeship?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 32, page 12, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Rules made by An Chomhairle under any provision of this Act may contain different provisions in respect of different areas in an apprenticeship district.</P>
      <P>(2)  Rules made by an apprenticeship committee under any provision of this Act may contain different provisions in respect of different areas in the district of the committee.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where rules under Section 25 of this Act contain provisions which apply to an area comprising part only of an apprenticeship district, subsection (2) of that section shall, in its application to a person carrying on in that area the trade to which the rules relate, have effect as if the reference therein to an apprenticeship district in which the rules have effect were a reference to that area.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where rules under Section 26 of this Act contain provisions which apply to an area comprising part only of an apprenticeship district, subsection (2) of that section shall, in its application to a person carrying on in that area the trade to which the rules relate, have effect as if the reference therein to an apprenticeship district in which the rules have effect were a reference to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where rules under Section 27 of this Act contain provisions which <Col N="117" /> apply to an area comprising part only of an apprenticeship district, subsection (3) of that section shall, in its application to a person carrying on in that area the trade to which the rules relate, have effect as if the reference therein to an apprenticeship district in which the rules have effect were a reference to that area.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where rules under Section 31 of this Act contain provisions which apply to an area which comprises part only of an apprenticeship district, subsection (2) of that section shall, in its application to a person carrying on in that area the trade to which the rules relate, have effect as if the reference therein to the district of an apprenticeship committee and the reference to the district were references to that area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to give effect to a recommendation of the joint committee that An Chomhairle and the apprenticeship committees should be empowered to make different rules for different areas within an apprenticeship district.  Under the Bill as originally drafted, there is no power to make different rules except by re-dividing the area and appointing a series of apprenticeship committees, if necessary.  This amendment will give apprenticeship committees an additional degree of flexibility in regard to the making of rules and should enable committees to be established in respect of relatively large districts, rather than have a number of small committees administering small areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Before making or confirming rules under any provision of this Act, An Chomhairle shall publish notice in at least two newspapers circulating in the area in which the proposed rules are to have effect, <Col N="118" /> stating that it is intended to make such rules, the nature of the proposed rules, that copies thereof shall be made available, on request, to interested persons and the time, manner and place in which objections and representations in relation to the proposed rules may be made.</P>
    <P>(2)  An Chomhairle shall, before making or confirming rules under any provisions of this Act, consider any objections or representations received, in accordance with a notice under subsection (1) of this section, in relation to the proposed rules.</P>
    <P>This amendment gives effect to a recommendation made by the joint committee that An Chomhairle should publish notice of its intention to make or confirm rules, that the proposed rules should be available to interested persons and that objections or representations in relation to the proposed rules should be considered by An Chomhairle.  It was the intention that An Chomhairle should in practice follow a procedure of this sort but now there will be a statutory obligation on it to do so.  The provision proposed by the amendment follows generally precedents established under the Apprenticeship Act, 1931, and the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>

    <P>Section 33 is designed to ensure that steps will be taken to bring to the notice of persons affected the fact that rules have been made and the place where copies of the rules may be obtained.  As originally drafted, it was proposed that An Chomhairle should publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least two daily newspapers. The joint committee decided that in some cases better publicity might be obtained by a notice in local papers which are in many cases weekly.

      <P>Section 34 as originally drafted prohibited the taking into employment by way of apprenticeship of persons who were not on the register of candidates for apprenticeship provided for in Section 40.  The joint committee recommended that, in addition, the section should prohibit the employment of persons by way of apprenticeship unless the appropriate Apprenticeship Committee had consented to employment with a specified employer.  The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to that recommendation.  The joint committee made the recommendation with a view to preventing abuses such as the use of apprentices as cheap labour by employers who do not possess adequate training facilities.</P>

      <P>29.  Before Section 35, page 12, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  An apprenticeship committee may, after consultation with An Chomhairle, determine the number of persons that, during a specified period, is to be taken into employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade, for which the committee is established in the district of the committee and the committee, if it so thinks proper, may, before the expiration of such period, make, after consultation with An Chomhairle, a further determination altering the number previously determined.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where an apprenticeship committee determines, under subsection (1)  of this section, a number, the committee shall arrange for the taking into employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade, for which the committee is established, in the district of the committee of that number in the period specified in the determination and for that purpose may, if it is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that a sufficient number of persons is not being taken into such employment, in the period specified in the determination, in the trade and in the district, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that a person who carries on the trade in the district has the facilities for training persons by way of apprenticeship in the trade and in the district and is, without reasonable cause, failing to take persons into his employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade and in the district,</P>
      <P>by notice in writing served on that person require him, within a specified period to take into such employment in the trade and in the district a specified number of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  An apprenticeship committee shall not exercise the power conferred <Col N="121" /> by subsection (2) of this section for the purpose of making any arrangement under Section 49 of this Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to replace the original text of Section 35 with a new text.  It will give effect to the following three recommendations of the joint committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That an Apprenticeship Committee which determines the number of apprentices to be admitted to a trade in a specified period will have power to vary the number before the end of the specified period;</P>
    <P>(2)  That the power of the Apprenticeship Committee to compel an employer to take on an apprentice or additional apprentices will be invoked only where the specified number is not being taken on and where the employer concerned has facilities to train apprentices and is unreasonably failing to take on a sufficient number of apprentices;</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Committee's compulsory powers under this section should not be exercised for the transfer of apprentices involved in a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>The aim of this section is to ensure that sufficient numbers of apprentices are taken on each year to ensure that in future there will be enough skilled craftsmen to meet the needs of trade and industry.  Unduly low intake of apprentices leading to an acute and artificial shortage of skilled workers is a complaint often made about existing apprenticeship arrangements.  On the other hand trade unions often argue that the purpose of restricting intake is to ensure that apprentices are not used as a source of cheap labour and that a pool of unemployed craftsmen will not be created.  It will be up to Apprenticeship Committees which will be representative of workers, employers and educational interests to determine each year how many apprentices should be taken into the trade in that year, taking account of the two points of view I have outlined.  It is hoped that the problem will be overcome by goodwill and co-operation on the part of all concerned and that the compulsory powers provided for in this Section will <Col N="122" /> be used only as a measure of last resort.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> With the permission of the Chair I propose to take amendments Nos. 31 and 32 together.  The purpose of these two amendments is to seal a possible loophole in subsection (2) of Section 36 as originally drafted.  There were somewhat similar provisions in the Apprenticeship Act, 1931.  In a court case taken under that Act a district justice held that an apprentice and employer had fulfilled their obligations if the apprentice attended one class during a course in a technical school.  The purpose of this amendment is to require the apprentice to attend at all the classes so as to ensure that such a decision as has been taken can never be taken again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>( )  Where a person upon whom a notice under paragraph (a)  of sub-section (2)  of this section has been served is allowed time and liberty to attend, during normal working hours, an instruction which is part of a course provided under sub-section (1)  of this section and fails to attend, then, notwithstanding anything contained in his contract with his employer, he shall not be entitled to receive the amount of any pay (being pay which he would otherwise be entitled to receive) which is apportionable to the period <Col N="124" /> of his absence from his employment by way of apprenticeship unless he satisfies his employer that his failure to attend the instruction was due to sickness or other unavoidable cause.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 will go together with this amendment.  As the Bill was originally drafted an apprentice who failed, without reasonable excuse, to attend the technical school course would be guilty of an offence punishable by a fine.  The Joint Committee recommended that it would be much more effective to penalise the apprentice by an appropriate deduction from his wages if he failed to attend technical school classes without reasonable excuse.  I have accepted that recommendation and as a corollary it is proposed by amendments Nos. 51 and 52 to delete the power to take proceedings against apprentices who fail in this regard.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The person having custody of a register kept under this section shall, upon request, permit the register to be inspected by any interested person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to deal with amendments Nos. 38 and 39 together. Section 40 provides for the keeping of a register of candidates for apprenticeship and Section 41, for the keeping of a register of apprentices by an apprenticeship committee.  Each of the sections contains provisions requiring the register to be kept open for inspection at all reasonable hours.</P>
      <P>On further consideration, I have decided that this requirement is too rigid and is perhaps incapable of being complied with in certain circumstances. Many of the apprenticeship committees, particularly those in the provincial areas, would meet only at infrequent intervals and might not have any permanent offices.  In such circumstances, it would be difficult to keep the register open for inspection at all reasonable hours.</P>
      <P>The alternative text submitted here provides that the rights of all interested persons will be preserved, that is, their rights to inspect the register, but they would have to request the person who has custody of the register to permit inspection.  In the circumstances, that is more practical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to enable part of the funds of suitors vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to be utilised for three specific <Col N="132" /> purposes, namely, to finance the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance the repair and renovation of the buildings of the Society of King's Inns and to provide for the creation of a captial fund for the maintenance of the Library and to recoup the Exchequer a sum advanced in 1944 by way of a Grant-in-Aid to the Library for the re-binding of books.</P>
    <P>A suggestion that the State should provide assistance towards the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre was first put forward by the owners of the Theatre, the National Theatre Society, in 1937, when they were being pressed by Dublin Corporation to make changes in the building to ensure safety from fire.  Although the idea was received favourably by successive Ministers for Finance, various factors, including the advent of the Second World War, operated to delay its coming to a head.  Meanwhile, in 1951 the building was damaged by fire and left unfit for further performances. Alternative temporary accommodation was obtained in the Rupert Guinness Memorial Hall and afterwards in the Queen's Theatre, which is still being used.</P>
    <P>In December, 1954, the then Government announced that, subject to the approval of the Dáil, they would supplement whatever funds the Directors of the Abbey had, or might have themselves to rebuild the Theatre on the old site in accordance with plans to be approved of on general lines. There was delay in preparing sketch plans due to protracted negotiations for the acquisition of an adjoining public house with a view to its demolition so as to enlarge the site. These premises were ultimately acquired in 1957 and a sum of £26,000 was voted by way of Supplementary Estimate in 1957/58 in respect of their acquisition.  Sketch plans for the new Theatre prepared by the Architect, Mr. Michael Scott (in consultation with Monsieur Pierre Sonrel of Paris) have since been received and approved by the Minister for Finance.  Detailed plans and specifications are shortly to be submitted after which the contract for the work will be placed.</P>
    <P>The National Theatre Society has <Col N="133" /> received annual State assistance for the Abbey since 1925-26 because of its importance in the cultural life of the metropolis and the country.  The current year's provision under this head is £14,000 (Subhead B of Miscellaneous Expenses Estimate).  The Society's policy is to cater for the production of plays by Irish playwrights reflecting the way of life of the Irish people. Being thus restricted in the choice of its performances and having to compete with the cinema and other forms of indoor entertainment, including to an increasing extent television, the Theatre inevitably operates at a loss. Moreover, the Queen's Theatre premises are not regarded as being suitable to meet the requirements of Abbey audiences.  In addition they are expensive to run&mdash;which all adds to the loss.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, including that of the Abbey's prestige, it is clear that the sooner it gets new premises the better.  As the State has been assisting the Theatre annually, it is only logical that it should come to the Theatre's assistance in the matter of providing a new building.  In fact it has already contributed an instalment of the cost by the grant of £26,000 for site acquisition in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>Associated with the Abbey are many Irish names of international repute such as Synge, Yeats, O'Casey, Robinson and Murray and it is to be hoped that the new Abbey, with its second auditorium for experimental plays and the like, will stimulate fresh development in Irish dramatic art.  It is considered, in all the circumstances, that the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre is a very appropriate purpose to which some of the suitors' funds vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice might be applied.</P>
    <P>I come now to the provisions with respect to King's Inns.  Some two years ago the Chief Justice approached the Government on behalf of the Benchers, who are the controlling body of the Society of King's Inns, to ask for financial assistance because of the difficulties they were experiencing in maintaining the Society's buildings and running its Library notwithstanding that heavy <Col N="134" /> increases had been made in the fees and subscriptions which constitute the Society's principal source of income.</P>
    <P>Later there was a meeting between the representatives of the Benchers and the Taoiseach at which the Minister for Finance and I were present at which the matter was fully discussed. As a result of these discussions and the inquiries which followed it became evident that the buildings, which were erected at the beginning of the last century, were in danger of falling into ruins unless money could be found to undertake an extensive programme of renovation and repair and that this danger had been much increased by the appearance of dry rot.  Such a programme, it was estimated, would cost about £45,000 to complete.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on this scale is quite beyond the resources of the Society which unlike some of the English Inns of Court has benefited from no rich endowments.  At the same time the running of the Society's Library has been a heavy financial burden.  Its only income is a grant of £433 a year which was authorised by the Copyright Act of 1836 when the privilege of receiving free books was withdrawn and the whole of this sum has to be expended on the purchase of books and is, in fact, insufficient for that purpose.</P>
    <P>King's Inns was the last work in Dublin of James Gandon, the architect who designed and supervised the erection of the Custom House, the Four Courts, the Military Infirmary and the Westmoreland Street facade of the Bank of Ireland.  Gandon retired while the building was in course of construction and the work was completed by his pupil and partner, Henry Aaron Baker.  The cupola above the join of the two wings was designed by Francis Johnson, the architect of the General Post Office, Dublin.  Before the completion of the south wing (intended for the Library) it was taken over by the Government to house, first, the Prerogative Court and, later, the Registry of Deeds.  The Registry of Deeds has occupied this portion of the building ever since. When the Government took over the south wing it became necessary to <Col N="135" /> make other provision for the library. A site was found adjacent and the present Library, which was completed in 1827, was then built on this site. The architect was Frederick Darley. In 1892 the Library was enlarged by the addition of an annexe, in stone and steel, on the east end of the building.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, agreement amongst those best qualified to judge that the building of which King's Inns constitute the north wing is a minor classic and one of the finest buildings of its kind in Dublin.  In the Government's view it is well worth preserving. The Library contains a very valuable collection of books.  As well as being used by students and barristers it is open to the public on certain conditions and permission for reading and reference is freely given.  Subsection (4)  of Section 2 of the Bill provides for the payment to the trustees of the Society of sums totalling £70,000 of which the sum of £25,000 is for the creation of an investment fund and the application of the income thereof for the maintenance of the Library or the general purposes of the Society, the balance being earmarked to recoup or defray the cost of expenditure incurred or to be incurred on the Society's buildings.</P>
    <P>The funds of suitors include the unclaimed dividends and balances to the credit of suitors and estates carried down for at least two centuries to the Judicature Act, 1877, by which all the Superior Courts in Ireland were amalgamated. Since then there have been added further accumulations and additions down to the present time.  These are what are known as the dormant funds.  The destruction of the Four Courts and the Public Record Office in 1922 have made the establishment of claims to the funds accumulated prior to 1922 virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>The funds of suitors have been resorted to from time to time for public purposes.  In general, the direction of these appropriations was for such purposes as the building of the Four Courts, the Public Record Office, the Bar Library and purposes in connection <Col N="136" /> with the Superior Courts in Dublin.  The net effect of the appropriations already made is that the amounts of cash and securities standing to the credit of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice in the Bank of Ireland and the books of the various companies whose securities he holds are <i>less</i> than the amounts of cash and securities standing to the credit of suitors by, respectively, £325,150 and £130,000.  In other words, cash and securities to the amount of £455,150 have already been withdrawn in pursuance of statutory authority.</P>
    <P>I am calling attention to this lest it be supposed that the dormant funds are inexhaustible.  In the aggregate they amount to some £860,000 of which more than half has already been withdrawn. Accordingly, the withdrawal of a further sum of £323,000, for which the Bill provides, will exhaust the funds when account is taken of the fall in the value of the investments.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that, as in the case of previous withdrawals, the Bill affords a complete indemnity to suitors by which they will be absolutely protected from any possible loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This apparently represents practically an exhaustion of the funds in the account dealing with the funds of suitors.  I take these two objects set out in the proposed legislation as being proper, worthy and welcome applications of whatever moneys there are.  The Minister is quite right in warning that there are no further funds to be drawn on.  It is a fact that over the years these funds have grown.  There is no doubt that over five, ten or 15 years they have amounted to substantial sums to be drawn upon for purposes such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said there are three purposes.  I take them under two headings.  There is the payment for the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre. Secondly, there are, under two heads, the gift of £70,000 to the Benchers of King's Inns.  With regard to the Abbey Theatre, £26,000 was already expended in 1957 as regards the acquisition of the site.  I noticed that subsection (2) rather limits the payment of the £250,000, or whatever <Col N="137" /> sum is drawn for the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre.  A narrow interpretation of that might mean just the application of the funds to the actual structure itself.  Personally, when I read this Bill first, I wondered whether any advance was to be made not only towards acquisition but towards exhausting other claims in the area where the new theatre will be built. It may well be that the sum of £26,000 brought in in 1957-58 already provided for that and no further sum is likely to be incurred on anything except the actual building of the Abbey Theatre.  If there is anything else, it might be well to have this phrase modified in some way.</P>
    <P>This, as the Minister explained, is merely for the rebuilding.  While the Minister went into a certain amount of detail with regard to the plays that have been produced and the people in Irish literature and culture who have had their plays brought on to the Abbey stage, I should expect Deputies to confine themselves to the question of the proper use of these funds and apply them to the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre.  That should be done irrespective of what a Deputy's own view might be as to the type of play that might be produced. I do not think we have that right.  I hope we would not be given any right with regard to criticism of the sums that have been given.  Either we trust those who run the Abbey Theatre or we do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who do not should keep their objections for the people who administer those funds and not seek at this point to diminish the funds by way of any reflection on whatever plays which may have met with objection in the minds of certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to what I call the second matter&mdash;the payment in connection with the trustees of the Society of the King's Inns of the sum of £70,000.  I welcome this sum.  I am glad the Minister has put this on the footing that the buildings which the Society inherited are worth preserving. Great efforts have been made by the <Col N="138" /> Benchers themselves to have these buildings properly repaired, maintained and kept in a way which would be a credit to them and the city.  The Benchers' efforts are strictly limited. They have certain securities bringing in a certain amount of income.  They have no other way of increasing this income.</P>
    <P>Other sources of revenue which the Benchers have are very limited indeed. It is mainly a question of fees paid by students.  These fees have been seriously raised in the past number of years, so seriously, indeed, that, as an individual, I feel that they are a very severe heavy imposition on the parents of students.  There is no other way in which the Benchers can secure funds.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years, the Benchers have pledged their credit with the bank to a very considerable extent.  The repairs which have been carried through by the Benchers themselves in a period of less than five years amount to about £20,000.  Practically the whole of that has been paid by overdraft.  A situation has been reached in which the securities which the Society have are very nearly exhausted. A precarious position was approaching, if not already reached.</P>
    <P>The future is not very rosy as far as the preservation of the buildings is concerned.  There are two main buildings&mdash;the library and the chief King's Inns buildings.  I saw an account some time ago.  The Benchers have to meet the cost of certain work already done and not yet paid for and also the cost of certain other work connected with the King's Inns buildings proper which must be done.  The estimated expenditure one time was £12,000.  The library requires for decoration and repair, apart altogether from maintenance, a sum of about £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000.  If this free money, so to speak, is used to pay off the overdraft &mdash;it is a very substantial overdraft&mdash; for the Benchers, there is barely sufficient to meet, as I say, the work already done or advised to be done, or the work which, in accordance with the architect's report, appears to be absolutely necessary for the proper repair and redecoration of the library itself.</P>
    <P>The figures I put previously before <Col N="139" /> the Government, have, I think, changed very seriously to the disadvantage of the Society.  I believe that the moneys which will have to be expended are a great deal more than the two sums I have mentioned. Nevertheless, the situation has very definitely improved.  The buildings in the state of preservation in which they have been put over the past five years are in a condition in which the maintenance costs ought to diminish to a considerable extent.  From the plans and the recommendations of the architects and others, it appears that heavier expenditure than what was thought at first may have to be incurred.  The buildings were left by the British, when they evacuated this country, in a very bad state indeed and there has been no great money apparently spent on them for many years.</P>
    <P>On the first approach by the Benchers to inquire into this whole matter, it was discovered, first of all, that there was a certain amount of dry rot but, at a later stage, more serious defects were revealed.  What is called fungal attack, worm infestation, boring beetle, and all sorts of things were discovered and once the inquiry started, it led on to recommendations for extensive repairs which were being put up as being necessary. The investigation showed very serious defects in the whole of the King's Inns buildings as well as the Library, requiring very heavy expenditure and that the whole of the defects in the building have been completely eradicated by the expenditure heavy though it was, is not just accepted by everybody except those of the most optimistic frame of mind.  Nevertheless, the position will be very definitely improved and the burden which the Benchers have to carry in their efforts to preserve these buildings and to provide for the education of future lawyers will be very greatly lessened and, for that, the Benchers, I am sure, would have thanked the Government at the time as I thank them now.</P>
    <P>I urge a few technical points.  Sub-section (2)  of Section 2 speaks of the Capital Fund.  The Capital Fund is the fund set up by the Central Fund Act, <Col N="140" /> 1956.  It is not defined in this Bill as being that fund.  There is merely this reference in a sort of accidental way in sub-section (2)  and it is quite clear to anybody reading it, but it may not be the interpretation given to it later if any Court discussion took place that that is clearly to be identified as the Capital Fund established by a particular part of Section 4 of the Central Fund Act, 1956.  I am sure that this has been looked at, but, if not, I would ask that attention be devoted to it.  It may be necessary in the definitions to define the fund as being the Capital Fund referred to in the Act of 1956.</P>
    <P>I could have wished that some other way had been discovered of dealing with this matter.  The Capital Fund established by the Central Fund Act, 1956, was, of course, the fund into which there were paid the moneys derived from the special import duties and those special import duties had been put on for certain purposes to help in respect of capital matters. There was a restriction put upon the expenditure of the moneys and it is that restriction which is now referred to in sub-section (2)  of Section 2 of this Act, which runs that, notwithstanding anything contained in the particular sub-section, the Capital Fund may be applied for the purpose of the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>That is a very definite gap brought about in the old Capital Fund.  It is a very definite swerve away from the purpose for which the Capital Fund was established and the reason why sub-section (2)  has to be put in is that payments out of the Capital Fund were restricted.  The Minister was there given power to apply for any purposes for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided and, it then continued, &ldquo;which are conducive to the development or improvement of capital resources&rdquo;.  The fund was clearly intended to be used for the development of capital resources and now there is an encroachment on that.  As I say, I have no objection to moneys of this type being set apart for the rebuilding of the Abbey, but this is the first attack upon the Capital Fund.  It may be followed by others and within a very <Col N="141" /> short time, we may find that the Capital Fund, built up for capital purposes, will be entirely dissipated by its being devoted to other things.  I would have wished that the matter could be handled in another way, and I think it could easily have been, but the draftsman decided on this way of doing it.</P>
    <P>According to the later sub-sections of Section 4 of the Central Fund Act, 1956, the Minister has to prepare an account of any payments into or out of the fund and an account has to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, by a later subsection, a copy of every report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of such account must be put before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As far as the payment made to the trustees of the Benchers of the King's Inns is concerned, there will be a single payment, I presume.  There will be nothing to report except merely that the payment was made.  But, the maximum of £250,000 for the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre will, I assume, be paid out in such fractions during the course of a year or years as may be required for the purpose.  I presume that there is still an obligation on the Minister, seeing that this is now a source of the Capital Fund, to have an account prepared of any moneys coming to some part of this £250,000 and to send that to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to have a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to these sums.</P>
    <P>I do not know in what period this £250,000 will be spent by those in charge of the Abbey but it would possibly mean that over a number of years, when a report is presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General and there have been payments of certain sums during a number of years, there will be an occasion year by year for discussion on how the building is going and, if people have any views as to whether it is according to good plan or if there is any deficiency that occurs to Deputies to talk about, there will be an opportunity for these criticisms to be made.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill says that the State assumes the liability in respect of this amount of £323,000, that is to say, <Col N="142" /> if any claims are made against this dormant fund.  The Minister has given us certain figures with regard to the accumulation of this fund, which was £860,000 at one time and has been reduced by certain demands, that £450,000 has been already drawn, and we are now drawing £323,000.  Can the Minister tell us&mdash;I think the answer will be a satisfactory one&mdash;whether there have been any late, so to speak, claims in respect of any of these funds. Has any claim come in against any part of the whole £455,000 already used?  I only want to get some indication of how far these funds are really dormant or whether there is a revival of interest by those who own these funds from time to time and to what extent that has depleted what otherwise might be a bigger fund.</P>

      <P>I do not agree at all with my colleague, Deputy McGilligan. I think we should be allowed to have a full discussion here when the Members of this House are going to agree to pay out £250,000 which the Minister will get out of the funds of suitors for the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre.  We are supposed to give £250,000 towards rebuilding the Abbey Theatre.  I am in full agreement with that because the Abbey is dear to all Irishmen.  It is something we were proud of&mdash;and I said &ldquo;were proud of&rdquo;. When we have to pay the piper we should be allowed to call the tune for the people running the Abbey.  It has been receiving a subsidy from Dáil Éireann for many years.  I have no objection to that.  I would be in favour of increasing it were it necessary.  This occasion gives me an opportunity of calling attention to the dead hand policy of the Abbey for many years past.</P>

      <P>In his introductory speech the Minister said that the Abbey had to carry on at a loss in spite of television and so on.  There is a great revival of interest in the live theatre at present and I do not think the Abbey faces as bad a time as the Minister conveyed in his speech.  He said it had to be subsidised because of all its great difficulties.  I do not think its difficulties are great at all.</P>

      <P>Everyone will agree with the provision of £250,000 for the Abbey Theatre but I believe we in Cork have a crib about it.  The Government <Col N="144" /> were generous in giving a loan towards the rebuilding of Cork Opera House, which was burned down, too, but I fail to see why they did not give a grant.  There is as much claim on the Government's generosity in the capital of the south as there is here in Dublin.  There is a big difference between the treatment concerning the rebuilding of the Abbey and the loan offered for Cork Opera House.  As those of us connected with local authorities know, there are always strings attached to a loan besides the matter of repayment.  The Minister could have shown greater generosity by giving a slice of this money to the Cork Opera House.  I shall not follow in the tracks of Deputy Lynch, but all I can say is this.  When the Abbey Theatre were on their high horse, at least Kerry and Cork combined to show that the play <i>Sive,</i> rejected by the Abbey, was a success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance a point has arisen, on which, with respect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like, as a Deputy, to comment.  I think I have a perfect right to discuss the policy of the Abbey in this regard if this House is to vote money for them.  I should like formally, in case it should go by in the record as a precedent, to make that statement and to say that I think it is a serious matter that the consideration of policy like that should be barred when we are discussing the voting of moneys.  Although I have not anything particular to say on the precise subject, I think the issue that has arisen in regard to this is of such importance to warrant making this remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general policy, many of us would wish that the policy adopted perhaps sometimes were different, but on the whole I must agree with Deputy McGilligan in general terms that it is within certain limits and the limits do not come up for discussion in this debate.  It is better that the people charged with those matters should exercise their discretion.  There are always sanctions available in other ways afterwards in this House.  I did not intend to talk on the question of the Abbey except <Col N="145" /> to make this statement I have made about our right to debate matters of policy without restriction while this House is asked to vote moneys.</P>
    <P>I am more particularly interested in the proposal to assist the Society of the King's Inns.  It is one of the few occasions on which any of the transactions and dealings of that body come before us.  Perhaps we should not let the opportunity pass without remarking on the work being done by that, if you like, vocational body.  The point has been dealt with in greater detail by Deputy McGilligan but the King's Inns has, as the educating and controlling body for one branch of the legal profession, fulfilled a very useful function in our society.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make this remark in connection with it.  In these days when organisation, and the compulsion of modern life force patterns on a community which often tend to be prejudicial to the interests of the individual, it is in the law courts, as we traditionally know them&mdash;in the tradition of law fostered by the Benchers, by the Society and by the legal profession&mdash;that the best guarantee for the individual will be found in the long run.  Anything that can be done to preserve that position is a useful contribution to our constitutional stability.  Taking for granted that there is no need to argue further for the cause, the question then is what concrete steps are to be taken?  Again, Deputy McGilligan forestalled me in his reference to the condition of the buildings.  The Minister referred to the history of them, and so forth.  Now, apart from the constitutional asset, if one might so describe it, in the Society itself and in its traditions, we have in the actual buildings a municipal asset, if not a national asset.  The allocation of funds to preserve these buildings then is something with which no one, I think, would quarrel.</P>
    <P>Moving in that area in the past, one was struck by the shabby appearance of the locality as a whole.  Anything that can be done to refresh it will be a useful contribution to life in that part of the city.  Possibly I am going outside the rules of order now, but I would suggest that the <Col N="146" /> whole of Henrietta Street and the King's Inns should be the object of attention for the purpose of rehabilitating them.  There are in the vicinity houses in very poor condition and renovation, if not rebuilding, is necessary. There is a housing problem there of sorts, but that is a matter for the Dublin Corporation.  I think it would be appropriate to take measures to put these buildings in order and restore them, now that this money is being allocated for a specific purpose. The time is opportune to deal with the vicinity as a whole.  There is a park in front of the King's Inns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice would scarcely have any responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but I think I should take this opportunity to make this very proper suggestion. I know the funds can only be applied to the purpose the Minister has suggested, and I have no wish to go further than that.  At the same time, I cannot refrain from suggesting that the park could be developed into a very attractive amenity.  Where the funds would come from for that development I do not know.  I do not know if the Office of Public Works would have any responsibility.  If what I have suggested were done, the Minister would not only achieve the purpose for which he is allocating these funds now, but his purpose would be greatly enhanced.</P>
      <P>I agree with a previous speaker that this is a commendable and welcome measure.  I suggest that the project would be greatly enhanced were the Government to co-ordinate its activities with those of the Dublin Corporation with the object of rehabilitating the area as a whole.  Dublin would then have an asset of considerable value to it and to the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to the financial implications in this matter.  I understood there was a sum of over £400,000 available, of which £250,000 was to be allocated to the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre and £70,000 to the repair and renovation of the King's Inn.  That seems to me <Col N="147" /> to leave quite a substantial amount of money on hands and, if my calculation is correct, I should like to support the sentiments expressed by Deputy Desmond. He suggested that before arriving at decisions to spend these substantial amounts in the capital city regard might be had to the cultural needs of other areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned Cork and the rebuilding of the Opera House there.  My native city, the third city in the State, has not even got a civic theatre.  Quite apart from that, it recently suffered a very substantial loss through the burning of the only small theatre in the city.  Some day, the Government might make an effort to break away from this apparent desire to centralise so much expenditure in and near the city of Dublin.  I do not say that in any narrow sense. I appreciate there are certain national institutions which must, of necessity, be located in Dublin.  When, however, it is a question of giving substantial grants to encourage culture, art, drama and so forth, the time is opportune for an appreciation of the fact that there are other places in the country besides Dublin in which culture should also be encouraged.  On my calculation there is still something left in the kitty and, when the Minister comes to allocate the balance, I hope he will have regard to the fact that there are other centres, outside Dublin which voluntarily, and without any assistance, do much to encourage the amateur theatrical movement in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency which has made its mark in the sphere of amateur drama, I welcome the Minister's approach to the problem of the Abbey Theatre.  We are all aware that the Abbey Theatre could not, by its own unaided efforts, take any steps to procure a building worthy of the purpose which it is called upon to fulfil.  The Abbey is a national institution.  For years, pressure has been brought upon the Government to do something to assist to erect a building for the Abbey Theatre.  I can appreciate that the Government have to be somewhat conservative in <Col N="148" /> providing funds for a project of this kind.  I am happy now that the Government have found it possible to allocate these funds.  I am sure they took every precaution to ensure they were on safe ground before deciding to make these moneys available.</P>
      <P>The Abbey, as I have said, is a national institution.  From that point of view, it is only right that the Government should start at the top.  At the same time, I endorse the suggestion made by Deputy Russell that the Minister might find it possible at some later date to allocate sums to the other parts of the country and to rural areas generally to help local drama organisations to erect buildings for the development of drama in these districts.</P>
      <P>A big drawback in this matter from the point of view of drama is the lack of facilities which is to be noted in provincial areas and even in big towns. Now that the Government have seen fit to recognise the importance of a national theatre in the city of Dublin, I hope that in a short time they will attend to the points which have been made this evening and which I support. I feel that the attempt which has been made to discuss the policy of the Abbey Theatre is something which should not have occurred on this Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to make money available to preserve an idea and an ideal in the very atmosphere, on the same site where a dramatic tradition of national importance and high standards has grown up; to make some impact on our national culture; and to spread the quality of Irish dramatic art not only throughout the provinces here but also in other lands which have an interest in Ireland.</P>
      <P>We all hoped that sufficient funds would be available to promote the same idea in any other part of Ireland where there was sufficient foundation for it.  There is no use in half doing a job and when the Government&mdash;with, I am sure, the support of all Parties and the country generally&mdash;decided to rebuild the Abbey as a national cultural centre, there was no use in distributing the funds over the country and having none of the works completed so they decided to complete this work.  I feel sure there may be some comparison between this project and the rebuilding of the Opera House in Cork because the Abbey plays were presented there, just as they were in many other cities in Ireland, but we must recognise that the Cork Opera House was a private enterprise. It was burned down and it was only partly insured, and the people of Cork and the surrounding districts have set up a fund which we hope will be supplemented.  We had hoped it would be supplemented from this fund but when there is not sufficient money, we can have no grievance. At any rate, the general interest of the provinces will not be neglected when a cultural ideal of this nature is being preserved.</P>

I do not propose to advance any claim on behalf of any other project apart from the two dealt with in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would urge, though, as a point to be made to the Minister that when dealing with subsection (4), paragraph (b)  of Section 2, which states:</P>

      <P>that stress should be laid upon the necessity for the editing of textbooks which are now hopelessly out-of-date and upon which money could be well spent, both in the interests of legal administration and from the point of view also of providing some purpose for people who are interested in that kind of avocation.</P>
      <P>As to subsection (1) of Section 2&mdash; this may well be a Committee Stage point&mdash;while others do not seem to share my anxiety, there does not seem to be any machinery for making any kind of application to the Chief Justice for the payments out.  The Minister might do well to consult his advisers as to whether some change should not be made there saying that the Bank of Ireland &ldquo;shall, upon the order of the Chief Justice, upon motion by somebody on behalf of the Capital Fund, the Minister or the Trustees of the Society...&rdquo;  As it stands at present, it seems to me it would be a matter simply for the Chief Justice to do it, without any obligation upon him with regard to time.  There is not any such provision as to an appointed day or anything of the kind to which we are accustomed in other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the policy of the Abbey Theatre is not for discussion, except in a very general way.  I have no objection to the description of &ldquo;national theatre&rdquo; if it is truly national and of nation-wide application. Neither have I any objection <Col N="152" /> to the term &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;, provided it is cultural and representative of what we understand to be culture in this country.  It is one thing to be a live, national cultural centre.  It is quite another thing to be something that is trying to preserve a tradition that has no cogency in the times in which we live.  It might be well if that were borne in mind in any directions that might be given as to the expenditure and the use of this money, as far as the Abbey Theatre is concerned.</P>

      <P>As one of the latest arrivals on this political stage, may I make my humble submission in relation to this Bill.  My contribution is a criticism but not of the objects of the Bill which I think are worthy and which deserve the support of every Deputy.  My objection to the Bill is that it proposes to give a substantial sum to a company which has exasperated, annoyed and irritated some of the very best elements in the country.  Whether those who are annoyed with or exasperated by the Abbey Theatre directorship are right or not is not the point at issue here. There is a considerable amount of public uneasiness regarding the existing directorship of the Abbey Theatre and such a vast sum of money should not be handed over to that directorship until public uneasiness has been allayed.  Any person who takes the trouble to spend 1/- and 15 minutes of time, as I have done, in the Companies Office to read file 3360 of the Irish National Theatre Society Limited, will find on that file plenty to cause considerable uneasiness.  It shows a history in which a majority of directors at any one time have, by deliberate action, silenced a director who was in a minority.  That is not desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this House is to hand money over for the purpose of building a new Abbey Theatre which we hope and trust will carry on the finest traditions and achieve the objectives of those who founded the Abbey Theatre many years ago, it falls on us to ensure that that money is spent by a Board which has the confidence of the majority of the people.  I am not for a moment concerned with the opinions of cranks. <Col N="153" /> I am not for a moment concerned with the opinions of play writers whose plays have been rejected and who have provoked the disparaging remark of the Managing Director of the Abbey that the reason why so many people are opposed to him and his co-directors is that the directors have turned down so many worthless plays.</P>
    <P>My concern is that the vast majority of the Irish people take no interest in the Abbey Theatre and, as for the minority, the majority of the minority have no confidence in the existing directorship.  That is not a healthy situation.  If an opportunity should come such as has now arrived to do something about it, then I respectfully say, we should do something about restoring public confidence in the theatre before handing over this money.</P>
    <P>Completely apart from any personal arguments which may have taken place between directors of the Abbey Theatre and other individuals in this country, the existing directorship is justifiably not deserving of our confidence in that when the Abbey Theatre was burned to the ground, several leading industrialists and several generous-minded people offered money for the rebuilding of a new Abbey but the existing directorship spurned those offers of help.  Some years later, having refused the help that was to be given out of the goodness of people's hearts, the directors then turned to the State and sought the money out of the taxpayers' pockets.  It is only because some intelligent person decided to use money which would otherwise be lying inactive in the funds in Court that the taxpayer is being saved the immediate burden of providing this large amount of money but it would not be relevant to this Bill to say that the money might be spent in another fashion.  It is relevant to say that we would not have to hand all this money to the Abbey if the existing directorship had accepted the wonderful offers of generous help from many sections of people at the time the Abbey was burned.</P>
    <P>I think the reason they spurned <Col N="154" /> these offers of help was that they did not want anybody to have any say whatever regarding their policy.  If people had subscribed tens of thousands of pounds, they would have had some moral right to criticise. That is not a healthy situation.  If it is to be a national theatre, it must be run by a society and by a board which has the confidence of the majority of the people.  That will not be achieved if the existing Memorandum and Articles of Association are left as they are.  Therefore, I respectfully say that before this money is handed over, public confidence should be restored in the directorship of the Abbey by ensuring that those who do criticise are not squeezed out of any influence which they might have by the directors using the powers they now have under the Memorandum and Articles of Association as they stand.</P>
    <P>Regarding the money to be spent on the King's Inns, I am a member of a profession which was ejected by the learned Benchers of the King's Inns many years ago but I do not hold that against the members of the King's Inns.  But I think it is time to rationalise the legal profession.  Here in this capital city of Dublin, we have, to my knowledge, five law libraries and possibly there are more.  If money can be saved and if a more modern and better system can be put into operation, I think it ought to be done, but in relation to this Bill I suppose we must preserve the building of the King's Inns, whether we house a law library in it or not but a change in the divisions in the legal profession is something to which we ought to turn our minds in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I rose here this evening and I was told I should not speak on the policy of the directors of the Abbey Theatre.  We have just heard his maiden speech by Deputy Ryan, in the course of which he referred to the policy of the directors of the Abbey Theatre.  I ask that I should be allowed to say, as I was saying, that the Abbey has been described as the National Theatre but is not a national theatre.  It has lost all claim to be called a National <Col N="155" /> Theatre.  It is buried down in the &ldquo;Queens&rdquo; in Dublin and they will not go on tour.</P>
      <P>I have heard my colleagues say that this money should not have been given holus-bolus to the Abbey Theatre. Some Deputies have said that some of the money should go to Cork and Deputy Russell has said some of it should go to Limerick.  Two years ago, we opened the Theatre Royal in Waterford and I did not come to this House to look for the money for it. The Waterford people reopened the theatre.</P>
      <P>I come now to a complaint which I wanted to make and which I think I am now entitled to make.  We invited the Abbey Theatre to send their company down to Waterford.  I have the correspondence here and it is only right that one letter should be read here from the directors of the Abbey Theatre, the people to whom we propose to hand over £250,000.  They said:</P>
      <P>... if we had two plays each of which could be performed by seven or eight people and each of which could be well cast from our company without leaving the other short of suitable talent.  In that case we could send whichever of the two plays seemed most suitable to Waterford and keep the other in the Queens.</P>
      <P>That means they have only eight or nine actors or actresses about which they think anything because they have not been recruiting them.  If they have not the money to recruit them they should go to Illsley and McCabe, Lord Longford, Cyril Cusack and Anew McMaster who are able to barnstorm all the towns in Ireland, to bring real drama to the countryside without any subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all proud of the Abbey Theatre.  It is a possession of which Irishmen everywhere are proud.  We are actually proud only of a tradition. We are proud of authors who are dead.  We are proud of great actors who have gone by with nobody to take their place.  It is not a legend&mdash;<Col N="156" /> it has been freely said&mdash;that a play that has reached the international stage, written by an Irishman, was submitted to the Abbey and returned by them.  This man had been over the course a few times and had struck some of the pages here and there.  It came back rejected with the pages stuck.  These are the people to whom we are giving this £250,000.</P>
    <P>The Abbey Theatre is dear to all Irishmen, but it is doubly dear to Dublin men.  Therefore, the Minister as a Dublin man looking upon the Abbey with a double reverence should, as I said when I was ruled out of order, ensure since we pay the piper we should be allowed to call the tune. I often hear people say that the political arm should not enter into these things.  It is the political arm that votes the money and I do not see anything wrong with whatever Government is in power having representation on that Board so that the tune may be called if the necessity arises. The reason the directors of the Abbey would not have the help of Dublin merchants and other people who are proud of the Abbey and wanted it rebuilt when it had been burned was that they were afraid these merchants would look for some representation on the Board.</P>
    <P>There have been two plays rejected by the Abbey in recent times which have reached the international theatre. The people who really count are the theatre-goers in Ireland and in Dublin and they have been complaining about the Abbey for years.  A prominent civil servant stood up in the Abbey eight or nine years ago and protested about the type of show that was being put on in the old Abbey, and he was right.  But of course the directors of the Abbey were able to say: &ldquo;Hit me now with the child in my arms.  This is the national theatre and the men who died shall be remembered forever&rdquo; and so on, thus covering themselves with a smokescreen.  Anybody who criticises them will be called a Philistine.  I would prefer to be with the Philistines in this instance because I would not like to see the great tradition of the old Abbey die, and the great tradition of the old Abbey is being murdered by the present Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> We are providing money so that the fabric of the old Abbey will be restored. We would ask the Minister to take the precaution of seeing that the policy and the administration of this new Abbey Theatre will be overhauled so that it will return to its former greatness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the discussion has digressed from the main purpose for which the Bill was brought in.  We are dealing here in the main not with the policy of the Abbey Theatre but with the distribution of a certain sum of money which we are taking from funds of suitors known as the dormant funds.  If the Abbey Directors are not running the theatre in the way the public demand it should be run, the remedy rests with the public.  I am not myself acquainted with any of the complaints to which Deputies have referred in regard to the policy of the Abbey Theatre.  The Abbey Theatre, no matter how anyone may look at it, is a national institution and has been regarded as such by the Irish people; not only has it been regarded as such by the Irish people but it is internationally regarded as the national theatre of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Abbey is restricted to some extent in regard to the type of plays it may produce.  Other theatres are not so prevented from putting on the type of show they think will pay.  I believe, myself, that the Abbey Theatre has been the fount of practically all the dramatic art that has grown up in this country over a number of years.  We all know that there are dramatic societies in practically every county in Ireland which are highly competent societies capable of producing plays in a creditable manner.  Most of these plays are plays that have been produced by the Abbey Theatre from time to time and the proof that the Abbey Theatre is the fount from which most of these societies spring is the very fact that, looking at these amateur dramatic societies producing their plays, one is immediately struck by what I might almost describe as the impersonation of the Abbey actors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we are not discussing the <Col N="158" /> question of the policy of the Abbey Theatre.  We are discussing the question of the appropriation of these funds in conjunction with the Bill. The dormant funds are not inexhaustible. There are no means by which we can get money out of these dormant funds for any of the other proposals which have been made here this evening. I think it would be true to say that the amount of money which we are withdrawing from these dormant funds may possibly exhaust these funds.  I say that by reason of the fact that most of the available moneys are available in the form of investments, and it is quite possible that if and when these investments are capitalised, they will have depreciated to quite a considerable extent.  I cannot say to what extent they will have depreciated, but I feel pretty certain that they will have so depreciated and that, instead of having a balance of money, we may find there are no moneys left beyond the sum we are now distributing.  If we were to add up or subtract and so on, it would be found&mdash;that is from the figures I have given&mdash;that there would be a balance of £80,000, or something like that, but with the depreciation to which I refer, there will possibly be no sum of money whatever available.</P>
    <P>The Capital Fund which was established by subsection (2) of Section 4 of the Central Fund Act, 1956, provides a convenient repository for moneys that are to be paid out as required.  If these moneys were paid into the Exchequer in the first instance and withdrawn, it would necessitate a Vote, so I think that is the expedient we are utilising here.  If we put it into the Exchequer, the money would have to be voted out; by putting it into the Capital Fund, the Minister himself can release the money for these purposes without the necessity of having to bring in a Vote.  The Vote is being taken now when this Bill is being dealt with.  From that point of view, I think it is the most desirable manner in which the money can be withdrawn.  The money will be given out on the order of the Chief Justice. The money will be released when the Chief Justice makes an order in that respect.  The Capital Fund can be <Col N="159" /> regarded as a kind of savings box into which the money is put and from which it can be taken out when required.</P>
    <P>The subsection which establishes the Capital Fund states that it is to be known as the Capital Fund and, apparently the draftsman thinks that it does not require to be further identified or defined.  For the purpose of the Bill, he appears to be satisfied with this form of draftsmanship.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy McGilligan's inquiry, so far as I know, there have been no claims since the establishment of the State in respect of which any deficiency in the funds had to be made good.  I think that meets the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No claim in which a deficiency arose.  I do not think there is any more I can add.  I think that the money will be put to an excellent purpose.  There is no doubt that the library in the King's Inns will benefit to a considerable extent, especially from the fact that the interest on the £25,000 will probably, to a considerable extent, provide the books which were withdrawn some time ago.  The £433 did not meet in any respect the requirements of the library.  We hope that the interest which will accrue from the investment of the £25,000, plus the £433, will make a sum of money available which will buy the books required for the library.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated to Deputies with the text of this Bill, it has for long been the intention to have legislation recognising and dealing with the special position of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is designed to that end.</P>
      <P>I have attempted to depart as little as possible from the existing state of affairs and the Bill, if enacted, will do no more substantially than clothe long-standing practice with statutory authority.</P>
      <P>The special position of the Chairman of the Houses in respect of the appointment of the Clerks, Clerks-Assistant, Superintendent and Captain of the Guard is dealt with in Part II of the Bill.  The selection of members of the joint staff will continue as heretofore to be effected through the medium of the Civil Service Commissioners. This system has given complete satisfaction and I am sure it I would be the wish of the House that we should not depart from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In only one particular have I departed from the terms of the report on which long-standing practice has been based, namely, in respect of the Librarian and Assistant Librarian.  It seems to me that these posts may reasonably be filled from the membership of the joint staff as recruited through the Civil Service Commissioners. In the unlikely event that no suitable person can be found within the existing staff, the Civil Service Commissioners would be approached and requested to take the necessary steps for the recruitment of a Librarian or Assistant Librarian, as the need <Col N="161" /> should arise.  There really seems to be no particular need for continuing to regard the holders of these posts as officers of the Houses, and they fittingly fall within the category of members of the joint staff in which they are placed by this text.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything I can usefully add at this stage as I think the Bill can be regarded more as a Committee Bill, and can be properly dealt with on that Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, when the two Civil Service Acts were going through the House in 1956, it was visualised then that there would be a separate Bill in respect of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and, of course, that is the reason we have this Bill before us this evening.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with perhaps three or four matters that require special consideration. It deals with, first, the appointment of the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Dáil and Seanad respectively, and second, with the appointment of the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Captain of the Guard of the Houses. Thirdly, is there adequate consideration given in the Bill to the fact that a great number of the staff must necessarily function both for the Seanad as well as for the Dáil? Finally, there are provisions made in Section 25 or Section 26 for certain superannuation arrangements.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of having a separate Bill for the Houses of the Oireachtas staff, and having a separate nomemclature for them in calling them civil servants of the State rather than civil servants of the Government, is intended to ensure and stress that it is right and proper that this House and the other House, the Seanad, should be the masters of their own business.  Therefore, I find it difficult to see why the Minister has taken the line he has taken in Sections 4 and 5 in relation to the Clerks and Assistant Clerks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must, of course, discuss this Bill without giving any consideration to the personnel who fill either of these posts as Officers of the Houses, or to the position of Ceann Comhairle <Col N="162" /> or Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann. As the Minister has stated, he has merely re-enacted in statutory form what was an existing practice but what was, in my submission, an unsatisfactory practice.  I have read Section 4 as carefully as I could and it seems to me that as drafted there&mdash; I understand there is another view but I disagree with it&mdash;the Taoiseach is merely to be a rubber stamp to appoint someone on the joint recommendation of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and the Minister for Finance. I think it is a very bad principle that we should provide in a statute a method by which two people are to make a recommendation and, when they make their recommendation, that the Taoiseach must make the appointment; and to provide no means in this section by which there can be any, so to speak, arbitration in the event of differences between the two people concerned.</P>
    <P>I think we all know that this led to an entirely unsatisfactory position in the past.  It led to a situation in which the then Chairman of the Dáil and the Minister for Finance were not able to see entirely eye to eye, and it caused a great deal of unnecessary difficulty because there was nobody in the position that then existed who could resolve that difficulty as between them.  Indeed, the Taoiseach under existing practice had no power to make any appointment unless a joint recommendation came to him.  My reading of this section is that that same existing practice is now being adhered to, and I think that is a bad practice.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from that, I think that the person who should decide who will be the Clerk or the Assistant Clerk of this House should be the Chairman of Dáil Eireann and not a member of the Government.  The position of the Clerk and Assistant Clerk to the Dáil is one of vital significance, not merely to the Government of the day but to the Opposition of the day, whatever Parties may be in opposition.  If the Clerk and Assistant Clerk are not freely available and easily consultable, then the whole work of an Opposition can easily be frustrated.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what we should do in this Bill is to make Parliament <Col N="163" /> supreme over itself, and in relation to these two officers in each House, that it should be the Chairman of that House who would have the right to make the appointment to the posts.  I agree, of course, at once that it would be only right and proper that before making any such appointment, the Chairman should consult with the Taoiseach, not in his capacity as Head of the Government but in his capacity as the Leader of the House.  I think that it would be desirable also that the Ceann Comhairle should consult with the leaders of the Parties who have been recognised and designated in the Act of 1937.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive a Chairman making an appointment when he has had that consultation, if the Taoiseach, on the one hand as Leader of the House, and the Leader of the Opposition Parties on the other hand, put it to him clearly that the appointment that he intended to make was not of a person who was <i>persona grata</i> with the ordinary body of Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind and bearing in mind that it seems to me to be essential that Parliament should be supreme over its own working, I think that the method I have suggested would be far more satisfactory than the method in Section 4 and would, in addition, get over the difficulty of a clash between the Chairman of the Dáil and the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister for Finance, as head of the Civil Service, wished in those circumstances also to be brought into consultation, as well as the Taoiseach, as the Leader of the House, I should not have the slightest objection, but I think that the principle must be established and should be kept that Parliament is supreme over its own workings and that it should be acknowledged and accepted that the appointment of the Clerks and the Assistant Clerk of each House are factors vital to the working of the respective Houses.</P>
    <P>The same thing, of course, applies to Section 5 in relation to the appointment of Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Seanad.  There, I admit, you have not got the same definition as you have in the Statute of 1937, but the fact is everybody <Col N="164" /> knows there is a Leader of the House in the Seanad and a Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad and it is quite simple to provide a method by which the Chairman of Seanad Éireann can consult with such persons as he deems to be for the time being the Leaders of the Government side of the House and of the Opposition side.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the appointment of staff to serve not merely the Dáil but also the Seanad.  I think there should be more provision for consultation between the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and the Chairman of Seanad Éireann in relation to this joint staff.  For example, that consultation could easily be introduced in the first line of Section 7&mdash;we can discuss this in detail on the Committee Stage&mdash;by providing that the Chairman of Dáil Éireann must consult with the Chairman of Seanad Éireann before appointing persons to be members of the joint staff.  Some people take the view that consultation does not affect matters very much, but even though the Chairman of Dáil Éireann is entitled, after consultation, completely to disregard the wishes of the Chairman of Seanad Éireann, nevertheless, I think we must assume and work on the assumption that the Chairmen of each House will be reasonable people and that if there is that consultation, there will be an opportunity there for ironing out many difficulties and averting an <i>impasse</i> that might otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be unreasonable and unreal to have the staff segregated as between the Dáil and Seanad.  The Seanad does not meet so often and there could be occasions on which reporters and members of the translation staff and so on could, and should be switched from one House to the other.  I am not clear about this and I should like the Minister to clarify it: suppose a member of the joint staff is sent up to the Seanad to work there for a day, a week or a month, or for any period, is that member of the joint staff during that period under the control of the officers of Seanad Éireann or, although working in the Seanad, does he still remain under the control of the Dáil?  It seems to me that it is essential that when he is allocated, so to speak, like <Col N="165" /> that, he should be under the control of the Seanad rather than under the control&mdash;remote control in such circumstances&mdash;of the Chairman of the Dáil or the Clerk of the Dáil as being the equivalent, perhaps, of the Secretary of a Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister in relation to Section 6.  I shall deal with it later in relation to the section.  I understand that both the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Captain of the Guard are due to retire more or less contemporaneously at a fairly early date.  I wonder is there any real need for both posts? If both officers are retiring more or less contemporaneously at an early date, I think the posts could be amalgamated.  What we want is one officer of that sort and perhaps a head usher.  It would be a more satisfactory method of working and would get over one of the difficulties that has always existed in that there has been no avenue of promotion for ushers themselves.  It should appeal to the Minister in that there would be some saving by such amalgamation and by the abolition of one of the offices.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sections 25 and 26 dealing with superannuation, may I say that, in Section 26 particularly, additional superannuation terms are given to two officers therein named. I understand from the Minister&mdash;I acknowledge his courtesy in giving me the information for which I had asked&mdash;that in the case of the Captain of the Guard, the sole effect of this section is to give him the service for pension purposes he already had in the Garda Siochana before his retirement from that force, except perhaps for some little rounding-up to even the figure and that, in fact, there is virtually no added period if his previous service is taken into account in the amounts that are included in the section.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the case of the Superintendent, the position is that additional pension concessions given to him are the equivalent of adding six years to his service.  I raise no objection to either of these additions and <Col N="166" /> so the Minister will not misunderstand me when I say there is a basis upon which I could raise such an objection.  I want to be quite categorical in saying that whatever terms are being given in this way to those two officers should also be given to anybody else in this House who is in the same position.  I understand there are other members of the joint staff in the building who will be retiring shortly on reaching the age limit and who will not, on their retirement, be qualified by reason of the shortness of their years of service, for their full pensions.  Part of that, I understand, arises in the case of some people because, although they have been here since 1922 working in the service of this House, their services since that time are not counted for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the vital necessity I have already stressed of keeping the Houses of Parliament supreme in their own right, I think that regardless of whatever steps may be taken in relation to other parts of the Civil Service, in respect of these officers of State there is a compelling case to be made that they are entitled to receive credit for pension purposes for all their service since the House was established.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many members of the staff are involved but I think there is an obligation on us when we are enacting Section 26 for two particular officers, to ensure, at the same time, that the legislation we are enacting covers anyone else who might be in the same position and who would not be able to receive the full pension to which he would normally be entitled for his years of service without special legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, of course, that there might be certain members of the Translation or Reporting staffs who might have come in at a very late point above the ordinary age for entering the Civil Service.  I can appreciate that there might be a case because, after all, the principle behind the addition of six years' service for the Superintendent is the principle that because he came into the service of <Col N="167" /> the House in late years, he did not qualify for the full number of pension years and that is why they are being added.</P>
    <P>I think these cases will have to be examined with great care.  The House should be satisfied.  I am quite certain the Minister will meet us on the point that if there are, and I understand there are, other people here who will have to retire at 65 without getting their full pension, they should be included in the arrangements which are made specially for two officers under Section 26.</P>

      <P>It is particularly important to draw attention to Section 3, which states that under this Bill members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are civil servants of the State.  Because of that, we, as members of this House, must take cognisance of our responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to a few sentences.  In Section 11, for instance, the departure is significant.  First of all, we come to subsection (2) which deals with members of the joint staff.  Further on, there is a difference when we are dealing with officers of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I, any more than the previous speaker, am not questioning any consideration that may be given to some members of the staff who are mentioned in this Bill but I do think that if we are considering the over-all position of civil servants of the State or members of the joint staff in relation to their work and conditions in the Dáil and Seanad, we must draw particular attention to the fact that there are other members of the staff who should, in our opinion, be given greater consideration than they are being given under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, if we are to give some concessions to some people who are entitled to them or deserve them, should I say, there are others lower down the scale.  As a member of another committee, I know the wage and salary paid.  It is known to us as members of the Public Accounts Committee.  It is known to members of this House through the Appropriation Accounts.  If we go through the <Col N="168" /> various accounts, we can see the salary paid to all members of the staff in the House.  They, and I personally, would say that it is not fair to exclude from the benefits being given to a few the very many who, unfortunately, will be denied many of the benefits that we could bestow upon them and which I believe they would be entitled to.  For example, there are some members of the staff who earn between £7 and £8 approximately.  Some of these came in at a late stage in life.  Owing to the fact that many of them had service in the Army and other branches of the national service for which they cannot get much advantage on retiring at 65 years of age, they will find themselves in receipt of a pension of about 25/- per week.</P>
    <P>It is true that they get a gratuity, but, again, that gratuity may amount to anything between £50, £70 or £80. I think it is not fair for us to start off in some cases by being as generous as we should be and, at the same time, being so niggardly in our treatment of other members of the staff.  Their hours of work vary very much here. They are very much at variance with the hours of employment of civil servants outside, whether in Departments in Dublin or down the country.  We know the hours of service that must be given in the Dáil and the Seanad.  The hours for the members of the staff are completely at variance with what they would be had the members been in other employment with the State.</P>
    <P>Because of that, we should draw particular attention to Section 11 and the discrimination which, in my opinion, is being exercised in favour of some as against others.  I would ask the Minister between now and the Committee Stage to give consideration to that matter.  Again, in Section 16 emphasis is put upon four new definitions. I suggest to the Minister that greater consideration be given to this matter, now that we have the opportunity. All members of this House, no matter to what Party we may belong, are aware of the courtesy and the help given us by all members of the staff, including the members lower down in the scale who are attendants of all descriptions in this House.  They <Col N="169" /> help in every way and that in itself is justification for giving them, even at this late stage, as fair treatment as we are giving to some others.</P>
    <P>Under Section 26, it is quite obvious that gratuities can be given on a different scale from that in which they have been given in the past.  I agree with the Minister in his approach to it in relation to some but I would suggest to him that it is not yet too late to realise that fair play for the few should also mean fair play for the many who so far under this Bill are, unfortunately, not getting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow more or less on the lines adumbrated by both Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Desmond.  I am not going to concern myself with the provisions of this Bill that relate to methods of appointment or classification of officers of the House.  I rather like Deputy Desmond's phrase that where there is to be fair play for the few, there must also be or should be fair play for the many.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am extremely interested in the uniform application of what we sometimes euphemistically call fair play.  I think that uniform application, so necessary and so desirable, can at times be absolutely marred by what I would call the principle of selectivity.  Selectivity is always suspect and the provisions of this Bill that engage in a process of selection are, in my opinion, more than suspect.  I want to know why it is that recommendations which date as far back as 1924 are now being brought into play, when, if my information is correct, there have been occasions in the past when they have not been so brought into play.  People entering into any class of employment enter at that time subject to conditions of service well known to them at the time of entry. Is it reasonable then that people who enter into other services or even the service of this House under certain conditions should be made stick to those conditions while, at an opportune time, for the select, the conditions of service are altered?</P>
      <P>I notice that in the Explanatory Memorandum issued with the Bill Section 26 is explained as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> This section deals specifically with the case of two officers of the Houses.  In view of the relatively advanced ages at which they were appointed special ad hominem provisions for enhanced pensions are made in this section.</P>
    <P>I know that if there was uniform application of such <i>ad hominem</i> arguments, it would probably cause quite a disturbance in the Department of Finance and quite an increase in the amount to be paid but I would rather pay nothing to a few by alteration of conditions of service than leave, not a large number, but an adequately large number, disgruntled and dissatisfied and reasonably so.  If conditions of service at the time of entry are to apply to them, they should with equal force apply to all others.</P>
    <P>I have spent my few short years of Parliamentary life trying from time to time to get established three persons who devoted the whole of their lives in pioneering, beginning in the Congested Districts Board, in knitting industries in the West and North West coast.  In the case of one, I believe it was done this year.  The other is living on British relief in a British city and the third is struggling on from year to year at the mercy of a particular Department and the Department of Finance.  Why cannot the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> be applied to those people who started in their very early lives under adverse conditions and whose work was of a pioneering nature?  There was no selectivity there because, I suppose, people who are hidden away and to whom no great obligation is due from those in a position to confer benefits can reasonably well be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I think this is a bad principle.  I think it is one that will leave a very sour taste in the mouths of many in the Civil Service both inside this House and outside it.  While it is not possible in a Bill of this kind, framed as it is to deal with members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I think the Minister should well busy himself with immediate legislation to deal with those other cases outside the House that require the same kind of <i>ad hominem</i> attention.  There are, as <Col N="171" /> Deputy Sweetman says, people in this House who have been much longer on the staff here, with longer service, continuously and admittedly unestablished but, for some reason or other, it has not been found possible to bring them within the ambit of the select.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister, even on this Stage and before Committee Stage, will find it possible to have some provision incorporated in this Bill that will, in the words of Deputy Desmond, apply the fair play, now restricted to the few, to the many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised by Deputy Sweetman was with regard to the appointment of officers of both Houses.  Deputy Sweetman thinks that the present system of appointment is not a good one.  I must say that I approached this problem with the same idea.  I gave it a great deal of thought.  Several suggestions were made to me as to how the appointments could be made and none of them appeared to me to be better than the present one although I agree with the Deputy that it is not a satisfactory system.  The analogy that I was going on more or less in this Bill in regard to appointments was that a Minister can make appointments in his own Department.  What I sought to do was to put the Ceann Comhairle in the same position as a Minister.  In other words, if the Ceann Comhairle wants, let us say, clerical officers, he applies to the Civil Service Commissioners. They give him a list and he appoints the number he requires.  That is exactly what a Minister does in his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint staff, however, is appointed in a different way.  I think it is going a bit too far with the independence idea, if you like to put it that way, to say that the Ceann Comhairle should appoint a Clerk to the Dáil.  A Minister is not trusted, if you like, to appoint a Secretary to his own Department, and I think rightly so.  It is the Government that makes the appointment.  My own experience would tell me that a Minister on occasion has a better opinion of a certain officer in his Department <Col N="172" /> than is justified and when his colleagues point out to him that he would not be a good appointee the Minister is inclined to see reason and to say, &ldquo;All right.  We will appoint somebody else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, I should like everybody to forget about our present Ceann Comhairle and to recognise the fact that we are not talking about the present Ceann Comhairle.  There will be other Cinn Comhairlí in time to come.  A Ceann Comhairle may have his favourite amongst the staff.  He may not be the best man.  It would be a dangerous thing to leave it entirely in his hands.  I should like therefore, to see some other suggestion made that would help to give us the best possible man as Clerk of the Dáil.  The same applies to the Assistant Clerk and to the two officers of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has the appointment at present.  Deputy Sweetman may be right in saying he is only a rubber stamp because he appoints on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance.  Unfortunately, there is no solution for the problem if these two men cannot agree. I suppose it would be a question of which between the two is able to stick it out the longest.  One must agree with the other in the end.  That recommendation goes to the Taoiseach and he must appoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly very satisfactory&mdash;that there should be a war of endurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is not satisfactory. It is because I could not get any better that I put down the present solution.  I should like Deputies to keep in mind in this case that the appointment is made by the Taoiseach, not as head of the Government but as Leader of the House.  He is the leader of the majority of members of the House and in the capacity he makes this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is every reason for bringing the Taoiseach into it, and there is certainly reason for bringing the Ceann Comhairle into it to some extent.  But whether it should be on his recommendation or after consultation with him, <Col N="173" /> I do not know.  We shall have to leave it that way and see if some Deputy can give us a better solution on the Committee Stage.  The same will apply to the appointment of the officers of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Add the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall discuss that on the Committee Stage.  It is one of the difficult problems I was up against in the drafting of the Bill.  In the case of the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard the appointment is made by the Taoiseach after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle &mdash;that is what is laid down in the Bill &mdash;and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The reason the Taoiseach has full responsibility there is because these two officers have been regarded as security officers.  If ever we are up against trouble in the country, where there is a possibility or danger that the House might be attacked by some section or other, we have to rely on these two men as the principal officers looking after the security of the House and seeing that nobody is admitted unless for some very good reason and so on.  As security of that kind would be a Government matter, the appointment is made by the Taoiseach after consultation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman made a suggestion, which I must say did not occur to me, that these two officers were to retire in or around the same time and he asked whether there was a necessity for two.  I shall certainly have that case examined because a Minister for Finance is always very glad to make economies and, if an economy can be made on the lines suggested by the Deputy, we can also discuss that on another stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Desmond that this divided the staff into members of the joint staff and members of the staff&mdash;that is the officers&mdash;the division was really made for the purposes of appointment, of dismissal or of penalties of any kind. Apart from that, when appointed they come under the rules of the Civil Service with regard to discipline and so on.  That discipline is enforced by <Col N="174" /> the Ceann Comhairle.  They also come under the Superannuation Acts that apply to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Sweetman, which certainly gave me a great deal of thought, too, was this question of the control of staff when working for the Dáil and when working for the Seanad.  It appeared to be very difficult to have two people in control.  The easiest way out was to put one man in control&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;and to assume that the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach will work well together.  As the Bill stands, the Ceann Comhairle can appoint the Clerk of the Seanad as his deputy for discipline and everything else to control members of the staff when working for the Seanad. That would be the sensible thing to do. We can insert provisions&mdash;I had thought of doing so but on consideration did not, but if the Dáil wishes we can put them in&mdash;that when members of the joint staff are working for the Seanad, the Cathaoirleach will be the controlling officer and that he will delegate to the Clerk of the Seanad his powers in that regard as, I presume, the Ceann Comhairle will delegate to the Clerk of the Dáil his powers as regards discipline.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to give the analogy of a Minister.  Under the law, a Minister controls the members of the staff in his own Department but in fact he delegates these powers to the Secretary of the Department and the Secretary of the Department gives reprimands when necessary to members of the staff and reports them for defalcations and such matters.  It is not the practice that the Minister does these things himself&mdash;although he can if he so wishes&mdash;and the power is delegated to the Secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also talked about consultation.  I think there should be consultation, but again it is a difficult thing to put into an Act, at least to put it in with effect.  The particular case mentioned by Deputy Sweetman is one where consultation is hardly necessary. Where the Ceann Comhairle is appointing members of the joint staff, the list is handed to him by the Civil Service Commissioners and he makes <Col N="175" /> the appointment.  It is hardly necessary that he should consult with the Cathaoirleach in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>The next point refers to the special provisions made for the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard.  Some Deputy read out what was in the explanatory memorandum on this point.  Although it is not mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, what was in my mind more than anything else was that, up to this, it was ex-members of the I.R.A. who had filled these positions.  It is not likely&mdash;in fact, it is hardly possible now&mdash;that they will be filled again by members of the old I.R.A.  It is likely that in the future these positions will be filled by men taken from the regular Army or perhaps ex-police officers, and in all probability they will be people who have got a fairly adequate pension from the service they are leaving.  For that reason, they will be adequately looked after in the future.</P>
    <P>Some speakers said there were other members of the staff who deserve to have their cases specially considered just as much as these two particular officers.  I must say I am not aware of such, but I certainly would be quite prepared to give sympathetic consideration to cases brought to my notice.  When a Minister is preparing a Bill of this kind he usually gets particulars from people who might be affected in that way.  For some reason, no cases have come to my notice; but there may be cases and, if there are, we can consider them.</P>
    <P>The speeches on this Bill were very, very short.  I spent a great deal of time considering the various aspects of the Bill and, despite the brevity of the speeches, they did bring out clearly the three difficult points in this legislation: (1) the appointment of the Clerk and Clerk-Assistant; (2) the control of the members of the joint staff when working in the Dáil and in the Seanad; and (3) the particular positions of the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the finances necessary for the urgent and important work of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, which was incorporated on the 28th January, 1959. The House will recollect from previous debates that the work entrusted to this Company is regarded as vital in relation to the future of Shannon Airport and its maintenance as a major centre of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid limiting the activities of the Company pending the enactment of the present Bill, the House, in March, 1959, approved, as an interim measure, an Order adding the name of the Company to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, <Col N="177" /> 1954, to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing by the Company up to a maximum of £200,000.  During the debate on the motion approving the draft Order it was indicated that legislation to regularise the financing of the Company would be introduced.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that funds will be made available to the Company in two ways:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) Money required for capital purposes, such as the construction of factory premises, will be provided by means of subscriptions for share capital by the Minister for Finance under Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>(ii) Money required for other purposes, including administration and grants to industrial projects at the Airport, will be provided by way of non-repayable Grants-in-Aid voted annually.  It would not be possible to forecast the exact amount of money required for grants in any one year as projects develop too quickly to permit long-term forecasting.  It is therefore proposed to fix an aggregate amount of £500,000 to be allocated by way of grants as required.  This is provided for in Section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government decision in November, 1957, to set up a body for the particular purpose of developing employment-producing activity at Shannon was a positive indication of the determination of the Government to take all possible steps to maintain Shannon as a major international Airport and as an important centre of employment.  The directive given by the Government was to take all practicable steps to counteract the effects on the level of employment and activity at the Airport of the tendency to overflying by jet aircraft. The Company was requested, in particular, to direct its efforts towards securing an increase in terminating passenger traffic and towards developing the use of the airport as a freight centre for terminal and transhipped air cargo.</P>
    <P>In its efforts to increase the amount of terminating passenger traffic, the Company has undertaken an extensive <Col N="178" /> publicity campaign in the United States and elsewhere to popularise the excellent facilities available at Shannon.  In this campaign, use is made of press, radio, and television coverage particularly in the United States.  In addition, there is an energetic publicity campaign to encourage travellers between Europe and America to break their journey for a holiday in this country even if only of a short duration.  Emphasis is laid on the attractions of the South and West as holiday centres.  In these activities the Company has maintained close liaison with Bord Fáilte Éireann and Aerlinte Éireann.  It is intended that in the future the publicity campaigns of these bodies will be integrated as closely as possible to secure the best results.  The Aer Lingus continental services and the Aerlinte transatlantic service will, it is hoped, provide an eastbound and westbound link which may, if fully exploited, induce an increased number of tourists and holiday makers from continental countries and from the Americas to spend some time in this country.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in the development campaign it became clear that the establishment of industries in the Free Airport area would be essential to the future of the Airport.  These would not alone provide a positive safeguard against diminution in activity and employment but would also promote the use of the Airport as a freight centre for the transport and handling of raw materials and finished products.  The Company therefore undertook a campaign to attract business interests in this country and abroad to the attractive facilities available for industrial activity at Shannon Airport.  The Oireachtas had given its approval to this campaign by agreeing, in the latter months of 1958, to two measures designed to facilitate the entry to and control of business at the airport and to exempt from taxation for a period of 25 years the profits of concerns established there.  The present Bill to provide the finances necessary for the Company in its development work is a confirmation of the intention of the Oireachtas to assist in a material way in the encouragement and promotion of industrial <Col N="179" /> activity and in the development of traffic at the Airport.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objects of the Bill is to provide share capital for the construction of factory premises at the Airport.  The amount proposed is £1,500,000.  The Company has been proceeding with the work of building factories in advance of demand and at the same time has placed itself fully at the disposal of industrialists interested in establishing at the airport.  The setting up of a new industry is not a simple matter and the preliminary negotiations are normally detailed and protracted.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the results are heartening. Two undertakings have already been established and provide employment for 23 persons.  Negotiations are in an advanced stage in respect of four other projects.  Additional proposals are under consideration and there are good grounds for expecting that these will result in the establishment of further industries at the Airport.  The projects which are in an advanced stage of development are expected to afford employment to about 300 persons.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that I cannot at present give details of the exact nature of the undertakings.  I can reveal, however, that factory premises are expected to be ready in early Spring 1960 for an undertaking which will afford initial employment to 40 persons and will thereafter increase substantially.  In addition another undertaking has reached the stage of incorporation of a company and it is hoped that production will commence in the next month or six weeks. Factory premises for this firm are in course of erection.</P>
    <P>The importance attached to the development of industries at the Airport cannot be overstated and the Shannon Company is prepared to consider every proposal fully and sympathetically.  The services of the Industrial Development Authority are availed of to the fullest practical extent in the examination of proposals to establish industries at the airport and that body advises me on the desirability of granting a licence in each case.  This arrangement precludes <Col N="180" /> overlapping between activities of the Shannon Company and those of the other industrial promotion bodies and in addition enables each proposal for Shannon to be reviewed in relation to the industrial situation in the country generally.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully satisfied about the need for this legislation and they are hopeful that the efforts of the company will be successful.  In previous proceedings in this House Deputies have generally been appreciative of the importance of Shannon and of the urgency of taking the necessary steps to consolidate its position.  I, therefore, recommend the measure to the House and confidently ask for the support of all sides in the efforts being made in relation to the Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this proposed legislation confirms certain undertakings which were given earlier to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and, in so far as any legislative measures are necessary to facilitate the development of undertakings which will provide employment at Shannon, the House will give the proposals general approval.</P>
      <P>There are several other matters which I should like to mention at this stage of the Bill, because I think it is well to consider, in conjunction with the development which has already been planned, where a particular policy is leading or may lead.  During the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I expressed the view that the realistic approach to the problems which would arise in the event of Shannon being overflown was to concentrate on development opportunities for employment, either at Limerick or Ennis.  In expressing that view I referred to the general trend of the advice contained in <i>Economic Development</i>, and the opinions expressed in that publication, where comment was made, not specifically on the particular problems of Shannon, but on the general problems created by the efforts to provide employment in the under-developed areas.</P>

    <P>The general trend of the views expressed was that the efforts made so far had not been as successful as was expected, and that, in fact, the general <Col N="181" /> tendency was for the industrial promoters, or <i>entrepreneurs</i>, or anyone concerned with establishing industries, to seek locations where other facilities were already available; that, in general, people seek opportunities for establishing new industries where they have an adequate pool of labour, port and other facilities&mdash;admittedly, port facilities are available here&mdash;that the normal facilities available in reasonably sized towns and cities attracted industrial developers; and that any attempt to provide artificial attractions even to the extent of financial encouragement failed to achieve the success which the natural facilities and the availability of other normal services required by those likely to develop industries achieved.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I shall be glad to hear from the Minister whether the Government have considered the possibility of encouraging industrial development in a positive way at Limerick or Ennis&mdash;or, if necessary, at some of the smaller places such as Newmarket-on-Fergus&mdash;with the specific object of absorbing those persons who may lose their employment as a result of technical developments in aviation.  It is a well-known fact that the persons already employed in Shannon come from either Limerick or Ennis or, for that matter, from further afield, but at the moment they reside in some of the adjacent cities or towns.</P>
    <P>Consequently, there are no special advantages attaching to Shannon which did not already exist and, in fact, it appears that efforts should be concentrated on providing employment where the other facilities already exist for those persons who may lose their employment as a result of the general trend in aviation in recent times.  In that connection, I should like the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, to say what will be the effect of the recent announcement by certain air companies that it is proposed to overfly Shannon and, if possible at this stage, to indicate the probable consequences on employment and revenue from landings at the airport.</P>
    <P>This method of establishing a State company is, to some extent, unusual. <Col N="182" /> Normally, most of those companies are established by a particular piece of legislation which outlines its object and lays down certain functions and responsibilities.  I should be glad, therefore, to know from the Minister why this particular method was adopted, or is it merely because the company had already been set up and that this is the most convenient method of acquiring for the Minister for Finance the share capital of the company? Can he indicate what amount of capital has already been invested in this company, and the capital of the undertakings which have been established, to which he has referred?</P>
    <P>As I understand it, two undertakings have been established giving employment to 23 persons.  There is one further undertaking which may commence next Spring with the prospect of employment for a further 40 and I understand the proposals under consideration would, if established, give employment to a further 300 persons. In that connection, is employment in these undertakings confined exclusively to persons who lose their employment at Shannon Airport as a result of the diminution in work which has occurred or may occur because of the decision to over-fly Shannon?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are a number of aspects of this matter which should be kept under careful review, and if possible, an industry should be developed there because of any special features which Shannon or the Airport has.  Unless that is so, then the further considerations which I have mentioned which received very considerable attention in <i>Economic Development</i> should be considered.  Of itself, Shannon, except that it has the facilities for air transport readily available, has no other advantage which Limerick or Ennis has not got in a far greater degree.  With the exception of certain items of cargo which lend themselves to air transport, there are no other advantages there which are not already available in either of these centres.  For that reason, I believe attention should be paid to that aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's remarks that the total State investment <Col N="183" /> in this undertaking amounts to £1,500,000.  In addition, there is power to provide grants not exceeding £500,000.  The Minister also said it was proposed to build factories and have these available before actual specific undertakings had been established.  In that connection, it is well to remember that where grants were provided elsewhere and, in fact, where factories were established, in a number of cases these buildings were left derelict because of the general trend in modern industrial development for individual industrial concerns to plan the building in accordance with their own wants and requirements.  The mere provision of a building is not always the essential pre-requisite for the establishment of a particular industry.</P>
    <P>Certainly, in the Six Counties, when facilities were provided there, quite a number of the buildings were left derelict.  This matter was considered when the Industrial Grants Act legislation was being framed.  My recollection is that the point was discussed here during the course of the debates. Experience elsewhere has shown that the initiative which it was thought would be gained by the provision of a building does not always work out in practice and that in fact most individual industrial operators prefer to have the opportunity themselves of erecting a building in accordance with the particular requirements of the industry concerned.</P>

      <P>Any development that will mitigate the falling-off of transit traffic at Shannon Airport is to be welcomed. I am sure every Deputy will wish the Shannon Airport Development Company every success in its efforts.  We probably would not be considering this Bill this evening were it not that certain factors outside the control of the Minister and of this country have operated substantially to reduce transit traffic through Shannon Airport.  Modern plane development, particularly the expansion of development of the jet plane, has come as a very severe threat to Shannon Airport. Deputies who do not live in the vicinity of Shannon Airport may not realise what that means to Limerick and Clare, particularly.  Almost 2,000 <Col N="184" /> persons are employed at Shannon Airport, the bulk of whom reside in the City of Limerick and the remainder near Ennis.  In the main, these people are paid a high rate of wage, and naturally they spend their earnings in the City of Limerick or in the town of Ennis.</P>
      <P>It has been said, not without reason, that if anything drastic were to happen at Shannon Airport it would result in Limerick becoming virtually a ghost town.  For that reason, as a Deputy living very close to Shannon Airport, I welcome any effort that will help to mitigate these likely developments and that will, at the same time, give a reasonable return to capital invested. I am sure the Minister will agree that that should be a <i>sine qua non</i> of any State investment at present.  It would be a very serious matter if this House were to vote a substantial sum of money for investment at Shannon Airport and if the greatest discretion and business acumen were not exercised in selecting the type of industry to be developed there.</P>
      <P>We all know of instances such as were referred to by Deputy Cosgrave where considerable State funds&mdash;which means, in effect, the taxpayers' money &mdash;went into an enterprise which flourished for a year or so and then the promoters vanished and the countryside was left with an empty building as an indication of a very bad investment of State moneys.  It should not be forgotten that part of the reason why the traffic through Shannon Airport and into Shannon Airport is declining is because of the contrary development which necessitates transatlantic planes touching down at Shannon for a few minutes and then travelling on to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce earlier this year, it seems to me that such an arrangement could not possibly continue when the new jets are brought into operation on the transatlantic flights and, indeed, when the jet planes of the other companies come into regular service, as they are doing at present.  If Shannon could be a link with other airports in Britain and the Continent it could encourage a greater <Col N="185" /> amount of traffic to Shannon Airport. If Shannon could offer a direct link with Aerlinte to the various services covered by the Aer Lingus system it would be to the benefit of Shannon Airport.  Sooner or later, the persons concerned will have to determine whether they will have a sort of half-developed airport as a transatlantic airport or whether they will have Shannon as their essential transatlantic base, linked with the cities on the Continent and London, Glasgow and other cities in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>If that system could be brought into operation I think it would straightaway increase the amount of transatlantic traffic through Shannon Airport and the amount of tourists getting off at Shannon Airport.  Deputy Cosgrave is quite right.  I have consistently advocated here that the advantages which are applicable to the customs-free zone at Shannon Airport should be extended to a wider area to include both Limerick city and the town of Ennis.  The logical place for people to work is near where they live.  The majority of the workers at Shannon Airport go down in buses or cars from Limerick city or from Ennis.  It seems far more logical to try to develop industries near to either of these larger centres of population where the people concerned have schools, churches and facilities for amusement quite close to where they are living.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce that the benefits applicable to the Customs Free zone at Shannon Airport might be extended to industries, established outside the zone, that use Shannon Airport for exporting their goods.  If you want to develop Shannon Airport, it does not much matter where your factory is&mdash; whether it is in the free zone or 50 miles away&mdash;so long as it uses Shannon Airport to export its goods and employs commercial freight planes so to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the course of his introductory speech that a campaign was being carried on in the United States and elsewhere to promote particularly the South and West <Col N="186" /> of Ireland as tourist centres.  I should like to add my voice to support that programme.  If more could be done in conjunction with Bord Fáilte to develop these areas as tourist centres and to encourage tourists to come by plane to Shannon to visit them, that development would be of benefit to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>As the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach, indicated when speaking on the Vote for his Department some months ago, the outlook for Shannon is very serious and the unfortunate aspect of the matter is that it is due to developments over which we in this country have no control.  However, there are certain things we can and should do and one is to keep in mind that Shannon Airport was built as an airport, not as an industrial zone. Every possible encouragement should be given to air companies to use Shannon airport as a transit stop by reducing the charges for touching down there or, as I suggested earlier on in my speech, by linking Shannon Airport with cities on the Continent and in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I hope this injection of capital into the area contiguous to Shannon Airport will have the desired effect, and that not alone will it help the present numbers employed there but that it will result in an expansion of employment in the airport.  I want to support the point made by Deputy Cosgrave that the ideal solution would be not to have just a customs free zone but to have a Shannon free zone in an area within 20 to 25 miles of Shannon Airport so that industries could be started near places of population like Limerick and Ennis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the period of compulsory education should be extended to the age of 15 years, and that the child, having passed through Standard VI, should be given these three alternatives: (1) to enter a secondary school, (2) to undertake a whole-time course in a vocational school, (3) to remain on in a national school.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Dr. Hillery on his promotion to the very high office of Minister for Education and of wishing him every success in that office.  In putting down this motion we are anxious to establish a case for extending the principle of equal opportunity in regard to the most important facet of the life of an individual, his education.</P>
      <P>We have seen the principle of free education, admittedly after a considerable struggle extended in relation to everyone in the State up to the age of 14 years.  It seems to me that the time has now come when we should consider the whole question of the continuation of the education of the child after the age of 14 years.  Once the principle of free education has been accepted up to 14 and once we can show, as I think we can, that education up to 14 years is relatively useless to a person trying to find his way in life or to make a success for himself in life, then I do not see why this same principle cannot be extended further to give a child an opportunity suitable to his particular demands, whether it is in relation to a craft, a skill, the intellect or the mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly perverse to suggest that a man who is unable to pay for primary education for his child, when the family is small, should be able to pay for education at a later time when the child would require vocational education, secondary education or education in a university, the stage when the family has grown bigger, when his responsibilities are much greater than they were and when the <Col N="189" /> difficulties and expenses of feeding, clothing and housing children have increased.  To be logical on this question we must accept that if the parent requires help during the period up to the time that the child reaches 14 years of age, he needs considerable help later on for the fullest education of the child.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should spend long discussing the adequacy of primary school education as fitting a child to play his part or make his way in life. It is accepted by everybody that primary school education is the basic education in the three Rs which fits a child to move on to some subsequent academic development of his physical attributes or of his intellect.  The point is made in the Commission on Primary Education, which was set up in 1954, that the function of the primary school is to provide an educational foundation.  Clearly, one does not provide a foundation without putting something on that foundation.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph, it says that at the end of the primary school period, the child should be able to read intelligently simple prose and have acquired some acquaintance with literature. He should also be capable of writing legibly simple descriptions or a letter.  Further, the primary school cannot be expected to provide the full minimum education which is regarded as necessary today.  Therefore, I do not think we need to discuss that question, that none of us accepts or should accept that primary school education is sufficient for any child.</P>
    <P>Consequently, one has to examine the alternatives open to the child at the end of its primary school phase of education.  As far back as 1927, a Commission on Technical Education made certain recommendations as a result of which, I understand, the Vocational Education Act was passed. In Part V of that Act, the beginnings of the continuation of the primary school system were established, the system wherein it was recommended that something in the region of 180 hours in the year should be compulsory in certain areas.  Up to date, the provision in that Act has been operated in three areas: Limerick, Cork County Borough and Waterford. <Col N="190" /> Obviously it was a step in the right direction, but it is obviously grossly inadequate as fulfilling what we think should be provided for a child in a modern society.</P>
    <P>Later on, in 1935, an interdepartmental committee came to certain conclusions&mdash;which I think are as valid today as they were then&mdash; that a large proportion of the employment obtained by juveniles in nonagricultural occupations is blind-alley employment.  They went on to say that it is difficult to see what better employment could be obtained by such juveniles by keeping them on at school for another year or so.  I am inclined to agree with that.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at the outset that we believe that it is really desirable for a child to stay on at school until the age of 15.  We believe the child should be given the opportunity as soon as he passes the Primary Certificate to remain on in a national school, go to a vocational school or to keep on at some type of secondary school in order that he can move on, if possible, to the university at a later date.</P>
    <P>The other conclusion which they arrived at was that the parents of juveniles who were in blind-alley employment were generally in very poor circumstances and would be unable to keep the children at school any longer.  I am concerned with the view that the parents are in poor circumstances. That is as common today as it was then.  There are other conclusions&mdash;that children who do not get education after 14 do not obtain employment, and that there is a great danger in their idleness which tends to make young people eventually unfit for employment.  That is the environment which creates what are sneeringly called &ldquo;the unemployable&rdquo;.  I think those conclusions are still valid and that the children who enter blind-alley occupations will never have any opportunity to marry and to rear families.  Mostly, they are children whose parents are in poor circumstances and they usually end up as what is described as the &ldquo;teddy boy&rdquo; or the juvenile delinquent.  These are products of their environment, the <Col N="191" /> environment which we create for them by denying them access to the higher education which some of us were very lucky to get.</P>
    <P>Right from 1927, and 1935 and up to most recent times, it was agreed and is agreed that there should be better educational opportunities.  There has been a fair amount of newspaper controversy in this regard in recent years. It is a very healthy and a very desirable controversy and shows that the people are becoming interested in the real issue of education.  There is a general feeling that our educational services have made some progress, but that, unfortunately, taken in the context of the demands of modern industrial society, they are still seriously inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Primary Education make the point that parents in a position to do so are eager to provide for their children's further education. The Commission on Youth Unemployment, in paragraphs 34 and 35, recommend that the school-leaving age should be raised ultimately to 16 and as a first stage, the school-leaving age should be raised to 15.  They make the proviso that this should be done area by area, according as local conditions provide.  I think it is logical to suggest that.  Our objection is that this provision was made first in 1927, that, as local facilities become available, so-and-so should be done, but local facilities have not become available to anything like the extent to which they are required.  That is why I think there is a demand for a very much more energetic and more revolutionary outlook in the Department of Education which I hope the Minister will supply.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Youth Unemployment also said that the majority of the statements of evidence received by the Commission suggested the raising of the statutory school-leaving age.  I think everybody agrees that that is a step to be desired, an inadequate step, but an advance on what is there already.  I think that is the least we could ask the Minister to do, or agree to, in order to try to save the children from the serious situation of trying <Col N="192" /> to find their way through life with the basic education of the primary schools.</P>
    <P>In discussing this matter, the question of the size of the problem arises and I have found it very difficult to get any accurate figures on this, even though I have asked the Minister a lot of questions.  Perhaps he can enlighten us as to the actual size of the problem. The only figures I have were used on occasion but they were contradicted by the previous Minister for Education, Deputy J. Lynch.  I do not know on what grounds he objected to them.</P>
    <P>As recently as 1951, these figures showed that in the census of population that year, the proportion in the age group, 15 to 16, enrolled in courses of whole-time education for 1951-52 was 34.6 for boys and 38.5 for girls. The overall total was 36.5 per cent. and that left something like two-thirds of the children who, at that time, were not enrolled in whole-time educational courses.  That, of course, is a very high proportion and I should like to know to what extent it has decreased, if it has decreased, since that time. It is lamentable to think that such a relatively short time ago nearly two-thirds of the children of this country were turned out to emigrate, or live at home, in that sadly neglected and dreadful state of semi-illiteracy, or whole-illiteracy, which was the state all of us were in when we finished our primary education.  I sincerely hope the position is better now, but I do not think it is anything like as satisfactory as most people would like to see it, and I think that the problem obviously arises on this question of the ability to pay.</P>
    <P>One of the extraordinary things is that one can compare the Department of Health&mdash;defective as it is, and critical as I am of that Department and of its appalling backward attitudes in some respects&mdash;and find it has at least got a dispensary service, a service whereby the people who by their own means&mdash;whatever the wording of the law or the section of the Act is&mdash;cannot provide the medical services they need, are provided with them, whilst there is no such service in relation to secondary school education or university education and also, I think I <Col N="193" /> should show, in relation to vocational education.</P>
    <P>I believe it should be possible for persons in that group to have access to these higher forms of education in some sort of free educational service.  The children of poor families and large families in the middle-income group&mdash;indeed, there are many of these white collar workers with large families who cannot afford further education for their children, &mdash;should have that chance.  It is not just a problem of poor families alone. There are many people who have five, six or seven children, as they are exhorted to have in our society, and as a penalty for that, they are denied the opportunity of giving their children that start in life which a secondary school, and certainly a university education, gives anyone.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I believe the problem resolves itself into a question of scholarships.  I do not want to fill the universities with people who should not be there.  I do not want to turn everybody into professional people, architects, lawyers, doctors, and so on.  I know the agricultural background of our society and I know that the bias must be in an agricultural way towards agricultural technology of one kind or another, but certainly the opportunity should be made available to every child, irrespective of its origin, to get such education.  To me, that is implicit in the undertaking of the democratic proclamation of the Republic&mdash;to cherish all children of the nation&mdash;and if I might remind the Minister, it is implicit also in the democratic programme which enshrines the fundamental principles of policy upon which his own Party is based.</P>
    <P>That opportunity, according to the figures I have, is denied to a very high percentage of children at the moment, and it is denied because of lack of means, not lack of intelligence, lack of ability, or lack of brains.  There are plenty of gifted, talented, intelligent children who are denied the opportunity to cultivate their talents and I think that is a scandalous thing.  The difficulty in relation to scholarships is, I think, illustrated in <Col N="194" /> a few figures I got today concerning the scholarships available and the number of children who compete for them.  The number of children who sit for scholarships is an illustration of the anxiety of their parents that they be better educated and it is also an illustration of the wonderful measure of self-sacrifice many parents are willing to make to provide education for their children.</P>
    <P>In 1958-59, there were 1,382 entrants for scholarships to the universities and there were a meagre 147 scholarships available.  In 1959-60, there were 1,480 entrants and 146 scholarships.  In relation to figures for secondary schools, in 1958, 3,002 children sat for secondary scholarships, of which 690 were available, and in 1959, 3,126 sat for 636 scholarships. The number of entrants has grown from 2,400 in 1951 to 3,100 in 1959, an illustration of the great interest there is in, and the great demand that exists for, secondary school education amongst what essentially must be called the underprivileged, the people who cannot afford to pay and who feel they might be able to get their children through with a scholarship, even though a sacrifice is involved.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there is another answer to a question in relation to the teacher-training scheme operated by the Department of Education.  I should have thought that we are very short of teachers.  In fact, I am certain that we are, particularly if we want to reduce the size of classes to 30, which is a recommendation of the Commission on Education.  In order to be eligible for this scheme, children have to pass the Leaving Certificate examination with honours in Irish and a pass in four subjects, English, Mathematics, History and Geography, and the number of children who met those qualifications was 1,658, while the number of places available in training was only 329.</P>
    <P>There are a large number who are perfectly eligible to become teachers but they cannot afford the training themselves.  They try to get through on a scholarship but only 329 scholarships are available for the 1,600 odd applying.  There is a great demand <Col N="195" /> for teachers and one would think it would be possible to increase the number of places available for children who are intellectually eligible for training.  It will be said that there are scholarships available, but in that regard, from what I have seen of them, there were 36 scholarships for boys valued at £40 each, 36 at £20 each; 20 at £30 and 20 at £15 for girls, as a result of the intermediate examination. Those are miserably endowed scholarships, taking into consideration this further fact that there is a means test in relation to local authority scholarships anyway and that the person who is low enough in the scale for his child to get one has to pay in addition for the child's clothing, its food, housing, its maintenance, its books and equipment.  In addition he is at the loss of the income that the child could earn if it went out to work between the age of 14 and 17, 18 or 19 or whatever age it might qualify in the university or the technical course.</P>
    <P>When you talk about scholarships and the number available you must remember there is this very considerable sacrifice.  Even if the child does win a few pounds in a State or local authority scholarship the father is still at a very considerable disadvantage in trying to educate the child in these circumstances.  There can be no comparison between the white collar worker or the poor person trying to educate four or, perhaps, eight children and the wealthy person who is not concerned about fees and is able to send children to the Clongowes or Belvedere type of schools or wherever there are expensive private schools.</P>
    <P>I think that is one of the reasons why so many children are denied educational opportunities.  Clearly the average person with £7 or £9 a week, or the road worker or the unemployed man cannot afford to give his children a proper education and in denying them a more ready access to higher education you are perpetuating this system whereby the labourers continue to be labourers and the doctors can make their sons doctors, lawyers, architects and so on creating a class of permanently stratified society, the sort of thing that the late Deputy Seán <Col N="196" /> Moylan held was the intention of the present system when it was established by the British in the early days.  That is something from which we must try to get away.  We must try to devise an educational system which will, in fact, give equal opportunity in relation to education, the most important facility that can be provided.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties arising in regard to secondary schools&mdash;most of them are run by religions orders&mdash;is that in most cases they have to find the money themselves to provide the building.  I do not see why this policy is persisted in.  It would make matters very much easier for them if the Department would take the responsibility of providing money for buildings as they do, to a considerable extent, in providing money for vocational and primary schools at the moment.  As it is, the secondary schools have very little alternative but to charge fees that are, perhaps, not high but even low fees, such as are charged by the Christian Brothers, the Marist Brothers and the other teaching Brothers.</P>
    <P>As I have tried to point out, these small fees can be an insuperable obstacle to a labourer or a man with a small income or to a white collar worker with a large family, taking them with the cost of books, the loss of income, the food, the clothing, the housing and the slight entertainment that a child needs when growing up. It is too much of a responsibility and the child in one way or another is denied opportunities which it might be able to bring to fruition and so become a much more valuable member of society than the unskilled and untutored person necessarily is.</P>
    <P>There are some comparative figures which I saw recently in a UNESCO survey of world education for expenditure on secondary education for, I think, 1955.  In Russia, the figure was £7; in the U.S.A. £5; in Scotland, £2 5s., in England and Northern Ireland, £2.  The Irish expenditure in relation to those figures was 10/-.  That was the case at that time.  Clearly, we have lagged very far behind in the provision of secondary education compared with other countries.  We have lagged far behind in providing for secondary education the facilities <Col N="197" /> we provide for primary and vocational education, bad and all as they are.  I would ask the Minister at least to consider making the burdens easier on these teaching Orders and so make it possible for them to get schools if they are willing to provide teachers and skilled technicians of various kinds to do the teaching.  I do not see why the additional burden of providing buildings should be thrown on them and that they should have to provide the rather expensive equipment involved in science buildings in technical schools.  There cannot be any advance unless that attitude to the provision of buildings for secondary schools is altered.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy Lynch, gave us an illustration of this question of cost in relation to vocational education.  In his Estimate speech, he told us that the figure for 1955-56 jumped to 94,506 but it fell again in the following year to 88,624. These are figures for vocational schools and he said that this fall was due mainly to a decrease in the number of students attending evening classes following the 6 per cent. cut.  I do not want to make more out of this than is there, but I think it is a pointer to the very sensitive re-action there is to an increase in costs.  This re-action must follow and must show itself by a decrease in the number of people availing themselves of continuation or higher education.</P>
    <P>I hope the present Minister will repudiate the utterly illogical suggestion which followed that the local vocational authorities should try to get a higher percentage of their costs in fees and contributions from the students.  I know that what we would like to see cannot happen overnight. While we would like to have the education provided in the various spheres suggested&mdash;up to 15 as a basic requirement and then the alternative of the vocational school or the secondary school and the university&mdash; we feel that the Minister should also consider the standard of education which is being provided in these schools, vocational and secondary, and in the university.</P>
    <P>There are some rather disquieting <Col N="198" /> figures to which I shall briefly refer. They may have a significance which I cannot see but I found them disturbing and I would like to refer to them. In regard to the primary certificate, it is no good providing free education unless it is of a sufficiently high standard to qualify the child to earn its living in reasonable surroundings and get good wages in later life.  I suggest the figures here point to some serious fundamental disorder in our whole educational system.</P>
    <P>In 1957, the number of children who took the primary certificate examination was 27,450 and 8,200 failed.  There were 14,905 children between the ages of 13 and 14.  I wonder why there is that high number of children in that age group&mdash;the primary certificate age group&mdash;who either did not or were not able to take the primary certificate?  They had to wait until 15 instead to take an examination for which the primary curriculum is fitted for the age of 14. That would leave 23,000 but of 27,000 who either did not take or failed the primary certificate in that year.  That shows the significance of the primary certificate or the value of education in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>In relation to the secondary schools, a recent article by Dr. O'Meara, who is a considerable authority on education, was particularly damning in relation to the Leaving Certificate examination.  I think that the charges he made should be considered by the Minister.  He may have considered them and he may have answers for them.  I think they are very serious charges.  He charges that by the use of various devices, such as memorising essays in Irish, French and passages in different books which they are likely to get, children are put through the examination and, as he says, the certificate is thoroughly fraudulent as a process and quite illusory in its results.  That is a very serious charge. I am not competent to decide whether it is true or not but I think that a person of his standing and authority would not make an irresponsible statement.  He further says it is clear that the Leaving Certificate is no indication of either true knowledge or general ability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> Later on, I found some figures relating to University College.  I know it would be dangerous and wrong to generalise, but it is a significant fact, which possibly the Minister can explain, that Professor Tierney in University College, Dublin, in 1958, reported that of 1,556 subjects taken, first honours were won by only one per cent. and second honours were won by only five per cent. in these subjects.  These are figures which require an explanation.</P>
    <P>As to the vocational schools, I looked up a report of the Department of Education and I found the following figures.  In relation to certificate examinations day vocational courses, technical school examinations and trained technological study and other examinations, a total of 45,524 persons entered for these tests and 17,897 failed.  That is approximately 40 per cent. I think.  That seems to me to be a very high percentage of failures but I may be wrong.  Taking the primary school, Dr. O'Meara's remarks, the findings of University College, Dublin, which are no different from any of the other Universities, I understand, and the vocational schools&mdash;<i>en passant</i>, one could refer to the failure of the medical schools to live up to the inquiries made of them by the Americans recently&mdash;I think the figures require some examination from the point of view of the curriculum to see whether it is suitable, whether there is overcrowding, the influence of learning the language, the overcrowding of classrooms, bad school buildings, indifferent teaching methods and corporal punishment which, in my opinion, contributes to the general failure of the children to reach the standard of education required.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that there are plenty of intelligent children who, in my view, on the figures shown, are being denied an adequate opportunity to get a continuation education.  It is quite clear from the most recent Estimates speeches by the previous Minister for Education, Deputy J. Lynch, that there is no apparent appreciation of the very radical changes which are required in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> There is no Department in the State which is of greater importance. I think it is fair to say that there is no Department which has been so neglected.  That sounds rather harsh in view of the schools which have been built, but at the same time we still have the overcrowded classrooms and the apparent failure to provide for the reduction of the size of classes to manageable numbers.  We still have the difficulty consequent on the teaching as shown in the results of the examinations and the failure to provide an adequate number of scholarships to enable the underprivileged children in the middle and lower income groups to get an education which will fit the natural gifts which the child has.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the desirability of taking such steps as are necessary to provide a plan over a reasonable period of five or ten years.  I quite appreciate that the provision of school buildings or the provision of teachers cannot take place overnight.  I also appreciate that possibly the money for scholarships cannot be provided overnight, but I think the problem is a serious and important one for the children and the nation.  It is one which would well repay the outlay in time, energy and money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that, in the broad structure of our system of education, there is nothing to prevent expansion or adjustments to allow our system to cater for all our needs and it is on that basis that I would approach the motion.  The picture of the actual situation in relation to post-primary education at present is much better than Deputy Dr. Browne thought.  I think I can give a better idea of how much progress has been made and is being made within our present system to achieve the ends which the Deputy thought might be planned for now. These plans are already made and progress has been made along these <Col N="201" /> lines but if I present the picture in figures for schools and attendance it will be much clearer.</P>
      <P>In the year 1924-25, there were 278 secondary schools attended by 22,897 pupils and 64 vocational schools at which there were very few whole-time pupils in attendance.  By 1934-35, the figures had increased to 322 secondary schools and 33,577 pupils; 141 vocational schools and 11,809 whole-time pupils.  In 1944-45, the number of secondary schools was 379, with 41,178 pupils, and the number of vocational schools was 197 with 14,102 whole-time pupils.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress shown in those figures in the provision of increased facilities for post-primary education and the rate of increase in the number of pupils availing of the facilities have been very much accelerated in the last five years.  Again, the figures will show the position.  In the year 1954-55, the number of secondary schools was 458; 1955-56, 474; 1956-57, 480; 1957-58, 489; 1958-59, 494.  The number of pupils in secondary schools in the same years were: 1954-55, 56,511; 1955-56, 59,306; 1956-57, 62,444; 1957-58, 66,221; 1958-59, 69,568.  In 1954-55 there were 245 vocational schools; 1955-56, 252; 1956-57, 260; 1957-58, 267.  The number of whole-time pupils attending vocational schools in those years were: 1954-55, 20,895; 1955-56, 21,336; 1956-57, 22,491; 1957-58, 23,816.  The final figures for vocational education for this year are not available to me yet but I understand that there is an increase in the numbers again this year.  Apart from the whole-time pupils, there are about 62,000 pupils in part-time attendance at vocational schools.</P>
      <P>In this year also, 1959-60, a further 20 secondary schools are already in operation and the majority of these are serving purely rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts that emerge from these figures are that post-primary courses have been increasing as the facilities have been expanded and that the facilities have been expanded at a rate which could be described as a good rate.  The result of this expansion of facilities is that 50 per cent. of the 14 to 16 age group are at present in <Col N="202" /> whole-time attendance at either secondary schools or vocational schools and if the number of students in secondary tops, as they are called, in primary schools is included the result is that two-thirds of the children in the 14 to 16 age group receive whole-time instruction, that is, two-thirds receive whole-time instruction as against the Deputy's suggestion that two-thirds were excluded.</P>
    <P>The question of the raising of the upper limit of compulsory education has been raised before and in many places it has been said that most other countries have raised the limit.  That is not the fact.  I find that very few countries in Europe or, indeed, in the world have a compulsory upper limit higher than 14 years of age.  I make the statement now, Sir; it has been made before but it does not seem to have been accepted.  If anybody doubts it, I would refer him to the World Survey of Education, Volume 2, prepared by UNESCO.  Whilst it is my earnest wish that children should continue their schooling at least up to 15 years of age, our experience shows that the most fitting way to bring that about is to continue to increase the facilities for post-primary education and, if at all possible, to accelerate the rate of increase of those facilities.  I would consider it one of my main functions as Minister for Education to speed up as far as possible the provision of facilities for this desirable development.</P>
    <P>While the question appears to me to be a matter of providing facilities, the fact that the present facilities are being fully used would not suggest to me that the main question is the means of the parents.  I should like to say that I intend to endeavour to broaden the scope of scholarships and I hope that, everything else permitting, we shall have a scheme of scholarships so that the poor boy or girl in the country who has the necessary talent will have the chance of getting post-primary education and, I think, a chance of university education also.  These matters are often influenced by more than our desire to wave a magic wand.</P>
    <P>The question of the amount of money spent per head of the population <Col N="203" /> in various countries has been mentioned by the Deputy and by other people recently.  The figures given, which were that Russia spends £7, the United States of America £5, England £2, are not a fair comparison when you take the figure for Ireland as 10/- In those countries secondary education includes, in addition to grammar school education, a variety of post-primary educational facilities which would be included here under vocational education.  If you want to make a fair comparison you have to take this into account and also the comparative wealth of the countries in the first instance.  If you do so, the figure per head of the population would be nearer 29/- than 10/-, taking into account the amount spent on education.  To this must be added the amount spent on fees.  That would give you a picture showing that our position is better than those figures suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the figure which should be compared.  The overall picture is good.  We have a system of education which can be expanded and which, given time, will be expanded. But we should acknowledge that it has been expanded rapidly in recent years to cater for our needs.  We have every reason to be optimistic. Any success we will achieve or the speed at which we will do so, will depend to a great extent on the confidence we have in our own system and the confidence parents and teachers have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I be permitted to refer to criticisms of our system which may undermine our confidence in it and so delay any progress which is possible? <Col N="204" /> I welcome criticism and I am very glad of any interest people show.  I want to deal with criticism not based on facts and criticism which is purely hostile.  There are two types of critics. One is the man who is plainly hostile and does not know anything about what is going on in the schools, what our system is and most likely does not know anything about systems in other countries and yet makes sweeping statements that we have the worst system in the world.  That critic is harmful.</P>
    <P>There is another type of critic who probably does not interpret the statistics properly, or, as has happened in the case of that comparison of money expenditure, sometimes does not take the trouble to verify the statistics available to him.  I am not worried about what both these types of critics think but their views are often widely publicised and that type of criticism tends to undermine the confidence of our people in our system.</P>
    <P>The basis for advancement is there, but, first of all, we will have to settle that our system is a good system and suits us.  I know it has virtues and also has defects.  A number of our critics are, I think, tilting at windmills. They waste a lot of time on imaginary ills while the real defects are overlooked. I would appeal to those interested in education to be realistic. If we are realistic, look for the defects and make our best efforts to remedy them, we shall cater for the educational needs of our population in a much shorter time.</P>
    <P>In a system which requires the functioning together with the State of minority and majority Churches we have the great advantage of harmonious co-operation.  We are lucky to have teachers, clerical and lay, in our national, secondary and vocational schools who have a dedication and devotion to their work second to none anywhere.  I am sure everybody will agree that, when all is said and done, a system of education is what the teachers make it.  We are in the unique position of having trained teachers in greater proportion than any other country.  As a body, our secondary teachers are as well qualified as any in the world and better <Col N="205" /> than most.  The overall picture of our teaching profession is one of high qualifications and training.</P>
    <P>Our school building programme has been excellent.  Last year 92 new primary schools were opened and 50 were opened in the first six months of this year.  These are both records. We have a very good relationship between the teaching organisations and the Department of Education.  I should like to say to Deputy Browne that we have no shortage of trained teachers and we are, I think, almost unique in that position.  We are not now recruiting untrained teachers for our schools.  We are able to get trained teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate we shall have to improve the ratio but we are in a much better position.  You could have the other position where you could have a school without a teacher.  I was saying that one of the things about which we ought to be glad is the good relationship that exists between those concerned with the system.  There is a good relationship between the teaching organisations and my Department.  The changes made by my predecessor in the inspection system and the reformation wrought there has brought a change in the pattern that existed hitherto.  Instead of grievances and complaints there is now a much more harmonious relationship between the inspectors and the teachers.  Deputy Mulcahy as Minister for Education evolved a scheme whereby, instead of having public quarrelling and recrimination, problems could be discussed under certain machinery which was set up by him, problems relating <Col N="206" /> to salaries and emoluments generally. Very often, such problems are settled now without recourse to arbitration and without any of the disadvantages that sometimes attach to a public discussion.</P>
      <P>The picture is very much better than many of our critics would appear to believe.  We have a great deal for which to be grateful but there is still progress to be made.  I believe we will make that progress, and we will make it much more rapidly if there is a spirit of goodwill on the part of our critics. From that point of view I hope they will accept my invitation to an open door for the purpose of ascertaining the facts before they venture into publication.  Four times in as many weeks officers of my Department have had to contradict flatly published statements which were contrary to the facts.</P>
      <P>In a good school, where good work is done, the teacher will be busy doing his work well.  He will not be shooting to the headlines.  He will not be seeking headlines.  I sometimes think that it might be better from the point of view of inspiring confidence in our educational system if some of our very excellent teachers and educationalists took time off to seek the headlines, as so many others do.  However, I think our time is better spent in making improvements and in expanding the system generally.</P>
      <P>I hope that my appeal for goodwill and my invitation to come to where the facts can be ascertained before going into publication will be accepted by our critics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that many of the comments tonight, in my humble observation, have not been confined to the terms of the motion, interesting as the comments were by both contributors to the debate so far.  We are asked in this motion to increase the school-leaving age from 14 to 15 years. I think most Deputies and the majority of the people would agree with that increase.  It is desirable, of course, that we should so improve the economic circumstances of the families involved in such a proposal as to make it possible for them to permit their poverty that deters parents at the children to continue in school.  It is <Col N="207" /> moment from continuing the children in school after 14 years.  It is not the cost of school fees, the cost of post-primary education in the vocational schools or in the secondary schools. In many cases, it is due to the fact that the parents cannot afford the loss of earnings by children of 15 or 16 years of age.  I know that is a matter which does not come within the ambit of the Department of Education.  It is no function of the Department to remedy our economic and financial affairs.  Nevertheless, it is something to which this House will have to bend its mind in order to improve the circumstances of those families needing improvement so that children will not be deprived of desirable educational facilities because of the poverty of their parents.</P>
      <P>I was pleased with many of the figures quoted by the Minister.  At the same time, in quoting them, I think the Minister was falling into a trap&mdash; a trap which has caught the Department of Education long ago.  The Department is too satisfied with things as they are.  Good as things are, they can be made very much better.  In order to encourage parents to leave their children at school for another year, or two, I think the system of primary education and the primary certificate must be altered so that children will not take that examination until their last year at school.  It is undesirable that children should work to a certain standard for the primary certificate and then, as it were, find themselves marking time before reaching the school-leaving age.</P>
      <P>That is what is happening at the moment.  The last year, or year-and-a-half, is in many cases regarded as marking time before leaving school. That is undesirable.  Consideration should be given to the retention of children at school for another year and to concentrating in that year on an alteration in the curriculum by the introduction of certain subjects which will equip the children for adult life and their responsibilities as citizens.  At the moment, they cannot, under the system as it is, get much notion of their responsibilities as future citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, of course, they <Col N="208" /> should get that education from their parents, but the schools can help. There should be less emphasis in that last year on the three Rs and a greater emphasis on civics, if only for the negative reason, perhaps, of reducing the rate of juvenile delinquency which occurs between 14 and 16 years of age. We must provide facilities at school in order to retain the children there and deprive them of those dangerous idle years through which many of them pass at the moment.</P>
    <P>If the economic fabric were in a healthier state, many of the children leaving school at 14 years of age would secure immediate and permanent employment.  Our economic situation is so bad that many of these children have no alternative but to idle around the streets for a number of years. That idleness inevitably leads them into trouble.  Anyone who goes to the children's court in Dublin Castle will see there the tragic number of children who would not have got into trouble had they been provided with better educational facilities.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the wonderful work being done in secondary schools by religious orders.  Without their help, we would not have today the large numbers of pupils we have in secondary schools.  The number is close on 70,000.  We would not have these children in secondary schools were it not for the charitable work of religious organisations.  Excellent as that is, I do not think the Department of Education has a right to feel satisfied that it is sufficient.  The Minister boasted that 50 per cent. of the children between 14 and 16 years of age were receiving whole-time instruction. That is so, but our concern in this House should be about the other 50 per cent. who are not receiving whole-time instruction, and most of whom are not receiving even partial instruction.</P>
    <P>I do not believe they will obtain that instruction.  A very small percentage will obtain whole-time instruction under the system we have at the present time.  Although the figures have improved over the past five years, I believe we are about to reach the stage where these figures will stop increasing, and we shall still be left with <Col N="209" /> some 40 per cent. of the children not receiving any education beyond 14 years of age.  That is a pity but what is worse is that the training they get until they reach 14 years of age could be improved upon and is not being improved upon.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset of my few humble remarks, that is a matter which is outside the scope of this motion.  It is desirable that children should continue in school after 14 years of age.  If that cannot be achieved immediately with trained teachers, there is certainly no reason why persons with some knowledge of civics, and with some knowledge of the ordinary responsibilities of citizens, could not instruct children in their final year in school and give them an introduction to the large world into which they are now launched with very little qualifications other than those which were considered 100 or 150 years ago as minimum educational qualifications.  We have improved very very little on the minimum standard then considered necessary. Life is now a lot more complex and, on that account, it should take a little longer to educate the children, and we should see to it that, while they are at school, they are provided with a better system of education than the one now in operation.</P>

      <P>I would favour the broad principle embodied in this motion tabled by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan.  I listened to a good portion of Deputy Dr. Browne's speech and I would agree with many of the things he said.  A good thing about the motion is that he is not too specific in it.  He does not go into any great detail and, generally speaking, the four proposals he has embodied in it would have my support.  I do not know what the Minister's attitude towards the motion <Col N="210" /> is, I must confess, because I was not here for the major portion of his speech which was mainly a general survey of the educational system as it operates here in Ireland.  That was the latter part of his speech, in any case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan was quite sensible when he said that there are many things to be considered in raising the school-leaving age to 15 years.  I must agree that it is desirable that the school-leaving age should be 15 years, but there are many facts which must be faced.  We certainly must face the fact that there are very many fathers and mothers of families in this country who cannot wait for their children to reach 14 years of age when they can leave school and undertake jobs selling newspapers, as messenger boys or doing farm work to supplement the family income.  That is a problem with which the Minister cannot grapple in his capacity as Minister, but it is a problem the Government and the country must face up to in considering the raising of the school-leaving age to 15 years.</P>
      <P>I shall now quote the second part of the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;.... the child, having passed through standard VI, should be given these three alternatives: (1) to enter a secondary school, (2) to undertake a whole-time course in a vocational school, (3) to remain on in a national school.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is laudable that a child, or the parent of a child, should be given these three alternatives.  I mentioned on the Vote for the Department of Education the importance of, and the lack of, vocational guidance in our educational system here today.  The Minister has made comparisons with other countries and he mentioned many of the advantages we have in our educational system but the one thing we lack&mdash;to my mind, the most important thing&mdash;is any semblance of vocational guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a boy or a girl reaches the age of 17 or 18 years, it is possible that he or she knows exactly what he or she wants to do&mdash;to become a teacher, a builder's labourer, a carpenter, a barrister or what have you.  I must say I am not an expert on education, <Col N="211" /> but from the little I know, there is no attempt on the part of teachers or anybody else to give any sort of advice or guidance to the type of child we are discussing here tonight&mdash;the child of 14 or 15 years of age.  There are many unfortunately, who decide to continue from the national school to the secondary school who get a bare pass in the Intermediate Certificate and a bare pass in the Leaving Certificate.  I ask the House what are they worth after they have wasted so many years in what is described as academic education?  Boys and girls with this standard of intelligence may not be suited for or, in many cases, have not the money for University courses to qualify with this, that or the other degree.  If they got the proper guidance at 14 or 15 years of age, they would probably become good stenographers or secretaries or tradesmen, or work in some other capacity which would not call for a University training.</P>
    <P>The Minister should concern himself about these matters because, again, my experience is that so long as fees and capitation grants are paid, the schools are not too concerned about the future of the boy or girl.  I make that as a general criticism, not as a specific criticism against any particular teaching branch or any section of the teaching community at all.  Therefore, in <Col N="212" /> trying to achieve what Deputy Dr. Browne wants to introduce, the Minister ought to try to form some association to help boys and girls at the age of 14 or 15 years to make up their minds.</P>
    <P>If when a child passes the sixth standard&mdash;usually about the age of 11 or 12 years&mdash;he were asked: what would you like to do?  Would you like to continue on to a secondary school, or go to a technical school, or remain on in the national school?&mdash; what answer would the young boy or girl at that age give?  Is he or she at 12 years in a position to decide what his or her future is to be?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Deputy have his parents no function?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come to that. The parents certainly have a function but my point about it is that there is not a proper liaison between the parents and teachers, unless, of course, each individual parent goes up to the school&mdash;and for some reason they are reluctant to do so&mdash;and asks: how is the boy or the girl getting on?  Unfortunately the usual sort of answer is: &ldquo;He is not doing too badly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m on Thursday, 22nd October, 1959.</P>

      <i>Notes regarding basic wage rates;</i>
    </P>
    <P>(a)The basic weekly rates as set out above are those obtaining for time work, i.e. they exclude additional earnings under the Incentive Bonus Scheme.</P>
    <P>(b)In Counties Dublin and Kildare the present basic rates are lower than the former rates; any employees who enjoyed the former rates retain them in the form of a special allowance, which when the Incentive Bonus Scheme has been applied at their Forests, guarantees total earnings not lower than the previous rates.</P>
    <P>As regards part (e) of the question, application of the Scheme in the next six months will continue to be concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of the country in Counties Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Kerry but it is expected that the scheme will also be extensively applied in other parts of the Country.  It would be misleading to furnish a nominal list of Forests where the Scheme is likely to be introduced in the period since application planning must necessarily be flexible and subject to adjustment as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>As regards part <i>(f)</i> of the question, average bonus earnings for Forests where the Incentive Bonus Scheme was in operation for each month of 1959 to date were as follows:&mdash;</P>
