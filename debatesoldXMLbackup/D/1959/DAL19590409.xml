      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night I was about to refer to the methods at present in operation governing the employment of vocational teachers.  The present system has been in operation for a number of years and is now beginning to show signs of defect.  It has reached the stage now in which highly qualified candidates for posts in vocational schools find themselves obliged to carry out an intensive canvass among members of the vocational committees in order to secure appointment.  I agree that the method of selection is probably the popular one, but it is not the method applied in most other branches of our Public Service.  In the case of agricultural instructors, poultry instructresses, and so on, appointments are made from a panel of qualified applicants by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of appointment of vocational teachers is a matter that the Minister will have to take in hand eventually.  For the past couple of years competition for such appointments has been exceptionally keen. That results in applicants finding great difficulty in securing appointment. That would not be so bad in itself if it were not necessary for these applicants to travel several miles through the country interviewing members of the vocational committee concerned. After all that, they might be unsuccessful and have to repeat the same performance all over again with the committee in another county where a <Col N="181" /> similar vacancy would arise.  I understand that some committees find this practice objectionable from the point of view of the members.  They also considered it very unfair to qualified applicants and have made some local arrangements whereby interviews are held by a sub-committee of the committee. A limited number of the total applicants is selected by that sub-committee, probably two or three, as being suitable people, and that small number is submitted to the Committee for one appointment.</P>
    <P>Qualified applicants for any position should be able to get reasonable and fair consideration from a committee, without having to go hat in hand begging their support.  I do not know what the Minister can do about it because I appreciate that since local ratepayers are contributing a proportion of the salaries for the teachers in question, the local representatives like to have some say in their appointment. I think they are precedents for taking the course I suggest.  I hope that, sooner or later, the Minister will be able to bring about the desirable change which is needed in the present system.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy realise that that would be a great departure in educational matters from the general practice in regard to the appointment of teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a lot of drastic departures over the past 25 years, some of which did not seem very desirable at the outset, but which, in the long run, proved very effective.  I feel we are discouraging people leaving secondary schools from taking on a course of preparation for teaching in vocation schools if they have to go around the country, hat in hand, begging for votes and if their appointments are eventually decided in many cases, not on capability and other such relative qualifications, but on other considerations altogether. That is something that should be corrected, at the very least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Gen. Mulcahy Gen. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Gen. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy suggests it should be taken out of the hands of the local body controlling education in the area, that is, the managerial body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I am particularly interested in page 8 of the Minister's report where he refers to the additional provision made this year for the training of teachers&mdash; particularly metalwork and woodwork instructors.  I am aware that there is a general shortage of such personnel. Nevertheless, the number of vacancies for that type of teacher is limited. What has impressed me over a number of years is the satisfactory manner in which the Department control the outflow of such teachers.  They seem to be able to measure out fairly correctly the number of teachers likely to be required at the end of a school year and more or less succeed in getting that number qualified, with the result that there is usually little or no unemployment amongst the teachers who qualify.  I would ask the Department to keep a special eye on that matter because, in other branches of education, we occasionally run into a situation in which we have a surplus of teachers who, in many cases, go abroad.  Then, unexpectedly, for a <Col N="183" /> short time, we have not enough personnel to fill the available posts.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the section of the Department controlling these training courses has been able to measure out correctly the approximate requirements for the respective subjects and has been able to keep it at that.  At the moment, there is a very good opening for young people&mdash;trainees&mdash; for such courses.  I think the method of recruitment would be very hard to improve on and I am sure it has given the results the Department anticipated.  Usually, the type of person selected has already proved his value in another field and thereby becomes very suitable for the position he is obliged to take up.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on providing such a very substantial increase in the Vote for Technical Instruction.  Under the Vote, an additional amount of approximately £98,000&mdash;7 per cent. of the whole Estimate&mdash;is made available.  I was glad to notice that the Minister made provision for the number of counties which found themselves in great difficulties through not being able to provide from the rates the amount of money necessary to meet the local contribution of the respective vocational committees.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to that position in his report&mdash;pages 7 and 8 &mdash;and indicated that he has provided, as a temporary measure, this year, a sum of £15,768 to carry the counties in question through the present difficulty. It indicates, however, that this is a temporary measure and that legislation will shortly be proposed to rectify this position in a permanent way.  It is very satisfactory that some temporary means have been devised whereby the counties in question&mdash; Leitrim, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Kerry&mdash;can carry through their normal programme in the interim.  When the legislation is introduced, I hope it will be possible to make available from the rates the additional amount of money that will be required in such instances.</P>

      <P>Is Meastachán antábhachtach í seo agus bhí áthas orm <Col N="184" /> nuair a chuala mé an tAire a rá go bhfuil breis airgid le caitheamh i ngach brainse den Roinn Oideachais i mbliana.

Beidh a thoradh sin le feiceál amach anseo, agus déanfar obair níos fearr don oideachas agus do leas na tíre i gcoitinne dá bhárr.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing to note that the goodwill engendered by the Minister on all sides in his very important Department will undoubtedly redound to his credit and the good of the nation in general in the future.  I referred to some matters last year such as the inspection system and the abolition of the merit marks which, I am glad to say, have satisfactorily been settled. My views on the primary certificate examination, the plight of the pre-1950 pensioned teachers and the supplying of needlework and kindergarten materials are already on record here. I referred to these matters last year.  I shall not delay the House or the Minister with my views on them again, but I trust that in time the points I raised in relation to them will be satisfactorily dealt with.  I shall confine my remarks, therefore, on this occasion, to a few other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister announced in his speech that from 1st July next the average enrolment and the average attendance figures required for the appointment of a second assistant teacher, in the case of schools where there is accommodation for three teachers, will be reduced from 100 and 85 to 90 and 75 respectively.  That is a very pleasing announcement and will undoubtedly confer great benefit on education in the Primary Branch, but I trust that, in addition to having these figures for the appointment and retention of teachers, they will also be taken into account in establishing the category to which a school belongs. There is the case of a school where there may be three teachers on the staff but which would be regarded as only a two-teacher school for the purpose of grants such as capitation <Col N="185" /> grants and grants for the heating and cleaning of the school.  There may be three rooms to clean but the school may get a cleaning grant only for two rooms because the category is based on the average attendance. Heretofore that was 85.  There may be over 100 pupils in the school and three rooms to clean and yet it would be reckoned as only a two-teacher school because of the requirement of an average attendance of 85.</P>
    <P>Anybody knows that an epidemic or a spell of bad weather could bring the average below the required 85 and that, consequently, the category of the school would be two-teacher. If the figures now announced are taken into account for the purpose of the appointment or retention of teachers, they should also be taken into account for the purpose of determining the category of a school and either the number on roll or the average should be taken.  It is unfair to count the average only in determining the category of a school for the reasons I have stated, that an epidemic, sickness or bad weather, factors over which the teachers have no control, could mean a reduction in the category of the school.  If either the roll or the average attendance were taken, epidemics or other causes of bad attendance would not particularly affect the category in which the school would be placed.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the provision of kindergarten and needlework materials in national schools.  The matter has not been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  I should like to include in that the provision of first aid outfits.  During play hour there may be a minor accident to a child.  During their training, teachers learn a certain amount of first aid, hygiene and so forth.  If first aid outfits were supplied they would be of great help in the case of a minor accident happening in a remote country district where a doctor or nurse would not be readily available. Immediate attention could be given to the child pending the availability of medical aid.</P>
    <P>Last year, also, I referred to the use of tape recorders in national <Col N="186" /> schools.  That matter was referred to by other Deputies.  Subsequently I was taken up in the local paper by an anonymous correspondent who suggested that I was trying to supplant the teacher by tape recorders or some artificial devices.  Of course, I did not intend any such thing.  I am glad that in his introductory statement the Minister indicated that the Council of Education in its Report on the Primary School recommended that a special research and advisory section should be established in the Department to provide advice on teaching methods and aids in general.  Since referring to tape recorders on last year's Estimate I have attended lectures on oral and visual aids where the use of the tape recorder and film strip was demonstrated most effectively as an aid to teaching.  These aids must be operated by the teacher.  I am glad that the Minister has taken note of this and that such a section has been set up in the Department.  I am sure it will do an immense amount of good.</P>
    <P>In the field of education every modern aid and technique should be availed of.  No one would suggest that in the field of combat the spear, the battleaxe and the shield would be of any use nowadays.  They were quite useful in their day.  The aims of modern weapons are the same&mdash;attack and defence.  In the field of education we must move with the times and avail of every modern aid and technique. More especially, such aids should be provided in the rural areas, removed from large centres of population.</P>
    <P>Television is another new aid that in time can be brought into very great use in education.  In countries where it is used it has proved of tremendous value in imparting useful knowledge.</P>
    <P>As I have said, all the time the teacher, no matter what aids he may have, will be most necessary because the primary purpose of education is the formation of character and leading children to the ultimate end for which they were created and that cannot be achieved by a machine or any artificial means.  These aids would be of great use in the hands of those who are skilled in them.  It is pleasing that a section has been set up to study these <Col N="187" /> methods.  I am sure they will be introduced in the training colleges and young teachers coming out of training colleges will have these new means and methods available to them.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that summer courses, which have been so successfully established, should be continued and that, when new methods and aids are in being, teachers who have been already trained should have refresher courses available to them so as to enable them to keep abreast of modern methods.</P>
    <P>I would again congratulate the Minister on the wonderful work he has done in all the various Branches, Primary, Secondary, Vocational and University&mdash;and would hope that he will be spared for many years to continue the good work he has done for education since he went into this important Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for Education is, of course, one of our most important Estimates in that the future of the country as a whole depends upon the moulding of the individual.  The greater part of the Estimate is taken up with primary education.  That is as it should be because the majority of our people get their early education in our primary schools.  I have not had the opportunity of studying the Minister's speech closely.  He made it in a language with which I am not fully conversant.</P>
      <P>The education of 30, 40 or 50 years ago in the primary schools was largely concerned with matters that affected us only in this country.  Today in the national set-up generally, where no country exists by itself but more for the community of nations and the European outlook, our education should be directed towards forming the minds of the rising generation looking beyond the confines of their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, it is necessary that our education should, if possible, be somewhat more extensive than before.  Not being an educational expert, it is very hard for me to indicate to the Department what form that could really take. <Col N="188" /> I feel that in every walk of life people have a particular speciality.  It should be possible for teachers in the primary school to be more lenient.</P>
    <P>As I understand, the position is that they have to teach certain subjects at certain times; that they are limited to those times and that they are forced to carry out that system by reason of the fact that an inspector may suddenly walk into a school and ask a teacher why he is not teaching arithmetic or something else.  Therefore, I think that our teachers are narrowed in their opportunities for dealing with their pupils.</P>
    <P>If they find that they have a pupil who has a bent for a particular subject they should surely be allowed to develop the bent that pupil has more than they are now able to do.  In other words, they should not be restricted in their teaching.  I think no one can study the mind of boys or girls as well as the teacher himself.  Therefore, I think that the Department of Education or those who are in control, through the Minister, should be more liberal in their outlook.  I cannot help feeling that in the world of the present day we are no longer a separate entity, a nation living to itself alone.  Therefore, in the educational sphere we should extend considerably beyond our own country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong in my surmise but I imagine that the teaching of history, for instance, in our primary schools is confined to Irish history alone.  I may be wrong in that; I speak subject to correction.  I think it would be a good thing if pupils were taught a little of the history of other countries.  I do not suggest that they should have British history shoved down their throats but I think they should have some knowledge of the history of some European countries and the countries which have a cultural outlook similar to that of our own.  It would be good for them; it would broaden their minds.</P>
    <P>It may not be possible&mdash;and that brings me back to what I said at the beginning&mdash;for all pupils to be instructed on these lines.  There may be some pupils who can only get through the ordinary curriculum embracing <Col N="189" /> such subjects as reading, writing and mathematics.  There must be the more brilliant type of pupil who is extremely adaptable.  That is evidenced by the fact that there are Irishmen who have played a vital part in other countries in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>They are the products of the national schools.  They have gone out and achieved much, building up other countries.  If they were directed along those lines and educated in the broader sense much of their efforts could be utilised and devoted to the building up of their own country.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate thing that so many of our people have to emigrate. Perhaps I should put it this way.  It is unfortunate that so many do emigrate. I understand that the enormous number of 46,000 emigrated during nine months in 1958.  That is a matter which should give serious thought to the Department of Education that they are not educating pupils only for the purpose of staying in the village in which they are reared but that they are educating them for something wider. Irish people do play a very prominent part in affairs because, wherever they go, they set a standard which is fundamentally sound from the Christian outlook. The higher the education they have for this purpose and the greater opportunity they have of absorbing a wider outlook in their youth, the better is will be for them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the Irish language. Anything one says about the Irish language is misconstrued.  It seems to me that valuable time is being wasted in that it is being accepted by everybody among all shades of opinion in this House that the attempt to develop the Irish language or teach it by compulsory methods is a failure.  I understand that we are waiting for a commission to reach a decision as to whether or not the teaching of the Irish language, as taught at present, is a success.  I do not think it is really necessary to wait for the commission to issue its report.  I do not know when this commission is going to favour us with their report.  I do not know how big the report will be or whether it is something that will possibly take an extensive period of <Col N="190" /> Ministerial and Executive study after it comes out but I feel that we ought not to drift on as we are.</P>
    <P>May I say that I do not want to see the Irish language disappear?  I belong to a generation that did not learn as much Irish as the present day pupils.  Perhaps, I should put that another way.  The way I was taught was not the way present day pupils are taught.  I think that the bilingual attempt which exists at the moment is a total failure and not only is it a total failure but it is to the general detriment of the education of the people.</P>
    <P>In other countries there are people who are bilingual.  For instance, the Swiss speak French and German; in Alsace it is one or other language, either French or German&mdash;but there is this difference between that and our case, in that those languages are spoken in the shops and schools and in the home.  One actually finds cases where the different members of the family speak to one another in different languages.  We have to face the fact that, outside the Gaeltacht areas, one practically never hears Irish spoken at all or if one does, it is generally a couple of teachers speaking to each other, as they are practically the only people who know it to-day.  I may be maligning my colleagues, but I would say that many, the majority, of my colleagues here do not know how to speak it.</P>
    <P>The plea I put to the Minister is that if he has any ideas on this subject at all he should move, without waiting for the commission to report. If the commission issues its report and if there are good things in it, let the Minister use it; but in the meantime let him use his own initiative. I think he has some initiative. He has shown that since he went into the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to university education. I am very glad to see, in the brief glance I had at the Minister's speech, that the grants for university education are to be increased.  There is always a feeling in this country that universities are very wealthy institutions which are very well able to look after themselves. Such, of course, is not the case at all. University institutions in every country <Col N="191" /> in the world are run at a heavy loss. All universities in all countries are extensively developed in every sphere possible.  We cannot get away from the obvious fact that we live in a scientific age and that university education is becoming of paramount importance. That is so not only in relation to our major industry, agriculture; we have to develop and go ahead in our scientific experiments regarding agriculture, but we must also develop industry, medical science, and so on, so that we can compete very favourably with other people.  One thing we must bear in mind.  Originally, when our National University was established, it was established under the existing grants and funds available to cover a student population in the neighbourhood of 1,200 to 1,400.  Now there are 4,000 students in the National University and they are still in the same congregation that they had practically without change, in the original part of the university, as established in the early part of this century.  Any funds which are being made available &mdash;and I gather they are more than they were before&mdash;are not sufficient to deal with this important matter.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I would like to refer, and which is, I think, the concern of our vocational schools, is the subject of cooking.  Cooking is very much tied up with several other sections of our educational system.  The consideration of cooking, is I am sure, the responsibility of the Department of Education.  I want to congratulate the Department on the training of staffs.  We have had schools in Wexford where they have trained waitresses and cooks.  It is essential that we should have people who really know how to do these things, since it means so much both to ourselves who live here and to our visitors.  Apart from anything else, I think the preparation of the dishes themselves needs to be good.  I have always been greatly impressed by the cooking of the French.  Their raw material is not as good as ours, but they manage to cook anything and make it tasty.  It is a well-known fact that in France they have not got the luscious meat which <Col N="192" /> we have here; yet they are able, by some method to turn out very palatable meals from the meats they have.</P>
    <P>In this country there is a great lack of understanding of the cooking of fish.  One of the reasons we do not eat fish&mdash;and, as a people, we eat far less fish than any other country in the world&mdash;is that our people do not really know how to cook it.  That is a rather sweeping statement to make about Irish housewives as a whole, but it happens to be true.  I think that is why we import so much preserved and tinned fish, as it is very easy to handle.  The cooking of fish is a difficult thing and it is a scientific matter.  For that reason, the Minister might consider, as an experiment, getting someone from the Continental arena who is an adept at dealing with fish cooking.  Perhaps he might be employed as an instructor in one of our vocational schools, or in one of those establishments which would be servicing our hotels later on.  Perhaps that state of affairs already exists&mdash; I do not know&mdash;but judging from the way fish is cooked here in relation to the way it is cooked on the Continent of Europe, there is still a lot of leeway to be made up.</P>
    <P>The decision the Minister took last year to restore the married female teacher was a wise one, although it may not have entirely met all the requirements necessary.  One of our great difficulties in rural Ireland has been the changing of teachers.  To a certain extent the re-employment, or the continuation in employment, of married teachers has prevented that. I always felt that those married teachers who ceased to be employable under the Department of Education were very often married to teachers. When they went out of employment, they were inclined to move from the country school&mdash;and, naturally, where the woman moves the man follows&mdash; into the bigger centres where it would be possible for them to get temporary employment at holiday times or during epidemics.  The re-establishment of married female teachers has stopped the migration of teachers to a large extent.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that another <Col N="193" /> difficulty in anchoring them&mdash;the married or unmarried teachers, young or old teachers&mdash;in certain areas has been due to the lack of housing accommodation.  If we are to create an atmosphere of stability in the rising generation, it is most essential that we avoid frequent changes of teacher. For that reason, I have always felt that there ought to be, sponsored by the Department, some form of very easy housing terms for rural teachers, to enable them to settle down in an area.</P>
    <P>I have found it the experience in my own constituency that if a teacher is to get married the sequence of events is often that he moves because he cannot get a house.  He may move into the nearest town in order to get a house, but that means he has to travel out to his school every day.  He is not in the school district and he is not part and parcel of the community there.  If a teacher does not live in his own immediate school district, in the area in which he is teaching, he does not carry the same weight.  It is only natural, with pupils who have left secondary or primary schools, that they tend to go back to those who have taught them.  They respect them and look up to them and I believe that this migration out of Ireland, this race to get out of the country by people who have got fairly good employment here, is due to the fact that they have really no one to advise them.  The natural influence would be to go back to a teacher for advice, a teacher or a master who has been living in their own area for 30 or 40 years but, if the teacher is changed, that influence is gone.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Minister might see fit to arrange with his colleague in charge of the Department of Local Government to have some particularly easy terms made available to enable teachers to build houses and to settle in their own teaching districts.  That is really the best hope.  There is no greater anchorage anywhere than to own your own house because, in doing so, you become part and parcel of the district.  I do not think I have anything further to say and I apologise for taking up the time of the House so <Col N="194" /> long on a subject with which I am not particularly conversant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to learn that the Minister for Education proposes to do something with regard to improving facilities in St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra.  It is high time that buildings there were improved and that facilities for the training of teachers were extended.  I think that the Minister might do something about improving the practicising schools that are attached to that Training College.  They are housed in very old buildings and it is in them the student teachers have to get their practice in teaching.  Those schools should be an example to the young teachers coming out of the training colleges.  They should see the very best available school buildings and should work under the very best possible conditions. <Col N="195" /> If a young teacher has not high standards put before him in his Training College days he cannot be expected to know what is best when he goes down the country where too often he finds bad buildings and conditions. He should at least know the standards towards which he should strive to attain.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the training colleges that I should mention.  Some years ago the I.N.T.O. recommended that the facilities in University College Dublin, should be made available to students in training and, for the life of me, I cannot understand why the Department of Education does not insist that students in St. Patrick's Training College should attend lectures or, at least, some of their lectures, in University College Dublin and do some of the degree course there.  The Protestant Training College arranges for the attendance of their students in Trinity College and I understand that lectures on the Irish language, history and education are given to the students of Protestant Training College in Dublin.  Why cannot the same facilities be made available for the students of Carysfort Training College and St. Patrick's Training College at University College Dublin? It is very hard to understand why something has not been done about the matter.  It seems an ideal scheme and one that could be put into effect without a lot of trouble or expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an announcement about the improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and that will be welcomed everywhere.  It means that something will be done, at long last, to reduce the big classes that have been the bane of teachers, especially in the city.  For a number of years I myself taught in the city and, about the month of June, I would have up to 70 or 80 children in my class in a room which was inadequate to accommodate that number.  That is commonplace in Dublin schools in May and in June when the enrolment of pupils, who have reached the age of four or four and a half years, is made.  Teachers have to contend with classes of that size but how can any teacher work <Col N="196" /> with a class of that size?  The teacher has a full time job trying to control the children and cannot properly impart instruction owing to the size of his class.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to do something about the unsuitable text books in the national schools.  In that respect the Irish text books are not the worst. The English text books, however, for the senior standards in primary schools are an outrage.  A few years ago in one of these books in my school there was a lesson on Michael Davitt.  I could give that book to any ordinary Deputy in this House and it would put him to the pin of his collar to know what it was all about.  The teacher had to spend most of his time explaining the difficult words and difficult phrases that cropped up in the lesson and, whatever knowledge the pupil could get about Michael Davitt and what he had done for the farmers of this country, was entirely lost owing to the amount of time spent in explaining difficult words and passages.  That text book was published by one of the important publishing firms here in Dublin and had got the prior approval of the Department of Education. Presumably it had been read and examined by an inspector and certified by him as suitable for a sixth class pupil in a national school.</P>
    <P>More care should be taken by the inspectors in the examination of these texts books sent to them by the publishers.  They are far too difficult for national school children and they make too many exacting demands on the time of the teacher.  Sanction should be given only to such text books as meet the exacting requirements of national school children as regards grading, suitability, and interest.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, seeing that he has done so much to improve the relations between the teachers and the Department, to examine the question of the many teachers who came out of the training colleges in the early thirties and could not get employment in these years.  Many of them worked as labourers and navvies in Ireland and abroad when work was very scarce and when they could not get employment in their profession.  These teachers <Col N="197" /> will lose pension rights and the Minister should make some concession to the men and women who, through no fault of their own, after leaving the training colleges in the early thirties, could not get employment in the profession of their choice and for which they were trained.</P>
    <P>I join with others in appealing to the Minister and to the Government to do something for the pre-1950 pensioned teachers.  These teachers have a grievance and many public bodies in the country have asked the Government to redress their grievance.  Many members of the Dáil and of the Seanad have spoken in their favour and if the Government decide to do something for those teachers they will have the good wishes and the commendation of everyone who knows the excellent work these teachers did in difficult days.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt referred to summer courses.  The best summer courses, with the exception of the music course given by the Department of Education, have been given by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  They have held courses in U.C.D., U.C.C. and U.C.G. and held symposiums on such difficult problems as that of the retarded child and the mentally defective child, problems that have been ignored by the Department of Education. The Department of Education held courses some years ago on the teaching of history and geography but for some reason or another these courses fell flat, and the initiative has been handed over to the I.N.T.O.  The Department has at its disposal experts or presumably people who are regarded as experts on these different subjects.  Why their services are not availed of in the summer months is more than I can understand.</P>
    <P>I hope that before this time next year the Minister will have reached a decision on this vexed question of the primary school certificate.  He has received much help and advice from the I.N.T.O. and I am sure whatever decision he makes will be accepted by the teachers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the training of metal work teachers and to the difficulty of getting them.  I would <Col N="198" /> ask the Minister if he could have a greater number of these teachers trained.  We have three vacancies in County Galway at present for Arts teachers.  We have advertised but can get no applicants.  I believe the position is the same all over the country. The Department has not been training enough arts and crafts teachers to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also mentioned university education and I join with him in welcoming the increases in the grants given to the university colleges. I cannot understand why many of the big firms, such as American combines, that are allowed to operate in Ireland have not helped our universities as they should by endowments.  There are exceptions like the firm of Arthur Guinness and Co. and a few more Irish firms.  Petrol companies and other large combines have not played their part in endowing our universities as they have done elsewhere, especially in Britain.  They are allowed to trade here and derive a fair income from their operations but they do not help us in regard to university education at all, although they do so in Britain. Why they do not do it here is a matter for inquiry.  They have duties to the Irish people and if they are getting a good whack out of the country they should try to put something back into it by helping our universities which badly need money.</P>
    <P>Last year marked a significant improvement in the relations between the national teachers, the Minister and the Department of Education.  The inspectorial system has been changed and the merit marks abolished.  I trust the inspectors of the Department, who are charged with the reponsibility of carrying out the Minister's wishes in this matter, will not forget their duty. Much of the success of the scheme depends on how they co-operate and it should be impressed upon them that this change, long overdue, is for the betterment of education and they should carry out their instructions in the spirit in which the Minister has instituted these changes.  If they fall down on the job I am afraid the ground which has been recovered and the improvements which have been effected will be of no avail.  I appeal <Col N="199" /> to the Minister to make sure that these changes will be carried out and that the improvements that we have been told about will prove to be real and not illusory.</P>

      <P>Tá dul chun cinn mór déanta ag an Roinn Oideachais leis na blianta anuas.

Nuair atá na dreamanna sin ag comhoibriú le chéile, na múinteoirí, an Roinn agus na bainisteoirí beidh toradh níos fearr ná mar a bhí as na troideanna agus na haighnis a bhí ar siúl le blianta anuas ón am a bhí na Sasanaigh i réim anseo.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of education which I should like to deal with in English and that is the development of modern ideas in education.  The one I want to refer to now is television. In the modern age, we must make use of any new developments which can be seen to be of advantage to teaching in this country and in every other country as well.  Television can be one of the greatest aids in schools all over the world.  We are about to set up a television service.  That is important because, up to now, we have been bombarded by outside television. After school hours, our children in many parts of the country where viewing is possible watch television programmes which are entirely foreign to this country, which are not suited to the adult population here and especially to our school children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government have taken the decision to install a television service here.  It is important that, as far as education is concerned, the <Col N="200" /> service be directed in the most suitable manner.  The most important feature of the decision is that we should have absolute and full control of such a service.  In that way only can we use the vast benefits of television for the education of our people and especially for the education of our children. Only by having complete and absolute control can we see to it that the work of generations of Irishmen and Irishwomen in fostering the Irish language and Irish culture, in advertising our Irish newspapers and in developing our country amongst the nations of the world, will be safeguarded.  Only in that way can we preserve the effect of the energy that has been put into the building-up of the Irish nation by past generations and by the present generation.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister, in his capacity as a member of the Cabinet, to keep a watchful eye on the development of the television service. When it does come, we hope that this marvellous device for education, this premier visual aid, will be availed of in our schools.  A start can be made in the bigger schools.  But, in time, I should like to see this device used in all the schools in the country.  It will be a great aid to our children and to teachers where special programmes suitable for children, programmes of an educational nature, can be arranged to fit into the school programmes.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister the necessity for better equipment for our national schools.  The present arrangement is fairly haphazard.  I think the Department should lay down special standards of equipment for the various subjects.  They should specify such a matter rather than leave it to the discretion of the teacher who in most cases just decides on what is needed and orders something, the purchase of which is usually decided by the price. Sometimes the cheapest possible article is got whereas, in the interest of economy, the better article at the higher price is the one that should be got.</P>
    <P>It is praiseworthy to note from the Minister's opening statement that a great expansion of the school-building programme has taken place during the year, that many extra new schools <Col N="201" /> have been erected and that the construction has taken place on a wider scale.  I think more emphasis should be placed on the reconstruction of our national schools.  It is painful to see some national schools which were built within the past 20 years falling into disrepair and decay.  In some cases, school buildings of only 20 to 30 years of age have had to be replaced by new buildings.  More facilities, better help and encouragement, should be given to managers to maintain schools by way of running repairs to the buildings, the painting of woodwork and so on. Then, after a period, they should be encouraged to carry out reconstruction rather than let those buildings go until such time as they are condemned by the Office of Public Works and the people of the parish and the Department have placed on them a commitment in relation to the cost of the erection of a new building.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Department on behalf of a section of our Irish children who are not catered for to any appreciable extent, that is, the mentally-retarded, the mentally-deficient and the backward children. I am afraid our facilities for looking after and trying to educate these children are only a very small percentage of what we require.  As a Deputy, I have had endless trouble in making inquiries and finding out where such children can be placed.  The invariable answer from the very few institutions that we have is that there is a waiting list of 400, and so on.  That position should be remedied very soon.</P>
    <P>In many cases where institutional treatment is needed, the only place to which such children can be sent is the local mental hospital.  I have seen children of eleven and twelve years of age in mental hospitals.  A mental hospital is not the place for such children.  That is something that should not happen.  It has to happen because there are no suitable places available. It is for that reason that I make a special appeal that grants should be given through the Department to the various religious orders and voluntary organisations who are finding it difficult to cater for the large number of children seeking admission to their establishments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> I agree with Deputy Carty that many of the text books are too difficult and frustrating to both teacher and pupil. It takes away from the educational value of the lesson when a disproportionate amount of the time available has to be devoted, in either English or Irish, to explanations of words and sentences, and so on.  It would help if simpler text books and reading books in both Irish and English were made available.</P>
    <P>In regard to Irish text books, in Donegal, which has three or four Gaelatchta, books have to be used that are not written in the Donegal dialect.  I do not want to raise the question of dialect.  That is a matter about which there should be no bitterness and on which there should be standardisation. I am thinking of children who come to school with a certain dialect and are immediately plunged into the intricacies of a strange dialect.  It is not fair to do it at that stage.  There are plenty of opportunities for coordination and co-operation for the purpose of arriving at something that is standard but the primary school, and especially the junior classes of the primary school, is not the place or the time to carry out that work of familiarising children with dialects of which they have no experience.</P>
    <P>The selection of text books or readers in Irish for junior divisions is such that if a teacher in Donegal carries out the regulations of the Department he must go outside Donegal readers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a publication which is doing very good work for the Irish language, namely, <i>Amárach,</i> which is getting no grant from the Department of Education.  <i>Amárach</i> has a very wide circulation in all the western counties.  The number of issues is as great as or greater than that of publications which are getting substantial grants.  I cannot understand why this publication is penalised.  I made a similar appeal last year on behalf of <i>Amárach.</i>  Nothing has been done.  I make the appeal now for no other reason than that this publication, like other publications, is totally in Irish; it has a wide circulation; the <Col N="203" /> material is of a topical nature and it it doing the same kind of work as the other publications which are getting grants.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister at the I.N.T.O.  Congress urging on teachers the necessity to inculcate in the minds of children the desirability of remaining at home, of working in this country and of making an effort to stem the tide of emigration and to build up the country economically. Many teachers are helping in that way and it is a way in which help can be given.  It is in the school that the mind of the child is trained.  It is in the school that he is fitted for his life ahead.  If the advantages of living and working in this country are made clear to him, if he is warned of the dangers of emigration and if it is pointed out to him that he can earn a better living and lead a better life here than elsewhere, it will be of great help in keeping him at home.</P>
    <P>With regard to vocational education, I do want to thank the Minister for the special extra grant which has been given to some western countries this year.  Donegal has benefited to a great extent from this grant.  In view of the great necessity for vocational education in the West of Ireland we are doubly grateful to the Minister for having agreed to our request in this respect.  Technical education is very necessary in the West of Ireland, especially in subjects such as engineering, metal work, rural science, building, and so on.  There is a most useful scheme in progress in Donegal and other counties in the matter of building construction.  The teacher cooperates with the people of a given district in building.  He is available to people who want to build new houses. He draws plans for them.  He supervises the building.  He brings them together in night classes and has a discussion on the remainder of the work to be done, whether it is a new house, a reconstruction job or the building of byres, outhouses and so on.  Unfortunately, we find that there is a shortage of these teachers.  We cannot get as many as we would like. I would urge that the training of such teachers and also the training of <Col N="204" /> teachers in rural science should be increased.</P>
    <P>We have in Donegal with our committee three teachers of building construction. Not alone does this course teach boys to build and to do carpentry work, but it is the best system of self-help and do-it-yourself that I know because under the supervision of the building constructor, they do the work themselves and they contribute greatly to the economic development of our country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I was surprised but gratified to know that between the ages of 14 years and 16 years, two-thirds of our pupils receive further education.  It is certainly an answer to the doleful litanies of woes and evils that we hear to find that the cynics and those other people who are no advantage to the country are again wrong.  That is something I am glad to learn.  I did not have figures before but having further advanced education for two-thirds of our pupils who are actually availing of it is something good and something which will bear fruit.  The time will come&mdash;and it is coming rapidly&mdash;when that happy state of affairs will be further improved.</P>
    <P>The building of extra vocational schools throughout the country will help in that respect.  The tendency nowadays&mdash;it is one with which I agree&mdash;is to build the bigger type of technical school which has got at least four rooms and four teachers catering for cookery, commerce, woodwork and rural science.  I think that any school of a smaller size than that is not of full advantage to the rural districts, but then again vocational committees are faced with this problem that they cannot place such four-roomed schools in all districts where it is desirable to have them.</P>
    <P>The result is that even when we have gone a good way towards providing vocational education, very many districts will be left without technical schools.  It will be possible, say, to build only one technical school for each ten or 12 national schools, so that the Minister should consider some way of making technical education available in every district, whether by <Col N="205" /> means of temporary, cheap buildings, or by subsidising the itinerant teacher which the vocational schools have because I feel that most of our children should have the opportunity, after leaving the national school, of attending either a secondary or a vocational school.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department of Education are to be congratulated upon the work of the past year.  From the figures by the Minister, we can look forward to further and better development during the year ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In the field of education apropos discussions in the Legislature, one must inevitably accept the fact that the views to be expressed must be either Party views or individual views.  I think it would be only fair to say that while all Parties in the House must agree upon the fundamental importance of our educational system at all levels and that the best possible should be done to achieve the greatest results at every one of those levels, nevertheless, it must be accepted that individual views from time to time, while they may be severely critical, may, nevertheless, bring some good or sponsor some idea, the implementation of which will have a result that can be regarded as an advantage.</P>
      <P>Since the Estimate last year, I notice with regret that neither the Minister, the Government nor the Department have thought it either fit or proper to direct their minds to this problem of a section of the pensioned class of teachers.  I say this, first, because I regard it as something terribly important, not alone for the persons concerned&mdash;I am referring to the pre-1950 pensioned teachers&mdash;but to their families and to existing teachers.  The treatment of these people is something that cannot help but have a bad effect on the morale generally of the people who devote themselves to this very high vocation of teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be well, as I said, I think last year, that the Minister and the Government should remember that at the time these men and women were bearing the brunt of educating the children of this country, they did not confine themselves merely to what they <Col N="206" /> were actually paid, and badly paid, for at the time, but they kept nationality alive in this country during those difficult years.  That is something which should not be forgotten.  That now ever-diminishing band of men and women are, I think, the only section of the ex-teaching community that remains dissatisfied.  I think it is something that the Government Party, even at a Party meeting of their own, should bring forward and press to the fullest possible extent to see that it is brought about.  It will not cost very much.  I should prefer to see the building of one or even two schools per year deferred in order to meet the requirements of these people who have given so much and are now being given so little.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cunningham about the position regarding retarded children.  I shall not refer to the mentally deficient children or children suffering from some sort of mental aberration, either permanent or temporary. I am referring simply to the retarded children, those whose development is late.  I concede straight away that the reduction of overcrowding in classes will help to meet this problem in some way, but not altogether.  It is one to which the Department should direct attention.  With regard to the care and education of mentally deficient children, I do not think too high a tribute can be paid to the Brothers of St. John of God for their tremendous efforts, voluntary efforts, in that field.</P>
    <P>From year to year, I have had occasion to mention the facilities available to teacher - trainees in the Primary Branch.  I said last year that I did not approve of the preparatory college system.  I think it is too narrow and too confined.  It prevents the teacher being what every one of us would desire.  I advocate again strongly that, while the mechanics of teaching can be left comfortably to the actual training college, the teachers being trained&mdash;in Dublin, at any rate&mdash;should be given the opportunity of attending some university courses.</P>
    <P>The amounts allocated this year over the various fields, including building, are very encouraging.  That shows a certain amount of improvement, but it must not be forgotten that, from the <Col N="207" /> point of view of school building and of salaries, the rising cost of materials on the one hand and the rising cost of living on the other hand, are reflected in those increases.</P>
    <P>I appeal again that when school grounds and school sites are being selected, an effort should be made to have them as large as possible, with a view to the provision of facilities for games within the school ground itself. Some Deputy said yesterday that the school sites were too big.  I do not think so.  There is nothing which can look as miserable, even from an aesthetic point of view, in the countryside, as a little school almost hemmed in, with a wall built around it enclosing the site itself.</P>
    <P>I notice an improvement in that respect, but there is room for still further improvement.  The true basis of a successful education is the happy child.  Once we are able to start off with that premise, with the correct surroundings inside and outside the school, of course, with suitable teachers, progress inevitably must be made.</P>
    <P>In regard to the suitability of teachers, I notice from time to time that questions are raised, here and outside, about teachers who appear to have overstepped the mark in respect of corporal punishment and who have found themselves in court and even decreed.  I am very happy to say that, in my experience&mdash;as I am sure it is the experience of everyone&mdash;these persons are very rare and they occupy very isolated positions.  In that respect, it is very difficult to pick out the suitable teacher.  While very little chaff comes through, it could be prevented by allowing a particular person, at a later stage in life than 14 years of age, to select his vocation.  At that early age, no child knows what he wants to be. If they were given more generally an opportunity to decide, in coming from secondary schools by more or less open competition, there would be less danger of producing the undesirable type of teacher.</P>
    <P>I have two complaints regarding texts.  As to texts generally they <Col N="208" /> change too frequently and the cost is so great that that change, every year or every second year, can be quite a burden on the average family.  I see no reason why certain attention should not be paid to the production of a standard text which would last at least for a number of years for the average schoolgoing family, so that the books could be handed down from year to year.  The changes are so frequent and so violent that it is a burden on those who have to buy these books.</P>
    <P>In particular, reference has been made to the teaching of history in national schools.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan made a strong complaint about some teacher who had only two heroes in modern Irish history.  That would be a rare case.  I come from a constituency where political feelings run as high as anywhere else and I certainly have no complaint to make about any national teacher in the whole of North Mayo, about the use of the school as a political platform.  I do not think that any teachers who support my side of the House could be similarly accused by anybody opposite. It was probably an isolated case.  However, the history as written is not in conformity with the advice given by Stephen Gwynne on one occasion, that history, to reach its proper objective, must be written truthfully as well as charitably.  I do not think that obtains in the history texts now in use in our schools.</P>
    <P>Apropos the refresher courses mentioned by the Minister, these are extremely useful.  I should like to see an additional course instituted for those married women who have come back into teaching life, after perhaps ten or 15 years' absence.  The regulation was imposed around 1936, that is, some 23 years ago.  Some of them have been out of teaching for that time.  In my respectful submission, if they were actively engaged in the pursuits of bringing up a family and keeping house, they would by now have reached the state of being almost totally untrained, and I do think that a refresher course of some kind should be instituted, if not made obligatory, for them.</P>
    <P>Television has been mentioned by <Col N="209" /> Deputy Cunningham and there is no doubt that as an educational medium, it could be excellent.  There are arguments for and against, provided one can keep the pupils to the actual educational hours that are being used. In that respect, I think the whole matter is very clearly dealt with in the 1957 publication of the United States of America entitled &ldquo;Education and Communication.&rdquo;  I think that television as an educational medium would probably be most effective in a levelling as it were, of the country.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made during the course of the debate yesterday evening, about the proportion of religious and lay teachers in secondary schools, and particular reference was made by Deputy Sean Flanagan to the Diocesan colleges.  I, as a past pupil of a Diocesan college, and as one who has been in close touch with it and similar institutions, do not believe that that complaint can be made against them. There was a suggestion that the religious part of the staffs was untrained. They are trained as any other secondary teachers, unless the reference is to the older men, those who had not the advantage of what Deputy Dillon described in very derisive terms, the Higher Diploma in Education.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon.  I think the Higher Diploma is a fraud and is being used as a medium of fraud.  It is now a vested interest from many points of view.  I spent a year doing that course.  I may not have been a particularly brilliant student in that respect but, in any event, I qualified for a Higher Diploma.  I am glad to say that widsom prevailed and I never had it conferred, which might have been of some advantage at certain stages. However, I do not think so, and I believe that qualification has been sought for the material advantage that follows its acquisition.  I believe that training in voice production in schools is very important.  I mentioned this subject last year and I understand that certain educational institutions in this country have, for some time past, adopted the use of wire recorders in order to play back people's own voices so that they can learn from the play-back where their defects are, and how they can be remedied and improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> I shall not say anything, one way or another, about the Irish language.  I made up my mind last year that, when the Gaeltacht had been grossly insulted, I would just watch the course that things were taking.  I have no time for hypocrisy in that line of country, the kind of hypocrisy as was recently evidenced in an attack made on a professional young lady in Carna in County Galway, a nurse, because she was English and did not understand Irish.  One wanted to know which was the greater crime, and I am very glad that the people of Carna, who were more closely associated with her than the person who attacked her, came to her assistance.  As long as that hypocrisy and that narrow-mindedness exists, there is no hope of progress, and as long as people think that the people of the Gaeltacht are fools and anything can be foisted upon them, you will make no progress either.  With those few remarks, I leave this subject of education.  I shall watch its progress and its many aspects as time goes on.</P>

Ach, mar sin féin, ní féidir liom labhairt ar gach aon rud a luadhadh san Tigh, inniú agus indé, i dtaobh oideachais.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to express to all Deputies my appreciation of the objective manner in which they approached the debate and in which they made contributions and suggestions. Many of these dealt with topics that have been discussed here down through the years.  Some of them have been attended to but there are some which, unfortunately, have not been attended to.  As far as I can, I shall deal with the main points raised during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think one of the subjects to which most Deputies referred was the efficacy of the teaching of Irish, particularly in the national schools, and the progress made in the restoration of the Irish language as a result.  In <Col N="211" /> my opening remarks, I did say that since a Commission had been set up to look into the problem, I would not deal with it at any length.  However, I think it is due to the Deputies who have spoken that I say something a little more extensive now than I did in my opening speech.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can deny that there has been a lot of progress made in the extension of the knowledge of the Irish language throughout the country.  I am firmly convinced that more people know Irish now than did 25 or 30 years ago.  It may be that more people are not as well able to use the language as the people in those days.  By comparison, I believe that the people who knew Irish, 25 or more years ago, knew it because in many cases they learned it as the mother tongue, the language of their homes and, in many other cases, because they learned it purely for the love of the language.  It is true that many people who know Irish now know it because it was part of the curriculum in the national and secondary schools.  I do not intend to refer to the compulsory aspect of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon chided me that perhaps I would trot out the rule governing the teaching of the language in the national schools but I think that is so well known now that I need not refer to it to any extent.  However, there is a great volume of opinion behind the manner in which Irish is taught in the national schools at the present time, particularly from the point of view of teaching Irish and through Irish at an early age.  There is expert opinion available on that aspect of the subject, that is, that at the early age of entry to the schools, children's minds are more receptive, particularly for the purpose of learning a language, than at any other stage in their lives.</P>
    <P>I do not hold entirely with what Deputy Dillon said about there being no love now for the language amongst those who know it and occasionally use it.  It may be 25 or more years since he himself went to the different Gaeltachta in order to perfect his knowledge of the language.  In those days, <Col N="212" /> he did meet people who were there because they really wanted to learn Irish for the love of it, but there is a great volume of people attending summer courses in Gaeltacht areas who go there for the sheer love of it.  It would be stupid for me to deny that many of them go because their parents think that the extra knowledge they will acquire in these summer courses will enhance their prospects of doing well in school examinations and in after life, but many of them go because they are sons and daughters of parents who have an innate love of the language apart from academic advancement.  Consequently, those young people will have that love of the language for the sake of the language itself.  There are still pioneers and disinterested people &mdash; disinterested from the point of view of gain or advantage by reason of their knowledge of the language&mdash;who go to the Gaeltacht areas and give their time voluntarily in order to spread a knowledge and love of the language amongst the younger generation.</P>
    <P>Much as we may criticise the results and much as we may be disappointed by the results, broadly speaking, I believe a foundation has been laid that will ensure the retention of the language as a living language.  All that is needed from the ordinary person who has had the opportunity of learning the language at school is a little more effort, a little more imposition on himself or herself of the moral obligation of playing his or her part in the revival.  I have said before on many occasions that even amongst people who are the severest critics of our language policy, I have yet to find one who, when faced with the question: &ldquo;Do you wish to see the Irish language die?&rdquo; will answer that he does.  At least there is that good-will for the restoration of the language; and I think with a little more than good-will, with a little bit of obligation and activity on the part of each of us to do what we can to spread a knowledge of the language, more can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that some other form of commission might be set up.  Deputy Palmer in particular mentioned that teachers and parents <Col N="213" /> with other interests might get together. The commission set up is reasonably representative of all the groups and all the opinions that might assist in coming to a reasonable series of recommendations. That commission has been broadened rather much.  It emanated from a debate initiated on a motion in the Seanad, which was put down by two Fine Gael Senators.  The intention of the Government at the time was to restrict the terms of reference to the examination of what further might be done in the schools to hasten the restoration of the language.  As a result of objections made by the Senators responsible for the motion and as a result of certain suggestions made by other groups, the terms of reference were widened, with the result that the composition of the commission itself had to be widened. Nevertheless, I understand that the intention is to work through subcommittees, each of which will have to examine and report on different aspects of the language.  In common with other Deputies, I hope that the commission's work will be expedited as far as possible and that when it does report, we will have some worthwhile recommendations in order to make better progress towards the goal we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, in particular Deputy Corish, suggested there should be a new approach to the language.  I do not know whether I can claim there is a new approach in the few reforms that have been effected in recent times. As far as I can achieve it, I shall try to direct more attention to the spoken language than to the written.  Already, as I announced during the debate on the Estimate last year, a decision has been taken to introduce the oral Irish test at the Leaving Certificate stage. That test will be initiated in the Leaving Certificate Examination in 1960.  I have been urged from many quarters to extend the test to the Intermediate Certificate and extend it further into the primary schools.  The Council of Education has already reported and recommended that the spoken language should be given more attention than the written language in the primary schools.  It will be my <Col N="214" /> intention to encourage the implementation of that recommendation as far as I can.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of the oral test in the Intermediate Certificate, that will be rather more difficult than in the case of the Leaving Certificate by reason of the far greater number of students who take the Intermediate Certificate.  However, it is only prudent and reasonable that we should wait to see what results will ensue from the introduction of the oral test at the Leaving Certificate stage. In the meantime, it will be my desire, as has been suggested by many Deputies, to have an approach to the language and the teaching of the language in the schools that will make it rather a subject to be looked forward to.  I believe we can achieve that.  I believe that the stressing of the oral teaching of the language will be instrumental in achieving that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy complained about the lack of reference in my opening speech to educational policy and what the future programme is likely to be.  I admit I did not prognosticate on what would happen in the future, but as far as the Deputy's complaint is concerned, I think he should have given more attention to what has been done in trying to implement the report of the Council of Education on primary education. I think the <i>sine qua non</i> of that report was the necessity for increasing the <i>quantum</i> of trained teachers.  Steps have been taken to achieve this.  The removal of the marriage ban, which does not need any further reference from me, has given us an increased number of trained teachers and will continue to retain in the service trained teachers who would otherwise be obliged to resign, or who, if they did not quite fully resign, would be retained on the staff only in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, the intention is to improve and extend the accommodation in St. Patrick's Training College, which is the only training college for male teachers in the country.  I have had discussions with the principal and staff of that college.  Side by side with the improvement in and the extension of <Col N="215" /> the actual building and accommodation facilities, there will, I hope, be an improvement in training methods, together with an extension in the scope of the training in those subjects that national teachers will be required to undertake in the future.  That has a direct bearing on what Deputy Lindsay has just said in relation to mentally retarded children.</P>
    <P>Unless classes can be reduced to a reasonable size, it will be very difficult for any teacher, no matter how good or proficient he may be, to give the proper attention to those pupils who are mentally retarded.  It has been calculated that some 20 per cent.&mdash;perhaps more&mdash;children are retarded in some degree from the point of view of their receptivity of education.  Up to now, the trend was, in those countries where research into this problem had reached an advanced stage, to segregate these mentally retarded children.</P>
    <P>Scotland has been particularly progressive in matters of educational research and there they have now come around to the idea that segregation is not the ideal.  I think that is a view with which most of us would be inclined to agree.  Segregation of children who are merely backward from the point of view of their capacity to receive education is not a good idea because such segregation tends to create a complex in those young people.  The problem of mentally retarded children&mdash;I am not at the moment dealing with mentally defective children&mdash;will, I think, best be solved by a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, steps are being taken in that direction.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the teaching of civics.  That is one of the recommendations made by the Council of Education.  They recommended that civics as such should not be taught as a separate subject but should be integrated in the teaching of other subjects&mdash;&ldquo;in association with other subjects&rdquo; were the actual words used. If the results we see are any indication of the effect of our teaching methods generally on our young people in an effort to make them better citizens, I <Col N="216" /> think we can take some pride in our teaching policy in that respect.  We have a plethora of voluntary associations engaging in all manner of activities at the present time.  These include associations to enhance rural life, to advance the restoration of the language, to educate people in music and other cultural activities.  That is a sign that our teaching in the schools on civics generally and our teaching of Irish are encouraging rather than retarding development.  Activities in relation to national, social and economic matters generally were never so widespread or so popular as they are to-day.  There is evidence, therefore, that our teaching methods are bearing fruit generally and giving the results we expect from them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the teaching of manners and correct speaking in the schools.  It should not be necessary for me to repeat what has so often been pointed out: the teaching of manners and of correct speaking is primarily a matter for parents.  Behaviour towards brothers and sisters and neighbours is something the children should learn in their own homes.  The teachers can enhance that training, but, unless the ground work is there, no teacher, irrespective of how proficient he or she may be, can instil good manners, correct speaking and citizenship into his or her pupils.</P>
    <P>I have been struck by some remarks made to me by strangers visiting our country.  The latest experience I had in that respect was no later than last week.  I met the fraternal delegate of the Welsh Teachers' Organisation at the teachers' congress in Youghal. He commented upon the manner in which he was met by young people whom he stopped in the streets to ask for directions and local history.  He said that not only did they speak well but they treated him with the utmost courtesy.  He is a teacher of many years' standing and he expressed his admiration for that aspect of our teaching here which was reflected in the behaviour of these young people whom he met casually.</P>
    <P>Comparisions are sometimes made between the standard of education of <Col N="217" /> our children and the standard of children on the Continent of Europe and elsewhere.  My experience has been that those who go abroad with their families find that, age for age, their children are in advance of those in whose classes they find themselves in foreign countries.  That is the general experience and those who decry our standards of education and suggest that, age for age, our children are less well educated speak without any real knowledge or experience of the true position.</P>
    <P>With regard to speech and voice production and the necessity for education along these lines, I have referred to these aspects of education on a number of occasions.  I recently made inquiries as to what attention is given to these in the training of teachers and I was glad to note that due care and attention are given to them.  Nevertheless, as a nation, we speak rather carelessly.  We do not give sufficient attention to correct pronunciation. I believe that by and large throughout the country we have accents that not only enhance the speaking of Irish but the speaking of English as well.  We should give more attention to correct pronunciations, the sounding of the &ldquo;th&rdquo; and clarity of diction generally.  If we do, that reputation we have in certain parts of the country for speaking the best English in the world will extend rapidly all over the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the teaching of history and they referred to the manner in which the text books were written.  Deputy Dillon referred to a particular text book which he found in one newsagent's shop.  I had enquiries made, so far as I could, on the information given by Deputy Dillon in his speech about the passage to which he objected, and I find that text book is certainly not on <Col N="218" /> the Department's approved list.  There is of course freedom of choice in secondary schools&mdash;all of them being privately owned&mdash;in the matter of text books but my experience is that due care is given there to the type and standard of text books.</P>
    <P>The publishing companies, here at any rate, encourage national teachers themselves to write the text books. The publishing companies attend every congress or gathering of teachers and display their range of text books on the different subjects for the teachers' benefit.  In doing that I am told they advise the teachers themselves to pay more attention to the compiling and writing of the subject matter of these books.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have too frequent changes of the school texts.  Certainly, in the national schools, the Department encourages the retention of texts as long as possible and as long as is feasible from the educational point of view.  Generally, I think managers of schools and teachers respond to that request in so far as it is consistent with the interests of education and the financial interests of the parents of the pupils.  We all know that in secondary schools the texts are unchanged year after year.  Text books I myself used over 25 years ago are, I find, still in the secondary schools with perhaps, in some cases, minor modifications and alterations where such proved necessary.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is opportune to refer to complaints made about the failure of the Department of Education to give grants to applicants for the printing and publishing of certain publications. The Department of Education has no set rule governing the issue of these grants.  Every application to the Department is treated on its merits from the point of view of the value the publication represents to the language, its circulation and its subject matter.  Only a limited amount of money is available for that purpose.  The particular publication to which Deputy Sherwin referred is unfortunately not the only one to which we found it impossible to make an advance to subsidise publication. There are others; but the personality of the printer does not <Col N="219" /> matter.  Rather, it is the subject-matter and the value that it has, its potential circulation and its prospect of enhancing knowledge of the language.  These are the guides and tests which determine whether or not a grant should be given.  I should like to assure Deputy Sherwin that the person who asked him to raise the matter of his unsuccessful application is not the only person in that position.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the possibility of raising the school leaving age.  I am glad that Deputy Cunningham remarked on my statement that two-thirds of those reaching the age of 14 in national schools receive further education up to the age of 16.  We hear criticism, frequently, from people who should know better, that too many after the age of 14 receive no further education.  We have heard that percentage put as high as 90.  That is completely untrue and statements such as that are completely unfounded.  People who make these comparisons, I generally find, take the percentage of those who reach the age of 14 in the national schools and compare that number with the total of half a million students attending national schools.  They find that it is about 10 per cent. and then they say the remaining 90 per cent. receive no further education.</P>
    <P>The fact is that many national schools have classes up to the age of 18 and those who attend up to the age of 14 continue up to 15, 16 or 17. Other national schools have what are known as &ldquo;Secondary Tops&rdquo; and we have also the number going into the vocational and the secondary schools.  It is these numbers taken together, those who continue after 14 in the national schools, those in &ldquo;Secondary Tops&rdquo; and those who go to the vocational and secondary school, that should be compared with the total number of children reaching the age of 14 in order to get the true percentage of those continuing to receive further education beyond 14.  I hope the attention drawn to this matter during this debate will cause those who make fallacious arguments to cease making them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to modern <Col N="220" /> languages and the necessity for greater attention to them in our schools.  I have every sympathy with his point of view and I have given public expression to it on a number of occasions.  I hope we shall be able to go some way to meet his suggestion, though not exactly as he made it, with regard to the recognition of people native of certain countries in the teaching of the languages of these countries in our secondary schools.  Recent discussions I have had with representatives of the secondary teachers will, I hope, bring about an improvement in that respect and that there will be an encouragement for those who wish to perfect their accents in modern European languages so that they can better teach them in our secondary schools.  I have also encouraged people interested in foreign trade and those interested in the tourist trade to give better support to modern language classes which are available in most of our vocational educational schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett complained about the closing of the industrial school in Cork.  I share his feeling of regret that it was necessary to close this school but as he knows these schools are conducted largely by religious communities. They are voluntary schools even though they receive capitation grants for those under their care and if they decide to close down the school, there is nothing I or anybody else can do about it, except in so far as those who are entrusted to their care must be accommodated elsewhere and, under the Children Act of 1908, there is power in me to authorise their transfer.</P>
    <P>I want to assure him there is no question whatever of ignoring parental rights in the case of children who had been detained in Greenmount Industrial School in Cork.  Every effort was made to ensure that those who were resident, or whose parents were resident in and around Cork would be transferred and were transferred to the Upton Industrial School.  For some reasons, it was not possible to notify the individual parents of the transfers and, in that respect, I have to take the explanation offered by those who <Col N="221" /> conduct the school and understand the problems better than I do.  The circumstances were such that it was not possible or feasible to advise the parents, but, in saying that, I want to assure the Deputy there was no intention whatever of ignoring parental rights or of being in any way unmindful of the care and concern parents would naturally have for their children who were for the time being inmates of industrial schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay, and other Deputies, referred to the necessity for ensuring that those who undertake teaching as a profession should have a vocation for it.  While those who go to preparatory colleges may not be mature enough at that stage to know whether or not they have a vocation for teaching, they have not crossed the Rubicon. They follow the normal Leaving and Intermediate Certificate courses in those colleges and if, at the end of their term, the authorities of those colleges find the boys unsuitable, a report is made accordingly and the boys are advised not to proceed to the training college.  In the meantime, they have had the advantage of receiving a secondary education and a secondary education of the highest standard, in many cases.  Some of them have possibly received a secondary education they would not otherwise have got.</P>
    <P>However, I want to assure Deputies that a high degree of attention is paid to the suitability of those who attend and pursue courses in preparatory colleges for entry to training colleges. As I intimated recently, there is a slight alteration in the tests set for those about to enter those colleges. Everybody knows the vast majority of these are based on the competitive results of the school Leaving Certificate. Not only will they be required from now on to get a sufficiently high standard of the marks allocated but also they will be required to go before a selection committee who, so far as we can achieve it, are well qualified to assess the potential of each applicant for training to ensure that he is suitable material and that he will not be a square peg in a round hole.  That is a departure and an innovation which will make for the avoidance of people <Col N="222" /> pursuing teaching as a career who are not ideally suited for it.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need refer in detail to any other aspects of the debate.  I want to assure Deputies who made other points that these points have all been carefully noted and that any suggestions they made which are workable and worthwhile will be given the appropriate attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies who have commented favourably on the Department of Education over the years and particularly over the past few years.  I do not wish to indulge in any extravagant statements about the qualities of the permanent officials of the Department.  It would be easy for me to say they are the best to be found in any Department or in any similar Department in Europe, but I can certainly assure the House that I have no cause for complaint in the quality and the intensity of the work those officials are prepared to engage in in the interests of education.  I want to dispel, if I can, the suggestion that the officials of the Department of Education are in some ways hidebound in their approach to educational problems. Any Minister for Education who will be the political head of the Department will find a ready sympathy for the objective examination of whatever point of view he may have and a reasonable flexibility in the official Departmental approach to each and every educational problem.  I am glad that the tributes have been paid to the Department and on their behalf I am happy to acknowledge them.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £67,800 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the <Col N="225" /> 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, including certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle and if it is agreeable to the House, to follow the practice of previous years and to deal with the Votes for which the Minister for Justice is responsible, namely Nos. 26 to 34, as a group so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise any particular point on a particular Vote.</P>
    <P>Taking the group of Estimates together, they show an increase of about £185,000 of which £151,000 is accounted for by the increase in the provision that has had to be made for police pensions.  The upward trend in the expenditure on such pensions is likely to continue for some years to come as there are over 3,000 members of the Force with sufficient service to enable them to retire on pension whenever they wish.  The remaining £34,000 is accounted for almost entirely by increases in remuneration.</P>
    <P>As regards Vote 26, that is to say, the Vote for my own Office, practically all of the amount asked for is required to meet the salaries of the staff.  There is little or nothing else in the Vote.  The estimated expenditure is much the same as last year, but I have had to ask for a little more because of the general increase in Civil Service remuneration and because there are some normal incremental increases that have to be met. The Department of Justice is responsible for the administration and business generally of the public services in connection with law, justice, public order and police and has, besides, to administer miscellaneous statutes of great importance to the public such as those which deal with nationality and citizenship, aliens, betting, censorship, the licensing laws, adoption and so on.  In what follows I shall touch very briefly on some of these matters.</P>
    <P>To begin with the matter of adoption, during 1958 the Board made 592 adoption orders, 273 in respect of <Col N="226" /> boys and 319 in respect of girls.  I cannot speak too highly of the voluntary, unpaid services of the members of this Board.  I feel sure the House would wish to share with me in this commendation.</P>
    <P>The number of aliens registered with the police as permanent residents is 3,028, an increase of about 200 over the previous year.  Deputies are aware, of course, that British subjects, generally, are exempt from registration and there are no immigration barriers between this country and Britain and Northern Ireland.  At our ports some 35,000 foreign visitors landed for holiday or business purposes and close on 10,000 more came to us via British ports.  As far as possible, consistent with the requirements of the aliens laws, the policy has been to facilitate the admission of foreigners and the immigration restrictions are gradually being reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The Film Censor's return of films dealt with during 1958 was circulated to the press last January.  It shows that 1,085 films were certified as fit for exhibition in public, 239 films were passed with cuts and 55 films were rejected; of 32 appeals against the Censor's refusal to grant a certificate, the Appeal Board upheld his decision in 29 cases and varied his decision in two cases by allowing the film to be exhibited with cuts.</P>
    <P>Then there is censorship of publications. During 1958 the Censorship of Publications Board examined 1,072 publications and made 624 prohibition orders; 127 of these Orders were in respect of periodical publications and 497 were in respect of books but 177 of the latter figure were in respect of books already prohibited that had been reissued under new titles or in different editions.  The Censorship of Publications Appeal Board heard eight appeals.  They granted one appeal in respect of a book and one in respect of a periodical publication.</P>
    <P>As regards citizenship, Irish citizenship was conferred on 59 persons during 1958 by the grant of certificates of naturalisation.  This brings the total <Col N="227" /> number of persons naturalised under the 1935 and 1956 statutes to 1,754.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I receive, in the course of every year, a great number of petitions for the remission or mitigation of the punishment imposed in particular cases by courts exercising criminal jurisdiction.  All of these have got to be examined, reports obtained and the advice of the trial judge or justice sought; and this involves a great mass of work.  In most cases the petitions have to be rejected in the end, but this is not done without the most careful consideration.</P>
    <P>There is one class of petition that, in the absence of any evidence of a miscarriage of justice, I have normally no hesitation in rejecting and that is a petition for the removal of driving disqualification that has been imposed for drunken driving.  There were 115 such petitions last year all of which were rejected.  It may be that there is no connection between drunken driving and road accidents but, in any case, it is gratifying to be able to record that the number of deaths in road accidents in 1958 was lower than the number in 1957 which, in turn, was lower than that of the year before. Still, there were no fewer than 268 deaths on the roads last year, some of which, it is safe to say, might have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care.  I can only hope that one day the public conscience will be so shocked by this unnecessary loss of life that every one of us who has reached the age of reason will make it a point of honour so to use the roads as not to be a danger to himself or others.</P>
    <P>I may add that during the year my Department was engaged on the examination and the formulation of proposals for legislation in relation to the licensing laws, rent control, adoption of children, penal reform, charities, administration of estates, solicitors and the Courts of Justice.</P>
    <P>The foregoing remarks in relation to the Vote for my own Office concern its routine activities but before I pass on to the next Vote I have a word to say about the activities of unlawful organisations.  In July, 1957, it became necessary to invoke the powers of <Col N="228" /> Part II of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, and to intern a number of persons who were engaged in activities that were injurious to the security of the State. The detention of persons without trial is a step to be justified only by the existence of a grave emergency and for so long as the emergency exists.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, all of those who have been detained have now been released but it should not be supposed that this is because of any change in the Government's position with respect to the organisations in question. Rather is it the result of their considered view that, for the time being, the measures taken in 1957 and 1958 have served their purpose.  Speaking for myself, I have no doubt at all that the temporary detention of those concerned has effectively prevented them from endangering the lives of others and risking their own in the pursuit of activities that are no less futile than unlawful.  But I should like to repeat what the Taoiseach said a few weeks ago; that the Government will not hesitate to use all the means at their disposal to ensure that there is no usurpation of their authority and to prevent unlawful activities of a kind which, if they were allowed to go on unchecked, would be likely to lead to a situation here which must be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Vote, No. 27, is, from the financial point of view, the most important of those for which I am responsible and this year I have had to ask for £155,000 more than last year.  As I have already explained, the bulk of this is due to the additional provision that has had to be made for Police Pensions but the fact that extra police have had to be provided for service on the Border has contributed to the increase in costs.</P>
    <P>In my remarks on this Vote you will expect me to say something about the prevalence of crime in the country but before I refer to the figures for last year, I should like to explain that the Annual Crime Report of the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, will in future&mdash;beginning with the Report for 1958&mdash;show a number of changes in the presentation of crime statistics. <Col N="229" /> These changes have been introduced, with my approval, as a result of a critical examination by the Commissioner of the various crime-tables heretofore compiled.  This examination showed that in many cases there was excessive classification of crimes, which served no useful purpose, whereas in a few cases additional classifications could, with advantage, be introduced.  The revised form of Annual Report is being compiled on the basis of a twelve-month period ending on 30th September instead of on the basis of a calendar year.  The principal reason for this is to enable the Report to be prepared before the Estimate for the Garda Síochána is introduced each year.  Heretofore, only provisional figures of crime for the preceding year were available to the House when discussing the Estimate, and indeed there used to be an unavoidable delay of up to a year in the preparation and publishing of the final Report.</P>
    <P>With regard to the most recent crime figures, I would first of all repeat that they relate to the twelve-month period ending on 30th September, and the three months' overlap must be borne in mind in the comparison with the crime figures for the calendar year 1957.</P>
    <P>The 1958 figures, I regret to say, show that the upward trend in indictable crime that has been manifest since 1955 has continued.  Indictable crimes for the year numbered 16,567, which was an increase of 2,530 or 18 per cent. over 1957.  Most of the increase was under the head of larceny, the figure for which increased from 9,842 to 11,766, an increase of 1,924 or 20 per cent.  As in 1957, the most striking single figure in the analysis of this increase in larceny is the figure for larcenies of pedal cycles, which increased from 2,467 to 3,524&mdash; an increase of 1,057 or 43 per cent. This increase is all the more striking for the fact that the 1957 figure was itself over 800 higher than the figure for 1955 when the upward trend in crime began.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is almost inevitable that when larcenies increase, and particularly larcenies of pedal cycles, the <Col N="230" /> general detection rate will drop, for of all the common crimes none is more difficult to detect than the larceny of a bicycle.  It is, pre-eminently, a case where prevention is better than cure and where the preventive measures must necessarily depend on the owners rather than on the Garda Síochána. The Gardaí have been endeavouring, by various means, to ensure a greater awareness among the public of the need for preventive measures against larcenies generally.  If, for instance, we could prevail on cyclists to lock their bicycles as a matter of course when leaving them unattended, the number of larcenies would drop substantially. To illustrate the casual attitude of a great many cyclists, I would mention that, in the Dublin Metropolitan Division alone, approximately 3,000 missing bicycles have been taken into Garda stations in each of the last few years, and that of these no fewer than one in three were not claimed by the owners.  In their efforts to bring these points home to the public, the Gardaí have been greatly assisted by publicity given in newspapers to the need for such measures, and I am glad to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of this assistance.</P>
    <P>Though the increase in larcenies accounts for over five-sixths of the total increase in crime, there have also been increases in other kinds of offences against property, which, though numerically much smaller, cannot be ignored.  For instance burglaries and housebreakings and kindred offences increased by 19 per cent. from 2,895 to 3,459.</P>
    <P>Deputies may well ask: why this increase in the various classes of crime?  There is no single or easy answer.  The increase seems to be part of a world-wide crime wave. Several causes, no doubt, contribute to the increase in crime and most of them are probably outside the scope of the preventive operations of the police.  One thing that cannot be said is that the increase is due to the reduction in Garda strength which has been taking place in recent years.  It is in Dublin that there has been the greatest increase and in Dublin the Garda <Col N="231" /> strength has not been reduced at all; on the contrary, it has been increased. Nor have I heard that, taking one area with another, there has been any increase in crime in the localities where rural stations have been closed or reduced in strength as I certainly would have heard if this had happened.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one aspect of crime which has caused the public some concern.  I refer to the question of unsolved murders.  In the past few years there have been three murders that have not so far been cleared up. That this is disturbing is not to be denied, and I can assure the House that it is not a matter that is being taken lightly by the Garda authorities who are not only making sure that all three cases are still and will continue to be the subject of close and active attention, but also subjecting to critical examination all aspects of the investigation machinery.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I must also say, and emphasise, that there is no justification for suggestions that have been made that there is something radically wrong either with the Garda machine or with the policy of closing stations in certain areas that has been adopted in recent years, with the concurrence of my predecessor and myself.  Apart from those three cases which occurred in 1957 and 1958, the Garda record in the solution of murder cases has been exceptional.  In the ten years immediately preceding 1957, the record has been 100 per cent.  Whatever may be the reason for the interruption of this impressive sequence of successes, I am satisfied to leave it to the Garda authorities knowing, as I do, that it is a matter which is engaging their constant attention, to determine whether and in what way the methods of detection can be improved.</P>
    <P>I cannot dismiss the subject of crime without saying something about juvenile crime.  I should explain that this year I am not in a position to make an exact comparison between last year's figures and those of earlier years because the figures are no longer compiled by reference to an upper age limit of 18 as in former years but by reference to the age of 17.  For a <Col N="232" /> number of years, there has been little or no change in the volume of juvenile crime from year to year but I am sorry to say that, last year, there was a very sharp increase in juvenile crime of all kinds but, particularly, in the number of larcenies.  What the reason for this is I cannot say, but I have no doubt that it begins from lack of parental control; bad example and insufficient occupation are also no doubt contributory factors.  We can at least hope that the deterioration that has been evident in the past year will prove to be a passing phase.</P>
    <P>On the question of police establishments, the present strength of the Force, all ranks, is 6,479.  During the year 1958/59 400 recruits were enrolled in the Garda Síochána but notwithstanding this, the overall strength is still 1,000 less than it was about ten years ago.  The reduction in manpower and the closing of rural stations or their reduction in status have been counterbalanced by the greater use of motor cars and motor cycles and the use of radio equipment and it is intended to pursue this policy for some time to come.  It is hoped, eventually, to reduce the Force to about five and a half thousand men.  It is expected that vacancies will occur during the year from the usual causes&mdash;deaths, resignations and dismissals&mdash;to the number of 430 and it is proposed that recruits to the number of 450, including 18 women, be appointed.  A competition for the appointment of women police has been held by the Civil Service Commissioners and it is expected that, having completed their period of training, our first women police will take up duty in Dublin and Cork towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Vote for Prisons, apart from remuneration, is due to the increased cost of feeding the prisoners and maintenance of prison buildings and to expenditure on the prison cottages at Portlaoise.  It will be observed that provision is being made for a daily average of 385 prisoners or slightly fewer than last year.  Since the Estimate was framed, the daily average of the prison population has gone up and averaged 423 in the first quarter of this year.  This, perhaps, is hardly <Col N="233" /> surprising in view of the crime situation and the remarkable thing is that, notwithstanding the upward trend in crime since 1955, the daily average population has been so low.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may ask what we have been doing in the field of penal reform.  Our resources do not permit of experimentation to any large degree and the numbers of prisoners under sentence are too limited to permit of diverse classifications.  Moreover, most prisoners are not long enough in custody for any training or rehabilitation measures to take effect.  Last year only fifteen prisoners were committed to serve sentences of over two years; in each of the preceding two years the figure was only nine.  Last year there were, on average, only eight young offenders serving sentences of Borstal detention.  Sixty per cent of the prisoners committed receive sentences of less than three months, from which a remission of one-quarter is allowed in most cases.  However, the House will shortly have an opportunity of discussing the question of penal reform on a Bill dealing with certain limited aspects of the problem which I expect to introduce shortly.</P>
    <P>Votes 29, 30 and 31 are concerned with the services of the Courts.  There has been little change in any of these Estimates.  In the case of the District Court increased provision has had to be made for the salaries of the Justices who have been appointed on a temporary basis to obviate the necessity for making permanent appointments pending a reduction by five in the number of District Court Districts &mdash;and a consequential reduction in the number of Justices&mdash;which it is hoped to effect before the end of the year.  In the case of the Circuit Court, there has been practically no change at all and the increased provision for the Supreme Court and High Court is mainly due to increased remuneration.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Vote for the Land Registry is due, apart from remuneration, to the necessity for creating four additional posts in the mapping branch to tackle the problem of the maps that have become worn out as a result of constant handling and require to be renewed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> Vote 33, Public Record Office, calls for no comment and with regard to Vote 34, I need say no more about the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests than that both the Minister for Justice and the public are under great obligations to the Commissioners for doing unpaid work of the greatest value to the community and that, speaking for myself, I am glad to take this opportunity to acknowledge that debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I do the Minister any injustice when I say with regard to the speech he has given to us this year that it is very much the same as last year's.  Certainly, the outstanding matters are merely a repetition of what had to be expressed and what had to be exposed to the Dáil this time last year.</P>
      <P>In the first place, remuneration is up.  I mean, the cost of the Department, of the various groups for which the Minister is responsible, is up and this is mainly due to the fact that extra moneys had to be provided by way of salaries or by way of pensions to staff.  This is, in other words, part of the repercussion of the Government's own proposals with regard to finance during the last couple of years.  It is to be hoped that some day we will get away from this cycle: that there is an increase in salaries to bring certain people up to the levels that they once had and the levels they once had is getting back to 1929.  After that, there are financial measures which raise the cost of living in the country; then there are agitation and efforts at conciliation and arbitration and, finally, again after months in which the salary has lagged behind the increase in the cost of living, a new Vote, with added remuneration and, therefore, a new Estimate, which indicates that these things have been brought about in a particular way and that humanity alone demands, apart from justice, that some addition should be made to the salaries of the various officials both in the Department, the Courts, the provincial offices and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing that is up is crime. Indictable crime, according to the Minister, is up.  For the year indictable <Col N="235" /> crimes numbered 16,567&mdash;an increase of 2,500 odd over 1957 and an 18 per cent. increase over the previous year. This time last year when the Minister was speaking he told us he himself had been shocked to find the number of indictable offences was increased over the previous year by 12 per cent.  So that, not merely is there an increase, but the rate of increase has accelerated during the year.  There was a 12 per cent. increase on the previous year. Now we have got an 18 per cent. increase on the figure which had been increased by 12 per cent. in comparison with the year before.  That is certainly not a situation that anybody can regard with complacency.</P>
    <P>The greater number of these crimes concern larcenies, burglaries and housebreakings.  The Minister says it is not easy to say what is the cause of this.  While there has been an increase in crime all over the world, there has been a steady inclination to associate two things together&mdash;crime, unemployment and under-employment.  It happens that there are people in some sort of employment who do not get anything like the remuneration they believe and it is not big enough to spread over the pleasures they seek.</P>
    <P>With regard to juvenile crime, I do not know whether that has been linked with anything so often as it has been linked with unemployment.  In this country last month before a particular society a lecturer said that juvenile crime was linked with unemployment: &ldquo;Were it not for the thousands of youths who by reason of unemployment emigrated from Ireland each year the problem of delinquency would be much more serious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The earlier part of the Minister's statement was taken up, first of all, with the increase in pensions and the necessity for making provision for an increase in police pensions.  In addition to that as far as the Minister's own office is concerned the main amount asked for in the way of an addition is to meet the salaries of the staff. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is little or nothing else in the Vote.  The estimated expenditure is much the same as last year, <Col N="236" /> but I have had to ask for a little more because of the general increase in Civil Service remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister has to make the ordinary preface to this remark by referring to the necessity for increased remuneration.  Of course, the Minister can think himself of what has brought about the necessity for those increases.</P>
    <P>The Department's duties are set out by the Minister earlier in his speech. Administration and business generally of the public services fall to him in connection with law, justice, public order and police.  In addition to that, he has to administer the various statutes which deal with nationality and citizenship, aliens, betting, censorship and so on.  The Minister then details what the Department has done or propose to do under some of those heads.</P>
    <P>One of the things to which I do not think he referred was the question of the licensing laws.  There was a report by a commission many months ago.  The Minister gave no hint at all as to when it is likely that any proposals founded on the commission's report may be brought before the House for deliberation.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to give us some hint.  The commission's report has been circulated to people interested for the purpose of getting their remarks on the amendments.  I should be very glad to know how far these inquiries have gone on and whether the Department are in a position shortly to answer that legislation is under preparation to bring about amendments which are circulated.  I do not say that all the amendments which the commission have proposed will be accepted by the House or by the Government but that there is room for amendment in the licensing laws and the administration of these laws is beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>With regard to film censorship and the censorship of publications, the figures the Minister has given are of interest.  I hope they will be observed by the public, particularly those with regard to appeals.  There seems to me to be an amazing bit of confusion about the law relating to the censorship of publications.  There is prevalent <Col N="237" /> in some quarters the belief that a person's house might be searched in order to discover a banned book.  That is not the case.  What is prevented under the censorship of publications legislation is the sale or something that is a sale even though it might be pretended to be an exchange of books as between individuals.  There is considerable apprehension among members of the public in regard to this matter that even the possession of a book which has come under the ban of the censorship is an offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one class of petition he has consistently rejected is the petition for the removal of a driving disqualification as imposed for drunken driving.  I do not know whether the Minister wants us to take his words strictly, that he has rejected petitions for the removal of a driving disqualification. One sees from time to time in the papers mitigation of penalties in connection with drunken driving. The Minister mentions that he rejects all petitions for the removal of a driving disqualification.  That is one thing.  He will certainly have to reconcile what he says with what is made known to the public with regard to the removal of certain other penalties in respect of driving and driving under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that there may be no connection between drunken driving and road accidents.  I do not know why he hesitates to say in a firmer way that there is a definite connection between drunken driving and road accidents.  That is beyond question.  I do not say that all drunken drivers eventually meet with road accidents or cause road accidents but quite a number of accidents on the roads are due to people who drive when their senses are somewhat dulled by reason of the fact that they have taken intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the public conscience being so shocked with the unnecessary loss of life that everyone would make it a point of honour so to use the roads that there would be no danger either to themselves or the public. The report will be made vigorously that the Minister's conscience should be so shocked that with his colleague, <Col N="238" /> the Minister for Local Government, he should see whether some change could be made in the law in regard to this matter of driving on the roads and the causes of accidents.</P>
    <P>In that connection it would be an education for the public if the Minister gathered together and revealed certain statistical information collected a couple of years ago.  On first view it is certainly astonishing when one reads about the number of cases where death has been caused by the driving of mechanically propelled vehicles.  If one follows the cases that arise in regard to deaths caused on the roads, it is astonishing to see the results.  First of all, there is a screening of these particular cases by the law officers to decide whether the case is bad enough to be manslaughter or whether it is a question of careless or dangerous driving. A follow up of that reveals some striking facts.</P>
    <P>Even the limited number of cases sent forward under the heading of manslaughter have to be screened at a certain stage by the district courts.  It is astonishing again to find how few are the cases&mdash;these would be the bad cases&mdash;in respect of which informations are received in the early stage. The situation gets worse if the cases get through the district courts and are sent forward for trial.  Again, there is quite a number of cases in which the judge refuses to let the case go to the jury.  Finally, there is the number of cases when a jury gets hold of a manslaughter case and a verdict of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; is brought in.  In fact, it has been very definitely an exception to have a case of manslaughter brought home to an individual, even when death has occurred through the driving, or through something in the way of negligent driving of a motor car on the road.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a vast number of civil cases which arise from these accidents, in which damages are given against the party driving, and it is very seldom that the defendant gets off on the civil side.  However, the number of cases in which the law eventually gets hold of the offender, where death has been caused on the road, is very few indeed.  It is possibly <Col N="239" /> due to the standards which have been laid down in certain decided cases, in connection with the type of negligence required for a manslaughter verdict, having been raised too high.  In that way, it may not be easy to get judges to put cases before juries in such a way that the penalty the public think should follow would, in fact, follow. I would mention to the Minister that the statistics have been compiled only up to the period 1955-56, and that there is necessity for an improvement in that situation.  It would be for the public benefit to see the way the courts treat these cases of murder, or at least, death, on the roads.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to use whatever pressure he has in getting the Department of Local Government to see that the legislation on transport is hastened up, so that we might have a chance to let the public realise that care and consideration have been given to this matter, that efforts have been made to put an end to the heavy toll of life on our roads from year to year.  Legislation was in a practically completed form, with the exception of about three points left over for questioning, by the early part of 1957. Now, two years later, it does not appear as if any solution has been found to those few points which alone remained for official decision in connection with road transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that his Department was engaged in proposals for legislation in relation to the licensing laws.  We have not seen any result of that yet, nor have we seen anything in regard to rent control, the adoption of children, or penal reform. As I read this in the earlier stages of the Minister's brief, I was hoping to find him say that something was being done about penal reform; but skipping to the end of his speech, I think I can paraphrase it, without injustice to the Minister, by saying that nothing will be done about penal reform.  He thinks that there are some minor points of legislation which are to be brought in, dealing with some small points; but, as for the rest of it, it seems that we have not the diversification, so to speak, of crimes which <Col N="240" /> would warrant a proper analysis leading towards some scheme in the nature of a reform of the penal system.</P>
    <P>In regard to charities, the Minister says he has been engaged in the promotion of legislation.  This legislation was practically complete in 1956-57. One important point was left over then, which struck at the whole roots of the matter&mdash;that is, the definition of a charity.  Surely, two years was long enough a period in which at least to have that canvassed to the point at which proposals could be brought before the Dáil for its consideration, even without the proposals being pressed through.</P>
    <P>There was legislation in regard to the administration of estates, which was held up for quite a while by the Minister himself.  It got a very easy passage through the House.  It was quite a welcome piece of legislation, and it has improved the situation in regard to the administration of estates. I understand, however, that there is in the offing some other legislation, dealing with another aspect of that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has turned off the proposals in connection with solicitors. When are we to see the proposals on that point?  The Solicitors Act has been found lacking in constitutionality at a certain point, on the disciplining of solicitors.  The decision which was given on that point may, of course, have results or reactions far beyond the ranks of the solicitors' body.  The terminology used by the Courts, in describing the disciplinary section of the Solicitors Act as unconstitutional, went very far indeed. The matter has been brought inside the framework of the Constitution, inside one section which says that limited matters and functions of a judicial type may be handed over to people who are not judges under the Constitution and to be tried out in institutions which are not courts established under the Constitution.  In giving the decision of the Court on the Solicitors Act&mdash;the decision unfortunately has not been reported yet except through the newspapers&mdash;the phrase which the newspapers took up, and which I have verified as being in the judgment, said that anything that <Col N="241" /> touched on a man's life, liberty, property or reputation could not be regarded as a minor matter or dealing with a minor judicial function.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, quite an amount of other legislation is likely to be required in an effort to re-establish some sort of disciplinary control over a variety of bodies.  The solicitors themselves have been left without any chance of controlling the wayward members of their profession.  The Minister said last year that he had met a deputation from the Incorporated Law Society to discuss the matter and he said that he gave that deputation an assurance.  I quote from the Debates of the 16th April, 1958 Col. 233.  He gave the assurance that, as far as he was concerned, he would make every possible effort to see that the situation which had arisen as a result of the judgment would be dealt with as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>The Order Paper has carried, for many months past, legislative proposals which were introduced and certain amendments which were found to be required.  At one time, the Minister thought there was considerable urgency about this and wanted to have it law before the House rose for the summer recess last year.  He was being aided in that matter and there was a definite view prevalent in the House that the sooner it was rectified the better.  He cannot complain that there was obstruction or lengthy argument here.  There were some amendments suggested and in the matter which has remained there is an amendment in the name of Deputy J. A. Costello, which is still to be considered. In some way, the proposals became bogged down.  I ask the Minister to tell us what the obstruction is that he has found and when he thinks the obstruction will be overcome, so that legislation can be brought in and made efficient to deal with the situation which emerged.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has to examine and formulate proposals for legislation in relation to the courts of justice. There has not been any legislation in that matter.  Last year I raised a variety of matters and the Minister <Col N="242" /> when replying referred to some of them.  I am referring to the Minister's reply, as set out in col. 231 of the Official Debates for the 16th April, 1958.  I had asked about the simplification of court procedure and there was the question of the imposition of fines on the spot.  After that I asked about law reform and also dealt with the solicitors' matter.  I asked whether any report had been received from the Rule Making Committee and, if so, whether any suggestions had been made for the better administration of justice, such as the Court Rule Making Committees are supposed to recommend from time to time.  I then put forward the suggestion of having recording machines provided in the courts instead of the old system of evidence being taken down in long hand.  At col. 234 the Minister said he would investigate all these suggestions.</P>
    <P>I asked later that the court offices be kept open for business during the long vacation by staggering the holidays of the officials.  Again promises were made that the matter was being examined.  The Minister's speech today does not contain one word about those various proposals.  Perhaps he would be good enough to say whether they have been examined and, where they have been examined, whether they are thought of favourably or with sympathy.</P>
    <P>The Minister passed over, in a way which does not accord with the importance of the matter, the question of the release of all the people who were interned under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940.  He does say it had become necessary to intern a number of persons who were engaged in a number of activities that were injurious to the security of the State. One does expect a quotation from an Act from a Minister but, in fact, the Minister should phrase this more correctly by stating: &ldquo;A number of persons were interned who, in the Minister's opinion, were engaged in activities which, in his opinion, were injurious to the security of the State.&rdquo;  I am right, I think, in quoting that.  That is the wording of the operative section <Col N="243" /> of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940.  This was entirely a matter of the opinion of the Minister to operate.  It may not have been the Minister for Justice but I presume it was in this case.</P>
    <P>The detention of a person without trial is a step which can be justified by grave emergency and only as long as the emergency exists.  There are other ways of dealing with grave emergencies under The Offences Against the State Act.  There is the question, first of all, of dealing with the ordinary courts which had not broken down before the Minister took over control.  If the ordinary courts had broken down there are special courts that could be appointed.  Special personnel could be appointed to the special courts under the Offences Against the State Act and, in that connection, I want to say that most people are revolted by this method of detention without trial on the warrant of a Minister who simply has to say: &ldquo;In my opinion certain people are engaged in certain activities which, in my opinion, are injurious to the security of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Where the administration of justice has broken down, that situation could be met by another proclamation under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and there, at least, is the safety of a court of trial even though it may be a trial not necessarily before properly qualified legal persons.  There is always attached to that a right of appeal to the ordinary courts, even though by the procedure of the Special Court the right of trial by jury is taken away from the people.  What was the grave emergency which the Minister, by innuendo, suggests was present in this country which justified the detention of people without trial, in some cases detention of people without trial very nearly for a couple of years?  In that connection, no doubt the Minister has seen an article in last Sunday's <i>Observer,</i> a paper which circulates fairly widely in this country.  In that issue an article appears dealing with the Rhodesian detention legislation, legislation which is very much of the type of the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> That legislation was proposed to be introduced in Southern Rhodesia and it was withdrawn on account of the public disquiet caused by the proposals, public disquiet that was not confined to the white settlers in that country. However, the Act was withdrawn but the article in the <i>Observer</i> referred to the parallels which the Rhodesian Minister for Justice quoted for his Acts.  He said that this type of thing occurs elsewhere and we were paid the rather invidious compliment of being singled out as a country where this type of legislation was found to be necessary.  Let us think of the group we are bracketed with &ldquo;Southern Ireland, Ghana, Singapore, and Kenya.&rdquo;  With regard to allegations of murder and revolt, the Southern Rhodesian Minister has not even suggested that the Congress&mdash; that is the African Congress in Southern Rhodesia&mdash;was planning revolt.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister himself, in answer to Deputy McQuillan, objecting to the people he detained being called felons.  Deputy McQuillan was pressing him to declare that these people were felons and he refused to answer that.  I hope the Minister will now take some steps to have the writer of this article informed that there were no allegations of murder or revolt, certainly in the context that the South African Congress had planned assassination or revolt of any kind.  Now that the Curragh Camp has been cleared it would be a proper time for the Minister to be more informative on this whole matter regarding what were the things which had emerged, the things which caused and mounted up to a grave emergency, such a grave emergency as could not be met under the provisions in the Offences Against the State Act which allowed for the setting up of special courts.  The Minister, I think, would find his hands stronger in his attitude towards these people if he did that.</P>
    <P>Over the months considerable sympathy has been engendered for these people because of the fact that nothing was alleged against them. People were taken off to the Curragh Camp and there seemed to be very <Col N="245" /> little discrimination.  Mistakes were made and one person had to be released because of a mistake in identity.  With that happening, a certain amount of sympathy was being engendered, even among people who did not approve of the detainees' actions, and that could have been prevented had the Minister made a statement on what was underneath the surface.  Some general picture ought to have been presented to the public with regard to these people, above what has been given so far.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was questioned, from time to time, about various people who were detained the stereotyped answer given by him was that if these people liked to sign a guarantee that they would behave in a constitutional way then they would achieve their release at any moment.  That stereotyped stock answer continued to be given even when people were released without signing any pledge or guarantee.  In that connection I think it is true that the bulk of the releases that have occurred during the last six weeks were of people who, throughout, have maintained they were acting constitutionally and, therefore, would not sign a condition which was read to them.  I gather that quite a number of the people released had not imposed on them the necessity of signing the guarantee which the Minister had formerly insisted upon.</P>
    <P>The results of this thing must be faced sooner or later.  There is the question of people who do sign guarantees with regard to their future behaviour and, having signed guarantees, say they treat their signature on a particular document as signing an empty formula.  Certainly, there was one outstanding example of a young man whose release, after signing a document, was made the subject of comment in this House.  He was able to say, and he publicised his view very effectively in the newspapers, that he went back over the years and, if certain people could adopt an empty formula, he did not see any reason why he should not adopt the same formula and sign a document presented to him with a certain type of mental reservation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> Whatever he signed, he signed it as being an empty formula.  That young man was at liberty for many months before the general release took place although he told the Government he was in fact repudiating the document put before him for signature.  The community will be grateful that these releases have taken place, and more particularly will they be relieved if they can get an assurance, more than by a mere statement from the Minister, that there had been a grave emergency which could only be met in this way and that that grave emergency now no longer exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister compliments himself that it is the considered view of the Government that &ldquo;for the time being, the measures taken in 1957 and 1958 have served their purpose.&rdquo;  The Minister gives us his personal assurance that &ldquo;the temporary detention of those concerned has effectively prevented them from endangering the lives of others and risking their own in the pursuit of activities that are no less futile than unlawful.&rdquo;  He then reiterates a warning given by the Taoiseach that &ldquo;the Government will not hesitate to use all the means at their disposal to ensure that there is no usurpation of their authority and to prevent unlawful activities of a kind which, if they were allowed to go on unchecked, would be likely to lead to a situation here which must be avoided at all costs.&rdquo;  He states that if these unlawful activities are restarted these measures will be taken once more and detention will again be imposed.  I think it is in the public interest that the public should be better advised how serious the situation was and of what has brought about the alleviation which has enabled the releases to be made.</P>
    <P>Although possibly it is not the Minister's immediate task, he might have referred to the publicising in the papers that there had been a protest made to the Government with regard to the release of these people.  The Taoiseach said, with regard to that, that he thought the intervention of the English Prime Minister was ill-advised or he used some other adjective.  That was all right.  But I think the public again <Col N="247" /> might be told now that the matter is no longer a critical one&mdash;I do not want the exact details&mdash;what was the gist of the objection that had been raised and the intervention made and how it was replied to.</P>
    <P>It certainly is an astonishing thing that the Prime Minister of another country should in such an open way &mdash;I think it was at a public dinner&mdash; indicate that he had caused a protest to be lodged by the British Ambassador here.  One would have expected something more in the way of a sharp retort or answer to what is now recognised as a blunder committed by the British Prime Minister.  The public ought to be advised of the reception that was given to this protest from the British Ambassador, what the gist of the protest was, how there was any justification for what is clearly an unwarrantable interference with our own affairs and how vigorously the Government retorted to that protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure.  I think it would be a matter for the Minister for Justice as the person as the result of whose opinion these people were detained and presumably as a result of whose opinion these people are now released.  I should have imagined that although the medium of communication might have been External Affairs, the person whose administration was being censured was the Minister for Justice.  I have made the point I want to make on it.  I did not intend to speak in any disorderly way, Sir, but I merely make the suggestion that I am quite in order in addressing these remarks to the Minister for Justice.  If he likes to say his colleague will deal with it, we shall await that occasion.  I do not think it would be out of order for the Minister to give us his own view with regard to that intervention since he is the person responsible for the operation of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the matter of crime earlier.  It is disheartening, and it is <Col N="248" /> not good enough to say there is a world-wide crime wave.  In a small country like this with quite a numerous and, to my mind, quite an efficient police group, it is a dreadful thing to find that last year we had an increase of 12 per cent. on the figures of indictable crime for the previous year, to find that this year the position is worse and that they have gone up again by 18 per cent. even on the greater number of last year.  I suggest that it will be regarded as a smug type of complacency merely to say there is no simple or easy answer and that it seems to be part of a worldwide crime wave.  There are circumstances with regard to unemployment and underemployment, bad conditions at home and all these things which certainly play their part in the increase in these indictable crimes.</P>
    <P>The question of unsolvable murders got a great deal of publicity and there is a good deal of public disquiet over this.  I am very glad to get the information&mdash;I had not known that the record was so good as the Minister says&mdash;that in the ten years preceding 1957 the record was 100 per cent.  I take it that means that of every murder committed there was a discovery which led to somebody being brought to justice for the murder. Maybe the Minister's figure of 100 per cent. means that in every case in which somebody was brought before the Courts for a crime there was a verdict against the individual?  Is that the case?  Apart altogether from people being made amenable to the Courts of Justice for the crime of murder, were there any cases of murder where nobody was made amenable and where, through lapse of time, it was not possible to have the matter discussed?</P>
    <P>If there is a 100 per cent. record for the ten years preceding 1957, people will be all the more anxious to know what has happened in the last couple of years.  Personally, I agree with the Minister that there is no failure on the part of those looking after crime, on the side of the Guards.  But the three murders that have not been cleared up are undoubtedly disturbing and it is not a complete answer and will not be <Col N="249" /> a justification to the public to say: &ldquo;There is no justification for suggestions that have been made that there is something radically wrong...with the Garda machine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree it has nothing to do with the closing of a number of police stations in certain areas; but the other point is the one about which there is a note of interrogation in the people's minds. I think very much the same personnel are investigating these matters who had the 100 per cent. record prior to 1957.  Unless they are failing in the type of their investigating skill or lacking in their zeal&mdash;and I do not believe that to be the case&mdash;there is at least this to be answered.  I do not know whether the Minister will say there is less public support for the authorities in connection with such matters as murder and very serious crime.  That has been hinted at in the newspaper accounts.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to attend to one thing.  It is a minor matter.  I do not think it does the Guards any good to have a certain amount of talk about active inquiries being conducted over an extensive area with regard to certain crimes.  There is then a rumour. People are brought to the point of expectation and nothing happens. There is another sensational bit of news about the crime squad having moved into a certain area, and again people expect something and that, at last, an arrest will be made.  That has been hinted at.  While I do not think we have advanced to the point of stating &ldquo;An arrest is shortly expected&rdquo; there are hints to the effect.  Notwithstanding all that, we have these three dreadful cases lacking solution.</P>
    <P>Juvenile crime is put down by the Minister to lack of parental control; bad example and insufficient occupation are contributory factors.  These three are undoubtedly factors, but I would put them in a different order; insufficient occupation would go at the top.  Lack of parental control must also be associated with conditions generally.  One cannot have the same control by parents where not merely the man but the woman of the house as well has to go out, even if it is only for part-time occupation.  The <Col N="250" /> ordinary household is broken up by these conditions and there cannot be the same control exercised by parents as there was in happier days when economic necessity did not compel both parents to seek employment and the children were therefore under parental observation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to answer his own question better than he did in his speech as to why there is this increase in various classes of crime. He referred to bicycles and he told us that no fewer than one in three were not claimed by the owners.  Last year, when he was talking about bicycle thefts he said that these bicycles were not the vehicles by which the capitalists of the country travelled, they were mainly used by working men getting to and from their work:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are being stolen, not from capitalists, but from unfortunate men who use them as a means of transporting themselves to their places of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is so, it is astonishing to find that one in three working men using bicycles to get from one place to another are so casual that they do not turn up to claim their property.  I think the Minister will have to propound something better than that by way of reconciliation in explanation of what he says here with regard to the casual way in which owners treat the theft of bicycles.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister urged business people to provide themselves with watchmen in order to protect their premises from being broken into.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... large business concerns should provide themselves with watchmen during the hours of darkness as a further means of providing protection for the valuable property that is often contained in their premises, property sometimes worth tens of thousands of pounds, and yet it is not regarded as a good economy to provide a watchman who would be always on the premises during those hours of darkness and who would be in a position to raise the alarm in the event of any attempt being made to burgle the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did the Minister do anything beyond <Col N="251" /> making that suggestion in his speech last year?  Were the owners of business premises asked if they were prepared to incur the expense of watchmen and, if so, what was the response?  Apparently it did not stop the housebreaking.  To put it generally, it did not stop offences against property; and these are the main ones that have increased during the year under review.</P>
    <P>Last year, when dealing with indictable offences, the Minister gave us the figures for the Dublin Metropolitan District.  This year he gives us the figures for the whole country.  According to the Minister last year, the number of indictable crimes in the Dublin district in 1955 were 6,333; in 1956 these crimes rose to 7,120, in 1957, in the same area, they had gone up to 8,750.  This year the Minister swings over and takes the figures for the whole country.  The figures he gave last year for the whole country&mdash;I have not got the 1955 figures&mdash;were 12,782 indictable offences in 1956. These rose in 1957 to 14,322; this year the figure stands at 16,567.  That is the 18 per cent. increase.  The Minister might fill in the gap so that Deputies can get the picture for Dublin.  He might give us the figures of indictable crimes in the Dublin Metropolitan District in the year 1958 so that we can make a comparison between the two speeches both in relation to the whole country and in relation to the Dublin Metropolitan District.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will agree that larceny, which is the main criminal offence, is due to the lack of money from which certain people are suffering. Surely there is an almost automatic connection as between the lack of money in people's pockets, either because they are out of work or drawing unemployment assistance, and the fact that there is a good deal of thieving of property.  I suggest it is not easy to ignore that connection.  It occurs immediately to anyone who considers these figures and considers the condition of the country, a condition which has been described by people in different parts from the point of view of chronic unemployment, bad <Col N="252" /> employment, emigration and everything else.</P>
    <P>With regard to prisons, again the increase here is due to certain causes. Here, again, there is an increase in remuneration caused by the fact that the cost of living has been put up by Government activity and the resulting increases therefrom have to be met. Apart from that, we have increases in the cost of feeding the prisoners.  Does that mean that the increase is due to the increased cost of the same food or are the prisoners being better fed?  Are they being fed in a more expensive way?  I take it the simple explanation is that the same result has been experienced in prisons in relation to the increase in food prices generally throughout the country.  On the other hand, if the explanation is that we are giving more food, or better food, to prisoners, I would like the Minister to explain why.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot object to my saying now that he holds out no promise whatever of any improvement in the field of penal reform.  There is one brief paragraph in which the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our resources do not permit of experimentation to any large degree. ... Moreover most prisoners are not long enough in custody for any training or rehabilitation measures to take effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then gives some statistics and he concludes by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the House will shortly have an opportunity of discussing the question of penal reform on a Bill dealing with certain limited aspects of the problem which I expect to introduce shortly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that nothing is being done or will be done in respect of penal reform because of the fact that (a) we have too few prisoners and (b) they are there for too short a period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the extent of it?  I thought penal reform related to rehabilitation and training.  I thought that was what was intended in penal reform.  Keeping cells in a cleaner condition or providing better beds is not exactly what the public understand by penal reform.  What is generally understood by the term is reform of the penal system leading to reform of those who undergo imprisonment with the object of making them good citizens or better citizens when they emerge.  Certainly, that is what I understand by penal reform.  I gather nothing has been done in that respect.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Courts of Justice, we have been told there has practically been no change at all and the increased provision is due to increased remuneration. That, of course, means increased remuneration of the staff.  There have been no judicial increases.</P>
      <P>The record presented by the Minister is nothing upon which to congratulate ourselves.  It may be that the situation is beyond the Minister's control and that we will just have to wait until this crime wave subsides, if it ever will subside.  The Minister certainly does not hold out any great hope of improvement.  He simply laments the fact that there was an increase and leaves it at that.  I think there will be general public dissatisfaction with that.  The Department has not yet been able to suggest something in the way of a remedy, apart altogether from the permanent reform in respect of the conditions in the country.  They have not the realism to associate the bad conditions in this country with the present conditions operating in respect of crime.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to make <Col N="254" /> some brief comments on some aspects of the Minister's statement and not a general speech on the Department of Justice as it affects the country as a whole.  The Minister has given some figures with regard to legal adoption which are satisfactory.  I think people generally have no grave complaints about the operation of the Adoption Board but some cases of individuals who had particular difficulties with regard to adoption have arisen and my humble opinion is that the officers of the Adoption Board could be a little more helpful in trying to ensure that these children are adopted. There have been some snags, possibly legal ones, but I think many of these could have been overcome if the officers made different suggestions to the parents of the child to be adopted.  I had occasion to ask the Adoption Board to investigate some cases in Wexford recently and I have not heard of them for a long time. That may be a particular complaint and it is not a complaint against any of the individuals on the Adoption Board.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred to film censorship and while the reference is far removed from his paragraph on juvenile crime, it would have been very appropriate if the Minister had talked about juvenile crime in the same breath.  Film censorship here, so far as I can gather&mdash;and I am a film fan&mdash;has worked very satisfactorily. I cannot understand why there is not special censorship for children's films.  They have it in Britain, so far as I am aware, and I can imagine no reason why we cannot have it here. There is no doubt that some of the films which children see here have a grave influence on their lives and certainly an influence on juvenile delinquency.  Crime is glamorised, especially in certain types of films.  I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle or the Minister has seen &ldquo;The Dead End Kids&rdquo;, a very popular gang of juveniles who, in about 80 per cent. or 90 per cent of the film, are delinquents. They steal fruit and annoy people and indulge in all sorts of petty crimes. They would not be averse from taking a motor car, if it suited the plot.  It is crime for 80 or 90 per cent. of the <Col N="255" /> film; then there is reform for about 10 minutes, and pardon and everything ends happily.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be a killjoy and there are many films appropriate to children and to certain teenagers, but any member of the House who goes to see certain films would shudder to think that these films will be shown the next day at matinées to children aged from four to 16.  The sooner we have an attempt to control that type of film for children, the better I think it will be for the children here who have become delinquent in the past few years.  The Minister has freely admitted that juvenile delinquency, especially in the past few years, has been on the increase&mdash;I think he said over two years.  The public generally are protected by the film censorship that we have but there should be some further protection for children by ensuring that certain types of films will not be shown to them, especially at matinées.  If the parents want to bring them to night shows, that is the parents' responsibility, but many parents at present in an effort to amuse or to some extent educate their children, allow them to attend matinées and some of the films they see are unsuitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not making any specific suggestion but I think we should have a form of censorship of films for children.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to traffic, mainly I think in connection with accidents.  All of us are glad that the number of deaths on the roads in 1958 was lower than in 1957 when it was lower than in 1956.  I know the Minister, in mentioning these figures is not complacent, nor does he show any hint of complacency, but we are all with him when he expresses the hope and the wish that these accidents should be avoided through motorists and the public generally taking more care on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of transport for <Col N="256" /> which the Minister has responsibility is traffic.  One of the big things that distresses me is our lack of traffic regulations.  Dublin City is pretty well regulated generally, but it could not be said to be one of the best regulated cities in the world, so far as traffic is concerned.  In many provincial towns on market days or on usually busy days, there is, infact, chaos.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will say that he has some responsibility but not overall responsibility for that.  I know the local authorities have an interest also and have a grave responsibility, but unfortuntely I find many local authorities have&mdash;I shall not say a vested interest&mdash;a special interest in traffic.  As I said many years ago in this House, I think the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána should intervene. I do not want to mention any particular provincial town but I think many Deputies from outside Dublin will recognise the type of town I mean all over the country.  If the local authority are not strong enough to do it, I believe the Minister for Justice, through the Garda Commissioner, could do it and should do it, because not alone does it upset the residents of the town, but it does not impress the tourist when he comes and sees the traffic chaos which we have, not only in Dublin but in many of our provincial towns.</P>
    <P>I should like also to complain briefly to the Minister with regard to the accommodation that many of the Garda have in the Garda barracks.  I had occasion to visit some of those barracks and I was appalled at the small space in which five, six or eight Gardaí were confined.  It was positively unhealthy.  At a time when many new barracks are being constructed, the Minister or the Garda Commissioner should try to ensure that there will be sufficient sleeping accommodation and, generally, sufficient facilities for those members of the Force who are required to stay in the barracks.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to note the Minister's boast, so to speak, that the ranks of the Garda Síochána were being diminished.  The Minister said the present strength is 6,479, but he <Col N="257" /> went on to say that within ten years the overall strength would be reduced by 1,000.  He went on further to say it was hoped eventually to reduce the Force to about 5,500 men.  I do not think that is a good policy, especially in view of the fact that the Minister has freely admitted crime has increased in recent years.  We have been unfortunate in that, in the past 18 months, three, four or five murders have occurred.  The fact that we have had these murders is not, I know, directly attributable to the fact that our police force has been reduced but, surely, if crime, especially in respect to larceny, is on the increase, there must be a greater need for more Gardaí.</P>
    <P>My town has a population of about 12,000.  I may be wrong, but so far as I am aware Wexford town is policed during the night time by two members of the Force.  If those two members of the Force were to walk the principal streets in Wexford, it would take them, I am sure, about four or five hours to do so just once, and Wexford is a fairly compact town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And to have a smoke. I would say from the south end of the town to the north would be a distance of 1½ to two miles.  Is it any wonder that we have petty larceny and lockup shops and private homes being broken into, when we realise that there are only two members of the Garda charged with policing the whole town? The lad who wants to break into a shop knows exactly when the Gardaí are at the far end of the town.  If the police are at the western side of the town, it means he has 1½ or 2 hours to do the job, to break into a shop or a private residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable or feasible to have every street in a town like that policed, or to have three or four streets policed by one or two Gardaí, but I do suggest that a town of that dimension, or a town with 3,000 or 4,000 of a population or even 2,000, should be policed by a squad car, because a squad car going round the town will be known to all the people.  First of all it gives a sense of security and, secondly, if there is <Col N="258" /> trouble at one end of the town, the squad car can get there in reasonably quick time.  One cannot expect two members of the Garda Síochána to be responsible for a town of 12,000 people and to be responsible for the policing of miles and miles of the streets in that town.</P>
    <P>I qualify that by saying that so far as my information goes, two members of the police force are required to police the town which I have mentioned. I may be wrong; it may be four or six members of the Force, but my information is that it is only two. These are the only comments I want to make on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice, except to impress on him the necessity for at least an investigation into a system of censorship of films for children under the ages of 14 and 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad that Deputy Corish referred to the question of legal adoption.  The machinery set up under the Act has worked amazingly smoothly and has given tremendous security to children who otherwise would have had none, as well as giving great happiness to people who would otherwise have been childless.  There is an omission which, I gather, has already been noted by the Minister, in that one or two religious denominations which are not referred to in the Act are not at present permitted to avail of the provisions in the Act.  I understand that legislation will be introduced some time to remedy this omission.  It has been brought to my notice that people who very sincerely wish to adopt children in some cases have actually taken a child into their homes but cannot legally adopt the child.  I urge the Minister to introduce this legislation, which I gather is more or less on the stocks, as soon as possible.  There is a grave matter of personal happiness at stake for a number of people and I hope there will be no further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to agree with some at least of what Deputy McGilligan said on the question of penal reform.  I hope this will be treated as a matter of urgency and dealt with on a very broad scale.  It is not, to my mind, so much a matter of making conditions more <Col N="259" /> comfortable in prisons as trying to ensure first of all that people are not committed to prison, if that can possibly be avoided and that those who have to be put out of circulation for a period are at least not upset to such extent that they become abnormal and anti-social creatures.  Certain moves have been made in Northern Ireland which deserve our attention such as the release of prisoners on parole at particular times such as Christmas time.  I advocate such a practice, not just to be nice to the prisoners or to make things easy for them, but because it is important to try to ensure that the prisoner will remain a normal member of the community and any long period of imprisonment is bound to upset a man's balance.  This practice of allowing prisoners to go home at certain times is a very valuable one and the experience in Northern Ireland has been extremely satisfactory and prisoners released on parole have reported back dead on time.</P>
    <P>In general, I think, there is a certain amount of public uneasiness that certain crimes which appear very serious have been dealt with leniently by the Courts.  I believe not only district justices but senior members of the Judiciary are very reluctant to commit men to prison, if they can possibly avoid it.  That is a very valid and at the same time a very serious criticism of our prison system.  I feel that it is not only a matter of restraining a man's liberty or taking it away, but that every effort should be made to try to find out how to restore that member of the community to his proper place in the community as a productive member of society.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are getting very bad value for our money.  It is set out in the Estimate that provision is made for a total of 385 prisoners.  It requires the services of 239 of a staff to look after those prisoners.  Even though that figure includes the chaplaincy service and the medical officers it appears excessive when you look at the total amount of money required.  A sum of £111,000 will be required to pay the staff to look after 385 prisoners.  That does not appear to be an economic use of the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> The whole basis in relation to the maintenance of such establishments as Mountjoy and Portlaoise requires revision. I do not know Limerick and Sligo so well but that fortress at Portlaoise is an abomination to me every time I pass it.  To be incarcerated there is enough to turn a man permanently against the community.  We should try to be a little more adventurous in our dealings with convicted men by placing them, as far as possible, in more normal conditions. They are not beasts who have to be restrained and if you continually lock them up with such tremendous ostentation it can produce only a feeling in the convicted man's mind that he is a terror to the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question as to whether the net result would be good or bad and the view of the Judiciary is that incarcerating people in these, what are to me, horrible fortresses is not the way to reform them.  We should not regard this purely as a matter of revenging ourselves or allowing the victim to be revenged by the community.  It is a matter of trying to restore a criminal type to a proper place in the community.  I do not mean just giving them spring beds, and so on, but that a genuine effort should be made to treat the men in such a way that when their term of imprisonment is over they will be able to re-enter the community and make a constructive contribution.</P>
      <P>On the question of the courts themselves, I have frequently been appalled at the conditions in relation to maintenance, lighting and heating.  District justices and their staff and those who come before them are exposed to extremely bad conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we shall leave it. A reduction in Garda strength is almost inevitable by reason of the increased use of radio and mechanical transport.  I have had experience myself of dialling 999 on a couple of occasions and the response was unbelievably <Col N="261" /> quick.  I cannot help believing that the use of these radios and cars is a much better way of dealing with the prevention of crime than additional men patrolling the streets.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there is a tremendous amount of discontent in the force on the question of Garda promotion.  I know there are always in any force a number of men who feel they should be promoted before the men who actually are promoted.  However, from a number of complaints I have received and from the number which have emerged through the Garda Representative Body, there may well be some grounds for dissatisfaction with the present promotion system.  I would urge the Minister to investigate them to the full and ensure that members of the Garda who have passed the necessary qualification examination for promotion are at least given a reasonable chance of attaining to a higher rank.  I do not want to be taken as arguing any particular case but a general and dispassionate enquiry would be helpful and would at least restore some of the confidence amongst the Garda which has been lost in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has introduced his Estimate. It is regrettable to note the increase in crime and at the same time to note the decrease in the strength of the Garda.  It is only to be expected that you will have an increase in crime if you decrease that strength.  It has been said that we will have still further decreases amounting to about 1,000 in the present strength.  It is stated that due to motorisation, we have increased efficiency.  If we look at the increased duties which the Garda have been asked to perform in recent years we could describe them as semi-civil servants. As a result of that, there is a certain amount of neglect of police duties which they were originally intended to perform.  With the increase in the number of motor cars and motor cycles on the road and the increasing number of thefts of cars and motor cycles, it was only to be expected that Garda duties would have increased also.  We have a number of estates <Col N="262" /> built up on the perimeter of our cities which further increase the difficulties of the police.  In my own city a police patrol is as scarce as a snowball in Hell.  You may see a police car outside the town but the criminal is used to that now and is prepared for it.</P>
      <P>I agree with other Deputies that the stealing of bicycles is a very mean type of crime.  It hits the small man who, as the result of the loss of his bicycle, may also lose his job.  Another matter that is causing comment is the number of drugs lost or stolen from doctors' cars.  One is inclined to say that drug addicts may be around when such things happen.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the activities of a certain group&mdash;I shall not call them a religious group because they are not recognised by our Constitution and I think I am entitled to name them. They are known as Jehovah's Witnesses. Their insulting behaviour on the doorstep of many houses leads to their being assaulted, and they are a group to which the police should pay attention.  I hold they are an unlawful organisation because they are not covered by our Constitution.</P>

The British <Col N="263" /> Government were not acting on behalf of the eleven O.E.E.C. countries who are not members of the European Economic Community.  The negotiations were designed to mitigate, as far as Britain was concerned, the trading disadvantages which could arise in the current year from certain of the concessions granted to each other under the Rome Treaty by the members of the European Economic Community. The O.E.E.C. countries outside the European Economic Community have been kept informed of the progress of the Anglo-French negotiations which have not yet been brought to a final conclusion.  A number of these countries have now initiated separate bilateral discussions with the French authorities.

    <P>* Seven persons were arrested on 31st December, 1956, and were charged under section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The charges were dismissed on technical grounds on 2nd January.  The men concerned were re-charged, however, and on 14th January, 1957, all seven were convicted.  Accordingly the seven acquittals on 2nd January are not included in the figures above.</P>

Only in this way can it be ensured that the scheme is operated fairly from the outset.</P>
      <P>It is expected that application of the scheme to the forests in Co. Waterford will commence within the next month. It is hoped that the scheme will be in operation at all forests in the county in about 6-8 months' time.</P>

      <P>When confirming the opposed portion of the Tipperary (N.R.) Compulsory Purchase (Labourers Acts) Order, 1956, sites numbers 11-16 at Ballycahill on the Molloy Estate were excluded from the order <Col N="273" /> on the grounds that (a) the Irish Land Commission had initiated proceedings for the acquisition of the Molloy Estate prior to the making of the compulsory purchase order, (b) the Land Commission were in possession of the estate before I signed the confirmation order, (c) the acquisition of these sites would have seriously impaired the efficient division of the estate and (d) the Land Commission were prepared to sell alternative sites to the county council.</P>
      <P>I understand that alternative sites in lieu of these in the Order were selected following discussions between officials of the Land Commission and the county council and that the Land Commission were informed in June 1958 that the council wished to acquire the alternative sites offered.</P>
      <P>Discussions between officials of the Land Commission and the county council for alternative sites in lieu of those in the Order were in progress for some time before the confirmation Order was made.  At no time in that period, though inquiries were made as to the position by the Inspector who held the Inquiry, did the council suggest that the alternative sites offered were not suitable.  It is understood that council's engineer in fact reported that the alternative sites were suitable.</P>
      <P>I may add that I saw only yesterday a Press report, dated the 28th March, of a discussion on this matter at a recent meeting of the county council. In view of remarks attributed to some of the speakers, I think it will to say, for the information of the Deputy and everybody else concerned, that neither I nor any officer of my Department had any knowledge of or interest in the uses to which the Land Commission proposed to devote the lands in question save that the Commission required the water supply and the particular sites in question to enable them to make an efficient division of the lands generally.  Any suggestion that I had some ulterior motive in excluding these sites from the confirming Order is, of course, entirely without foundation.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I was speaking of the activities of a certain pseudo-religious group who pester the homes of people with their pamphlets and preaching at the busiest hour of the day when the man of the house is not there.  I said that these are not protected by our Constitution and I submit that they would be an unlawful organisation.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Garda the number of young children allowed to roam the streets at night at unearthly hours.  That is not in their interest.  I do not know what the law is in that respect but the Garda should see that children are off the streets at a reasonable hour so as to remove them from danger to themselves and others.  One sees tots making men of themselves with cigarettes stuck in their mouths and one sees coming out of public houses, one shoulder up, young lads hardly able to lift a glass.  I should like to see the attention of the Gardaí drawn to that matter.</P>
      <P>Another most disgusting thing is the amount of profane and filthy language used by young children.  That causes a very bad impression on tourists, apart from the fact that it is very wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Garda should give an occasional lecture in schools on road safety.  The impression created by a lecture by a Guard would be much greater than if it were given by the teacher.  That might mean a great deal to the safety of children and motorists.</P>
      <P>People are critical with regard to unsolved crimes.  If there were more co-operation by the people with the Garda such a situation might not arise. It is not right to criticise and not cooperate. Of course, that is a legacy from the days when we would not cooperate with the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of film censorship, <Col N="283" /> I agree with Deputy Corish.  Films in which the criminal is portrayed as a hero should be completely banned from the screen.  It has been suggested that films should be graded.  I suggest that such films should be completely eliminated, that we would be far better off without them.  Young minds are affected by such films.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the Department of Justice made an effort to rebuild, remodel and repair courthouses.  In view of the heavy incidence of rates at present county councils are reluctant to undertake that work.  Consequently, you hear a number of complaints from justices saying they will not sit in such and such a courthouse because of the conditions in which they have to discharge their duties.  I think it is only proper that the weight of this should be taken by the local ratepayers, although it may be said that you are taking the money out of one pocket and putting it into another.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, that is, the continued pestering in my own area of tourists by itinerants.  Speaking for Galway city, we have a great influx of visitors during the tourist season.  We also have a very undesirable influx of itinerants who come in like flies to pester the unfortunate visitors.  That gives a very bad impression.  The Gardaí do their best with them but I think it is a matter that deserves still greater attention.</P>
    <P>Once again, I should like to congratulate the Minister and say that he is doing a good job with the amount of money we give.  Let me repeat that I should like to see more Gardaí in our city.  They have quite a lot to do and, as I said before, they have been turned into a semi-civil service, having regard to all the different duties that have been imposed on them over the years. It is false economy to economise in that regard.  If there is an increase in crime, the Department of Justice is the one Department that should not have to take the blame.  The Minister suggested that mobility has played its part in dealing with crime.  In the towns and on the perimeter of the towns, you <Col N="284" /> have areas where they never see a policeman.  That in itself is something that should not be encouraged.  Once again, I congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled this Estimate. I hope that a note will be taken of the few points I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point is in relation to the jury lists in respect of the civil business of the High Court in Cork.  The High Court in Cork city deals with cases not only from Cork city but also from Cork county and neighbouring counties.  The jury lists are drawn from a circumscribed area and this has resulted in hardship for the people whose names are on the jury lists, since they are called more often than they would be if the list were called from a less circumscribed area. The Minister, in reply to a question of mine, indicated that legislation is intended to deal with this aspect of the High Court going out on circuit for jury actions.  I should be glad if the Minister could indicate when he intends to introduce that legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister, too, I think should investigate many of our criminal and penal statutes as they are today because where provision is made for fines, the fines are completely out of relation to present day money values.  Fines which 50 or 60 years ago were punitive in the extreme having relation to the value of the £ then and the value of the £ now, really have no punitive effect at all now.  They are not calculated to discourage the crime which they are intended to discourage.  I think that is a matter in respect of which a review is long overdue.  The Minister would be well advised to look into it and see what can be done.</P>
      <P>The next matter I should like to mention might more correctly be a matter for mention on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government&mdash;I am not quite sure.  I mention it just in case it is germane to this Vote, that is, the question of the Malicious Damages Act.  The repeal of it has been urged by many public bodies and very rightly so, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Corporation have to meet a very large sum annually.  I think they <Col N="285" /> estimated £8,000 for this year to meet claims under the malicious damage code.  Malicious damage is growing with juvenile delinquency.  I think it is unfair that local bodies should have to meet large bills for such type of damage.  It is unrealistic, too, in modern times when insurance companies have covered much of the damage which was meant to be paid for under the Malicious Damages Acts. You find people insuring their plateglass and paying large premiums for the insurance.  Then you find afterwards that the insurance company has not to pay for malicious damage to that plateglass.  The ratepayers have to pay.  I think that the original intention behind the Acts was to discourage crime in areas by making the areas pay for it.</P>
    <P>In so far as that aspect of it is concerned, I do not think it discourages crime any more.  The type of people who commit these acts of malicious damage have not to pay for them themselves&mdash;they are not ratepayers. They are youngsters or birds of passage in an area.  It has not the slightest preventive effect upon any person who intends to commit malicious damage and it does severely affect the budgets of the county councils, the county borough councils and the corporations involved.  Action in this matter is also overdue.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's views as far as I know at the moment are that the malicious damage code should not be repealed.  He has, I am quite sure, received complaints and requests from a large number of local bodies in that matter.  I would suggest that local bodies are better informed on a matter of this nature than are the Minister's advisers.  I would ask him to reexamine the question of that code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to raise on this Estimate.  One of them arises out of the problem of increased road accidents and death on the roads generally, which I think is causing a considerable amount of public disquiet.  I do not think that the Minister appears to have provided us with any serious reason to think that he is moving towards some kind of a solution of the incidence of accidents on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> I should like to suggest that he should give consideration to a few points, one of which is the question of instituting driving tests.  The other, of course, is another approach to the question of drunken driving.  With the extraordinarily rapid development of motor cars and the speed of the modern motor car, it is very wrong that a person can walk into an office, get a driving licence and be given thereby the right to drive what is potentially a lethal weapon in certain hands, without any need on his part to prove his capacity to drive a car at all.</P>
    <P>Some people go to the trouble of having driving lessons and become reasonably competent to drive but there is no compulsion whatever on them to do so.  If somebody wins a motor car in a pool or a newspaper competition, he can walk into an office and then step into his car and drive away.  That seems to be an extraordinarily risky thing to permit.  People who suffer from some medical disability such as severe deafness, partial blindness or incapacity of some kind or another, may take out a licence and are then permitted to drive a car.  I would be the last to impose a penalty on anyone because of disability, but that disability must add to the risk incurred by the pedestrian, the cyclist or the other motorists.  The common good would demand that steps be taken to see that those who get licences are competent to drive and are capable of driving efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the introduction of driving tests.  I know they are not a complete answer, and that one has still accidents even where there are driving tests.  However, we would discharge our responsibilities to the fullest if we ensured that persons could drive competently and capably.</P>
    <P>Drunken driving is a complicated problem, because of the widespread general habit&mdash;in most cases, a harmless habit&mdash;of people taking an occasional drink.  The difficulty arises when a person takes more than he is capable of carrying and then is permitted to drive a car in a slightly or seriously intoxicated condition.</P>
    <P>Medical tests have shown conclusively that quite a small amount of alcohol <Col N="287" /> can impair one's judgment quite severely, and that that person's ability is not as great as that of a person who is normally a safe driver and who has not taken intoxicating liquor.  There is no simple answer to the problem, because of the different capacity of people to take drink without becoming intoxicated.  There are various other considerations, such as the culpability of the different persons involved in an accident.</P>
    <P>From reading the cases in the District Courts and elsewhere it is quite clear that justices find themselves in great difficulty when faced with the eloquence of lawyers on both sides. Later on, juries in manslaughter cases find it hard to decide fairly the degree of culpability and negligence in such a case.  The dead man or child cannot be restored to life, and there is very little satisfaction to the parent or relative when such a death occurs as a result of someone having taken intoxicating drink.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we should take positive steps to frighten those who, of their own accord, or through tiredness associated with a lowered capacity to absorb alcohol, find themselves in charge of a motor car and incapable of driving it.  There should be a more severe deterrent against the drunken driver.  Those who at present take more drink than they can carry know that there is a reasonable chance now that, given a sufficiently eloquent counsel, they may get off with a warning or a relatively small penalty. That outlet lies subconsciously in their minds, and it should be taken away from them.  Our laws should be more closely related to those of Sweden, where they deal very stringently with such persons.</P>
    <P>Now that it has been established medically that blood tests are reliable, the Minister should consider providing some place for the use of such tests in assessing the degree of intoxication and culpability in such a charge.  It should be made clear to those who drive while drunk that if they are found to have imbibed a certain percentage of alcohol &mdash;whether a glass or two glasses, and <Col N="288" /> so on&mdash;they would be faced with very severe penalities, which would become automatic on such a positive finding.</P>
    <P>The first penalty is a severe one, especially in the case of those who earn their living by driving, such as commercial travellers and lorry drivers.  It is the withdrawal of the licence for at least one year, and possibly for more than one year.  Going further still, there is the imposition of some term of imprisonment. Much as I dislike severe punishment, I believe the Minister will not make any serious impact on the incidence of road accidents unless he insists on some such rules.</P>
    <P>Firstly, there must be a standard of driving before one is allowed to handle this lethal weapon, which can travel at 60 or 80 miles an hour, dependent on the person's capacity to pay for it, on congested roads which often are unsuitable for fast traffic.  Secondly, the Minister would discharge his responsibility to the public if he would take courage&mdash;and it requires courage&mdash;to try to deal with this question of casual drinking and dangerous driving.  There is little alternative left to him but to consider the introduction of the blood tests for alcohol content.  From the District Court cases, it is clear that the medical evidence&mdash;probably conscientiously, in most cases&mdash;is of a most divergent character.  One perfectly honest doctor may say he thinks a person is perfectly sober and capable of driving, while another makes a completely contradictory statement.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily they do it because they are employed in a sort of venal kind of way, but, generally speaking, I do not think a doctor is in a position to make a hard and fast decision whether one person is capable and another is not capable.  I think the only way to come to a decision is to lay down a specific level of alcohol which we will not tolerate in a person who has an accident, and let everybody know that in advance.  If certain people insist on consuming that amount of alcohol let them take the consequence with their eyes open.</P>
    <P>On the question of juvenile crime, I do not think that the Minister is completely justified in blaming the parents for lack of parental control.  Possibly <Col N="289" /> it is true in certain cases in juvenile crime, and it is possibly due to the fact that there are many families&mdash;too many families&mdash;in Ireland where the father, because of circumstances which he cannot control, is not at home.  He is abroad; the father has had to emigrate through no fault of his own, and he has left the mother in control of a large family, or a medium sized family, and she is unable to control the boys as they grow up.  That is one of the serious consequences, probably the most serious consequence, of emigration&mdash;the lack of parental control arising from the broken or dissipated family, the family whose father has to get out of the country and leave a broken home behind.</P>
    <P>The increase in juvenile crime is only one of the serious moral repercussions of the emigration problem in Ireland, but I do not think that even that is the sole factor in its increase.  If one reads the periodicals and the newspapers, including the Taoiseach's own newspaper, and goes to the cinemas and sees the films shown there&mdash;now, unfortunately, they are on the television screen&mdash;it would appear that the whole source of interest for the modern child, the growing child, appears to be based on violence of one kind or another.  It even starts in the schools with the interpretation of history, our own history and world history generally, the brutality of one nation against another nation, the usurpation of power, the imperialism and colonialism of the different countries.  The whole motif of existence in the lives of these young children as they grow up in school right through their adolescence into adulthood appears to be based on violence of one kind or another whether it is the story of our national attempt to gain freedom or the international picture portrayed in violence.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest evil of all is the evil influence in the newspapers strip cartoons with their portrayal of gangsters, gang warfare, murder, pillaging and looting under different euphemisms, always amounting to the same thing&mdash;violence exercised by one human being on another.  The extraordinary thing is that we have come to accept all these things, this continuous <Col N="290" /> unending portrayal of violence of one kind or another as an essential part of the whole of the life of our young people growing up.  In the so-called entertainment world, violence is the thing which is most commonly portrayed.  I would ask the Minister, in the use of his censorship, to ensure that the censors should continue their outlawing of the seventh deadly sin. Sex appears to be the only subject portrayed in its most blatant and objectionable forms, and I suggest that they add to this the sins of violence and murder.</P>
    <P>To me it seems to me quite extraordinary that you can go into our cinemas and that the only thing you must not see&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;is the sin of adultery carried out on the screen because it is believed to be something that is not to be allowed to be seen by our children; yet children can go to the cinemas seven days a week and see the crime of murder perpetrated, whether by cowboys or Indians, gang warfare, beatings-up of one kind or another, and murder.  It seems to me that is one of the main sources of the general trend&mdash;the increasing trend&mdash;the acceptance of violence as the arbiter of disputes between people.</P>
    <P>The attempt by young people to get money to advance themselves in life and to solve their difficulties appears to stem from this acceptance of violence&mdash;from the greatest violence of all, the acceptance of the war solution, between nations, to the solution of murder, between individuals.  I believe that the Minister will agree with me that if he examines these different media of information and education&mdash; the periodicals, the newspapers, the strip cartoons in the newspapers, the comics, the television screen, the history books in our schools, and the violence in war films&mdash;he will see that therein lie the seeds of this violence, this disregard for life and this acceptance of criminal solutions for problems about which the Minister is so worried, and about which so many Ministers for Justice throughout the world are worried.</P>
    <P>Then there are the imported English Sunday newspapers.  The Irish newspapers within recent months appeared <Col N="291" /> to have discontinued the strip cartoon depicting scenes of violence&mdash;blood running from one man's wounds in glorious technicolour on the back of the Taoiseach's own newspaper&mdash;but the English imported yellow Press still carries these disgusting stories of violence of one kind or another.  Only last week in one of these papers <i>The People</i> there was a most shameful portrayal of a section of our people, the tinkers.  Some people may despise them; I do not.  They are still human beings and still part of our nation.  It was a most disgusting portrayal in this Sunday paper with horrid details of gouging and kicking.  It should not be permitted.  That portrayal of violence should not be tolerated or permitted in any papers, imported or home produced, or in films.</P>
    <P>This House seems to be obsessed with this question of prestige.  Well, that would appear to me to be at least one way in which we can make a real contribution towards seeing that the way of life of our people is not misrepresented abroad.  We certainly should not tolerate the circulation of papers such as those in this country where we have the right under censorship to forbid their circulation.  I would ask the Minister to give some thought to this whole question of the use of violence for the making or increasing of circulations.</P>
    <P>The use of violence and a decadent interest in crime is widespread not only here but everywhere else.  I was amazed to read a well-known Socialist peer proclaiming his great interest in reading crime novels.  It seems to me that is a most decadent interest, to be concerned with how one man kills another.  Where it concerns children and where they have access to these very colourful portrayals of murder, violence, gang-warfare and malicious damage of one kind or another, it can only have one result&mdash;the increasing figures for juvenile crime with which the Minister is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has come to any decision about the extension of the franchise to the Garda Síochána.  I do not know what the reason is for withholding this.  It seems to me there is no good reason why they <Col N="292" /> should be hand-picked from everybody else in the community.</P>
    <P>I have been given to understand there is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction in the Garda about the system of promotion.  The Minister answered a question of mine in which he said he was satisfied that there is no serious injustice or unfairness in this question of promotion.  I would ask him again would he try to ensure that if there is a genuine feeling amongst the Garda that there is a certain amount of favouritism, unfairness or injustice in the making of promotions, steps should be taken, as they can be taken, to see that the appointment board in relation to these promotions and appointments should be above suspicion, and that the Garda cannot have any justifiable belief that there is some sort of back stairs influence being used to secure appointments or preferments of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain the Minister himself is well removed from anything of this nature, but I know from my own experience in the Department of Health that it was one of my most pleasant functions in the making of appointments that I could, as Minister for Health, say: &ldquo;I have absolutely nothing to do with those appointments. They are under the authority of the Taoiseach through the Local Appointments Commission which is completely above board and suspicion.&rdquo;  The result of that was that one was saved a tremendous amount of attempts to influence one.  At the same time, through the operation of the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commissioners, it is now generally accepted by people going for professional appointments of one kind or another that they get a fair crack of the whip.  If they are qualified, they will very likely get the appointment; if not, they will have no grievance and certainly no grievance against the Minister or the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any difficulty establishing some sort of tribunal which will give the Garda complete assurance that their case is conscientiously, carefully and fairly considered before a decision is arrived at.  I could not imagine anything more <Col N="293" /> dangerous than a dissatisfied police force.  It must be a very important thing to try to ensure that the police force of any country is completely contented, that there is no dissatisfaction and suspicion among the Garda that some are doing better than others.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister once again of the request I made earlier to him.  Would he please consider taking powers to allow prisoners in our jails to go home at times such as Christmas for a short period?  I understand he has not got such powers at present.  I understand there is a problem when prisoners leave jail suddenly, just as there is when patients leave a hospital where they have been for a long time.  It is quite extraordinary how unwilling people are to leave a hospital where they have been for a long time.</P>
    <P>I understand there is the same feeling of fear, or presentment of insecurity of some kind or another, in the case of prisoners, even if it sounds very unlikely.  I understand it is true that, when they leave jail, they have this feeling of uncertainty as to what the future holds for them.  Of course, they are frightened of the likelihood that they will carry the stigma with them endlessly, making it difficult for them to get jobs, and that the extraordinary transition from the relative security of a jail to the complete insecurity of a penniless outside life is quite a strain on many of the prisoners.  For many the week after they leave jail, if they do not get secure employment, is the greatest period of temptation for them; and they are likely to end up in jail again because they are unable to resist the temptation to return to the criminal activities of their past.  Would the Minister consider the suggestion, and the practice adopted elsewhere, of allowing prisoners out for a limited period before they actually are discharged to see whether they can establish themselves in life outside jail before they are finally put out to try to earn their living with the tremendous burden many of them have of having had a criminal record?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to deal generally with this Estimate but there <Col N="294" /> is one point to which I should like to refer.  It is the closing of Garda stations in the country generally.  I feel I would not be doing my duty to my constituents if I did not raise this matter.  Several barracks were closed in County Kilkenny.  I was on a deputation to the Minister's predecessor about a particular barrack. Apparently he decided at that time he would not accept the recommendation from the Garda authorities about the closing of this barrack.</P>
      <P>When the change of Government came and a new Minister was appointed, the same recommendation was immediately put up to that Minister. Again, a deputation of those anxious about the matter came before the Minister.  That deputation included the parish priest, a man who was then close to 80 years of age. The fact that he travelled on that deputation clearly shows his anxiety in relation to the closing of that barrack. The Minister said he had seen the recommendation and he was not disposed to reverse the previous decision. In fact, as far as I remember, he said his predecessor had made no decision; he left the recommendation to one side.  But the present Minister was making a decision and we know now what that decision was.</P>
      <P>The people feel that a certain amount of protection is being taken away from them through the closing down of these barracks.  I have no doubt that the Minister was asked if he could reduce the cost of running his Department.  Now, the cost of the Garda Síochána is the heaviest draw on his departmental funds.  Obviously somebody suggested that economies could be made if certain barracks were closed down.  That policy is a very shortsighted one.  I would have no objection to a reduction in the number of Gardaí in relatively small districts: in some cases one or two men would suffice as against four or five at present; but the complete closing down of barracks in one whole area, as has happened in Kilkenny within ten to 20 miles of where I live myself, is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Gardaí are concerned. we should have a competent force.  A <Col N="295" /> competent Garda force up to strength will give the people confidence.  Quite a number of people who pay taxes get nothing by way of return other than a certain sense of security in the knowledge that they have a competent Garda force to protect them.  The first right to which any person is entitled is security in his own home.  I am not blaming the Minister altogether for the situation that exists because he is not the first to implement the policy of closing down Garda barracks, but I appeal to him to recommend to the Government that they should at least restore some semblance of protection to the people in these areas.  We have had a number of murders and I am convinced that these would not have taken place, had people been aware that there was a competent Garda Force in sufficient strength in the areas in question.</P>
    <P>One result of the present policy is a change in the old Irish way of life.  The door is no longer left open for the casual visitor.  Now, when the man of the house goes to work, the door is closed and barred.  It has to be admitted, of course, that in the case of the Kilkenny murder, the door was closed and barred.  Nevertheless, a particular individual was able to get into the house.  I do not suggest that reopening the barracks and replacing the Gardaí will lead to a cessation of murders&mdash;we may still have murders&mdash; but it will give people that feeling of security in their own homes; and the first duty of any Government is to give people security in their own homes. Any Government who fail to do that are failing in their primary duty.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to allow others to dictate to him.  He is the link between the citizens and his Department.  It is he who has the contact with the ordinary people.  Having received the deputation to which I have referred, the Minister should have informed his officials that a responsible deputation had interviewed him and he wanted the position reviewed. Instead of that, he said he had taken a decision and he was not going to alter it.  That is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about our <Col N="296" /> Defence Forces, our police force should be up to strength in order to give that fundamental security to which every citizen is entitled.  I appeal to the Minister to bring this matter to the notice of the Government and I hope my plea will receive the consideration it deserves.  I am pleading for a section of our people who are unable to plead for themselves.  The Minister says that £155,000 more is required this year because of retirements and also because of extra duty on the Border.  That increase is a natural one at the moment because the men who joined in 1922, 1923 and 1924 have now reached the retiring age.  The increase should not be met through the device of cutting down the numbers of Gardaí in certain areas.  We ar suffering heavily from this device in my constituency.  I appeal to the Minister to review the position because whole areas are being left without protection of any kind.</P>

      <P>We seem to have an inordinate number of housebreakers in both the city and county of Dublin. We have, too, a new type of housebreaker&mdash;the man who comes along to see if Bill Jones has gone out or if Mary Murphy has left her house unoccupied. If the house is unoccupied, he then sneaks in by the back.  I admit this type of crime is not new, but it has increased to alarming proportions in both the city and county of Dublin. I suggest the law ought to be amended and an example made of those who engage in this practice.  The Courts and the Gardaí do their best but the law will have to be made more severe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have another problem in the city and county of Dublin, the problem of the itinerants. The inhabitants in Ballyfermot make a complaint and the itinerants move from Ballyfermot to Walkinstown. They have hardly settled in Walkinstown <Col N="297" /> when someone there makes a complaint, and they move to Finglas. They move from one side of Dublin to the other, causing trouble everywhere they go.  They are destroying the work of some cottiers or people who have tried to make their homes in these areas.  It is a problem we have on the verge of the city of Dublin in my constituency. While I do not want to be unfair to any section of our people, the problem of the itinerants or tinkers has got out of hand.  When you mention it to the City Manager, he will enclose a particular site and the itinerants will be out of that area for a while, but they only move round a bit and you have the same trouble in the next district.  When they are put out of that, they move on again and you must ring the Guards or the City Manager or somebody else to get them away.</P>
      <P>The time has come when we should at least go to the extent of setting up a commission to consider what should be done with these people.  People living alone in remote areas of the county where there has been an increase in tinker camps in recent years suffer heavy damage.  A man from North Road, Finglas, told me the other day of the great amount of damage done to his place by itinerants and their horses.  Deputies from both sides have mentioned this problem from time to time and I respectfully suggest that the Minister should set up a commission to see what can be done.  It is shocking to see a number of children being reared in filth and dirt and not educated, just multiplying, and going begging round the districts.  There is no use in just moving them from one district to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and members of the Force on the manner in which they are dealing with a menace we had some time ago, the teddy boy. There are two classes of them, those that go round dressed up for show purposes&mdash;they are harmless&mdash;and the others, the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; who go about in groups of four, five, six or seven and gather outside dance halls or other public places and carry knives.  I should like the Minister for Justice <Col N="298" /> to ensure that any youth found with a knife in his possession will be dealt with very harshly.  It is a shocking thing to see a youngster drawing a knife on another youngster, beating up old people or engaging in activities of that kind.  I am glad that the Gardaí in Dublin have this position under control.</P>
    <P>While the Gardaí have been exceptionally good, I should like to see more Gardaí in plain clothes.  I am not advocating that they should get <i>carte blanche</i> to break the law but simply that they should be put in a better position to deal with a certain type of delinquent.  In some cases, parents of children that have not been kept under control go to the schools and tell the teachers, whether Christian Brothers or lay teachers: &ldquo;If you beat Paddy, I will bring you to court&rdquo; or &ldquo;If you strike Peter, I will take an action against you.&rdquo;  If that were allowed to continue, ultimately the Gardaí would have to be asked to deal with these children.  I hope more Gardaí will be put into plain clothes to protect the citizens against the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; who are going about the city armed with knives.  There are young and old teddy boys and my constituents who attend Dublin dance halls have told me how these teddy boys operate.  They understand only one language, the language of fear, and they should be severely dealt with when they commit any crime or cause trouble to respectable people, whether in the city or the county of Dublin, or any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I conclude by complimenting the Minister on the way he is doing his job and I trust he will live long to carry out the duties of his office.</P>

      <P>This is a Department which comes in for a fair amount of criticism, mostly undeserved.  The Minister in charge of it deserves the sympathy of the public.  It is a Department that needs men of character and honour and I am glad that over the years we have always found the Minister for Justice a man of character and honour.  At the same time, there is a tendency for too many people to attempt to pull coat-tails in the Department to get sentences and <Col N="299" /> fines reduced.  I hope the Minister will set his face against that.  Most of the fines and sentences are as lenient as justice permits; in some cases, they are so lenient as to be the laughing stock of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Capt. Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the pulling of coat-tails will cease.  I heard Deputy Booth speak about prison reform and parole.  I agree with parole at Christmas for a certain type of prisoner, but not for all types.  Prison life today is not the same as it was long ago.  I know that because I went through many prisons myself.  I knew what it was to spend six months on a plank bed in different prisons.  Yet I did not come out as a criminal because of that. If you are too soft or sloppy with prisoners, they will come out and laugh at you.  You must have a fair amount of severity and discipline.  All these people, whether their offence is petty or serious, have a certain tendency, because most of them were well reared and educated.  They could have behaved themselves but they wanted big money in the quick way.  They found themselves behind prison bars and that is the right place for them.  If we all adopted their policy, the country would be in chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must think of the victims of these people, the man who at dead of night got a crack of a stick on the head and later found the wallet of notes which he had saved all his life was gone.  Then we have somebody appealing for leniency for these hobos.  The victim is the man we must consider first and we have quite a trail of victims.  We know of many robberies but we do not hear of half of them.  There are a number of robberies which are reported and there are attempted robberies which are never reported.  The whole thing is getting a bit out of hand.  Where young &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; and old &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; come in conflict with the law, the law should deal with them because they have got into that way of living.  I agree with Deputy Booth's remarks about being soft-hearted, but, at the same time, <Col N="300" /> my sympathy lies with the victim of the robbery and not with the criminal.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed, and so are many other people, that we have three unsolved murders at the present moment. That has not happened for a long number of years.  I do not blame the Garda for it.  I believe we have as vigilant and manly a police force as there is in the world.  I blame the public.  Where those murders were committed, there are people who could give information about them if they would only open their mouths, but because they do not, the Garda are in the dark and the murders remain unsolved.  I would ask the public to do their duty.  I do not blame the Minister, his Department or the Garda.  They will do their duty if they get the assistance of the people and I am afraid they are not getting that assistance in these cases.  In a Christian country, men should not be so spineless as not to do their duty to their fellow men.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister thought fit to release the internees and I hope that, on their release, they will not embark on some other activity which will force the Government to intern them again.  I hope the Minister will think twice before there are any further internments without trial. After all, that only breeds discontent. If a man has committed an offence, he should be brought before a court and if sentenced, the sentence should be carried out.</P>
    <P>I agree our police force is fairly small.  In a Christian country, a large police force should not be necessary. In the larger towns, we need, I believe, more plain-clothes policemen. In the City of Dublin the ordinary Garda in uniform is spotlighted by the &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; and the touts who know exactly where his beat is.  If we had far more plain-clothes policemen on duty, day and night, many more robbers would be caught.  It was sickening to read in last night's <i>Evening Herald</i> of a series of robberies which took place in Dublin.  I would not mind so much if it were a case of men trying to get a few pounds, but those people left wanton destruction in their wake.  That type of <Col N="301" /> criminal deserves to be punished and both the public and the police should do everything possible to catch them and then they should be given the maximum sentence.  A trail of destruction like that shows disregard for property and for life.</P>
    <P>In connection with women police, I am glad that Force has been started here on, more or less, a small basis to see how it works out.  I had a few complaints about the examining board connected with that force.  Is it the position that at the interviews no female whatever sat on any of the boards?  Some people complained to me about that and I should like to know if there was in fact, any female on the boards.  It is the first female police force to be established here and perhaps they could not have had a female on the board, but I should like the Minister to take stock of that and, in his reply, to let me know if that is or is not the case.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies talked about cinemas and television being the cause of much delinquency which occurs at the present.  I believe that is so, but, at the same time, these things have come to stay and there is little we can do about them.  Even if we censored them in this country, with the world getting smaller as it is, there will be programmes from England, France, America and elsewhere, and the people running these concerns run them as materialists and want to make all the money they can.  Their moral standards are very lax and very low.  There is nothing very much we can do about that.</P>
    <P>What we can do is to intensify the training of our youths by the parents, the churches and the schools and so enable them to stand up to present-day life.  These new forms of entertainment are rushing upon them and people are bewildered, so much so, that they hardly know where they stand.  Things are bad to-day but I believe they will be worse to-morrow.  We must have due regard to that and guard ourselves by more responsibility in the schools, more lectures from the churches and from the parents in particular, because if the parents do not do it as a foundation, who else will?</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing his best in trying <Col N="302" /> circumstances.  The Department of Justice is criticised.  Its work is hard and honourable work and it is carried out as efficiently as possible.  I say that in the country areas we do not need many policemen.  The people are more or less law-abiding and orderly and there is no great amount of crime, but in the larger towns and cities, I urge that a stronger force of plain-clothes policemen is absolutely necessary if people who are not law-abiding are not to be allowed to get out of hand.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Burke's remarks about the itinerants.  They are most bothersome in his area, as they are in mine.  At Punchestown and Fairyhouse times, there is bedlam for ten or 15 miles around those areas by reason of the activities of those people.  It is not right that ten or 15 caravans should be parked on narrow roads.  The ladies belonging to those caravans go from house to house with children in their arms&mdash;if they have not a child of their own, they get one somewhere&mdash;begging, howling and crying for a pinch of tea, some sugar, money or something else.  If the woman of the house looks at her dresser when these people have left, something is gone.  There is no question that law and order are declining. I do not want to say itinerants should be driven off the roads but something should be done about them. There should not be 50 caravans, and some of them with very costly motor cars or costly types of caravans, parked on the roads.  They are a menace to the whole countryside.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking of the poor old man who comes up to your house from his camp and asks decently for a drop of milk, some matches or some bread and butter.  One is proud to give help to a man like that because he is the type of man who is part of the Irish life.  I am speaking of the other type of itinerant who is not a part of the Irish community.  To deal with those people, many a man has to stay at home in the yard or in the kitchen to protect his family while they are in the vicinity, when he should be in his fields at work. That should not have to happen.  Very often, 16 to 18 from the same set of caravans will come to one house on the same day.  They bewilder the people <Col N="303" /> If you lock your door, they will kick at it and knock at it for about two hours.  They will give you more trouble perhaps than if you opened your door.  We cannot stand for that. I do not know what the law about it is, but as a christian community we must be able to cope with it and we must cope with it.  I would ask the Minister to think twice about this matter.</P>
    <P>These people are a set of hooligans who will not work.  If a farmer tangles with them at a fair, they inevitably put it across him.  They will sell to the poor farmer for £50 an old nag not worth 5/- which they have gingered up and when the farmer brings it home, it dies from scour inside three days. That is going on, morning, noon and night, at every fair.  I should like to see an effort made to ensure that they will live as responsible people and pay rent, rates and taxes.  They have a royal life, basking in the sun along the side of the road.  They will not even put their horses off the road for a motor car.  They want to see will a car hit their horse so that they will get some compensation.  I agree with Deputy Burke that those people are a menace to the community.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the appeal of Deputy Dr. Browne for the introduction of a traffic test.  I do not believe for a moment that the introduction of such a test will prevent the large number of deaths and other accidents that occur on our roads every year, but it is fundamentally wrong that a person suffering from some serious mental or physical disability should automatically be issued with a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should consider making available, particularly in the larger urban centres, the younger members of the Garda who would be competent to lecture in the schools on &ldquo;safety first&rdquo;.  There has been a tremendous increase in the amount of road traffic over the past 25 years, something like a threefold increase since 1939.  With that substantial increase in road traffic, the danger particularly to school children in the city areas has correspondingly increased.  I <Col N="304" /> should like the Minister to ensure that in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere there would be some younger members able to give lectures to children on taking ordinary, elementary precautions on the roads.  That would probably have a more direct effect than other method such as putting up posters, holding safety weeks and that kind of thing, although I am in favour of that also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke at some length on the unfavourable reaction on the young mind of the sensational type of newspaper coming into this country apparently without restriction. He also spoke of the effect of murder films, murder comics and other periodicals which sensationalised acts of violence.  However, there is another aspect which is possibly of more importance and which has been brought to the forefront recently by a very distressing case which occurred in my own county as a result of which a man is on trial for the murder of his wife.  Depositions in connection with that case occupied quite a number of days.  They were taken down in great detail in court and were reported at great length in all the Irish newspapers.</P>

      <P>The publicising of evidence in major criminal trials, say, a murder case would have a far more lasting effect on a juvenile's mind than reading horror comics or anything like that.  In a case such as I have instanced you are dealing with something that is far closer to their own home and their own country.  It is not right that such evidence should be available to young people merely by <Col N="305" /> opening any of the Irish national or local papers.  There should be some restriction on the publicity given to such evidence.  It is really distressing when it comes to the question of children giving evidence in such a case and that being read subsequently by children of their own age.  I do not wish to labour that point because the case is <i>sub judice.</i>  Such cases, should be held <i>in camera</i> or else there should be some restriction on the publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I am making but that such evidence is available and young people can read it.  There is no use in talking about the imported yellow Press and sensationalism in other papers when you have that happening.</P>
      <P>I supported the plea made by other Deputies that the franchise should be extended to the Garda.  It is high time a responsible section of the community had this right and I hope the Minister will give it his support.</P>
      <P>I represent an area which has suffered considerably from itinerants or tinkers.  I wish to ask the Minister if there is any possibility of bringing in some form of legislation to control this section of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would not be in order in advocating legislation on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I would ask the Minister if he would give this serious problem his attention.  I do not want to be taken as being anti-social in any way.  I am aware that the itinerants are as much members of our community as I am myself, but I do think there is an obligation on them if they take up residence in an urban or rural area to conduct themselves in the same way as other members of the community.  We have had some scenes in Limerick over the last 12 months in which members of the Garda were involved, and, because of the small number involved, one or two of them received injuries.  I should like to join <Col N="306" /> with those Deputies who criticised the decision to reduce the numbers of Gardaí, particularly in the rural areas. I have heard several complaints from the county part of my constituency and there is no doubt that there is a great deal of disquietude in the country areas about the depletion in numbers of the force in those areas.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to labour the points I have to make on this Estimate because most of what I intended to say has been said several times already. I should like, however, to touch on one thing and that is the question of the revival of the sport of boxing in the Garda.  I think everyone in the country is aware that the Garda boxing team in years past brought renown not only to the force but to the country.  If it comes within the Minister's province to do so, I would urge upon him to encourage the taking up of boxing again by the Garda.  Again I would stress the point I made about the question of publicity in certain murder cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy Russell is talking about but in the desire to spare people's feelings we ought to be mighty careful we do not push ourselves into the position of advocating that criminal proceedings should be conducted behind closed doors.  If people's liberties are to survive in our society, one of our greatest safeguards is that they should be tried by jury in public and we have got to pay some price for that. Part of the price we have to pay for it is that, if people do disagreeable things which make them criminally liable, the tale will have to be told in open court.  While the fate of such people is in the hands of the jury, the society to which they belong is there as an additional protection to ensure that the humblest person arraigned in court gets justice.  Of course disedifying material will from time to time appear in the newspapers in the ordinary course of their public duty of reporting criminal crimes and occasionally material will appear in newspapers which is unsuitable for reading by children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Russell that in such well-conducted households as his <Col N="307" /> and mine we take precautions to see that the children do not read it&mdash; and that is a duty I am not prepared to delegate to the Minister for Justice.  I regulate the reading material for my family and no doubt every other parent in his establishment will accept a similar responsibility and emphatically repudiate the suggestion that it should be delegated either to the Minister for Justice or anybody else.  But, particularly in public matters, particularly in criminal matters, this is a very important privilege of free people and, by and large, I believe the newspapers in this country can be trusted to publish with discretion the material facts of such trials although it may inevitably be true that in certain cases of that kind the minimum evidence which may with propriety be published can give great offence if perused by persons of tender years.  We are not to purchase immunity from that danger by implying that we will accept a situation in which criminal matters will be tried in a court Star Chamber.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell has imposed on himself the self-denying ordinance of not repeating what has been said by other Deputies.  It is important that we should not hesitate to repeat what has been said by other Deputies in order that the Minister may get a true picture of the situation as it really is.  If one Deputy simply says he finds that the absence of Gardaí in rural Ireland constitutes a problem in his area, and the other Deputies do not subscribe to it, the Minister may get the idea that it is only a peculiar quirk of mind of an individual Deputy.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to what Deputy Giles said.  I think it is a mistaken policy&mdash; it has been pursued by more than one Government&mdash;to withdraw Gardaí from rural stations and substitute therefore itinerant patrols.  I think it is a mistake that is being made by people more accustomed to residence in cities and large towns and who do not understand the atmosphere in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The position is this.  Our object ought to be to prevent crime rather than to detect it after it has taken <Col N="308" /> place.  The less crime that takes place, the less work the police have to do in the detection of crime, the more effective is the job the police are doing.  If you have a Garda station in a rural parish, the Garda are familiar with the people of the parish and the people look upon them as their friends.  The result is that the Garda know what is going on.  If a woman in her kitchen is frightened by some fellow coming to the door and refusing to go away&mdash; and that does happen and is happening in increasing numbers of cases in rural Ireland&mdash;there is no use in saying that the Garda patrol car will pass shortly because it is when the Garda patrol car is not passing that the fellow will go up some street and batter somebody's back door and not be visible from the main street.</P>
    <P>Suppose there is a Garda station in that district.  If a group of itinerants or strangers comes into the district then, within 24 hours, the Garda know who they are, where they came from, where they are lodging, what road they are parked on.  If, then, somebody comes to the Garda station and says: &ldquo;I was up the fields at 3 o'clock this afternoon and a man came kicking at the door and frightened my wife&rdquo; the Garda are out within an hour to the encampment to enquire: &ldquo;Which one of you was kicking at the back door of the house of Mr. X?&rdquo; The very fact that these people know that that will happen prevents them from doing that kind of thing where a Garda station is functioning.  The moment they have knowledge that the Garda have been removed from an area, and that the area is now depending on a neighbouring town for patrol, you will find an immediate tendency for instances of that kind to arise.</P>
    <P>I can imagine that the Minister will feel we are laying too much emphasis on this kind of abuse but I assure him we are not.  If you are living in a relatively remote area of rural Ireland, there is nothing more distressing and disconcerting than for a woman with small children in a house to find some fellow at the door threatening and abusing her in the absence of her husband. There is nothing more consternating to a family man than to come home in the evening and to find his <Col N="309" /> wife upset with the picture painted for him of a fellow pushing his way into the kitchen and she afraid of what might happen.  I am not suggesting that anything always does happen.  I am not suggesting that violent assaults were made or serious crime was perpetrated. I am suggesting that that kind of thing is perhaps disproportionately felt in rural areas and constitutes a very material problem.  I think it is a bad economy from every point of view to have this system of withdrawing Garda personnel from rural areas and substituting patrol system.</P>
    <P>In my considered judgment&mdash;I know about conditions in rural Ireland&mdash;if that policy is persistently pursued, you will get a development of petty crime which the Garda will find extremely difficult to control and which at the present time, or under the system existing heretofore, they had under complete control.  I venture to say that in the area in which I live at present it would be impossible for anyone to break in and enter a house or perpetrate any minor offence of that kind without the Garda knowing with virtual certainty within 24 hours the perpetrator of the crime.  It might take four or five days to accumulate the kind of evidence on which they could be prosecuted and convicted but they know and they are in a position to let the misdemeanant know that they know.</P>
    <P>The very fact that it becomes pretty well known in an area that you cannot do that kind of thing without the Garda knowing it within 24 hours results in its never happening.  I do not believe that, over 25 years, there have been half a dozen serious breaches of the law of that character in the area.  The reason for it is that we all know that, whenever it did happen, within 12 hours the sergeant of the Garda was able to make it perfectly clear that the fellow that was ultimately proved to be guilty was known by them and it was only a matter of a couple of days before he would be able to put his hand on his shoulder and prosecute him and bring him to conviction.</P>
    <P>If you want to create a situation in which there is a serious prospect of these kinds of instances going undetected&mdash;which <Col N="310" /> you will have if you withdraw the Garda from their intimate contact with the people and, instead, send them out on itinerant patrols&mdash;that kind of crime will develop.  Do not forget that breaking and entering, or offences of that character, have a far more distressing quality in a remote rural area than they have in the city.  If somebody breaks in through your kitchen window here at night, if you let a couple of roars, if the police are not there, your neighbours will come to your aid, but if you are living 120 yards up a boreen and somebody puts his foot in the kitchen door at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and says he will not go if you do not give him money, or if old ladies come up and insist that their hands be crossed with silver or they will make a demonstration of one kind or another, it is a very different cup of tea.</P>
    <P>I want to urge on the Minister most strongly that what certain Deputies have said here to-day is true, that you will promote the perpetration of crime in Ireland if you dissociate the Gardaí from their present intimate contact with the people.  I am happy to say that the Gardaí are maintaining, on the whole, an admirable standard of conduct in rural Ireland.  They constitute an admirable example in the vast majority of cases in the community in which they live.  The young people do look up to them and they are a good example to them.  They enjoy the confidence of the people.  They are not looked upon as police, primarily. They are looked upon by the vast majority of the people as friends in need to whom the people go with complete confidence and whom the people feel it is no shame or betrayal to help in the prosecution of crime.</P>
    <P>To that general proposition, there are, of course, exceptions, but, normally the Gardaí in rural Ireland are not looked upon, as so many police forces are, as a kind of enemies of the people.  On the contrary, they are in intimate contact with them and have secured the confidence of the people and have successfully established themselves as friends of the people.</P>
    <P>I strenuously press upon this Minister <Col N="311" /> that, whatever his predecessors may have thought, he, albeit he is a Dublin man, should show a fuller understanding of the conditions in rural Ireland and, if necessary, reverse any policy at present in progress for the withdrawal of the Gardaí from the country stations and their concentration and future dependence on itinerant patrols, which is no substitute for the ubiquitous position of the guards as was the practice in the past.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, as every one of his colleagues, has the problem of increased remuneration.  That, of course, is a result of the Minister's Government's own policy.  They increased the cost of living and now the birds are coming home to roost.  The Guards had to get the 10 shillings and the prison warders had to get the 10 shillings and everybody had to get the 10 shillings and the taxpayer must pay for it.  What I am sad about it that some of the taxpayers, in addition to having to pay for this, have to carry the increased cost of living themselves without getting any compensation at all.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Minister's reference to the film censor.  I think the film censor, on the whole, is doing a reasonably good job but there is a new problem.  Heretofore, the film censor was primarily concerned to eliminate reference to indecency and salacity of one kind or another in films, but there is an entirely new business started now for which there is a new film company established, that is, the production of horror films&mdash;blood.  I saw blood and murder and mayhem.  I was reading only yesterday a description of the activities of this new film company, where a slaughter house proprietor showed that they had been a great source of revenue to him, providing eyeballs, toes and entrails in order to lend verisimilitude to the horror films which this firm is producing and the firm is rejoicing in the fact that it can produce a horror film for about 250,000 dollars, one of which has already cashed in £1¾ millions.</P>
    <P>It is not a pleasant thing to have to record that that kind of film has a wide appeal but apparently it has, not only in this country but in Great <Col N="312" /> Britain and the United States of America, and I am sorry to see that some of these films are being manufactured in England and distributed through a studio there.  I wish I could remember at the moment the name of the studio.  There is a special company now formed and making a great fortune out of the production of films of this character.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves: suppose mature persons want to revel in an orgy of sadism and masochism, is it the duty of the State to deter them?  I doubt whether it is, but I do think it creates a situation in which the State would have a duty to say that while, if such films are to be displayed and do not offend against ordinary standard of decency and morality, still they are not suitable for display to children and they force us, possibly, into establishing the category which is available to adults who indulge in that sort of entertainment but which will not be shown to juveniles.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's attention has been called to that problem or not but I think it is a problem of growing gravity, and I was rather dismayed to see that one of these films has recently been announced for display here.  It is entitled &ldquo;The Hound of the Baskervilles&rdquo;.  I read it many years ago and very entertaining I found it but they have apparently put trimmings on &ldquo;The Hound&rdquo; since Conal Doyle wrote it.  It used to be a respectable hound with teeth and glowing eyes and formidable mien, but now everybody has teeth and all the characters have grown formidable characteristics and this is all being incorporated in the film which is of a horror character.  I suggest that this is a matter to which the Minister can with advantage look.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is glad to report that during the year his Department was engaged on the examination and formulation of proposals for legislation relating to licensing laws, rent control, adoption of children, penal reform, charities, administration of estates, solicitors and the Courts of Justice.  It is very entertaining to hear that he is brooding on all these interesting topics but I may mention that the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill has <Col N="313" /> now been under consideration for some seven years.  Are we ever to reach the end of the deliberations requisite to provide a satisfactory instrument of this character?  Has the Minister no more encouraging news to give us than that he is brooding on all these important matters?  I am bound to say to him that that does not impress me.  I think he ought to do something more about it because the present situation in regard to the Solicitors Act is deplorable because we have effectively deprived the Incorporated Law Society of all the disciplinary powers they had and have substituted therefor nothing, so that we now have a situation prevailing of anarchy in that profession worse than ever existed in our previous history. That is monstrous.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I have anything further to add to these important subjects, save to make reference again to the place of detention which is now situated in Marlborough House.  I am in the usual dilemma that the Minister sends the children there and the Minister for Education administers it.  I have asked year after year one or both Ministers to take the modest step of providing that where children <Col N="314" /> are sent to Marlborough House on remand, facilities will be made available for psychiatric examination where that is requisite for the information of the district justice charged with the responsibility of ultimately disposing of the children.</P>
    <P>There is available in the city an admirable child guidance clinic which I have reason to believe is prepared to afford to Marlborough House the facilities of its service, if it is asked for. Surely that is not too much to ask in the case of a disturbed child and any child that is taken from its parents by a police court and sent to a place of detention must be a disturbed child. He may be disturbed just by being a bold stump but it is possible that he may be disturbed through some psychiatric defect either in himself or in his parents and, if he is to be appropriately provided for, that defect should be detected and taken into consideration when his case comes up for disposal.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(1)  The financial year 1949-50 was the first year in which grants were made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, which became law in July, 1949.</P>
    <P>(2)  There was some slight employment in a number of areas in the first quarter of the financial year 1957-58 due to the fact that local authorities were granted extensions of time for completion of 1956-57 schemes.</P>
    <P>(3)  Grants for new schemes were not allocated in 1957-58 or 1958-59.  The payments made in these two years represented outstanding commitments in respect of grants allocated in previous years.</P>
    <P>(4)  The employment figure given for the financial year 1949-50 represents the average number of men employed per month in respect of the eight months in which schemes were in progress in that year, viz. August, 1949, to March, 1950.</P>
