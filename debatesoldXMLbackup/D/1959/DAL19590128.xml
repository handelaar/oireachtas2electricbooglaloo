      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that a number of boys and girls of 16 years of age and under are leaving this country regularly to seek employment in Britain; and if, having regard to the dangers to which such young people are exposed, he will take the necessary steps to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, I understand that some boys and girls of 16 years of age and under emigrate, but there is no official information regarding the numbers involved or whether these young persons leave as individuals or as members of families.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am not clear what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to &ldquo;the necessary steps to deal with the matter&rdquo;.  If he has in mind some legislative prohibition on emigration by young persons, such a prohibition would be costly and difficult, if not, indeed, impossible to administer.  It would, moreover, be open to criticism as infringing the rights of parents and guardians, on whom the responsibility for the welfare of these young persons primarily rests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is highly undesirable <Col N="1132" /> that young people, boys and girls of 14 and 15 years of age, should leave the country on their own and be subject to various types of dangers in Great Britain?  This is, in fact, taking place with the use, I understand, of birth certificates belonging to older members of the family.  If necessary, would the Taoiseach not see that some check be kept on people, at least under 17 years of age, leaving the country? It is a very serious problem.  I have had representations to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that the most desirable way of dealing with this problem, which does exist, would be to extend the school leaving age to 16 and, at the same time, to embark on a far more liberal school building programme?  That would surmount all those difficulties.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Russell's supplementary question, I admit that it is a serious matter. I do not know the extent of the problem.  However, that any young people, boys and girls, should go unattended or alone at a tender age to a foreign country is a serious matter.  As I have said, the primary responsibility rests on the parents.  In the first place, they must do their duty. As far as prohibition is concerned, the Deputy, by reference to the falsification of birth certificates, shows clearly just one of the difficulties that would be involved if any attempt were made to deal with this matter by legislation.  An attempt has been made to deal with the problem by the clergy and by a number of voluntary bodies in Britain.  The question of raising the school leaving age has been examined many times.  The difficulties in relation to it are such that they have not yet been overcome.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Third Session of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations on Grains, dated 14th June, 1958, refers to the decline in flour consumption as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Consumption of bread grains as food on a per caput basis has been declining in practically all the more highly developed countries where wheat is the main food grain.  This tendency is particularly noticeable in North America and North Western Europe where there is an established tendency for consumption of bread grain to decline as income rises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Statistics given in Table 91 A. of the Yearbook on Production of the F.A.O. for 1957 show the trend in per caput consumption of cereals in a large number of countries in recent years.  This yearbook may be consulted in the Dáil Library.</P>

There is at present no secondary school rcognised by my Department for the purpose of payment of grants specially devoted to the education of blind children and there is no application before the Department for the recognition of such a school.</P>

      <P>There are two large national schools, one catering for boys and one for girls, and I understand the boys and girls attending those schools can remain there up to the age of 18. <Col N="1139" /> As far as the provision of secondary education is concerned, it would seem to me that education of a vocational or technical nature would be more in line with the type of education required.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil Éireann is a very great institution.  It is also a very queer one.  I do not know how to describe the Government's attitude but the manner in which this Bill has been put before us and moved marks this <Col N="1141" /> as a unique moment in the history of this House.  The Bill which comes before us for the last time, when it leaves this House with the majority the Government have been able to command for it will have proposed that the foundation upon which this Parliament rests will be radically changed and substantially weakened.</P>
      <P>The measure is of such a kind that I want to suggest to the members of the Government, to the Government Party and every Deputy in this House, that the proposals contained in the Bill are quite unconstitutional, that they are contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution itself, and that they are an outrage on the Preamble.</P>
      <P>The Government and Government Deputies have committed themselves to pushing through this House a proposal that in future Deputies can come into this House only by election in single member constituencies and by means of a vote that, in our state of society here, means that the people elected under that system will not represent the majority of the people, either in their own constituencies or in the country, and they can get out of that only by outraging another provision in the Constitution which provides the right of free association.  These are such radical changes in the Constitution that I submit they are unconstitutional in reference to the letter of the Constitution, its spirit and, as I say, all that is in the Preamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The senior people associated with the work of this House came into Irish political life in reaction, by the people as a whole, to a substantial threat to Irish liberty, Irish freedom, and the life of the Irish nation, and the proposal that is made here to-day, coming from inside, is a threat and an attack as insidious as the attack that brought every Party, creed and class together in the 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1919 eras. Part of the greatness of this House and part of the result of its tradition, and of the solid roots from which it comes, is that it is possible to discuss such a measure in the manner in which it has been discussed here.  There have been clashes and there have been expressions <Col N="1142" /> of passion and all that, but that a proposal of such a kind could be discussed here in so unexplosive a manner is a tribute to this House.</P>
    <P>We are discussing the very foundations of our liberties when we discuss a law intended to deprive a substantial number of people of the power of their votes, which in fact is intended to deprive the majority of the electorate of the power of their vote, and is intended to deprive the citizens of this country who desire to go forward as candidates and become members of the Dáil, of the open door that the Constitution, which has been described as a Christian and democratic Constitution, offers.  I do not see how a Constitution establishing a Dáil on these principles, denying minorities of any particular class in the country of their rights&mdash;rights which in the modern world are so important to the individual and to society, rights of representation in an orderly and effective way in the Parliament that controls so much of the social, economic and other destinies of the people&mdash;can be called a Christian Constitution.  The manner in which the proposal has been presented here, as well as its matter, is a reflection on that situation, too.  I say that it is contrary to the whole spirit of the written Constitution itself, and to its Preamble.</P>
    <P>Forty-five years ago or so when we came, from various callings and various interests unassociated in any way with political intent, into political life we did so because the whole life of this nation was threatened.  It was threatened by a movement in Britain intent on destroying Irish liberty and nipping in the bud the growth of the strength of our Irish people at that time when they had a possibility of getting their hands, to some extent, on their own affairs.  That movement resulted in a rebellion against their own Constitution, and it is a fact that the attack which called men of every Party, creed and class, in 1913, into the political situation to defend Irish liberty, brought a reaction against the movement of the Conservative Party in Britain, which movement has been described by <Col N="1143" /> British historians as a rebellion against the British Constitution in order to prevent Ireland having its freedom.</P>
    <P>British historians have written that the guns of Sarajevo only broke out in time to save British parliamentary institutions.  Such was the intention against the ordinary liberties of this country, based on the rank and file of its people, that we had to withstand an attack that was so great that it could be described by English historians as an attack which would have destroyed English parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>To-day we are concerned with an attack upon the fundamentals of our representation here that is possibly destructive of our Constitution, but, at that time, we were called into political life to take the torch of Irish tradition out of the hands of those who had carried that torch through difficult days.  Through difficulties we held that torch.  We got the tradition generally accepted in the Dáil that was set up in 1919 and we hoped here, under this roof, to give it asylum.  The fact that these liberties have passed successfully through difficult and dangerous days shows of itself that this House was firmly established in its foundations, and to-day we are able to discuss, without the kind of explosions that would be warranted if this threat came from outside, the pros and cons of this proposal, but what it means to express in terms is very difficult to arrive at.</P>
    <P>We have had the case for this proposal put to us smothered under the political literature of Europe and some of the literature of the United States. Can we face the consideration of this case from the point of view of our experience of our lives, our faith, beliefs and experience, or are we to look into the literature of other countries for that?  The Taoiseach says, or at least his Party imply, that this measure is his will and testament to their Party. Now that he is, as it were, departing from active public life, or feels he is prepared to do that, he wants to leave this as his will and testament to his Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I stood before another leader face to face as, in critical times, I have stood face to face with the present Taoiseach.  I stood with Pearse in his cell in Arbour Hill.  He was departing from active political public life. Had he a will and testament to give those who had an opportunity of having a last word with him?  He had issued an order to surrender which had fallen into our hands and, in the presence of British army representatives there, I had to ask him was that his order.  He said it was.  When asked did it refer to the whole of Ireland or only to Dublin, he said it referred to the whole of Ireland.  When asked if there was any good in the County Dublin people, who had given a good account of themselves during the week, continuing to hold out, he said &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  We could get a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and a &ldquo;no&rdquo;; but there was no advice as to how a Parliament should be established.  There certainly was no advice from the man who came from the side of Connolly in the G.P.O., that minorities were to be kept in their place in this country.  There certainly was no feeling in his mind, I am sure, that the Irish people were to be one massed Party.  He had plenty of experience to show that it would not be just.  His will and his testament showed his faith in the people and he asked no guarantee there.  That was the example that he gave.  From that example and that spirit, men of every Party, creed and class, having confidence in one another, sharing one another's burdens and helping those on the right and the left, have built up this State here and kept this Parliament going.</P>
    <P>There have been moments of tragedy and moments of glory in this House.  If there was any moment of glory or of triumph here, for those of us who mixed with the rank and file, who shared their troubles and tried to guide them and keep our own faith and keep up their spirits, it was in 1948 when the National Labour Party, the Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and Fine Gael came in and sat on the Government Benches to form a Government of all Parties apart from the Party that <Col N="1145" /> would never touch anybody or co-operate with anybody.  That was a moment of great triumph in this House, because it was a moment that restored to the work of this House the spirit that emerged when a reaction was called for against an attack on this country that would have burst the British Constitution and British parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>We have had the sorrow of hearing a Leader of a Party, who call themselves a national Party, with a national record of a particular kind, a man who is held up as the Leader of all the Irish nation at home and abroad, saying that he hated that Government, that he hated the grouping of men in an Irish Parliament which brought every aspect of Irish life and every experience of Irish life together to do, at Government level, what every Party, creed and class worked and slaved and sacrificed to get done, so that the rank and file of the people, having their own burdens and their own work to do throughout the country, could do their work satisfied that they had put representatives into an Irish Parliament who could represent them in their varied outlooks and in their mutual generosity and confidence.</P>
    <P>In the freedom that we have had and in the experience that we have, with various groups coming together in the natural order of things, in the economic, in the social and in the cultural, as well as in the political spheres, we have seen what a great richness and differentiation there is in Irish life and how, under the inspiration of their Christian faith and their belief and their personal responsibility, they feel that as they are doing their national work in the fields and factories they want to do it here in Parliament.</P>
    <P>In this House, which knows so much of that history, through the actions and the experience of its individual people and through the work of the House here as a whole, we are being told that that must stop.  We are told there is to be an end to the great and rich differentiation on the part of the rest of the people, who agreed to co-operate and mingle with one another, who have so much confidence in one another that <Col N="1146" /> they can concentrate on their own job for 24 hours of the day and, when it comes to communal and co-operative action, can co-operate.  As citizens of a State and as members of a nation, with a tradition, holding together, even in the rough and tragic days of the world, in a free Irish State, we should be able to discuss these matters, even in the comparatively calm way in which we discuss them.</P>
    <P>I have to bring my imagination back almost to a pre-1798 point to be able to put into a phrase what is happening to-day.  What is happening to-day is that something like this is being said by the Government Party: &ldquo;Without the ruin of the Fianna Fáil Party, other Parties in this country must not be allowed the smallest influence on the State; Fianna Fáil will not be compelled by any authority whatever to abandon that political situation, which their forefathers won with the sword and which is therefore their birthright; sinne Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have to go back to an ascendancy of more than 150 years ago to catch the mentality.  Thanks be to God, that ascendancy has gone, but now we have here this as an amendment to a Constitution which invokes the Holy Trinity, which refers all its actions and our actions to the Holy Trinity, which invokes our fathers and their struggle throughout the centuries, which invokes the national independence of our nation, which invokes the common good and the dignity and freedom of the individual and true social order.  I believe in the unity and Trinity of God, by faith.  I do not know what the Most Holy Trinity has to do to-day with a proposal of this particular kind.  We know from our faith what man is and what his destiny is and what his duty is, when we dare to pray and breathe every day that we in our individual selves may be made partakers of the Divinity of Him who partook of our humanity and when we realise what Irish democracy has meant and where it has come from and where we want to go in the days that are there to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> I do not know what we mean by our professions of man and his destiny and his divine conception and his divine and natural attributes, I do not know what they can be, that we cannot hear, as it should be heard, the case that is being made here.  We have seen this House thrown into difficulty and turmoil in this discussion, even as between the House and the Chair.  I ask the Deputies of all parts of the House to think what they are doing and what the results of these actions may be.  I ask them to think in terms of life rather than literature, and if I do refer to one book, I refer to a book that is the compilation of minds of many Irish people sitting on a commission, set up by the Fianna Fáil Government, under the chairmanship of Most Reverend Dr. Browne, Bishop of Galway.  I refer to just two pages, with a glance in between to see the multiplicity of callings and of organisations we have in this country dealing with Irish life and to realise what it means to them to have a Parliament which is a reflection of them and in which they can have confidence and over which they can have control.</P>
    <P>In one phrase in his foreword, Dr. Browne says that the report is a serious effort to show how abstract principles can be applied to the concrete realities of our complex social and economic life and he goes into what may be regarded, perhaps, as a principle: &ldquo;It has in more than one place made it clear that vocational organisations should develop from existing institutions and follow the laws of organic, vital growth, without violent breach of continuity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government in dealing with their proposal have used the word &ldquo;integration&rdquo;.  They want integration in Irish political life.  They stand as the people whose forefathers won by the sword what they believe is their birthright, and they are &ldquo;the national Party&rdquo;.  All the rest of the nonde-scripts, they say, can come together and integrate.  How?  By going into the back rooms in the various constituencies and seeing which of them will let the other go up, and while that process of integration, which I <Col N="1148" /> suppose they might like to think was something of an organic movement, was going on, while, through the long age that that process would take, every bit of differentiation making a differentiated contribution to the political life of the country is going to be a strength to the people who want to get into the Dáil on the basis of &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The type of integration the Dáil has carried out ought to have some kind of meaning and some kind of message for our people as it has had. Individuals have been merged into Parties; Parties have been merged together to meet difficulties such as the economic war when Fine Gael was formed.  Integration will go on, but we hope it will do so, not because of dangers arising for the people, forcing them to depart from their ordinary work and thoughts and come together as if to defend themselves from a military danger.  We hope it will be the integration that comes when men sit down at one table with their various experiences and different interests and bring their minds to bear on things. It is in relation to that that Deputies have thrown their eyes over what Irish life is, as shown in the Vocational Organisation Commission Report and that they could come to the No. 1 reservation.  The No. 1 reservation coming from Miss Bennett and Senator Campbell reveals what I accept as a typical comment on things that have to be minded.  It says in the beginning of the reservation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We agree with the principle of vocational organisation, because the general trend of economic and social development impels us inevitably towards a system based upon it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Organisation is limited to the sphere of occupation&mdash;that is, vocational organisation&mdash;and final control of national welfare remains in the hands of a democratically elected Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...we feel it necessary to emphasise our conviction that the one reliable safeguard will be the <Col N="1149" /> conservation of freely elected parliamentary institutions and of the subordination of the Executive Government to Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But we cannot subscribe to any proposals which would infringe upon the right of the workers to choose their own forms of organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We cannot subscribe to anything that would deprive the ordinary citizens who are guaranteed a right to vote and that one vote should be as good as another, of the right of entry to the Dáil and the right of association. We cannot accept any denial of that and we repudiate this Bill because it attempts to deny that.</P>
    <P>In the light of what we know of our life, our experience and our known capacity, we are asked&mdash;facing people who have very definitely declared before that they knew they were wrong when they took certain actions in the past under their present leadership; that they would not follow him to-morrow if they knew where to go &mdash;to turn our backs on our own experience and turn to Britain for its experience.  Quotations from all kinds of people and all kinds of documents are given to us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer again to the challenge I issued to the Minister for Health and the Minister for External Affairs as to why they quoted the literature of Europe and shut their eyes to what was printed with Irish money in a national publication dealing with the condition of things in Northern Ireland and the effect the wiping out of P.R. had there.  I do not refer to that again, but I do refer to the fact that they have told us that the British system is the thing for security.</P>
    <P>Belloc and Chesterton have commented on that in fairly recent years. The presentation of the British system given by the Ministers in this debate has been a deception of the most astonishing kind.  They have been offering to the people something great, freedom and liberty.  They are making sacrifices in offering the people <Col N="1150" /> a great machinery for their betterment. They are really misrepresenting what they are doing.  That is why the picture of Ananias comes before my mind.</P>
    <P>Hilaire Belloc describes the British Government as the only aristocratic State in white civilisation.  There is ample evidence in the writings of Belloc to show there is not a representative Government in Britain in terms of democracy.  At a time when Belloc was writing before the war, I have reminded the House that Winston Churchill, as a rather monumental figure in British action and British politics, was complaining that they, by their type of representatives, destroyed the personalities of the great cities and that they were in the position that they were unable to resist what he called the danger of dictatorship. In 1934 he complained of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These enormous political landslides which occur now one way and now the other after some stunt election campaign are harmful both to our trade and livelihood and to the House of Commons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He complained that in many ways at that time the House of Commons was most unhealthy and that all types of views should be represented there and that if they went on lurching about every few years from one side of the road to the other they would soon find themselves in the ditch.</P>
    <P>He was writing that at a time when Belloc and Chesterton were describing the British system of government as the only aristocratic Government in white civilisation.  Afterwards, when they had gone through the disaster of the war he was saying, in 1950:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have certainly reached a parliamentary deadlock or stalemate differing in its character from any in living experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are asked to trample on our tradition and our experience and in one blind move to jump into a situation in which, with eyes on the future, Ireland is going to have its parliamentary affairs in the hands of two massed Parties in opposition to each other.  Never was such a trick played on any people and, as I say, it is partly <Col N="1151" /> to the credit of this House that the people have been awakened a little to what is happening.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this is contrary to everything that we know of the roots of Ireland's strength, that it is contrary to everything we know of the classes, Parties and groups that have made sacrifices to give us an Irish Parliament, to help and be a guiding and subsidiary body to our people in carrying on their own work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must know that this is building up a situation that can lead to nothing but dictatorship and autocracy.  This move is being made in this House, and in this way, at a time when we are celebrating what is called the 21st anniversary of the Constitution.  In 1925 I stood in the House of Congress with the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Tom Johnson, and Senator Michael Hayes, who was then Chairman of this House.  I remember well that in front of every nation in the world Tom Johnson, the Leader of the Labour Party, got up and commenting on a speech made by Churchill, that when the King was at war all the Dominions were at war, made Sir Robert Horne come back into the House and in front of every nation made him declare that he was right. Sir Robert Horne said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is all very well, however, to twirl your fingers and say I am not playing in a game of tig, but if war is being made by a powerful enemy of Great Britain, Ireland cannot hope to escape.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But in 1925&mdash;34 years ago&mdash;the Leader of the Labour Party, with the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and myself&mdash;then just a Deputy of the House&mdash;were able to wring from the representative of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that what we said about Irish sovereignty and what we said about command over our own affairs was true then.  There is not a man or woman in this House but must admit that all that has gone in between was a contribution made from the very soil of Ireland by men, women and children and by every Party, creed and class.</P>
    <P>We tell those responsible for the <Col N="1152" /> present trick that their position is to-day what the position of the Conservative Government was in 1912, 1913 and 1914 and in all that led to the disastrous trampling on this country in the years following by Lloyd George's and other British Governments continued denial of the full integrity of our country and the full rights of our people.  They have learned enough since to know that their country's strength is as much dependent on the strength and neighbourliness of the countries alongside, as it is on their own strength and the internal neighbourly spirit, that will avoid frustration and enable the qualities, the energies and the capacities of the people to be exercised to the full.</P>
    <P>To-day countries of the world are exercising to the full their power to take from the ordinary material elements from which the Creator made the earth.  The minds and character of the people are more constructive and more powerful in achieving even material happiness than all the Creator put into the material earth. This Bill leads people along pure materialism and pure dictatorship and I resist&mdash;and I can speak for every man in the Fine Gael Party&mdash;the invitation to sit down in a back room with members of the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, and decide who shall represent the Irish people, for any spot of Ireland, in this Parliament. We do that openly by the display of our personalities and political and social characters and the organisations that we put together, and we shall continue to do that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will find&mdash;haloed and all as he may be by the past&mdash;that he is welcome to all the haloes and all the glory he can get from the past.  We do not put our haloes and our glory into the scales against him; but we will put our work and the generosity of our minds towards him and towards his colleagues.  We realise the difficulty that leadership on his side has brought to so many of the people and so many of his declared supporters, just as we sympathise with the people of Britain and with the traditional element even <Col N="1153" /> of the Conservative Party in Great Britain, whose actions in 1913 and all along against this country have played a substantial part in ripping Europe to pieces and bringing down around their own heads the problems that exist, not only at their doors, but at nearly every end of the world to-day.</P>
    <P>In this matter we offer the Fianna Fáil Party our fiercest antagonism and our most energetic fight against what they are proposing to blind the people. We do so as honestly, as faithfully and as dedicated to God's glory and the honour of Ireland, as we did in the struggle we put up against the British invasion of our country at that time. We do it in the fullest spirit of people who think that our Constitution should be worthily dedicated to the Most Holy Trinity and that we should be able worthily to say that it follows in the traditional history of our fathers and is dedicated to a true social order here.  We guarantee them all that&mdash;no malice, no bitterness and no aggression; but we do ask them to consider whether, in regard to their proposals here, they cannot find examples in the Old Testament and in the New Testament and in the modern history even of England and of Europe, on which they might very well meditate.</P>
    <P>This, I say, is a great institution. It has gone through great days.  It has been great in its small moments and in its big moments.  It is being demeaned to-day by the fact that a Government and a Government Party, who have had an opportunity of seeing so much in the country, who have been treated with so much tolerance and generosity, should come in here and make, under a deceitful guise, a proposition to this country that is as big and as fierce a bit of aggression on the liberties of our people and of Parliament as was the case when the Conservative Party, even at the risk of bursting parliamentary institutions in Great Britain, began the attack on this country that developed in 1913 and that, in so many queer ways and in spite of much that they might have learned or had an opportunity of learning, has continued even in some <Col N="1154" /> parts of Ireland to-day.  We oppose this measure.</P>

      <P>Many hours and weeks of parliamentary time have been given to the debate on this Bill.  That should suggest to the public the great importance that Deputies on all sides attach to this measure.  In my ten years' experience as a Deputy I do not believe I have ever seen a Bill get such detailed examination and exhaustive discussion.  Section by section, sub-section by sub-section, in fact, paragraph by paragraph, this Bill has been examined and discussed. Nevertheless, it is the only major Bill I have seen during my ten years here that did not require a reprint from the first to the final issue. Not one single paragraph or single comma was altered by all the discussion, all the advice and all the various amendments.  One is inclined to ask oneself: why was there no change in this Bill in particular?  Was there any reason for it?  I suggest there was this reason.  This Bill was deliberately drafted with one set purpose in view, and to change it in any way would defeat what the measure set out to do.  All the paragraphs, sections and sub-sections were so interdependent that to carry out the slightest alteration or to yield to the desires of the Opposition, even on a minor point, would nullify the full effect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government's case in support of the Bill was based on a number of points.  One was that it was essential for stable Government that minority Parties should be deprived of their right of representation in Dáil Eireann.  They suggested that that had been achieved under the direct voting system.  Instances were given of the weakness of the inter-Party Governments in 1948 and 1954.  Instances were also given of the weakness of coalition Governments in various parts of the world, even of some Governments not elected by P.R. at all.  It was made a point of supreme importance by many of the Government's speakers that the people of this country were entitled to decide by their votes what system of election to Dáil Eireann they required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> The Opposition countered the points raised by the Government on the basis that the present system of P.R. gave stable Government, comparable with any country in Europe.  They pointed out that Governments elected under this system here within the past 40 years had a longer life than the Governments elected in Great Britain under the direct voting system.  In fact, it was pointed out, as well it might be, that the present Government, elected under P.R., is numerically&mdash;whatever may be said of it in other ways&mdash;a strong Government.</P>
    <P>The Opposition pointed to the dangers that might arise from this attempt to deprive small groups and Parties of their right to constitutional representation in the Dáil.  They pointed out the dangers that might arise by forcing them into unconstitutional methods to achieve their objects.  They pointed out that the decision to refer this matter to the people was being taken at a time when the economic distress throughout the country was so acute and had such an effect on the people that the issue involved might not receive the consideration to which it was entitled and there was no demand by the public that the Government should put the question to the people at this particular stage. It was pointed out that there was no need for this rush to change a Constitution which had operated satisfactorily for upwards of 21 years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil made a virtue of necessity in this matter, insisting that the issue would be put before the people and it would be the people who would decide.  It is a basic principle of the Constitution, and fundamental to it, that no alteration in the system of voting can take place without the people being consulted.  Were it not for that, we might not have such enthusiasm on the part of Fianna Fáil for the people to decide in this matter. In opposing this Bill we know, just as Fianna Fáil know, that it is the people who will have the final say.  The case we made was not that we wished to deprive the people of their right to decide what system of election we should have, if a change were needed, <Col N="1156" /> but that this was not the opportune time or the appropriate moment at which to put the issue to the people. There were much more serious issues to be tackled first, such as unemployment and emigration; it was our contention that the problems in which the country finds itself should first be solved and then, and only then, should this issue be brought before the people so that they might consider it in the bright sunshine of prosperity and the calm atmosphere of economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out some of the dangers that may follow the abolition of P.R., should the proposed referendum go the way the Government hope it will go.  It has been pointed out by experts, experts who have no particular axe to grind and can examine the matter quite objectively, that on the figures of the last election, and the elections prior to it, it is more than likely that more than 90 per cent. of the Fianna Fáil Party will be returned to power if the system of election is changed to the single non-transferable vote.  Should that happen, to all intents and purposes, for the next ten years, the country will be faced with Government by one major Party and an Opposition so small as to be almost negligible.  That Government, sure of its numerical strength here, will then be in a position to pass legislation, with practically no opposition, altering the system of local government elections so as to ensure the same advantage to their Party in local government as they will have secured here.  It will also mean&mdash;to my mind, this is the most important point&mdash;that, with fewer than 20 Deputies in opposition and with control of the various county councils throughout the country, secured by manipulation and regulation, the right of nomination for the Presidency will be taken from the people and handed over to one Party.  There is a grave likelihood that that will happen.</P>
    <P>If we leave aside all the questions raised by the Opposition and simply confine ourselves to saying that there is no public demand for an alteration in the system of election, if we confine ourselves to the argument&mdash;and it is <Col N="1157" /> true&mdash;that the majority anti-Fianna Fáil vote will be so divided by this ruse that the various sections will not be able to combine to defeat Fianna Fáil and the Government Party will directly gain thereby, if we confine ourselves to the fact that for the next ten years the Government are likely to be faced with an Opposition of ten or 12 Deputies of the various combined Parties, if we are satisfied that one can have dictatorship by Party as well as by the individual, as we know can happen from our experience of Governments in other countries where Party or sectarian rule is supreme, and if we give Fianna Fáil credit for all they say and accept that they believe it is worth paying a price so that the people may have stable Government and it is worth taking all these risks to secure stable Government, then why this rush at this particular time to change the system? Where is the need to do it?  Why must it be done now?</P>
    <P>The argument has been advanced that the constituencies revision due some time this year necessitates the change.  That, of course, is not true. There is machinery in the Constitution for revising constituencies.  That machinery must operate at least once in every 12 years.  It is not laid down anywhere that constituencies cannot be revised more than once in any 12 years.  There is nothing to prevent the Government continuing its normal life span until 1962.  There is nothing to prevent Fianna Fáil deferring this issue for a reasonable length of time. But Fianna Fáil, at the start of this debate, were determined to have this Bill passed through this House at any cost and we were told that this decision should take place by March of this year.</P>
    <P>By the exercise of their rights in this Dáil, the Opposition groups delayed that up to the present day, so much so that we forced Fianna Fáil to depart from the cry that they wished this to be taken as a separate issue, that they wished that the referendum should not clash with the Presidential election.  We forced Fianna Fáil to declare that, because of our action in exercising our rights as <Col N="1158" /> Deputies in fully discussing a measure of fundamental importance to the country, they now have decided that it is essential that the two elections should be held on the same day.</P>
    <P>I wonder does that decision give us a clue to what was behind this Bill from the first?  Would it not suggest to the public that the intention was that the Referendum Bill would be over and done with and that the Fianna Fáil Party could rest secure in the knowledge that at the next election, by virtue of the fact that, the Opposition being divided into various groups, their numerical strength could not be passed on from Party to Party by means of the system of P.R., Fianna Fáil had a safe term in office for the next ten years and that then, with that done, the present Leader of the Government could divest himself of office and go forward to Presidency of the country?</P>
    <P>We were told by the Taoiseach at some stage of the debate on this Bill that the main reason for having this referendum was to find out the will of the people on this matter, that it was not desirable that anything else should over-cloud that issue or clash with it. Since then, the Taoiseach has repeated that, apart from the question of putting the country to double expense, it was not desirable that the referendum and the Presidential election should be held on the same day, but that the Opposition, by their deliberate policy, had rendered that inevitable.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there is the question of expense, but, on a fundamental issue of such importance as to necessitate an alteration in the Constitution, the question of the expenditure of £100,000 or £150,000 should not be made the excuse for obscuring the issue and for holding the Presidential election and the referendum on the same day.</P>
    <P>The two nominees for the Presidency are of national repute, men who in their own way have given long and distinguished service to the country, but they are, unfortunately, men who have taken opposite sides in that most regrettable period of civil war.  These two men will be contenders <Col N="1159" /> for the Presidency.  On the same occasion as the Presidential election is held, amidst the strife and political bitterness that is bound to arise, the question of the manner of electing representatives, in the national interest, will also have to be decided.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Government to proceed with the election of the President in June and, when the turmoil and strife of Party politics have died down, following the result, at a later date, when the people will be able to come to a fair decision in the calm and quiet atmosphere that will then prevail, to hold the referendum. I challenge the Government that, if they refuse that request, they will be found guilty of putting Party above the people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy in the course of his speech in which he dealt with many things, including a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Washington a long time ago, had one main theme at the heart of his discourse and that was that we were reverting to what he described as the British system of election. That system of election is not of British origin but the system of election which is embodied in Article 16 of our Constitution is.  This system of election by transferable vote in constituencies returning more than one member was invented in Great Britain over 100 years ago.  It has been the subject of a great deal of controversy and examination in Great Britain. Many eminent men have urged that it should be adopted there, but the common sense of the British people was against the theorists and when, in 1910, the system was made the subject of an examination by a British Royal Commission, which had been set up by a Liberal Government, it was roundly condemned.  The British attitude towards the particular system which is in operation here has not changed since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that Deputy Mulcahy has a greater regard for this child of a Briton's brains than the British people themselves have, such a regard and affection for it that he is not even prepared to look at its <Col N="1160" /> faults nor at the manner in which the Irish people were led to adopt it.</P>
    <P>In the face of the record, no one can urge that this system was of our devising.  We know how it came to be adopted here.  It crept in under the guise of a Local Government (Ireland) Bill which had its Second Reading in the House of Commons in the year 1919.  The person in charge of that Bill was the then, I think, Attorney General for Ireland, Mr. Samuels, K.C,. and, on the Committee Stage of the Bill, this exchange took place between him and an Ulster Tory: Mr. Samuels advocating the Bill and sponsoring and piloting it through committee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the general election, on the parliamentary franchise, 75 per cent. of the representation has gone over to the Sinn Féin Party.  What is the declared object of that Party?  It is to make local government in Ireland absolutely impossible and to break down British reign and rule in Ireland by capturing local bodies...</P>
    <P>Major O'Neill: Is it not the fact that the right hon. gentleman never mentioned this question of the Sinn Féiners in his speech moving the Second Reading of this Bill?  May we take it that that was the real reason why this Bill has been introduced?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very significant passage.  First of all, it proclaims in undeniable terms what is the provenance of the system which we adopted, and secondly, it proclaims undisguisably what it was hoped that system would accomplish.  It was hoped that that system would accentuate every point of division among the Irish people, that it would make it more difficult to secure that union of opinion and action in Parliament which the British regard as being one of the great factors in their history, the factor that the British people in Parliament have had a reasonable alternative to the Government in power and that that alternative has been secured while being compatible with the greatest degree of unity that permits such an alternative to exist.</P>
    <P>This amendment to the Constitution is now being proposed to the people. <Col N="1161" /> We are not doing any more than submitting our proposal to the people for their judgment; we are not, as Deputy Mulcahy suggested, trying to force it down the throats of the people or to force them to adopt it against their better judgment.  We will have an ample opportunity, I hope, to present our case to the people and the Opposition will have an equal opportunity of doing so.  What we are doing&mdash;we are not appealing to the prejudices of the people as the Opposition are&mdash;is putting this matter to their own sober judgment and asking them, with the knowledge of the history not merely of this country but of other countries to teach them and to guide them, if they are prepared to continue to live under the danger of anarchy and coalition and corruption which is inherent, as the Leader of the Opposition himself admitted, in this system of election by the transferable vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not even Fine Gael were able to absorb them.  Not even when Fine Gael had entered into bargains with them, when they were subservient to these minor Parties, when Clann na Poblachta was wagging, so to speak, the dog of Fine Gael, could Fine Gael maintain a united Party with a consistent coherent policy for more than two or three years. Twice the Coalitions have broken up in this country&mdash;the only two Coalitions which existed here since 1922.  Twice Fine Gael Coalitions have broken up, sometimes on the question of mere imcompatibility of personality, sometimes on the question of policy and sometimes because the minority in the Government was asking too high a price for the appearance of unanimity which was manifested.  In the course of the first Coalition, we saw a fundamental principle of our Constitution violated.  Deputy Mulcahy has been talking about the Preamble to the Constitution and everything that is in it and told us, merely because we are asking the people, in the light of experience, to decide whether or not they want an Article of the Constitution changed, that we are acting unconstitutionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition who was Taoiseach in the first Coalition, threw overboard in this House the Article in the Constitution which provides that the Government shall act with collective responsibility and he disclaimed collective responsibility for <Col N="1163" /> certain statements that had been made down the country by a member of his Government&mdash;statements which, of course, were quite contrary to the avowed policy of the major Party in the Coalition, the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill do?  It asks the people to abolish the present method of election.  I have said elsewhere, and I will repeat it, that the very name of the method of election we have here is a misnomer.  We have never had true P.R. in this country, representation which gives to every Party&mdash;and it can give it only to Parties, not to people&mdash;a place in the Legislature proportionate to the votes which they were given.  We have not got here, as I said, P.R.  We have a different system altogether.  It may give the appearance, and is giving the appearance, of conceding proportionality to some extent; but it is not P.R.  What we have here is election by the transferable vote.  With the degree of individuality which exists among our people, it would be very difficult not only for us to apply the principle of P.R. but to get them to accept the list system as it exists elsewhere. It is only under the list system that the theory of P.R. can be applied and it can be applied only where tightly organised Parties dominate political life.</P>
    <P>On the Continent, an attempt has been made to give effect to the theory of P.R. and it is significant that the system which is in force throughout all the Continent, except, I think, to-day in France, is this list system. But under that system every elector has an equal right.  Every elector has only one vote and can vote only once.  He votes for the Party list. There may be certain refinements with certain variations in use in various countries, but his vote counts only once and he can cast it only once.  It is not possible to have any second, third, fourth or fifth preference because you have the non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>Under the list system&mdash;it has many disadvantages&mdash;there is this virtue, that every elector is the equal of every other and a premium is not put, as it <Col N="1164" /> is under our system, upon dissent.  That system of P.R. requires large constituencies returning numerous members. Arising out of this, it has many defects. There is, first of all, no place in it for the Independent.  There is no place whatever in it for the Independent. There is a place in the system of transferable vote for the Independent and under the system which we are proposing of single member constituencies with representatives elected by the non-transferable vote, there will be a place for the Independent who can command the suffrages of the majority of his neighbours.</P>
    <P>The second defect about the list system is this.  It produces a divorcement of representatives from their electors. The personal relationship which ought to exist as between the representative and the electorate, and his people, is completely broken under this list system of P.R.</P>
    <P>The third defect is that the representatives who are elected under the list system are more responsible&mdash;in fact, in some cases, solely responsible &mdash;to their Party executives rather than to the people who vote to elect them. Therefore, if a representative is not in good standing with the Party boss, his name will not appear at election time upon the Party list.  He will have no chance whatever of being elected or even of standing as an Independent, as I have already mentioned.  The list system, therefore, tends to give control of Parliament to Party bosses, Party executives and because the Party executives are all-powerful in regard to their representatives in Parliament, it leads ultimately to the control of public life by Party bosses and, therefore, to widespread corruption.</P>
    <P>There is a fourth demerit in this system.  It lends every inducement to the ambitious politician to try to gain control of the Party organisation.  If he cannot do this, then it induces him to try to form his own Party.  Thus, once again, you have this influence of an attempt to construct Parliament upon a mathematical basis manifesting its disadvantageous side in the fact that it again tends to create division where it is desirable that union should exist.</P>
    <P>I have said that the list system tends <Col N="1165" /> to make the ambitious politician endeavour to gain control of the Party organisation and that where he is not able to secure control of it, it tends to make him look for an organisation of his own or, if you like, split the Party and form another organisation to further his own particular ends or ideas.  We have an example of that occurring just within the past four days.  When this Bill was having its Second Reading before December, I referred to the parliamentary situation which existed then in Italy.  I pointed out that with the system of P.R. which they had, the number of Parties which it had bred and the general tendency to disruptive action which is inherent in these systems, it was not likely that the then existing coalition of Christian Democrats with Social Democrats would be able to continue and that before very long the Italian Government would be out of office.</P>
    <P>That has happened within the past few days and it has happened for one reason only&mdash;that, first of all, an ambitious politician tried to secure control of the Christian Democrat machine and, secondly, other members of the Christian Democrat Party, formerly Prime Ministers, resolved to contest it and succeeded in breaking up the coalition.</P>
    <P>That is a temptation which exists in every coalition.  It is a temptation which has been shown to exist here beyond denial in the Coalition from 1948 to 1951, when, because of a rift inside the Clann na Poblachta Party, the Fine Gael Coalition was broken up. We have not yet been able to discover what led to the very significant General Election of 1957 when the Leader of a Coalition which then had a strong majority in this House asked the President to grant him a dissolution before the Book of Estimates for the year 1957-58 appeared and before the financial provisions for that year were put before the people.  We do not know what internal stress led the Taoiseach to ask the President for that dissolution but it is quite clear from things said in the course of that election, not by Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, but by supporters of the Labour Party, that we had not that <Col N="1166" /> happy, united family which Deputy J. A. Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, likes to talk about now.</P>
    <P>In order not to get away from the main theme, in order to come back again, may I say that, with the list system of P.R., you have again the fissiparous tendency manifested.  It makes for coalitions; so that the great disadvantage of every variation of the list system, as well as of the system of voting by transferable vote, is that it tends to breed coalitions.</P>
    <P>The system of election by transferable vote has most of the defects which I have mentioned in a greater or lesser degree.  It calls for large constituencies in most districts.  We have avowedly tried in the Electoral Bill of 1947 to get away from that defect and to reduce even the rural constituencies to manageable proportions.  It has given us, I suppose, some degree of stability, but not enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that this system calls in general for large and unwieldy constituencies.  I was pointing out that we endeavoured to counteract that so that we might have the right sort of relationship between the representative and his people which can be found only in the system of election by non-transferable vote and single member constituencies.  In <Col N="1167" /> addition to that, in addition to this weakening of the relationship between the people and the representatives, it makes elections very expensive.  We all know that.  Even in an urban constituency, the cost of conducting an election campaign is becoming oppressive. It must be much more oppressive in large rural constituencies covering perhaps, as some do, not merely part of a county but even two counties.</P>
      <P>Then, as we all know, it leads to the multiplication of Parties and the accentuation of differences&mdash;differences even in Coalitions.  In fact, a Party is driven, when it is within a Coalition, to try to maintain its separate identity to the point of acerbity with every one of its associates.  In order that the Labour Party, say, for instance, might not come to stand in the public mind for everything Fine Gael stands for, the Labour Party, if it happens to be in a Coalition, has to try to set its face against the things the Fine Gael members of the Government would like to do and has to pretend, even when it has yielded to the pressure of the major Party, that in some way it is not responsible for them.  It has to adopt the rôle of a political Herod and wash its hands of the things which its own associates are doing within the Government.</P>
      <P>In addition to all these defects, the system of election which we have here, by transferable vote, has an additional defect.  It gives undue weight to the wishes or the whims even of the cranky voter, of the fellow whose very nature it is to be at variance with everyone else.  There is one great fallacy underlying the whole system.  It assumes that it is of no great moment whether the people are represented in Parliament by those men or women whom they think most closely represent their point of view, that is, by their first choice, or by men or women, by Deputies whose title to sit in Parliament is based on an amalgam of inferior choices.</P>

    <P>If one applied this system of election to a football team, its absurdity would be manifest.  Nobody would have <Col N="1168" /> much regard for a team that was selected on the basis that a player whom the majority of the selectors thought was a fifth or sixth rater was regarded as being just as good as one whom the largest body among the selectors would place first.  People would not have any regard for such a team; because every man knows that only the player who is best fitted for his place is worthy to be chosen for an important occasion.</P>
    <P>No task is more important than the choice of a representative of the people in an area in the national assembly. No assembly can have a more critical function than that of selecting a Government.  Yet, under the system of election by transferable vote, the personnel of a Government and the public policies of a State are determined by, among others, some who were not the first or even fifth, but who may have been the 15th or the 16th choice of the electors who were ultimately responsible for sending them to Parliament. It is contrary to the very nature of things that a system which gives the lower choice of the electors equal validity with their first choice can work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The very nature of the transferable vote changes with every transfer and, with every transfer, changes in an increasing degree.  It starts off in most cases with being a vote for something, with being, that is, positive in its character.  In its ultimate stages, it becomes a vote against something.  It changes its character and, instead of being positive, becomes negative in its direction.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I was saying that because his vote may determine the result of an election, we are going to deal with a peculiar person first. Let us see what happens to his vote. When he goes to the polling booth there may be, probably will be, a candidate rather closely resembling his own point of view and he will vote for him.  His vote will be to that extent positive for that candidate or the Party for which he stands.  Then he votes for the second best man on the list. The second best man may have very little in common with his first choice but at any rate he marks him down. The first choice is all positive but in his second choice he is voting for a person whom he would not put first, and to that extent the positive decision is blended with the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first candidate goes out, the second candidate goes out, and the crank still remains at the firing line. <Col N="1170" /> He has a third choice, but this time the degree of positivity in the vote has become less and he is voting more for the third person because he is against all the rest rather than because he is for the same policy as the No. 1 choice. So it goes right down until, as I have said, at the end we get this extraordinary situation that the voter is voting not for something but against something.  While his first vote may have been intended to advance a policy, his last votes, his final preferences, are designed to prevent other policies from being put into operation.</P>
    <P>This elector's first vote may have had a constructive element in it from his point of view; but certainly his last preferences are destructive in their very nature and that is why, among other things, it is very difficult with this system of transferable vote to get anything constructive done in any Parliament, to get a Party returned with the unmistakable support of the largest section in the community, with the effective driving force in the community behind it, so that with such a force behind it it may be able to carry through a coherent, consistent policy.</P>
    <P>What are we asking the people to accept in exchange for this system which makes it so difficult to get a Government which will have sufficient momentum to carry through any constructive policy?  What are we asking them to accept for this system which tends by its very nature to divide the people, to give an undue place in determining the affairs of the State to the person who likes to be at odds with his neighbour, to the quarrelsome, self-assertive, bumptious elements in the community, rather than to those who are prepared to work with their neighbours in harmony for the common good.  We are giving them this system which has tended, where-ever it has been in operation, to unite within two Parties all the elements in the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Northern Ireland is a special situation.  The great thing about the two-Party system is that on <Col N="1171" /> both sides of every Parliament which is elected upon that basis there are men of very similar points of view. You have in the Conservative Party men who would regard themselves as very advanced in their social outlook. In the Labour Party you have men who certainly could not be regarded, even taking the most liberal view of their principles, as radicals.  The merit of the system lies to some extent in that, because it means that those two Parties tend to converge towards a common centre, tend to have a great deal in common with each other, tend to make the parliamentary system work, because there can be and there is where this system works a great deal of agreement among members of the Front Benches as to what is best in the national interest, a great deal of agreement within the Parties as to what is best in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Moreover it has this merit from the people's point of view, that no Party can have a monopoly of the Government, that whatever the Party in power may be, the people have in front of that Party sitting on the other side of the House a reasonable alternative&mdash;an alternative which will not make for revolution if it should come in, if it should be a Party which is left of centre; nor make for reaction if the Party coming in should be right of centre; but will keep the Government policies towards the centre of the road where the mass of the people in every community want them to be.  It will mean that the affairs of the nation will be shaped and moulded not by the fringes, not by the extremities, but by the good solid middle that exists in every community, the good solid mean that embraces every creed, and every class, and every economic interest within the community.  That is the system which we are offering as an alternative to the system which has been so disastrous wherever it has had an opportunity to work itself out elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been saved the consequences of having that dangerous system here by reason of the fact, as is quite properly admitted, that we had one division between us that is now <Col N="1172" /> passing, and thank God it is passing. We were radically divided on a matter of supreme principle, but we have now come to common acceptance of the fact that Ireland must be an independent nation outside the Commonwealth. Again, we have had the advantage of having an outstanding personality as Leader of our Party and a great spirit of unity, stemming back to the division upon the Treaty, if you like, which has held that Party together. I do not want to decry anything done by any member of any Party that was in favour of the Treaty but we were fortunate in some ways that, at a critical period, we had Mr. W. T. Cosgrave and that he was succeeded at an equally critical stage as head of the Government by Deputy de Valera.  The mere fact that we had these factors in the public life of our country has prevented the system under which we live here from showing all its defects and all its disadvantages.</P>
    <P>When the scene changes, as it is likely to change in a short time, and other men and other Parties and other policies emerge, then the evils of the system may become manifest and, if we are wise in our generation, we will change the system of election.  We will try and get that system which, while providing the people with, let me emphasise, a reasonable alternative to the Government of the day, whatever that Government may be, will tend also to mould the people into the greatest possible degree of union within their respective Parties.</P>

      <P>The very arrogance of the Minister for Health is amusing, and certainly the finish of his speech reminds me of something I read in Dickens.  I forget in which of his novels it was, but it was a description of a death-bed repentance on the part of one of the characters in the book. The Minister's speech reminds me very much of that, and I am just beginning to ask myself very peculiar questions in view of some of the Minister's utterances to which he has just treated us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to tell the House is that I am positively stunned, having heard the last few minutes of the Minister's speech.  Let the various Deputies take what they like out of that.  The Minister has told us that P.R. originated in 1919, in a Local Government (Ireland) Act intended for some specific part of the country. In actual fact it did not; it originated among several of our Nationalist leaders long before 1919, and the records are here to prove that.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question.  The Minister's Party came into power in 1932 and until 1948 they had an unbroken run of Government. They were never out of power once during that time, and they came back to power in 1951 until 1954 for a second period in office.  If P.R. was such a very disastrous method of voting for the Irish people I would like to ask the Minister one plain question&mdash; what were they doing about it from 1932 to 1948?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they did. The Minister is trying to convey that it was the English imposed P.R. but in his speech later on he tried to convey the impression that it was some men, in this country, who insisted on forcing it upon the country.  I shall not go into that.  All I am asking is what was he doing for the first 16 years his Party were in office and why did he not remove it?  Why did the Leader of his Party insist on putting it into the Constitution and make such a terrific song and dance about it?  They did so because they thought that P.R. was a bullet-proof method of election which would allow them to hold office. They thought that it was impossible for Fianna Fáil to be dislodged from office under that system, but they found out the opposite in 1948 and 1954, and now they want to make sure that such a thing will not happen them again. They want to remain in office as long <Col N="1174" /> as their cronies are there to support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

If Deputy O'Malley wants to go on that basis then the Deputy himself will go and a lot of his colleagues with him.</P>
      <P>The second question I want to ask the Minister for Health is, if P.R. is such a bad system of election for the Dáil, why is it retained for the election of the President?  I have asked that question here on a couple of occasions and it has not been answered.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil are very fond of saying that the two periods of Coalition Government were disastrous for this country and that the Coalition Governments did not last long but during the 16 years' period of Fianna Fáil Government we had seven general elections.  We had a general election in 1932, 1933, 1937, 1938, 1943, 1944 and 1948, and the average age of the Fianna Fáil Governments, <Col N="1175" /> with their so-called working majorities or overall majorities, was two years and four months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means no stability under Fianna Fáil because in 1937 Fianna Fáil had an overall majority and later they had nine of a majority in this House.  Perhaps the Minister for Health would tell us why it was necessary, with nine of a majority, to dissolve the Dáil a full year and a half before its normal span of life expired?  I want to say that it is scandalous at this juncture to ask the people to spend £100,000 on this amendment to the Constitution, an amendment which is proposed not for the benefit of the country but for the benefit of one Party.  It is regrettable &mdash;I do say this sincerely&mdash;that the last will and testament which the Taoiseach is leaving is being left to his Party and not to the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is obviously the Fianna Fáil Party he has in mind when he is trying to secure them in office and not the good of the people.  It is a shabby mean testament at the end of a fairly long political career, during which he did a lot of good things, even if he did a lot of bad things also.  It would be a pity to spoil the good side of his picture by leaving such a legacy as this to his Party, a legacy which he thinks will be so good for his Party but which will be so damaging to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my opinion that this Bill, if passed, will sow the seeds of grievous trouble sooner or later.  That is my conviction.  The Minister had a lot to say about P.R. leading to a multiplicity of Parties.  What is wrong with that? Might I tell him that any new Party, nine times out of ten, is started because of the absolute failure of the Government in power to do something that is badly needed for a particular section of the people?  Then these people take the bit in their teeth and say: &ldquo;All right; we supported such a Party, they gave us promises at election after election, but they have not honoured them.  Now we will put our own men <Col N="1176" /> in.&rdquo;  That is what put the Labour Party into this House, and that is what put the Farmers' Party into this House and that is what will put vocational Parties into the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the contempt of the Government for a section of the people that forces forward a Party.  This move will not stop that. I want to assure the Minister for Health that this attempt to bottle the crackpots and the cranks&mdash;as he calls those who vote for anybody but Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael&mdash;will not stop them.  Why should the people, after supporting a Party, as the farmers did, from 1932 to 1943&mdash;they gave Fianna Fáil 11 years in which to honour their promises&mdash;not form another Party if they are not catered for?  During that time Fianna Fáil trampled them into the dust and that gave rise to one of the cases of so-called multiplicity of Parties.  The farmers sent in their own representatives and we got what they sent us in to do, and it was no thanks to Fianna Fáil that we did.</P>
      <P>Apparently we have a new gospel in Irish politics, that is, that anybody who is not for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael is either a crackpot or a crank. That will make very interesting reading for many people up and down the country&mdash;that if they vote No. 1, 2 or 3, as the case may be, for those who do not belong to either of these two Parties, they are either crackpots or cranks.</P>

      <P>If this Bill becomes law, it will lead to very nasty cases of corruption.  Deputy Sherwin, on Committee Stage, gave us a good example of what happened in England&mdash;I think, in Southend.  There will be many Southends in this country.  There are bound to be many such cases because in every constituency you will have a man who can control a certain number of votes.  The candidates going forward will be, to a certain extent, at that man's mercy.  If he is the kind of man who has a price, a very nasty situation can arise.</P>
      <P>Nothing like it could arise under P.R. where, if a man wanted to go forward as a candidate, he was perfectly free to go to the returning officer with his nomination.  Under this proposed system, he can play a very nasty game.  We can have two candidates going forward with fairly equal chances.  If P.R. goes, we can have a third person in a constituency who would jeopardise the person who is almost certain to get the majority. That man, if he is crooked enough, knows his value and can demand his price, and I have not the slightest doubt that instances will arise where an individual will be returned who does not represent the people at all, but who is probably the candidate with the deepest pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the situation which the Minister for Health is trying to bring about, trying to recommend to the people, all for one purpose, that is, that Fianna Fáil will not be dislodged from power.  The real reason for the Bill is not what is happening in Italy or elsewhere&mdash;and all of the Ministers are fond of taking us away from our own country.  However, the cat was let out of the bag by the Taoiseach on the very first day this Bill was introduced. He said that when he was put out of office in 1948 and 1951, many of his supporters asked him what was he going to do about it.  In other words, what was Deputy de Valera, as he then was, going to do to stop Fianna Fáil from ever being put out of office again?  This is his answer. He proposes now to take from the <Col N="1179" /> people the power which they have had for 36 years, to vote No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Now he is going to restrict them to a single &ldquo;X&rdquo;, to a single vote, and he does that at a time when the unemployment figure was never higher and people are being asked to spend £100,000 of their own money to shackle themselves to the Fianna Fáil Party, whether they like it or not.</P>
    <P>The reason is not what happened in Italy or South America&mdash;I forget the other countries which the Minister for Health quoted&mdash;but the reason is, first, that it worked very well in the North. In the last general election there, the candidates in 27 out of 52 seats, more than 50 per cent., were returned unopposed. That is grand for Fianna Fáil&mdash;it will save their election fund a great deal of money.  It will save a good deal of trouble.  All they will have to do is gerrymander constituencies and admirable machinery for such a purpose is provided in this Bill.  After that they will use plenty of money and then they are &ldquo;home and dried&rdquo; and the job is done.  It is a pretty picture, but I do not believe the people will be deprived of their voting rights by this trick, for trick it is.  It is like something tried on the people many years ago by our oppressors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it quite clear at long last that he wants only two Parties in this House.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This is about the best device that could be thought up by Fianna Fáil to make sure the people will have no choice outside two Parties.  At the same time, at the back of his mind when he spoke of two Parties, he hoped for only one.  That is exactly what he meant.  It is a kind of sop to public opinion to say there is to be an Opposition.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for External Affairs and their colleagues, do not intend to have an Opposition.  What they want is a completely autocratic Dáil with all Government on that side and little or no Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the most melancholy and most reprehensible piece of legislation that it was ever attempted to pass through this House.  It is the most melancholy and reprehensible performance on the part of the Government Party.  We listened to the Minister for Health not so long ago representing to the House and the nation that P.R. crept into this country by means of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919 and <Col N="1181" /> that nobody else is responsible for it. As far as this measure is concerned and as far as the House is concerned we are dealing with a system of P.R. which was deliberately introduced here by the Party opposite who now seek to foul their own nest.</P>
      <P>In 1937 the Constitution enacted that election to Dáil Éireann should be by means of the single transferable vote.  When I heard the Minister for Health solemnly assure the House that, if there was anything at all to be said for P.R., it could be said only for the list system which is adopted in continental countries, my mind went back to reports of the debate here in 1937 prior to the enactment of the Constitution where on this side of the House Deputy Costello implored the Minister and his colleagues not to tie the Irish people down to the single, transferable voting system of P.R. and suggested that the country might find it necessary at some stage to adopt some other form of P.R. such as the list system.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues at that time turned down that proposal and solemnly enacted that the single transferable vote should be the method adopted for the election of the people's representative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the system which the Minister now tells us caters for peculiar people, the system under which undue weight is given to the opinion of the cranky voter, the system under which cranks and crackpots are returned to the House, the system which causes the most expensive form of election, the system which tends by its nature to divide the people.  These are some of the litany of faults and failings in the present system that the Minister recited this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand the Minister trying to represent that this system was introduced in 1919 rather than in 1937 by the votes of the Irish people because the Minister has to explain to the people why, if this system has all those faults which he enumerated, he did not advert to them in 1937 when he implored the people solemnly to <Col N="1182" /> enact the system as part of the fundamental document of our nation.</P>
    <P>This measure, if it passes the Oireachtas, if it passes the people, will give no chance whatsoever of new political growth in this country, at a time when many thinking people are of the opinion there is a need for a new political growth.  Each Minister and each member of the Fianna Fáil Party who spoke here made no secret of that.  They made it quite plain that this is a measure for the destruction of minorities, a deliberate effort to destroy the voice of the smaller elements in this country and an effort to make sure that into this House there will not percolate the views of minorities.  So that, if the measure goes through, there is no doubt whatsoever about it that any effort by a new political growth will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The measure of the belief that the Fianna Fáil Party have in their own Bill is reflected by the nature of the speeches which have emanated from their Front Bench.  We have been told by the Minister for External Affairs that the present system was a British system foisted upon us.  We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was a French system and that it broke down in France.  We have been told by the Minister for Defence that it was an obviously ridiculous system although I am quite sure that the Minister for Defence as a youth, with his father, assisted in enshrining it in the Constitution.  The same Minister has told us that it was a system without any logical or democratic basis.  If all this be true of the Constitution in 1959, surely it was true of the Constitution in 1937.</P>
    <P>It was sickening to find the Minister for Health revelling in what he described as the swan song of the Farmers' Party in this country and anticipating with pleasure the destruction of the Farmers' Party in this agricultural country.  It typifies the attitude, not of the Fianna Fáil back benchers who, I am quite sure, are as dubious about the value of the measure as we are, but the attitude of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil who are simply trying to steamroll this measure through the House because, <Col N="1183" /> in 1948, P.R. was able to produce an alternative Government to the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has wandered over the ground in such detail as to be in many respects confusing. The issue, however, is very simple.  It is a question of securing an electoral system in this country which will work for the benefit of the country.  After a sober appreciation of our own history for well-nigh 40 years, we have come to the conclusion &mdash;and this is the only reason this Bill is advanced&mdash;that it would be in the interests of the country to change to the direct system.</P>
      <P>The reasons for that are, in the first place, on the logic of it, the system of direct voting will give a workable Government and will also reflect by and large the general feeling of the community as well as and probably better than any other fancy academic system.  That is human experience where it has been tried.  It will give you a Government which can democratically perform its task and lead the country and that is proved, as has been shown, in the debate, not only on the history of the direct system where it has been tried but also on the failures of the alternatives where they have been tried.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the system is actually more sensitive to public feeling than the system of P.R., which tends to a certain stagnation.  I cannot understand the logic of Opposition speakers who talk about the fixing of any particular group in power for all time under this system.  If there is anything that P.R. tends to do, it is to bring about a certain stagnation of pattern, a lot of small groups with certain interests; they tend to stagnate and the country as a whole suffers. That has been the experience.  I would go so far as to say, and to point out again, that this country has been saved the evils of Coalition largely because one Party would not play the game of political musical chairs that this system of P.R. almost invariably degenerates into.  I would put it in the form of a <Col N="1184" /> question: let anyone ask himself what would it have been like if, in 1948, or at any other period, we all got into this bargaining business.  Goodness knows, before the last election there was effort enough made to drag us into this bargaining.  If every Party in the House had been bargaining and prepared to bargain for office, what would the outcome have been?  That is a fair question and I have used the simile, &ldquo;political musical chairs&rdquo;.  I have said that it is the almost inevitable result of P.R. once all the Parties go into the market.  That is one reason for our attitude.</P>
    <P>We have been taken to task, and the last speaker took us to task to know what is the difference between 1937 and the present day.  Very well.  It was perfectly fair to give the system a trial.  I will answer the question, what is the difference between 1937 and 1959?  The difference is this, that in the interim period we had two experiments of Coalitions.  Both experiments blew up internally.  It was not anything that the one solid opposition to the Coalition did.  The first experiment blew up because the Ministers of the Coalition Cabinet could not agree and it blew up in recrimination and all the unfortunate things that attend an internal blow-up.</P>
    <P>The second Coalition broke up in precisely the same way.  One of their supporters took a different line and stampeded the Coalition into a general election, and that at a time when the country needed a firm Government to see it through its economic difficulties, that at a time when there was very real economic difficulty in the country.</P>
    <P>I shall not go over all that political history again but it is true to state that the first Coalition went out leaving the country in a position that demanded drastic action to restore the economic order.  The second Coalition went out under such circumstances that the words, &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, &ldquo;disaster&rdquo;, were freely used on all sides and Deputy Costello, when he was Taoiseach, just before he went out was appealing for this, that and the other thing and the Minister for Finance was taking drastic action, and so forth, all because Coalition Governments were too weak to <Col N="1185" /> take time by the forelock and to prepare for eventualities that anybody could see were coming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic situation in this country now is much better than it was when you took office and it is getting better still.  But we can deal with that on the Vote on Account.  The economic situation is better than what it was when your Government blew up and left the country in a bad way.</P>
      <P>The contention here is that it is no argument to say you changed your mind since 1937.  The fact is we are facing realities.  We had two disastrous coalition experiments; and it is in order to try to save the country from similar experiments in the future that many people are supporting this measure.  It is best to have a system where you can get a single-minded Government, if you are to operate the two sides of the House system.  I will not by-pass into academic arguments about different types of federations and so on.  We have a particular political set-up and a particular type of Constitution here, traditionally and actually enacted.  With that particular political framework, I believe P.R., in the long run, can result only in disaster. The only method of working it is to have the direct system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is about stagnation and the sensitivity of the system.  The great thing about the direct vote system is that it is more sensitive to public opinion.  If you have swings of public opinion, P.R. tends to damp them out.  The other system will give due expression to change in public opinion.  Not only has it the advantage that it will give us a Government firm enough in office to do its work, but it also gives the people a better method of changing the Government quickly and decisively when they want to change, without having the desperate risk of a stalemate. The only Government that can function for any period is a Government fairly sure of its support for a period.  It is a good thing to have a <Col N="1186" /> Government in a position where it can appeal to the people and get a direct answer, when it so wishes.  I am afraid Fine Gael has made this argument in another way.  I should like to suggest to the people who mention that certain political groups are liable to be extinguished by this that I disagree.  If a movement is strong enough to command the support of the people, it can more easily secure election under the direct system than under P.R.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the origin of P.R. in this country, but the plain fact is that, up to the 1918 general election, you had a system of direct voting.  Is it not a remarkable answer to the people who talk about trying to exclude people and drive them to other methods that the fact is this: in 1918, after a succession of by-elections, some of which were won and lost under the system, Sinn Féin could sweep the country under the direct system?</P>

Is it a coincidence that, after that experience and after finding that the people could so effectively express their will, the British Government introduced P.R. in order to try to prevent such things occurring and to stabilise and secure the representation of a failing minority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with facts.  The fact is I made a certain statement about the 1918 election.  I do not think that can be contradicted. I make it merely as a factual statement, <Col N="1187" /> that after the 1918 election it was the British Government proposed P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let anyone interpret those facts, if he likes.  I am entitled to draw my own conclusions from them as well as anybody else. The net points I am trying to make are these.  The system being proposed has the advantage of giving effective Government and of being sensitive enough to public opinion to enable the public more readily to express their will more decisively than under the existing system.  The answer in regard to 1918 was an answer to some of the things said on the other side, as was my answer about Coalition Governments and our experience there.  They are two sufficient answers to the arguments that have been made.</P>
      <P>I think this Bill should pass.  It is a very good thing that every interested person and Party should argue this on its merits as far as possible, but I fail completely to understand a mentality that seeks to prevent and to block the people from giving their decision democratically through a referendum. I completely fail to understand the mentality that seeks to do that in the name of democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>After this rather interesting but fatuous treatise on P.R. by Deputy Vivion de Valera, one finds it rather difficult to speak with the expected measure of restraint in a discussion such as this.  That is particularly true when we reach the last stages of a discussion on P.R. and the principles incorporated in this Bill, by which it is sought by this Government to change the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had better deal with first things first.  Allegations have been made in this House and outside it, principally by the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Defence and, just now, by Deputy Vivion de Valera, that the system of P.R. as we have it in this country was imposed on us by the British <i>ab initio</i> and by British initiative.  Nothing is further from the <Col N="1188" /> truth.  A P.R. society existed in England for very many years prior to the Home Rule Bill of 1912 and the subsequent Act of 1914, which is the same, word for word.  There was also in this country, from the year 1911, a P.R. society.  Some of the original members of that society are still living, and they can and must bear witness to what I now say and will say in relation to the history of the P.R. system of voting as we have known it down the years.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Home Rule movement here and in the British Parliament, the Irish P.R. Society of 1911, which included, by the way, the late Arthur Griffith, whose ideals cannot be impugned and in relation to whose work for Ireland I challenge anybody to say anything by way of disparagement, were so captivated with the fundamental principle&mdash;they were not alone; there were various other groups and societies throughout the country, which could make their voices felt, equally enamoured of the idea of P.R. &mdash;that they reached the stage where, first of all, they consulted with the late Mr. John Redmond, the late Mr. John Dillon and the late Mr. Joe Devlin; and it was as a result of these successful conversations and negotiations that a deputation from this country, composed of Irishmen of the most liberal thought, went to London and there saw Mr. Birrell.  It was as a result of their efforts and as a result of the logic displayed in the course of their arguments as to how P.R. would give the best and the fairest results in a country fraught with trouble and constituted of so many varying minorities that it was agreed to adopt the P.R. system.</P>
    <P>It is enshrined in Section 9, subsection (2) of the Home Rule Bill of 1914 that in all constituencies, from three member constituencies up, the system of P.R. would operate for election to what was to be known as the Irish House of Commons.  Likewise, the 40 Senators who were to constitute the Senate envisaged in that Bill, representing four constituencies based on the four provinces of Ireland, were to be elected on a system of P.R.  The fate of the Home Rule Bill is now a matter of history, but the text is there, <Col N="1189" /> and the proof is there to show what led the British Government to incorporate in the Bill the principle of P.R. It was incorporated because Irishmen of the most loyal objective and with the purest of motives persuaded Mr. Birrell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for the history of P.R. in so far as it is applicable to what is now history, namely, the Home Rule Act of 1914.  The shelving of that Act during the First World War did not prevent people from keeping in mind the electoral advantages to be derived from the application of P.R. as an electoral system.  I should like Deputy Gilbride to be here to listen to this.  He would be very interested in what I am about to say.</P>
      <P>The first place where P.R. was tried was in the local election to the Sligo Corporation in 1918.  Much of what I am about to say now will be said mainly because Deputy Gilbride, instead of using the privilege and opportunity afforded to him here of coming in here and contradicting statements he considered worthy of refutation or contradiction, saw fit to adopt another course.  By himself, or through the medium of some scribe in Fianna Fáil Headquarters, he chose to travel instead into the <i>Sunday Press</i> last Sunday and into the <i>Sligo Champion</i> on the 24th of this month.  On the occasion of the Second Reading here Deputy Gilbride crept into the House, stood up subsequently to speak like a man of purpose, with a message &mdash; a message of truth, or one purporting to be so&mdash;and he proceeded to tell us the details not alone attendant upon the Sligo election but those preceding it also.</P>
      <P>At column 1973 of Volume 171 of the Official Report, he stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I had no intention of intervening in this debate but I happen to represent the area in which P.R. was first tried out and, reading some of the things which have been said, <Col N="1190" /> I felt compelled to put the facts on record.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He felt compelled to &ldquo;put the facts on record&rdquo;.  Deputy Gilbride continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Speaking here on 26th November as reported at column 1009 of Volume 171, Deputy J.A. Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;...for the first time in this country and the adjoining country of Great Britain elections were held in Sligo under the principles of P.R.  That was not done at the dictate of the British Parliament. It was done at the request of the people of County Sligo because they found that the other system, the system that the Taoiseach wants to impose upon this country for parliamentary elections and to impose for all time, caused complete chaos in their local affairs.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilbride went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That statement is without foundation and, therefore, completely wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on in the same column, with a sob in his voice, about the conditions that existed in the Sligo of that day, as he purported to know it.  He deals with the inability of the then corporation to strike a higher rate than they were allowed to strike. Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The corporation asked for leave to strike a higher rate and, following on further agitation by the people and the corporation, a Bill was passed in the British Parliament giving the corporation the necessary power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One cannot quarrel very much with that thus far, but he made some further comments and this is where Deputy Gilbride purports to contradict Deputy Costello.  He says that Deputy Costello's statement was without foundation and therefore completely wrong, namely, that P.R. had been asked for by the people of Sligo themselves and was not imposed on them by anyone else. Deputy Gilbride comes into the House and tries to put it across that it was <Col N="1191" /> at the dictates of the British Government that P.R. was incorporated in the Sligo Election Act.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A condition of the passing of that Bill was that P.R. would be accepted.  The corporation had to pay the costs of having that Bill passed and they amounted to the tidy sum of £986 17s. 7d.&rdquo;</P>

I assert it is a falsehood, made without any evidence to substantiate it, and, indeed, with no evidence either in Deputy Gilbride's subsequent leap into print last Sunday in the <i>Sunday Press</i> or in the <i>Sligo Champion</i> of the 24th January, 1959, with each of which I shall deal a little later.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a later stage in the debate, I challenged the veracity of Deputy Gilbride's statement, that the insertion of P.R. as an electoral system into the provisions of the Sligo Election Act was a condition precedent to their getting permission to have such an Act.  I still challenge that assertion and I label it a falsehood, in the absence of evidence to show that it was imposed as a condition precedent to the permission which the Sligo Corporation of that day, and, indeed, the Sligo townspeople, sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was happening at that time in Sligo?  Prior to 1898, the Corporation of Sligo was in the hands almost <Col N="1192" /> entirely of Unionists.  After the extension of the franchise in 1898, the Corporation of Sligo fell into the hands almost exclusively of Nationalists, but due to this low ceiling of rate levying, they could not go beyond a certain figure.  Neither Corporation could make any of the headway they would have liked to make in providing amenities for their town.  There were considerable local differences of opinion.  It was felt locally that if they could get a corporation representative of all sections of the community something could be done. The ratepayers had an association there.  The townspeople met in a gathering of their own.  The existing corporation, significantly enough, in the beginning opposed the suggestion that the principle of P.R. should be enshrined in the proposed Bill and subsequent Act.  However, popular demand carried the day.</P>

      <P>As a result of the efforts of the Sligo people and by mutual agreement, the election to the corporation that year was carried out on the principles of P.R., and the results were remarkable in many ways. In relation to the number of votes cast for each Party, it gave almost the identical number of seats they would have got if one had taken the total number of votes cast and worked the matter out mathematically.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to weary the House by again going into the figures of that time, but I must say, in answer to the people who tell us, in 1959, that the people of this country do not understand P.R., that in Sligo, in 1918, when it was tried for the first time, with an almost 11 per cent. illiterate vote, only a little over 1 per cent. of the votes were spoiled.  That is a considerably smaller percentage than the percentage spoiled, for instance, in the Constitution voting of 1937.</P>
      <P>Let us see what was said about it at that time and about the result.  The <i>Sligo Independent</i> said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sligo has the honour of being the first municipality in Ireland to adopt the principle...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to adopt the principle&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...and everyone agrees that it was a great success.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the <i>Sligo Independent.</i>  At that time, the <i>Sligo Champion</i> said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system has justified its adoption.  We saw it work; we saw its simplicity; we saw its unerring honesty to the voters all through. We also saw the result of the final count and we join in the general expression of those who followed it with an intelligent interest that it is as easy as the old way.  It is a big improvement and it is absolutely fair.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back to Sligo.  It was so successful at that time, and the result was recognised as being so fair and so just, that many local authorities passed resolutions asking that it be adopted all over the country, and it came in in 1919 as a result&mdash;asked for by Irishmen for Irishmen.</P>
      <P>In 1922, it was brought into the Constitution and I do not think it will be suggested that the people responsible for the drafting of the Constitution in 1922 were actuated by any other motive than the welfare of the country for which they had worked so hard.  It continued to be our system of election from that time in 1922 up to 1937, when we got another Constitution. In 1922 when P.R. was recognised here for its fairness to minorities, recognised as a charter of liberal thought, it was abolished by the Stormont authorities as a system of election for local elections.</P>
      <P>In the year 1929, while it still remained operative here, it was abolished by the Stormont authorities as the system of election for parliamentary elections.  It is now proposed, by the Fianna Fáil Party supporting the Government, to ignore the protection to which minorities are entitled and to discard all care for the rights which are theirs, by adopting the system which was taken up in Northern Ireland in 1922 and 1929&mdash;manifestly as a move to destroy minority rights and discard all care for the protection to which they were entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>P.R. has been recognised as the charter of freedom for minorities.  It has been described by eminent church authorities as a unifying and healing force.  Why, in the face of its fair working and the stability which it has given, do the Fianna Fáil Party seek <Col N="1197" /> to remove it?  The true reason, of course, was given by the Taoiseach himself, the Minister for External Affairs, and by practically all their colleagues in the Government, and to-night by Deputy Vivion de Valera. Mainly it is that, as a system, it failed to continue Fianna Fáil in power from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957.</P>
    <P>Have we reached the stage in this country where we are to identify stability in government with a particular Government in perpetuity?  That would appear to me to be the result which Fianna Fáil seeks to get from this Bill and subsequently from the referendum.  Is stability to be equated with Fianna Fáil in perpetuity?  Are our minorities, big or small, to be described as they were described to-night by the Minister for Health as cranks elected here by crackpots?</P>
    <P>Everybody has a right to seek entry into this Parliament.  This measure is designed to prevent people coming into this Parliament.  This measure is designed as a sort of <i>ex cathedra</i> performance to give the Fianna Fáil Party the right to judge who are the people to come in and what is the policy that should be allowed to come in with those people. Surely in a democratic State such as we hope this is&mdash;and we hope it will continue to be&mdash;it is the right of anybody or any group to be able, without fear or favour and without resort to corruption, to take their places in this House.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party are loyal to the principles of P.R. because they protect minorities and give fair representation.  It cannot be denied that if the principles of P.R. had not been incorporated in the Constitution of 1922, the Fianna Fáil Party would have found it extremely difficult then, when they were a minority, or even now, to come into this House.  It is true that by P.R. they came in here and now they propose to abolish it in order that they may stay here, because, if justice or equity is to prevail and if the people are to exercise the franchise in relation to the policies which they can trust and which have <Col N="1198" /> been put into operation, they know that at the next general election, under the system of P.R., they would not be the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, what is the best thing to do?  Get rid of it; try to abolish it and form single member constituencies with the non-transferable vote, so that on the figures which I have no doubt all the experts have gone into with great care, they will be able in the first event, at any rate, to get a majority of seats.  What will happen then?  On Second Reading, I mentioned <i>The Last Hurrah</i> in which Edwin O'Connor said: &ldquo;The Ninth Ward Democratic Club&mdash;such was the homogeneous structure of this ward that there was no Ninth Ward Republican Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The wonderful effects of having a one member constituency have been portrayed for us time and time again. We were told how close the Deputy would be to his people; how, with a small constituency, he would recognise their needs in a much more intimate manner and how he can be a better Deputy and give better results to his people.  I would accept that view if I were dealing with any other Party but the Fianna Fáil Party, because I know what will happen. Whatever slender majority they might have, every effort will be made to strengthen and increase it by the use of State patronage and State moneys. What hope is there in circumstances such as those, in an atmosphere almost of political tyranny, of getting a constitutional Opposition to reach a stage where it would be able to oust the tyrant&mdash;not constitutionally, but probably by other means?</P>
    <P>Do the people of this country want an ultimate atmosphere of discontent and unrest that will most likely emanate from this dastardly system as it would be operated if, by any unfortunate chance, this referendum should be successful?  What are the divisions, vocational, professional, industrial, agricultural or any other, that will divide our people on matters of policy in a small single member constituency?  Ours is not the kind of country which can be compared, as <Col N="1199" /> Deputy Moloney invites me, with the United States of America, where you have heavily concentrated industrial areas, rural areas and a great cleavage between wealth and all the other elements that make up the different grades of society.  The same situation obtains in Great Britain.  Even in Great Britain there is considerable volume of support for the view that their system as operated now is not fair because it deprives so many million people of representation in Parliament. How can anybody assert that the same conditions applicable in the United States or Great Britain are applicable here in a country where we are all more or less the same with no great division between us either in money, land or anything else?</P>
    <P>What makes the smallholder in the West of Ireland a Conservative while a similar smallholder beside him is either a Radical or a Socialist?  What economic circumstances or what kind of thought do the Government think would operate to make those people different?  The answer is nothing but the bitterness that has divided neighbours of that kind down the years.  That was the tone of speeches by Ministers of this Government when they tried to tell us that P.R. was imposed on us by the British, when they talked about the Lloyd George Treaty and when the Minister for Health, this afternoon, for well over an hour, with the most vituperative bitterness, attacked the Fine Gael Party.  Then, in the end, he wanted to leave the House appearing to be the grand benign fellow hoping for peace, hoping for a forgetfulness of the times that were&mdash;after spending a whole hour in trying to revive bitterness.</P>
    <P>In addition to the single-member constituency and the single non-transferable vote, this Bill enshrines another principle, that is, that a commission be set up to revise the constituencies and to carve out the country into little boroughs.  Who will compose the commission?  The President, first of all, at the request of the Government, will appoint a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge who will be the chairman of <Col N="1200" /> the commission.  Three members will be chosen by the Taoiseach from the Government side of the House and three members will be chosen by the Ceann Comhairle of the day from what he judges to be the Opposition.</P>
    <P>With, say, the referendum a success, the single-member constituency and non-transferable vote in operation and the hoped-for result for Fianna Fáil of probably 100 seats in this House on a minority vote, who would the Ceann Comhairle be?  Fianna Fáil smashed to smithereens the principle of continuity in the Chair of this House which was established by the first Government.  With a Ceann Comhairle of their own choice, judging absolutely who was Opposition, and judging absolutely the members he would choose from that Opposition, in spite of the best efforts of the most pure-souled judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court, you would get a result that would put gerrymandering in Northern Ireland to shame.  That is the purpose&mdash;nothing else.  We have seen it before.</P>
    <P>We have been tinkering with P.R. before here in what might be described as a mild way.  We saw the majority of the larger-seat constituencies reduced to three seats.  That was tinkering in the hope and knowledge that, with 51 per cent. of the votes cast, Fianna Fáil would get two seats.  That was gerrymandering.  What was it but gerrymandering to take the Gort area of Galway and put it into the Taoiseach's constituency in Clare? What was it but gerrymandering to reduce the number of seats in Mayo from four to three and to take away the area of East Mayo and put in the Newport-Mulranny-Achill area instead? The voting strength there was known, as was the voting strength in the other area.  By taking away one it weakened the Opposition and by putting in the other it strengthened the Fianna Fáil Party.  That action was not guided by any kind of directives of social justice, equality or anything else.  It was political expediency of the worst kind.</P>
    <P>What exactly, then, do we hope for from this proposed change?  Nothing, in my view, save further despair, nothing <Col N="1201" /> save a further loss of hope by our people.  If they are to expect from a Fianna Fáil Government, 100 strong, what they have been getting deliberately from a Government of the present majority, which is very big, how can the people have any hope in the future?</P>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera, commending the new system to us this afternoon, talked first of the logic of it.  He said that what he meant by the logic of it was that the new system would give us a workable Government, that is, a Government democratically able to perform its task.  What is wrong with the present Government?  It has been democratically elected.  It is a workable Government, if a majority is an indication.  Why can it not perform its task?  It knows it cannot perform the task it expressly, and in some cases impliedly, promised it would.  It knows that defeat from a disappointed, deceived and disillusioned people is the inevitable result of such failure.  It looks around to find out what is the next method whereby jokers can be pulled out of political sleeves: &ldquo;Ah! We will abolish P.R.  We will confuse the people.  We will draw a smoke-screen over our incompetence and our inability to do what we promised to do and we will divert the people's minds from the issues before them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera said the proposed system is more sensitive to public opinion.  How could a system which makes the voter no longer a voter, in the derivative sense of being able to choose, be more sensitive to public opinion than P.R. which gives him so many choices, so many preferences and enables him to assess the merits of the different people and vote in that order for the different people for whom he is called upon to vote?</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera complained that P.R. brings about a system whereby you could play political musical chairs, and that there might be bargaining.  It may be that one can steel oneself to close the mind to facts or that it is the political philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Vivion de Valera to choose a memory so short that they cannot remember <Col N="1202" /> the bargaining of 1951, the musical chairs of 1951, that extended from city constituencies to the furthermost constituency in this country in order to get the necessary support to have themselves elected as a Government.</P>
    <P>Do they forget that bargaining?  Do they forget that wonderful round of musical chairs when people sped through the night on long journeys to near country districts and far country districts trying to effect a bargain which they did in fact effect?  Coalition is to be regarded, according to Deputy Vivion de Valera, as a disaster. What is disastrous about men of different groups putting aside their detailed differences and adopting a common plan designed to achieve the betterment of this country as they see it?  Remember this, that the average life of the two Coalition Governments here is longer than the average life of any Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>We have been treated in the course of this whole debate to various examples of P.R., the merits and demerits of different systems of it almost from China to Peru.  China was not mentioned, of course.  Nobody on the Government side of the House, in pointing out the evils that befell European countries as a result of P.R. explained what kind of P.R. was in operation there at the time.  Anyhow, nobody proved that any calamity that befell a country in Europe was due in any way to the electoral system they had.  All the other factors were ignored but this whole barrage of geographical evidence is being brought in to frighten the more timid of our people into believing that mountains will fall down on top of them if they do not accept this last piece of trusteeship on the part of the Taoiseach; they are to be the beneficiaries of a testator who will be their moral trustee.</P>
    <P>Nobody on the Government side of the House has told us, apart from the fact that it failed to elect Fianna Fáil twice, how P.R. does not operate in this country as well as the non-transferable single-member constituency vote.  We have been treated to examples from all over the world but nobody has dealt with Ireland.  I want some speaker from the Fianna Fáil side <Col N="1203" /> of the House, particularly a Minister of State, to deal with Ireland and to say here categorically why the present system has not been successful in giving the people the kind of Government they should have, apart of course from the spurious argument that coalitions were bad, coalitions that built more houses, more roads, more hospitals, and improved social welfare conditions to a greater extent in their short period of time than the present Government in its whole period of 20 years or more.</P>
    <P>Apart from that spurious reason, give us some reason electorally, if you like to describe it that way, that might commend itself to us or to the people. I venture to say that this Government and their spokesmen are not doing well with the people on this issue.  The people suspect them and rightly suspect them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health told us this evening that there was room for Independents under the proposed system, and he talked about widespread corruption.  Under the new system, if it begins to operate under Fianna Fáil, the corruption will be so widespread that a member of a political Party, not to mind an Independent, would not have a chance of beating them down.  If the people are foolish enough to give a majority to this referendum and to accept this proposal of the Government, the only way in which it can be changed afterwards will be through unrest, and through methods of which we have had sufficient already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill, or Government spokesmen say its purpose is, to wipe out not one small Party in this House, not two, but every Party other than Fianna Fáil.  It might be gathered from some of their speeches &mdash;though certainly not from that of the Tánaiste who regarded Fine Gael as a surplus Party&mdash;that all they wanted was Fianna Fáil on the one hand and Fine Gael on the other, and to wipe out the Labour Party.  It might be thought that what was wanted was to wipe out Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, the National Democrats <Col N="1207" /> and the Independents, and keep Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>That is not the view that I have, and that is not the view I am allowed to have by reason of the statement of the Minister for Local Government who said in this House: &ldquo;If this referendum goes through Fine Gael &lsquo;will have had it.&rsquo;&rdquo; What can we expect of the standard of public morality that dictates a denial of that in the face of its true reporting by men of honour in the Press of this country who subsequently stood over it?  What can we expect from a Government that might be returned in such strength under the system which they propose?  The Minister for Local Government made that statement and he used the radio of this country four times to deny it.  He used the services of his Department, through his private secretary, to deny in the Press that he made that statement when, in fact, he made it as just an ordinary Deputy in this House speaking to a Bill.  He has never apologised to the people whose competence he so questioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to deal with one aspect of this Bill.  Several speakers here have suggested, from time to time, that no ordinary Deputy of Fianna Fáil, at any time down through the years, has criticised the system of P.R.  Even one of the leading national newspapers saw fit, during the past few days, to comment on the same lines.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I should like to say that in my short time in political life&mdash;since 1954&mdash;I was always against this system and notwithstanding the fact that certain members of the Coalition would suggest that I was in favour, at our Party meeting, of retaining it and that I tore up some mythical maps and such things, I am on record on the 14th April, 1954, as speaking at a public dinner at which the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, was guest of honour.  I then expressed the hope that very shortly P.R. would be abolished.  Again, speaking on the 9th March, 1957, speaking in public after the count for the general election, I said the following, which I quote from the <i>Limerick Leader:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hope, too, that this will be the last election held under the P.R. system, a system which was introduced into this country by an alien Government for the purpose of splitting the old Sinn Féil Party.  The system can be changed by means of a referendum under the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> did not take much notice of what I had to say.  At least it shows that there were people in my Party&mdash;and there are far more than have spoken here&mdash;who have been against this system down the <Col N="1209" /> years.  I cannot say the same for the Fine Gael Party.  Their followers all over the country know how evenly they were divided when that matter came up for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, if Deputy Lindsay so insists.  It is a well-known fact that Fine Gael were divided on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the same diatribe and expressions of consternation about the proposal to go to the people that we had when the Constitution&mdash;now quoted so glibly&mdash;went to a referendum in 1937.  It ill becomes Deputy Lindsay, or any member of Fine Gael, to criticise Fianna Fáil for bargaining.  They have a sorry history in that respect.  I do not want to go over the ground again but what happened in 1948 when the first Coalition was being formed and again at the start of the second Coalition is well known.  People all over the country, of all shapes of political opinion, are asking what is the purpose of Fine Gael in dragging this matter out.  They say: &ldquo;Have we not sufficient intelligence to understand what the issue is?&rdquo; I do not think any credit is reflected on the Fine Gael Party by their tactics in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Bill go to the people and let the people decide.  Is it not extraordinarily illogical for any speaker on that side of the House to criticise the Irish people for what they might do in the future, in supporting a measure of their own free will?  Is it not extraordinary, too, that Fine Gael particularly should criticise us for going to the people under Article 16 of the Constitution, when they themselves, on two occasions, denied an opportunity to the Irish people to decide very major issues which were at stake, but decided them here in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard the old argument from almost every speaker on that side <Col N="1210" /> of the House.  It is that if a Fianna Fáil candidate gets 2,000 votes, a Fine Gael candidate gets 1,500 and a Labour candidate gets 1,000, the combined Fine Gael vote plus Labour is more than the Fianna Fáil vote and that therefore the vote is against Fianna Fáil.  Would you not add the Labour vote to the Fianna Fáil vote and say that the combined Fianna Fáil and Labour vote is more than the Fine Gael vote?  Would you not add the Fine Gael vote to the Fianna Fáil vote and argue likewise, or is it a fact that the Fine Gael Party does not want ever to aim at being the sole Government in this country?  Must they always have some &ldquo;suckers&rdquo; tagging along behind them, until they can get rid of what, in their eyes, are leeches?</P>
    <P>I do not consider the Labour Party to be &ldquo;suckers&rdquo;.  From time to time some of their speakers have made major contributions on various problems in this House, particularly on matters of social welfare and health.  I think very sound principles have been enunciated by them.</P>
    <P>However, there is another aspect of this matter which has not been sufficiently commented on.  It is the fact that under the present system minorities are created.  They have been created in the past.  We have a Party in this House at present which calls itself the Farmers' Party, Clann na Talmhan.  They represent an outpost of civilisation over on the west coast but surely they do not suggest to the people that they are the Farmers' Party?  The Farmers' Party are represented here in our own Party alone. We represent large farmers and small farmers and certainly Clann na Talmhan do not.  It is just an example of the system that creates such a Party.  I do not suggest that those in Clann na Talmhan are head cases, but there is a possibility, and it has happened in the past, that peculiar people have been elected to this House.  I suppose we have a share of them on this side, too, but what I mean to convey&mdash; I am leaving myself very open&mdash;is that the day will end with the abolition of P.R., when every single crank and &ldquo;nut&rdquo; can jump before what might <Col N="1211" /> be termed a dissatisfied electorate and put his case before them.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has pointed out, on the Second Reading, these people in small groups and small Parties who can never hope, and know that they can never hope, to form a Government, can promise so much to the electorate that very often there is a certain section of the community, a very small percentage, who are gullible enough to believe them.  Under the P.R. system that gullible voter, uninitiated, possibly uneducated, is catered for by these head cases.  The new system will definitely give stability. Some Deputy, I am not sure who, said we will have 14 Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  If that is so, it is a marvellous tribute to Fianna Fáil, to think the Irish people are going to give us over 100 seats.</P>

If the Deputy heard his own speakers he would not be so anxious to throw in that reference to gerrymandering. When the Irish people decide this issue in June there will not be, I think, an election until 1961, and then we will be under the new system.  By-elections, in the meantime, I think, will be fought under the old system.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I wish to mention and I am not afraid of getting my knuckles rapped by what has been called the Party top brass. You can say anything you like at our meetings and you will not be thrown out on your ear.</P>

      <P>Some of the speakers are asking why is the Presidential election under the system of P.R., and why are local elections fought under the system of P.R.  I will give my personal opinion on this matter.  I admit we are not discussing the system of elections to the local <Col N="1212" /> authorities but I wish to refer to what almost all the speakers over there said. They tried to show that Fianna Fáil is completely illogical by bringing in this system, and no mention has been made of changing the system of elections in local authorities.  I personally see no reason why it should be changed.  Let the Deputy listen to that and write it down in his little book and let him get Colonel Dineen to print it and take it out of its context. But if he gets Colonel Dineen to do that, I will get Tommy Mullins to print what I said in full.</P>

      <P>The issue is as the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health have said, that we want to bring in this Bill to give the Irish people stable Government.  I see no connection between it and a Presidéntial election, a local election or any other type of election.  We are dealing with the system of election to the National Parliament and that is the issue involved. Deputy O'Sullivan is obviously thrilled with what I am saying and evidently he is going to make use of it on some future occasion.  He is very welcome.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying I hope this measure will be passed speedily. I think everybody is sick and tired of discussing it.  Let it go to the people. If Deputies opposite are so worried about the outcome and if they are so convinced that the people of Ireland will reject it, the sooner it goes to the people the better; but I say that the Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, has never misled the Irish people, and whenever they took his advice and listened to it, it was a good day for the country.  It was a very fortunate thing for the people that the Taoiseach was at the head of affairs at the critical period when, if other people were in the Government, there might have been a different story.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up much time, but I should like to make a few remarks regarding criticism of the length of time spent on the other four stages and now being spent on the Fifth Stage.  It is unfair for Government members or members of the Government Party to make such criticism.  It is not our intention on this side of the House to prevent the people from having their say, as far as this referendum is concerned.  It is a fact that because the Government have a majority, the Bill will be passed and will be put before the people, but I have spoken on this Bill on different occasions and I am speaking now because we believe this is the national forum.  It is the most important place to express our opinions.  Surely at this stage in the life of the Dáil nobody would, or should, suggest that speeches on what is described as an important measure should be curtailed.</P>
      <P>We are not wasting time that should be devoted to public business.  As far as I remember, the month of January has been a period of recess for the Dáil which usually resumes in the second or third week of February.  When the Taoiseach announced we would reassemble on 7th January, I understood he intended we should resume early so that we could have a full, frank and lengthy discussion on this Bill.  That is merely what we are doing.  It may sound as if speeches are being repeated, but if Deputy Mulcahy makes some remark about P.R. and Deputy Casey or another Deputy happens to say the same thing, it may be repetition but not from the same Deputy, and Deputy Casey and Deputy Mulcahy and others are here to express these opinions for the benefit of the people and particularly for the information of the people who sent them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a Bill discussed here yesterday, the Minister for Local Government read out a list of days and weeks and months and hours that had been spent on this Bill, but my opinion&mdash;it is not for me to direct them or tell them what to do&mdash;is that the 146 Deputies in the Dáil should regard it as their duty to their constituents to express an opinion on the Bill so that the people will be better able to make up their minds. That is the only reason I have spoken <Col N="1214" /> and am speaking, and I assume that is why other people also have spoken on this or other stages.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health in a learned speech to-day attempted &ldquo;to pull the schoolmaster act&rdquo; and tell us what we should know or should deduce from the methods that have been adopted on the Continent and elsewhere.  He suggested that this is the opportune time to change the system of election. I do not pretend to quote him, but my interpretation of part of his speech was that he admitted there was an unnatural division in the country arising from the civil war and because of that, he said, or at least I understood him to say, there was room from 1922 to the present time for different Parties, big and small and middle-sized, to be elected to Dáil Éireann under the system of P.R.  I gathered from him that the time was now opportune to do away with that system that gave three, four or five Parties and substitute the system that would give us two Parties.</P>
    <P>I spoke on another stage and argued against the abolition of P.R. and the introduction of the straight vote, on the ground that we were not politically mature and that some Parties were based on political thought and philosophy and because of that we should go to a further political stage before the people should be asked to consider adopting the system known as straight voting.  Deputy O'Malley described as rather ludicrous the arguments put forward, I think, by Deputy Mulcahy or some other Fine Gael Deputy.  He took as an example a constituency where a Fianna Fáil candidate got, say, 2,500 votes, Fine Gael got 2,000 and Labour, 2,000 votes.  He said that a Fine Gael Deputy asked was it fair that 4,000 combined votes of Labour and Fine Gael should not prevail over the 2,500 of the Fianna Fáil Party. That is not the argument that was used by Fine Gael Deputies; it is not the argument Deputy Larkin used. He did not suggest a combination of votes should prevail over a majority vote for one individual.</P>
    <P>The type of example given by Deputy Larkin and other Deputies was <Col N="1215" /> that of a constituency such as Limerick. In any part of Limerick, if straight voting is adopted, there will be a constituency which, in my opinion, and I think it is a fair opinion, will give a candidate from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan and Sinn Féin and possibly some Independent.  I believe that if there were an election in six months' time, a year's time or two years' time, all those Parties would contest a general election in Limerick City. Then we could have a situation like this&mdash;and this is the type of situation we refer to when we try to point out the unfairness of the straight vote in present circumstances in this country. Let us take it that Fianna Fáil get 3,500 votes, Fine Gael get 3,000, Labout get 3,000, Clann na Poblachta get 2,000, Sinn Féin get 2,000, and an Independent gets 2,000.  I do not think that is a situation which could not arise in Limerick; I think it is possible that it would arise.  There would be a situation where a candidate, let it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, would get 3,500, as against all other candidates getting 12,000.  Our contention is that that man does not, under that system, represent the majority of the people in his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks I am critical of Limerick, but I am not. The only reason I take Limerick is that there was a Clann na Poblachta candidate consistently and an Independent and, in the last election, a Sinn Féin candidate also.  There always have been Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour candidates there.  I might have reduced the figures, to give the other Parties 8,000 as against the first Party getting 3,500.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley seems to think what the Opposition want is that there should be a representative from the others as against Fianna Fáil.  All we want is that the lowest man be eliminated and that the second preferences be carried on.  Let Fianna Fáil get them, or Fine Gael or Labour or any other, but at least eliminate people until there is a result and until there is an overall majority for any one of the candidates.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health said that the time was opportune now to change over to the straight vote.  I honestly believe the time is not ripe.  They may be called cranks and crackpots, but there are fairly big minorities which do not believe in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, to take the three largest Parties here.  It would be wrong to deprive them of the opportunity of getting into the Dáil.  It may be said that they have an opportunity of presenting themselves for election, but in actual fact, the straight vote system, the single member constituency, will deny to all those small Parties actual representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health also said that he wanted to see a situation in which there would be two big Parties, Parties which could be described, he said, as being in the middle of the road.  He said there would come a day shortly when we would have two Parties and between each there would not be a big difference in policy.  I do not believe that such a situation is desirable.  I do not believe that, even if we had two big Parties here, such a situation would be desirable at all. If the situation in England is that there is a Conservative Party, regarded as being conservative in policy, as <Col N="1217" /> against the Labour or Socialist side, which is regarded as being progressive or more liberal in policy, I would prefer to have heard the Minister say that that is the situation he wanted to arrive at, rather than seek to have two middle of the road Parties in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested, as did many of his colleagues, that the straight vote will provide for stability. In spite of that parrot-like cry, I do not think the straight vote will, in its actual effect, give stability.  Even if the people were to opt for the straight vote, we still could have a situation such as the Minister for External Affairs has often visualised, where no single Party would have a majority.  In a case like that, there must be a combination of Parties or a Coalition. Fianna Fáil will have to make up their mind what they are going to do in such a situation.  If Fianna Fáil have one-third of the membership here, Fine Gael have one-third and we have one-third, Fianna Fáil will not be able to sit on the fence, as obviously the Minister for External Affairs wants to sit.  They will have to make up their minds what they are going to do, or whether there are to be three or four more elections, until there is an absolute majority for one Party.</P>
    <P>Governments having majorities have not necessarily meant that we have had stability; neither has it meant that we have had progress and prosperity. Whilst all of us may pay our tributes to the Taoiseach, and while Deputy O'Malley may have said he never wavered and always made the right decision as far as the country was concerned, all of us must agree that we still have our problems.  Fianna Fáil has had a stable Government with a majority of 18, and has not solved those problems.  Other Governments have not solved them.  Now the people are led to believe that if they do away with P.R. and adopt the straight vote, all our difficulties are solved and all our ills are cured.  Such is not the case. It is dishonest for anybody to talk about stability and progress in connection with the change in the system of election, because that change is designed as Fianna Fáil said, to give an absolute majority to a Party which <Col N="1218" /> can form a Government.  In the past 27 years, only the Fianna Fáil Government have had substantial majorities and we have not had stability in our economy; we have not had progress; and we still have the same difficulties as regards unemployment and emigration. It is dishonest that the Fianna Fáil spokesmen should try to pretend to the people that, as soon as this Bill is put to the people and adopted, all our difficulties will be solved.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand the criticism of many Fianna Fáil speakers who talk about the evils of coalition government.  We can appreciate their point of view.  It must have been a tremendous shock to them in 1948 when they were beaten. They had been invincible for 16 years. If I had been in government for 16 years and woke up one morning to find that that was all finished and that Deputy de Valera had gone as well, I should feel pretty bad about a Coalition succeeding me.</P>
    <P>Apart from what Coalitions did or did not do, the facts are these.  In 1948, when no Party had an overall majority, Labour, Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and some Independents decided to come together on a stated policy.  To the best of their ability and very successfully, they proceeded to try to work out that policy over a period of three years.  They were succeeded by a Coalition of Fianna Fáil and five Independents.  After three years, despite what the Taoiseach has said about Coalitions, despite the warnings he gave about them, despite the criticisms of the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Local Government and every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, in 1954, the people decided they wanted another Coalition.  I believe they decided likewise in the general election of 1951, but that is a different story&mdash;it was a matter of individual taste on the part of certain Deputies.  However, the people are not as spiteful or hateful towards Coalitions as the Taoiseach thinks they are.  The evidence of that is in the fact that, despite all the warnings, criticisms and condemnations from <Col N="1219" /> 1948 to 1951, they voted in greater measure for a Coalition in 1954.</P>
    <P>The Dáil was dissolved in 1957 and Fianna Fáil have come back again.  I do not say that under the straight vote, there might not be another Coalition, but Fianna Fáil will not be able to sit on the fence and say: &ldquo;There you are now.  Get together and form a Government.&rdquo; The responsibility of forming a Government is a serious matter.  It was a serious decision for the Labour Party to make in 1948 and 1954; but we made the decision and none of us regrets the decision made. The Party, as a Party, does not regret the decisions they made on those two occasions.  We make no promise about future Coalitions.  We are not prepared to say we will coalesce after the next election with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Clann na Poblachta or anybody else. We will have to decide what we will do in the circumstances in which we find the country in the event of no Party gaining an overall majority.</P>
    <P>If we are trying to aspire to unity and stability, it is rather a tragedy that the proposal in this Bill will be put before the people on the same day as that on which they are asked to elect a President.  As Deputy Kyne said, for the sake of unity and political stability, the country could afford another £80,000 to have the election on a different day.  As Deputy Kyne said also, it was designed by the Government Party some months ago that the election would be on the same day.  As far as I can see, in recent weeks, the Government have decided that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not such a good horse after all, and now they are trying to swop jockeys.  The Minister for External Affairs was the original choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I made a <Col N="1220" /> sincere criticism and said the people should not be asked to say whether they are for or against de Valera, for or against MacEoin, or anybody else. In order to try to cloud the issue, the same Government did the same thing in 1937 by muddying the waters of a plebiscite on the Constitution by throwing in a general election, or vice versa.  In conclusion, I wish to say that my Party does not apologise for any of the speeches made on its behalf on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a great mistake not to accept the declared intention of the Government at its face value.  We have the express authority of Front Bench members of the Government for stating here that their purpose in presenting this constitutional amendment referendum is to wipe out the Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and the Independents in this House, and, when the Minister for Local Government intervened, he revealed that it was his hope that the principal Opposition Party would be wiped out, too.  He was constrained by the intervention of the Taoiseach to publish a denial that he had ever expressed that hope; and he was publicly repudiated by every independent witness of his words.  But that is the purpose; that is the hope; that is the aim.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's severest critic has never charged him with avarice or desire to accumulate money, but for 40 years he has been an ardent disciple of Machiavelli, because ever since he entered the public life of this country, he has been drunk for power, and observe the situation in which we stand to-day.  He has now reached the apotheosis of a long struggle for power in this country.  He believed he had attained to his aim until his illusion was shattered by the events of 1948 and their repetition in 1954. The fact is that these two successive events shocked him.  It shocked him that it had been possible for the Irish people, whose mind he could find by searching his own heart, had suddenly proved his heart a liar, not once but twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thesis is that anyone may disagree with the Taoiseach once by <Col N="1221" /> falling into error, but if he should perpetrate that deed a second time, it is no longer error&mdash;it is malevolence. For anyone to differ from the Taoiseach twice is self-evident malevolence. He is in the dilemma now that he hesitates to make that indictment of an entire people.  Rather than make it, he proposes to provide against the appalling possibility that it should happen a third time. Observe the structure that is now in contemplation.  If that is not self-evidence of a power mania, amounting to madness, I do not know what is.  This is the programme: he is to be President; he is to be controlling director of three national newspapers, with a succession guaranteed to his own son&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, a man gone mad, intoxicated by an insane desire for power.  Mark you, there is the danger of which Deputy Corish spoke.  Our people have in their constitution a human strain of sentiment.  When there is presented to them a figure for 40 years in the public life of this country, seeking, in the evening of his days, further preferment, who will deny that a great many of our people, whatever their views may be, will be moved to say: &ldquo;We will either give him that, or something in exchange; if we cannot vote for him as President, sure, we will give him a vote on the referendum?&rdquo; Certain it is that, with the two on the same day, there cannot be obtained from our people a detached judgment on either issue.  There will be those who will say: &ldquo;We will give him a vote for President and vote against him on the referendum&rdquo;, and others who will say: &ldquo;If we feel a <Col N="1222" /> conscientious duty to preserve the principle of P.R., we will give him a vote for President, lest he feel rebuffed on every front.&rdquo; In fact, what is happening is that he is running true to form, and that constitutes a real danger for this country.</P>
      <P>I absolutely refuse to follow the Fianna Fáil Party in their labyrinthine calculations of what may or may not happen at the poll under various electoral systems.  Here, in this Chamber is the citadel of the individual liberty of every citizen of this State, from the highest to the lowest, from the richest to the poorest, and the day this Parliament ceases to function, no man's freedom in this society is safe.  I ask Deputies, who have some experience of the functioning of this Parliament, what will it look like if there are no Deputies on this side of the House? Remember, that is not my apprehension. That is the hope of the leaders of the Government Party, avowed by some of them, admitted through indiscretion by others; and that is the hope which the Taoiseach, being a skilled and devious politician, is most eager to cloak from the minds of our people. He wants them to trust him and to have faith that, whatever they do, Parliament will still be here.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of our people have never been in this House, or seen it function.  The vast majority of our people do not understand, as we understand, how Parliament works. But there is no experienced Deputy here who, when he contemplates these benches empty&mdash;never mind those where I stand&mdash;who will not realise that Parliament will be greatly weakened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to sound this note of warning again.  We are dealing with Ireland. We are not dealing with Canada.  We are not dealing with New Zealand. We are not dealing with Great Britain. We are not dealing with the United States of America.  We are dealing with Ireland, with all her history about us.  There is nothing more certain&mdash; I speak in this matter with a long personal experience of the public life of this country and a vicarious experience going back over a century <Col N="1223" /> in the history of the country&mdash;I warn Deputies of this House, that in Ireland minorities cannot be suppressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And, so certainly as we are standing on this floor to-day, if our people are misled by the Fianna Fáil Party into endorsing an electoral system which slams the doors of this Dáil in the face of minorities, we will be, by our act, begetting a development, which whatever Party forms a subsequent Government, may find an almost unbearable handicap.</P>
      <P>Let us face this fact.  It cannot be too often repeated.  The moral position, quite apart from the legal position, of this Government and this Oireachtas in connection with the imprisonment on the Curragh of between 100 and 150 men, without trial, is founded on the proposition that any man, who can get a quota of voters in this country to support him, can come into Parliament and make his voice heard; and, so long as that system exists in this community, no Government will allow any minority, great or small, to arrogate to itself the functions of the Government lawfully elected by the people's Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standing on that moral ground, I believe we are unassailable.  But I ask Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party how would their consciences sit with them if, at this moment, they felt themselves open to rebuke, as the lawfully constituted Government of the country, for holding 100 to 150 men in prison, without trial, having denied them the opportunity of making their voice heard here?  It may be that to a big, powerful, political machine, with vast funds drawn from its protégés, and with a great organisation built up on the resources that it draws from those whom it favours, it is fantastic that it should be a matter of any consequence to a relatively poor, insignificant and weak minority in this country that they should have the right to appear in Dáil Éireann.  But it is there, and one of the strongest instruments in the hands of the executive at the present time is that the elected representatives of the <Col N="1224" /> Sinn Féin and I.R.A. movement here are afraid to take their place here and make their case; and we are in a vastly different moral position in that knowledge from what we would be in if they were in a position to say to us: &ldquo;You, by your actions, slammed the doors of Parliament in our faces and we have not got that opportunity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be expedient at any stage to overstate the issues joined here between us but it is desperately important that the people should know precisely what they are.  To get as near to them as I can, and I pledge my word that this is the impression I get from what I have heard from Fianna Fáil speakers from the Front Bench of their Party in the course of this debate, their aim and desire is to slam the doors of Dáil Éireann in the face of all minorities in this country; our aim and desire is to keep them open.</P>
    <P>I want to recall again to the minds of the Deputies the events of 30 short years ago when the present Taoiseach was leading a Party solemnly pledged not to enter Dáil Éireann and, seeing the barren futility of the continuance of that policy, he and certain of his colleagues changed their mind and he became himself with his colleagues the splinter of a splinter, a minority in a minority and he said: &ldquo;If we are not to drift down the road to chaos, the time has come when we must reverse our policy and enter Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this referendum had been decided in favour of the Fianna Fáil case to-day, his own minority would then have been in a position to say to him: &ldquo;But you cannot go into Dáil Éireann.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government have so fixed the electoral system that you cannot get a man elected and there is nothing for you but to stay with us in the wilderness.&rdquo; But, because there was then a Government that cared more for the country than they did for their own Party, under the leadership of Mr. William T.

    <P>I well remember the flood of vituperation and filth that he cheerfully faced while he taught the present members of the Government how to carry on in Parliament and, mind you, the time is nearly coming, although it is still too early, for the historian to pass his judgment on that period in our history.  When the time is ripe for an historian to tell the story of that epoch and the epoch in which we are now playing a part, which will get the verdict of the nation, the Prime Minister who drew a fraction of a fraction, a splinter of a splinter, a minority of a minority into Parliament or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is in this Bill is the Government's plan to wipe out the minorities in this Parliament.  I am comparing that with the plan to bring minorities in and I am making the case that, when history comes to be written, it will be the Prime Minister who brought them in, to his own grave political detriment, who will be adjudged the true servant of the Irish nation rather than the Prime Minister who drove them out in the hope of serving his own political advantage, to the grave detriment of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to reach all the people.  It is hard to make the people understand. It is hard to persuade people how precious certain things are when they have not known the absence of them. There is a whole generation of our people grown up in the last 30 years who never knew what it meant to struggle against the loss of freedom, who have never been without it, and the terrible danger is that an appeal to that generation may be successfully made to the point of misleading them and, as a result, parliamentary democracy, which is the only true citadel of <Col N="1226" /> individual liberty, in this country may founder.  That would be a disaster in more ways than one because it would be the vindication of everyone who sneered at our people, confidently prophesying that, if given the chance, we would destroy our own freedom, given the time, and that would be detestable to me.  What is even worse is that in all my knowledge of the world I have never known parliamentary democracy and individual liberty founded thereon to perish and to be recovered without bloodshed.</P>
    <P>If, in a moment of folly, our people consent to what is now proposed, I warn them that they will put these institutions, of which we, the Deputies of Dáil Éireann, constitute a part, in very mortal peril.  I believe that will create an atmosphere in the country in which certain elements of our people who are now generally condemned for their refusal to accept lawfully constituted authority in this Republic, may win a growing measure of unthinking sympathy.  I believe that we are being asked to walk into all that peril to gratify an insane yearning for power which in the mind of the Taoiseach is to be satisfied by nothing short of his presence in the Park, his son's presence as his deputy in the control of three national newspapers and his nominee and faithful supporters in control of the Executive Government. Is there any reasonable man or woman in this House who considers that such a prospect is consonant with the best interests of the democratic institutions of this country?  Is there any man or woman in this House who believes that that is a desirable development in our constitutional evolution?</P>
    <P>We are told by certain elements of the Fianna Fáil Party that our desire to debate these things and ventilate them is evidence of reluctance on our part to face a referendum.  I want to say quite categorically that I think one of the most unsuitable methods of resolving complex problems in a society such as ours is recourse to referendum.  It is about as undemocratic a procedure as is conceivable to the mind of man.  How can there be adequate discussion, how can there be <Col N="1227" /> adequate investigation, how can there be adequate examination of the complex problems involved in this legislation by referendum?</P>
    <P>There have been nine weeks of debate in this House, but that is what we are sent by the people to do, to deliberate, to argue, to match mind against mind, to investigate, to examine, and having taken all that slow precaution, to decide and to legislate.  That is democracy.  It is not democracy to go out and propagate a piece of legislation and present it to the multitude and say: &ldquo;Will those in favour shout &lsquo;Aye&rsquo; and those against &lsquo;No&rsquo;&rdquo;, particularly if the querist is an aged servant of the State surrounded by an aura of sympathy, and anything else he can call in support, conveying the implication: &ldquo;Either you vote for me or my long life in the service of the State ends in repudiation and tragedy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is that the atmosphere in which to get a deliberate, calm and resolved determination of such problems as are herein involved?  It certainly is not. Our Constitution, such as it is, provides that a Government can, in certain circumstances, have recourse to this procedure.  Some Deputies may ask why we should express amazement at any question being put to what they call a democratic decision of the people in a referendum? There are hundreds of questions which have been answered in the affirmative in other countries, which I would be appalled to think any Irish Government would desire to put to our people by way of a referendum.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of proposals which are the common coin of States that are unfree in the world in which we live, which I would regard as a public scandal if sponsored by any Government of Ireland as appropriate questions on which to seek the judgment of our people by referendum, on the presumption that they would be entertained for a single moment, whereas they were so outrageous as to be unsuitable for public discussion in our society.  I do not accept for a moment that the principle of referendum is the ideal one, but I recognise <Col N="1228" /> at once in the minds of those who yearn towards it, the chronic tendency of Fianna Fáil to demand a court of appeal from Parliament.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil find parliamentary procedure with its examination, its rights, its deliberations, tedious and irksome and hard to bear.  They have the feeling that if they have the numbers why should they not prevail?  &ldquo;Why must we submit to this parliamentary interrogation; why must we go through the tedium of persuading Parliament, first the Dáil and then the Seanad, to agree?&rdquo; If Fianna Fáil feel that way when they have a clear majority, how will they feel if they produce a situation in which they are substantially the only Party in the House, as they hope to be?  That is their hope and their aspiration.  Will we be told hereafter that if there is any challenge here to their edicts there will be an appeal from Parliament by referendum?  Why legislate at all then?</P>
    <P>I venture to say that any Fianna Fáil Deputy to whom that question was addressed would say at first glance: &ldquo;That is the right procedure; that is the most democratic procedure.&rdquo; It is Government by mob law. Mind you, that is the Government and that is the justice that prevails over two-thirds of the human race to-day. Do not forget that within the last fortnight one of the most civilised and modern communities in the world, the Republic of Cuba, a stable State, to all outside appearances, has been turned overnight into a community where trial for life is conducted by public acclaim in a bullfighters' arena. Mind you, in that two-thirds of the world where these practices are coming to be accepted, the Governments in each of the societies would claim as the chief merit of the new dispensation their glorious stability.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Government is a Communist Government.  I do not believe this Government is a Nazi Government, though I believe the Minister for External Affairs was a Nazi in his time&mdash;I know he was&mdash; when he used to canvass the corridors to go up and dine with the Nazi Ambassador to this country during the war years, but that is not relevant <Col N="1229" /> to our proceedings at the moment.  Let us bear in mind that this perpetual appeal for stability is most frequently heard at the present time on the lips of Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Khrushchev's explanation is: &ldquo;We must have stability and in order to have stability anyone who disagrees with me has to be persuaded not to do so again, and if that involves burying him in six feet of good clay the resources of civilisation are not yet exhausted.&rdquo; If his removal demands that he go in the capacity of Ambassador to Mongolia and if that is sufficient to give him second thoughts, then he is very welcome to his oriental sojourn.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will deny that for the time being at least Mr. Khrushchev has as much stability as any man could hope for.  He was actually able to get them to listen to him for seven hours when he addressed the twenty-first meeting of the Cominform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My train of thought has not been interrupted because I keep thinking of this word &ldquo;stability&rdquo;. Mind you, it has been one of the great foundations on which Fianna Fáil sought to build their case for closing out of this Parliament any dissentient voice.  What did they mean by stability?  There is no authoritarian Government in the world at the present time, which is not most touchy lest they be described as anything but the democratic Government of the country in which they exercise that control. Chou En-lai in Pekin is insisting that the Government at present acting in China should be described as the Popular Democratic Government of the Chinese People.  Bonn is described as the Government of Western Germany and Herr Ulbricht of Eastern Germany is cast into dismay if his Government is not described as the democratic Government of the German people.  Czechoslovakia is the democratic Government of the people and the more bloody the tyranny becomes in Eastern Europe, the more emphasis is the word &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; in that title given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a modern method of propaganda to take words of well-established meaning and give an entirely different meaning to them and then make them part of the vernacular in the special meaning you chose to attach to them. There is nobody outside Eastern Germany who looks upon that as a democratic Government.  There is nobody outside China who looks on the bloody tyranny there as a democratic Government.  There is nobody outside Czechoslovakia who believes that the Czechs are living under a democratic institution.  There are few people even behind the Iron Curtain who believe that the Hungarians are enjoying what <Col N="1231" /> we understand as democratic institutions under Mr. Kadar, but all these gentlemen are eager to describe themselves as democrats.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which they have prostituted the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. Are we travelling the same road with the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo;?  What I am concerned to have in this country are stable democratic institutions.  By that, I mean that the life and liberty of every citizen of this State shall be sacrosanct under the law, whatever Government is in office in Ireland. What I mean by stability is that Parliament shall truly function as a citadel of individual liberty for all sections of our people, whatever Party is in power.  What I mean by stability is that our political institutions will be so well organised that the disappearance of any one of us or any group of us will make no difference to the continued functioning of a free Parliament.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of Deputies and the people to the avowal of the Leader of Fianna Fáil.  His idea is that stability in this country means that the Fianna Fáil Party shall be the Government of this country and if there is any departure such as happened in 1948 and 1954, that is evidence of instability. Whatever constitutional reforms may be required to prevent the possibility of that event occurring again must be made to ensure what they call stability, but what, in fact, means the impossibility of anything displacing a Fianna Fáil Government in this country.</P>
    <P>What will happen in this country if the electoral machine is so rigged that there never can be in the future anything but a Fianna Fáil Government? Suppose the present Government realise their dream, achieve what they want and wipe out of the mind of the people the belief that there could ever be a change.  Does anybody seriously believe that the kind of parliamentary institutions which we have grown up in this country to revere would long survive?  Does anybody want a Parliament in this country in which it is unthinkable and impossible for a Government to be formed except from one Party?  I do not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> I think it is a healthy part of normal political democratic parliamentary government that there should always be present to the people and available to them, when they want it, an alternative to any Government and I think that is what the Fianna Fáil Government seek to take away.  I call in evidence their own words as uttered in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Fianna Fáil are beginning to get cold feet on the issue of the referendum.  It does not surprise me for I know Fianna Fáil too well.  When the cold breath of possible defeat blew upon them, they throw in the Taoiseach as they would throw in anything else, in the hope of averting defeat.  I acknowledge the danger that the warm sympathy of our people might mislead them if the Presidential election and the referendum are held on the same day, but I earnestly hope and pray that our people will be awake to the true nature of the decision set before them.</P>
    <P>Will they vindicate the electoral system which has given this country three Prime Ministers in 30 years, the political system which has given us Governments with clear majorities in this House, the system which has given us Governments from Fianna Fáil and inter-Party, the average of which has been, down through the years, three years longer than the period of election to the American House of Representatives, longer than the statutory period for a Government to survive in the Commonwealth of Australia?  Will they vindicate that system by their vote or will they deliberately sweep all that away and launch out into the unknown to be characterised by this sinister picture&mdash;this is what Fianna Fáil hope for and this is what the people must give them if they are to accept the counsel and advice of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;the Taoiseach in the Park as President, himself and his son as controlling directors of three national newspapers and his nominee and henchmen constituting the Government and the Executive of this country, all at the same time?</P>
    <P>If that is not the picture of a power megalomania in one man, I do not know what it is and it is between that <Col N="1233" /> megalomania for power and the continuance of a free Parliament in our country that the people are to be asked to choose.  It is a choice that they should never have been asked to take. It is a disgrace to the Government that proposed it.  I trust and pray that our people, demoralised as they have been over the past 20 years by all that Fianna Fáil stand for, will recall their great traditions in their long struggle for freedom, as we understand the word, and their passionate attachment to democratic parliamentary institutions as we understand those words in Ireland and by their votes on this referendum declare, unequivocably and emphatically, that they will not have a dictatorship in the Park, a dictatorship in the newspapers or a dictatorship in Parliament.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that the true stability of this nation which rests on Parliament and the faithful allegiance of our people to the institutions we now operate will be gravely prejudiced if in this referendum the verdict is by a narrow margin.  Fianna Fáil may glory if the verdict goes in their favour, but let them remember that if they take from our people through a handful of votes representative of a microscopic majority in a referendum, a fundamental constitutional right precious to every section of the minorities at present in Dáil Éireann, they will strike a more deadly blow at the stability of the institutions of this State than anyone has ever done before.  If we hold these institutions only by a narrow majority, and Fianna Fáil declare their intention of returning again and again to the charge for the purpose of destroying them, they will strike a deadly blow at the stability of the institutions of this State.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil never should have put this matter in issue.  They should never have claimed the right or avowed the desire to satisfy the megalomania for power of one man, but, to do it by forcing this Bill through the Oireachtas, is to do this community and this State a grave wrong.  It is possible they may change their tune yet.  I hope they may yet be defeated in the Seanad and that this matter may be prevented from presentation by an <Col N="1234" /> Irish Government.  I hope that such a defeat would make this Government think again.  It is true that even though this Bill were defeated in the Seanad, it would result in no more than 90 days' delay, but it would give time to a Government to think and think again before taking a step, no matter what the issue is, that will shake and gravely shake true stability in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil Government may claim to be the servants of Ireland, but they are in fact its executioners. History will pass verdict on the man who shakes the foundation of this State so painfully built up in his despite and without his help, but all the resources of which were gladly committed to his hands, once he secured a parliamentary majority in this country.  If he is maddened by the fact that the people exercised their sovereign right in passing that authority from him to others twice in the past ten years, he should remember that those who went before and handed it on to him bore no malice towards the people who made their decision but were able to carry on the opposition in this House until the people gave them the authority to take back from Fianna Fáil what they had so scandalously misused.</P>
    <P>That was the true tradition of parliamentary democracy which I hope will be forever served by those of us who sit on this side of the House.  I have sufficient confidence in the people of this country to believe that they will ultimately vindicate our attitude and reject the proposals submitted in this referendum by voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; and, at the next general election which I hope will come before 1961&mdash;it could not come too soon for me; to-night, if possible&mdash;will put an end to a Government who, by their conduct in this matter, have so utterly disgraced themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest anybody reading this debate might be led astray by certain of the charges Deputy Dillon hurled across the House, I want to put it on record that he is one of the gentlemen who tried to organise a Fascist Nazi organisation here.  They went around the country in blue shirts and said that as the Blackshirts had won in Italy and as the Brownshirts had won in Germany, so would the Blueshirts win here.  I do not want to go into it any further than that, but I want to put that on record, in view of some of the things the Deputy said.</P>
      <P>Let us now take this question of &ldquo;mob law&rdquo; which is how Deputy Dillon described the referendum.  I believe that the mob on this occasion &mdash;what Deputy Dillon calls a mob&mdash; will give him the same answer as they gave him when he last appealed to the people on the referendum for the Constitution.  I believe they will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this referendum just as they voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the Constitution in spite of Deputy Dillon and others who wanted to cling to the remnants of the Constitution forced upon us by the British under threats of immediate and terrible war.</P>
      <P>I believe &ldquo;the mob&rdquo; on this occasion will vote as they voted when we asked them in 1937 to vote for the Constitution which they gave themselves.  The foolishness of Deputy Dillon is disclosed by that phrase that a referendum is mob law.  The people who might read these debates can judge by that phrase what is behind a number of the arguments that have been used by the people on the opposite benches.  They can judge what is behind their opposition to this proposed amendment of the Constitution by that phrase.  They can also judge the reason for the words in which Deputy Dillon described the straight vote system on the last occasion that it was debated here on the Committee Stage.  On that occasion he said that the straight vote system is &ldquo;political dictatorship gone mad&rdquo;.  In the same debate he declared it to be &ldquo;an outrage on every standard of public decency&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democrats in other countries who might be led to read this debate to <Col N="1236" /> see what the Irish are doing about their system of election can see that the principal opposition to the change from the proportional system imposed upon us by the British comprise gentlemen who went around this country in blue shirts trying to repeat here the Fascist victory that was obtained by their confréres in Italy and in Germany, and who regard the American direct voting system as &ldquo;political dictatorship gone mad&rdquo; and an &ldquo;outrage on every standard of public decency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Dillon, a referendum is &ldquo;one of the most undemocratic procedures ever conceived by the mind of man&rdquo;.  In the ordinary presidential, senatorial or congressional elections in America hundreds of referenda on various items throughout the country are held on the same day as the presidential or the congressional elections.  If there is a dis pute on some matter between the representatives elected by the people it is regarded as a normal thing for a local state Government or a city Government to agree to put it to a referendum and allow the people to decide what they want by a majority vote. Deputy Dillon, although denouncing the Fianna Fáil tendency or the Fianna Fáil plot, as he put it, to destroy minority rights in this country is also denouncing as mob law the putting of a question to the people which will be decided one way or the other by majority vote.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Dillon, other mem bers of his Party and other groups in the House are very eloquent about the rights of minorities, they have put a limit to the number of minorities they will allow to be represented in this House.  None of them has proposed that the size of the constituency under P.R. should be extended so that smaller minorities might come in None of them has proposed that the whole of the State should be one constituency so that if a person could get one vote in every 150 he would be returned to the Dáil.  At the present time in most cases he must get one vote out of every four to be certain of being elected.  If we could have a P.R. system where one vote in 150 could elect a candidate, we could have <Col N="1237" /> the leaders of 150 Parties here to coalesce and play musical chairs.  If we were to satisfy some people who want to go to this extreme of having representation for every petty or every small section of the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Here we have several pages of groups or organisations all of which, if we had a large enough membership in the Dáil, and had the State as a single constituency, would have an opportunity of being represented here. Pointing that out shows the absurdity of trying to get every very small section of the community represented by a person who has the label of his trade or profession on his coat.  We are all representative here of those 200 or 300 groups who gave evidence before that commission.  Both sides of the House have farmers, bakers and candlestick makers.  I take it that within our different Parties we discuss the problems that affect all these sections of the community and after debate at our Party meetings we come to a reasonable compromise in solving the difficulties under discussion.</P>

      <P>If this straight vote system works here as it has worked in the United States over the last couple of hundred years and in Britain for quite a considerable time, the tendency will be that we may have two groups of Parties allied within themselves or we may have one large Party and two allied Parties forming an Opposition.  Then the people will know what type of Government to expect.  If they vote for one of the large Parties or for a group of two or more traditional and well-known allies, the people will know, when they vote for any candidate, what type of Government they will get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about P.R. is that the people cannot know at all what <Col N="1238" /> type of Government they will get. Once the rot sets in and the proportional system is carried to its logical conclusion, splitting the representatives of the people into the greatest number of small Parties, no one can know under which thimble is the pea. The Labour Party can go out and denounce Fine Gael and the Farmers' Party.  Fine Gael can denounce to their supporters the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and Farmers' Party, but afterwards they can come together and form a Coalition.  Each Party put up their own policy as the only policy they will support after the election, and yet they can come together afterwards to form the Coalition. Deputy Norton calls that making a deal.</P>
    <P>We do not mind two Parties making a deal provided it is not a double deal, provided they make it in advance and tell the people what they intend to do and not tell them to support one Party in an election and then make a double deal or a double-cross when the election is over.  Let us get rid of the hypocritical system whereby half a dozen Parties will go up for election each advocating in the most violent way its own policy in order to get a number of members that will ensure that the small Party will get a Ministry to run.  We cannot make the progress that we should make here if we have that sort of system.  Even larger, much more powerful countries than ours, have been brought to their knees with the electoral system which encourages a large number of small, violently antagonistic Parties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the immediate causes of the introduction of this Bill at that time was that we were galvanised into taking action, seeing how France was brought to its knees, possibly the richest country in the world per head of the population, if you judge by its resources, leaving out the United States.  From the point of view of its natural wealth, the skill of its people, its industrial traditions, and all that, France is probably, after the United States, the greatest and richest nation in the world, and it was brought to its knees by the fact <Col N="1239" /> that its people could not unite, by the fact that the representatives of its people could not unite to pursue a constructive policy long enough to put that constructive policy into effect.</P>
    <P>There are many members in this Dáil who are very well acquainted with a great number of the representatives in the French Chamber.  They know them to be decent men, men whom you could trust to carry into effect what they promise you to do, but they have been in this frightful situation over the last 20 or 30 years that the various systems of election which they had, threw up ten, 12 and 20 Parties, with no one Party having a majority, and all feeling that if they pressed their case hard enough they could get in charge of a Ministry to put into effect some little portion of the policies they advocated to the people.  That is what brought France to its knees and it would bring this country to its knees if it were in operation long enough.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect to have for ever, under the present system, a large Party with the standards that Fianna Fáil has displayed over the last 20 or 25 years.  Rather than form a coalition in which we did not believe, which we thought would be disastrous for the country we walked across the floor of this House twice.  Anyone who knows the situation at that time would realise it could have been much easier for us to form a coalition in 1948, or in 1954, than it was for the various small groups that had to be brought together in order to form a coalition. We opposed coalition because we believe that our country cannot make the progress under coalition that it can under a large, well integrated Party.  Under the direct voting system, the alternative would be another large, well integrated Party, or two Parties so well integrated, and which are so long in alliance that they are generally recognised as one throughout the country.  You have the two things in various countries and I believe, from the point of view of the Labour Party, Deputy Dillon is trying to scare them and saying that they are going to fade out under this system. That depends on the Labour Party; it does not depend on the system of election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> Whether Fine Gael is going to fade out or come up as a strong Government Party under the straight vote depends on Fine Gael and what the people think of it, and not on what Fianna Fáil thinks of it.  What is going to happen Fianna Fáil under the straight voting system over the period of years ahead depends on what the people will think of Fianna Fáil in the period ahead, and not on what we think of ourselves at this particular time.  It gives an opportunity for Parties who believe in themselves, Parties who believe in their policies, who are prepared to work hard and canvass the country and organise the country.  It gives them a chance of coming up quickly.</P>
    <P>It gave that chance to the British Labour Party.  In 1918 they had only a handful of seats but, by 1924, they were the Government and during the period between 1918 and 1958 they have increased the number of their seats in the House of Commons 20 times.  During that same period, or at least between 1922 and to-day, the Labour Party here, under the P.R. system, have gone down by half.  No, it was six fold the British Labour Party went up at the same time as the Labour Party here went down by half under P.R.  Nothing can save the Labour Party but themselves and nothing can save Fine Gael except themselves.  That applies to Fianna Fáil also.  If we do not act, and do not propose policies which the people want, Fianna Fáil can fade out under the straight vote system, just as the Liberal Party faded out in Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is playing a very dangerous game.  It is not the first time he has done it by indicating that a Government here, elected by the Irish people under a system of election that the people approved, would not have the moral authority to deal with any revolutionary group that denied the validity of the Constitution enacted by the Irish people.  That is a very dangerous game.  The Constitution was enacted by the Irish people.  Our moral authority to use force if necessary, to prevent anybody using force against the institutions of the State, springs from the fact that the <Col N="1241" /> Constitution was enacted by the Irish people, and that the Government is acting in conformity with the constitutional law.</P>
    <P>If the system of election is changed the people must approve of it under the constitutional procedure set out in the original Constitution, and that then becomes the moral basis for a Government, elected under this Constitution as a whole, to enforce the authority of the people against any section that would deny it.  Deputy Dillon is entitled to stir up that section of the Irish people in order to get them to vote against the referendum if he so desires, but do not let him go so far as to deny the moral authority of the Government to enforce the law, if it acts constitutionally under the fundamental law enacted by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon denounced Fianna Fáil for demanding, as he said, a court of appeal from the Dáil.  He cannot have it both ways.  If we had the constitutional right to pass this Act, to change the electoral system by a mere majority in the Dáil and Seanad, then we need not appeal to the people.  We could pass it if we had that right, but now we are also going to take the constitutional step that is necessary in order to make the passage of this Bill through the Dáil effective. We are going to the people to ratify and confirm the decision as made by their representatives.  It is a queer way to put it, that a referendum is a court of appeal from the Parliament when we are bound by the Constitution to put it to the people.</P>
    <P>Now, I put it&mdash;Deputy Costello, Deputy Dillon and others are here&mdash; there is no reason why we should have the referendum and the Presidential election on the one day.  There is no reason why there should be a Presidential election at all and if the Opposition are so keen to keep these things separate and not to put the expenses of two ballot days on the people, they can arrange that the man who is going to go in will not be opposed.</P>

      <P>Outside a lunatic asylum you would not hear anybody call a referendum a mob law in the many democratic countries in the world where referenda are a not uncommon event.  Indeed one might say they are an everyday event.  Outside a lunatic asylum you would not hear anybody call a referendum a mob law.  Outside a lunatic asylum in the United States of America, or Britain, or any of these other States that have survived with stable Government&mdash; and by stable Government I mean the stable governmental institutions in which Opposition takes over from <Col N="1243" /> Government and Government takes over from Opposition&mdash;you would not hear anybody saying, as Deputy Dillon said, that the straight vote is a political dictatorship gone mad, or that it is an outrage on every standard of public decency.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that this amendment which we are proposing to the Constitution has been clearly indicated as the right thing to do by every responsible person who has had experience of Government, and the difficulty of Government, over the last 30 years. It is no secret that in 1927 when Fine Gael, then called Cumann na nGaedheal, issued their election propaganda they spoke about it.  Foreigners coming here and talking to Ministers of the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government realised that they were against this system of P.R. and the disaster of coalitions which it bred.  From 1927 to 1932 Fine Gael spoke consistently against the idea of coalitions and spoke about the weaknesses of the P.R. system and its tendency to create a multiplicity of small Parties, which made coalitions inevitable.  In 1937 Fianna Fáil proposed the Constitution to the people.  We did not include P.R.  One of the reasons we did not include P.R. was because there was a terrific opposition to the Constitution, sparked off by the Opposition, the various groups of Opposition at the time, saying that if the people adopted the Constitution women would not be allowed to leave their homes and could not take jobs outside their homes and that the President was going to be a dictator and all the rest of it.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil had insisted at that time in putting the straight vote system into the Constitution it might easily have been defeated.  We thought it advisable at the time to get the Constitution accepted by the people, to take no chances on it, but to put into the Constitution the provision under which we are acting at the moment, that whenever the people decided that any part of the Constitution should be changed they would have the right to do so by following the procedure that we are following in making this proposed change.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take that period.  In 1937 we were in a minority.  When the Constitution went through there was an election and we were returned in a minority. In 1938 we were returned in a majority but 1938 was the year of Munich.  If we had decided to make the change at that time we would have had to go through all this procedure and it would have taken us long after 1938 to get the Bill into the Dáil.  It would have been two years after that; it would have been 1940.  I do not think any Government, in the middle of the war, would go through that procedure.</P>
      <P>In 1943 we became a minority.  In 1944 we were elected again as a majority but after those years you had not only the last couple of war years but the greatest period of economic difficulty the world has ever seen&mdash;for a couple of years thereafter. But whatever we did, or did not do, all during that period events were moving in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Germany, Hitler came up through a multiplicity of Parties created by P.R. and Mussolini also came up.  Many of the small countries were threatened.  Belgium got through only by the skin of her teeth because there was in Belgium before the war the Rexist Party and also the Communists.  In France there was the same thing, extreme Communists and another semi-royalist Party&mdash;I forget its name&mdash;on the extreme Right.  These people came up because, while the straight vote increases the power of the minority in the centre, P.R. increases the strength of the minorities on the extreme left or the extreme right in any nation.  It is almost ludicrous, or indeed it would be ludicrous, to say in the light of the lessons we have from other countries, that under the straight voting system minorities are denied their rights.  Indeed, one criticism of the system is that it gives the minority in the centre too much power, that a swing of 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. <Col N="1245" /> of votes in the centre can bring down a Party that had a big majority sending it back with a very small number of members, or bring an Opposition that had perhaps 40 per cent. of the seats back into power with 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>That has happened on many occasions in these straight vote countries. We have seen what a swing of a small percentage did in the United States in the last congressional elections.  We saw what happened in Britain several times since the war when a small percentage change in the popular vote meant a 5 per cent. or a 6 per cent. change in the number of seats in Parliament. It is ridiculous in the extreme to say that the straight vote denies minorities power.  Nobody is so crazy as to say that all the 200 or 400 minority organisations represented in the vocational groups should be facilitated each to send a member into this Parliament bearing the ticket or badge of one of these organisations to kick up such a row that nobody could hear their ears advocating in a violent way the interests of the particular minority or group he represented.</P>
    <P>There is something here that is beyond the 200 or 300 identifiable minority groups in the community; there is the community as a whole. There is the consideration that somebody must look after the general interest of all these people, the general common interest, and if the Dáil is comprised of members each representing a sectional interest and nobody representing the general interest the nation must go down.  There may be many agile brains, cranks and soreheads, as Deputy Dillon described them, thinking up the thousand and one proportional systems, but the system of election that has served longest is the system that is operated in America.</P>
    <P>In the modern world the straight voting system was really originated in America where it started with adult suffrage.  Before that, in Britain you had pocket boroughs and all the rest of it but in the United States since the revolution in the 18th century, the straight voting system has been retained.</P>

      <P>Whatever criticism you may make of the United States&mdash;and there are many criticisms that might be made of its politicians just as could be made of ourselves&mdash;there is this to be said.  It is a miracle that any country could be composed of such a multiplicity of sections, of races and colours, and yet keep ordered Government. If they had the system of P.R. in America it is not one civil war they would have had but permanent civil war.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties the Jewish people are facing in Israel at the moment is that the various sections that came from the 30 or 40 different countries are each keeping a sectional approach.  I think there are about 40 different Parties in the Israeli Parliament. Two considerations are keeping them together in some sort of ordered Government.  One is outside, immediate pressure which is a very good cementing force when the people have to recognise their common interest; the other is a very old and well-respected leadership.  But the difference between Israel and the U.S. is this.  In Israel, where under P.R. you have all these groups&mdash;although fundamentally they are of one blood&mdash; each one keeps to his own different section or Party, but in the United States although they are of 100 different races, many different colours and shades, they are cemented together under the direct vote system into two Parties and the two Parties give them stability.  The two Parties vie with each other for the votes of some of these minorities and give the minorities greater representation and take greater care of them than these minorities could possibly take of themselves under any system of representation of the various sections through P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to succeed as a country we must unite as closely as we can on as many things as possible.  We have 3,000,000 of a population and I suppose 2,500,000 of them have reached the age of reason.  Each one has his own particular approach or combination of approaches to all the problems <Col N="1247" /> There is no means of consulting them from day to day on the various things that crop up for decision here or in the Government.  We must try to unite them, outside this Parliament.  The coordinating work cannot be done here because we have no room for 2,500,000.  We must have a system that encourages the people to get their representatives to put forward their views or policies and to make them effective locally in the local organisations of, say, two major Parties or two groups of Parties or whatever number comes out of these elections.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party after having discussed this for so long will, perhaps, take another view of the Bill before it goes to the people.  I feel confident that the people will pass it. It is difficult to explain in some ways, but the people generally understand the difference between the proportional system, which created weaknesses here and which created fatal weaknesses in other countries, and the straight vote system which we are proposing to operate here, which has brought good results in other countries and which is likely to bring equally good results here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs has reminded us that this debate has gone on for nine weeks. During that period, I have listened to contributions from Ministers and from members of various Parties, but in all that time I have not heard such utter rubbish as has just been offered by the Minister.  We are a small nation of some 3,000,000 people with a Constitution originally brought in here in 1922, amended and adopted by the people on the proposal of the Taoiseach in 1937.  Our Constitution, our institutions of Government, our way of doing business in this House, the methods of the Government in dealing with business, have nothing in common with the system which is operated in the United States of America.  The Minister for External Affairs should be the first to know that, if they are discussing a Bill in the House of Representatives, there is no Cabinet taking part in the debate there.  In the United States, the Cabinet is not even part of the Legislature.  The States themselves&mdash;49 at the moment&mdash;have got their own State Governments. National decisions are made by the Federal Parliament, but many of the laws which bind the citizens are the laws made by the State Legislatures and there is no such thing as a national <Col N="1249" /> Minister in the same sense as we have such a Minister.  Even beyond that, has it not been common knowledge over the past 30 or 40 years that from time to time in the United States of America, there have been grave differences of opinion between the President for the time being and the legislative chambers making up Congress itself?  Yet, this is the country, this is the continent, the Minister sets up as having a type of electoral system which would be more suitable in Irish conditions than the one which&mdash;according to the words of the Taoiseach on many occasions&mdash;has been successful in our own country, in our own conditions, since 1937.</P>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion&mdash;and I wonder if it is a conclusion that many of our people are coming to&mdash;as a result of the type of case put up by the Government spokesmen, that this Government are a majority Government, they have got the support of the majority in this House&mdash;in the general election they were elected on the basis of getting the support of the majority of the Irish people, and nobody is quarrelling with that&mdash;but this Government have so little faith in themselves and in their Party and in their own future that they wish to ensure that future elections will be decided, not on the basis of a majority decision of the Irish people, as they are at the moment, but on the basis of a minority decision of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have concentrated on the possible results of the introduction of the proposed system, and have stated on many occasions that the tendency of this Bill&mdash;if it is accepted eventually by the people in a referendum&mdash;will be to deny representation to minority sections of our people.  In that regard, the Minister for External Affairs has been kind enough to refer on many occasions to the Labour Party.  I do not think either the members of the Labour Party in this House or their supporters in various parts of the country care very much what opinions the Minister has in relation to the Party's future.  However, I agree with him that so long as the workers of this country believe that their interests will be served by having Deputies of <Col N="1250" /> the Labour Party in this House, they will continue to send them here, no matter what the system of election is.</P>
    <P>That is not the fundamental issue. The fundamental issue may have been clouded by concentrating on the necessity of continuing to provide in this House fair and equal representation for substantial minorities in the country. The fundamental issue is that this Bill, if passed, will tend to have this House representing a minority of the people.  If in a few years' time, as well might be the case, the Fianna Fáil Party were reduced to 30 or 40 members, I doubt if the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Health or the Minister for Local Government would consider that Fianna Fáil supporters should not have the right to nominate candidates in every constituency or that Fine Gael or any other Party that had grown bigger should not have a similar right.  The general tendency of the Bill has been quite clearly shown by the Minister for External Affairs.  He is anxious&mdash;and I take it the Government are anxious &mdash;to introduce into this country a system whereby there will be a Government Party and an Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs and some of his colleagues talk about an alliance between Fine Gael and Labour or Fianna Fáil and Labour because, they say, their policies are familiar. We know they are talking cockeyed nonsense.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that he thought the Labour Party had a different philosophy and outlook from the other big Parties here.  I agree with him.  I hope the outlook will grow more different and that this other era will come to an end very soon.</P>
    <P>This evening, the Minister for External Affairs referred to the development of a powerful Labour Party in England.  There was no Sinn Féin Party to split in England.  At the beginning of the century and for a long time before that, you had in England the Conservative and the Liberal Parties. The Labour Party grew and developed in England when the workers there realised that they required not only industrial strength but protection of their <Col N="1251" /> interests in the Parliament of that nation.  To-day, the strength of the Labour Party in England rests on that firm basis.  There can be no analogy between the situation that developed in England from the beginning of the century to immediately before the war, and the situation in this country.  The Parliament in which we sit has only operated as a Parliament since 1922. To the sincere regret of many of us here not allied to either side and to thousands of supporters outside, that situation has not yet clarified itself.</P>
    <P>We have discussed this measure at length.  It may be an earnest of things to come, if the Government succeeds in getting its way, that on a number of occasions leading Government spokesmen have expressed their irritation at the prolongation of the discussion.  The discussion has been prolonged no more than that of many other Bills, possibly of less importance, that came before the House. It has been suggested that the discussion has been a waste of time and that there has been an endeavour to obstruct the course of the Bill.  We have a Government with a majority of 18.  I do not think the Government can suggest that the prolonged discussion on this matter has held up urgent public business.  The Government of the day can set down and order the business to be dealt with by the Dáil.  It may be&mdash;I do not know&mdash;that they have no public urgent business.  Certainly, they have demonstrated in the course of their contributions to this debate a singular lack of faith in their own capacity to convince the people that they have done a good job during this period of office and that they are entitled to get their support again.</P>
    <P>There appear to be two main conclusions to be drawn.  The first is that the Government have introduced this Bill because they are convinced they have no hope of being returned with a majority in the event of another general election under the system of P.R.  I suggest that conclusion is a reasonable and correct one.  It is based on this very simple thesis.  If they had such faith in their own Party and in their ability to convince <Col N="1252" /> the people that they are doing a good thing and deserve the support of the people for a further period in office, then I submit they would never have introduced this Bill at this stage.</P>
    <P>The second conclusion that one must reach in this matter is that this Government, headed by the Taoiseach, with Ministers, some of whom have had many years in office as Ministers, and who on countless occasions have expressed their belief in democratic decisions taken by the people, democratic decisions made in the name of the people, are even losing their alleged regard for democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs tried, as usual, to be humorous.  He indicated that the alternative to the direct system of voting&mdash;in other words, the continuation of P.R. to its extreme limits&mdash;would result in one constituency for the whole country and, for that single constituency, candidates would go forward for election on the basis of covering the whole country.  The Minister, in his endeavour to be humorous, neglected to advert to the fact that this Dáil, as at present constituted, represents all the people in the country and constituencies are divided in certain ways for the purpose of giving fair representation to all the people in the country.</P>
    <P>The Constitution which they now propose to emasculate provides that the number of people in a constituency shall be limited both as regards the minimum and the maximum.  It is inherent in the Constitution that representatives elected here are elected to represent Irish citizens and they are, therefore, elected to speak in their name.  They are not elected merely for the purpose of electing a Taoiseach and ensuring that ten, 12 or 14 Cabinet Ministers are appointed. Under the present system of P.R., as it operates here, not a single Minister has been able to say that the people are unfairly represented.  It is perfectly obvious that if the new system is accepted, that statement cannot be made in the future, because, in practically every case, where two candidates contest a constituency, the Deputy elected will be representative of a minority.  If only 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. of a constituency send a <Col N="1253" /> Deputy here elected on a minority basis, this House will then, of necessity, represent only a minority of the people.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the vaunted regard of the Minister for External Affairs for a Government elected as a result of such a system would rest on any fair basis?  I sincerely believe that parliamentary democracy, as it operates in this country, and democracy itself, as recognised in this country, will suffer a most severe blow if the proposals contained in this Bill are passed by the Dáil and Seanad and approved by the people. The tragedy will be that the people, and this is true of Fianna Fáil too, may not realise that until after the event. If this issue goes before the people, there will be very little opportunity for calm, considered judgment.  In any country, when an issue is put before the people and presented to them by newspapers, by radio and other means of propaganda, the people can conceivably make a mistake if the weight of the publicity falls in a certain direction. I appealed to the Taoiseach earlier to give an assurance to the House that the people would be afforded a fair and equal opportunity of judging the merits and demerits of this proposal.  Nobody in the House has yet received such an assurance.  Indeed, it is obviously the intention of the Government and the Taoiseach not to give such an assurance to the people.</P>

      <P>Unlike the Minister for External Affairs, I do not claim to be the possessor of a prophetic vision.  The Minister for External Affairs purported to state most explicitly the result not merely of the referendum but also of the Presidential election.  I do not know what the result of either election will be.  It is an article of my Faith that nobody knows the future but the Almighty.  This I do know: this Bill will certainly put to the severest test the degree of political maturity of the Irish people and the extent of the growth of their political education and judgment.  It is, accordingly, of vital importance, not merely to the present generation but to generations to come, that the issues involved in these proposals contained in the Bill <Col N="1254" /> should be clearly and explicitly put before the people and that they should get that opportunity to which they are entitled of calm and dispassionate consideration and judgment.</P>
      <P>This Bill is certainly full of possibilities and pregnant with consequences for good or ill for the present generation and for future generations.  It was, therefore, incumbent upon the representatives of the people here in Dáil Éireann to ensure that the provisions of this Bill, every aspect of it, every possibility contained in it and every possible consequence that might ensue from it, should be considered and adequately debated, so that the Irish people would know that they were not engaged in a purely political debate, that it was not a question of &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up Fianna Fáil&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up Fine Gael&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up Labour&rdquo; or anything else, but that they were engaged in a political discussion of high import and of great consequence to the future of this country.  It behoved us here and it behoved in particular the Government to approach the task that faced us here in Dáil Éireann in the past couple of months with serious recognition of the responsibility which lay upon them to the present generation and to future generations.</P>
      <P>We are told in the Constitution, which has been so much lauded by the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health, in Article 45, the duties which are cast upon the Oireachtas and, thereby, upon the representatives of the people who sit in the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are told what their responsibilities and their duties are in framing and discussing legislation.  These are set out in Article 45 under the heading &ldquo;Directive Principles of Social Policy&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas.  The application of those principles in the making of laws shall be the exclusive care of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that much-lauded Constitution and that Article thereof, Deputies here are charged with the duties mentioned <Col N="1255" /> in that Article and, in particular, they are bound to strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting, as effectively as they may, a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.  They are, I repeat, under a responsibility in the legislation they sponsor and support in this House to promote the welfare of the whole people and, impliedly, to have due regard for the principles of justice and charity.</P>
    <P>At all events, I believe a number of Ministers and many of the Deputies who have spoken in this House on the Government side do not know what the principles of justice or charity are and are prepared to bolster up any case, by any argument, however much it may be in derogation of these principles of justice and charity.  The people are entitled to know the meaning of this Bill and the reasons for it. Accordingly, we who are in opposition &mdash;all Parties and all sections in the Opposition&mdash;approach the duty that we feel imposed upon us in all seriousness and with every intention of seeing that this Bill will be fully debated.  So far as we can ensure it, we wish it to get to the people in such a way that they will be able to do their duty and, as we hope, demonstrate once again that they have reached a degree of political maturity and political education in this small State of which we may well be proud.</P>
    <P>They will not be able to demonstrate that unless they get the opportunity of knowing what is involved in this and, also, of knowing the truth and, also, of appreciating the fact that they are doing something which not merely affects a political Party or the head of a political Party, but affects generations of the Irish people yet unborn, perhaps.</P>
    <P>I drew attention in the course of the debates on this Bill to the falsity of the case that was being put forward and to the fact that the Irish people were about to be deluded, if Fianna Fáil could achieve it, by appeals to old loyalties, political loyalties and personal loyalties to the Leader of the Party and that they <Col N="1256" /> were being asked to vote for the proposals in this Bill, not because they knew or cared or understood what was in the Bill, but because they were asked &ldquo;not to let the old man down.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should think that, in the conduct of the future debates in the other House of the Oireachtas, the Seanad, and also in the propaganda that will be put forward during the course of the campaign on the referendum and the Presidential election, Fianna Fáil, at least at this late hour in their political life, should realise their responsibilities and, whatever about the Presidential election, at least in their debates on the Referendum Bill, should put whatever arguments they have with truth and with some degree of accuracy.</P>
    <P>It would take me quite a long time to deal with all the malicious innuendoes and the false suggestions that have been made here to bolster up this case by the Fianna Fáil Ministers and those of their Party who spoke in this debate.  I intend to select only one or two to justify what I have been saying as a warning to the Irish people to be sure, when they are considering the verdict they have to give on these proposals, that they will weigh the arguments and sift the so-called reasons and be in a position to assess the true worth of what is being told to them.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that, if the Ministers were really serious in their efforts in this Bill, that they would have been able to advance cogent arguments and to rely upon reason and argument and not upon malicious innuendoes and suggestions, but, of course, as we know and as I am sure a very big number of the people realise at the present time, this Bill is nothing but a piece of aggressive arrogance on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party and an unscrupulous effort to secure permanent power and, in order to secure that, which is the essential aim of this Bill, they forget the dictates of truth, justice and charity.</P>
    <P>May I take one example at the outset? Deputy O'Malley, speaking on <Col N="1257" /> the Committee Stage of this Bill, on Wednesday, 26th November, 1958, at column 1088, Volume 171, No. 8 of the Official Reports, said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy McGilligan had a few words to say, about 12 in all, on what his ideas were and I give this as his opinion on the system of P.R. On the 25th May, 1937, Deputy McGilligan said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley purports to quote what is in the Dáil Debates of that date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was always held with regard to P.R., which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The comment by Deputy O'Malley on that alleged quotation is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now by their fruits you shall know them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, was one of the statements which I said had no regard for charity, truth or justice and contained an entirely false and malicious innuendo.  It was repeated in a publication which was handed to me the other day by a gentleman I do not know.  In the January issue of <i>An Gléas</i>, the political propaganda sheet of Fianna Fáil, No. 43 of January, 1959, in which their propaganda in reference to the Presidential election and the referendum is set forth, there is in a framed square or whatever the journalistic expression for it is&mdash;in a framed panel&mdash;there appears: &ldquo;Who said this?&rdquo; It is in a corner and recollect this is a document that is to be sent widespread throughout the country in order to get votes for the Government case on the referendum. &ldquo;Who said this?&rdquo; And this is what is quoted: &ldquo;It was always held that with regard to P.R., which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system&rdquo;&mdash;following Deputy O'Malley's quotation from Deputy McGilligan.  Then you see: &ldquo;For the answer to this question see column 4&rdquo; and in column 4 is given in black letters: &ldquo;Who said it?  Mr. Patrick <Col N="1258" /> McGilligan, T.D., in Dáil Éireann on 25-5-'37.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we go to the Dáil Debates and what do we find?  We find that that quotation has been deliberately misquoted because what Deputy McGilligan said at column 1070 of the Dáil Debates of 25th May, 1937, was something more than was given there.  This is the full quotation which ought to have been given if Fianna Fáil had any belief in their case, not to speak of having any regard for truth, justice or Christian charity.  This is what Deputy McGilligan said and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was always held that with regard to P.R., which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President, as he then was, now the Taoiseach, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That may be the Deputy's opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not my viewpoint, but one held by a number of people, and it is a matter that might be argued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can argue it when it comes up again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was deliberately stated in this House by Deputy O'Malley, misquoting Deputy McGilligan for the purpose of suggesting that Deputy McGilligan's view was that we had adopted the worst possible system of P.R.  That was repeated or it is going to be spread broadcast&mdash;that lie&mdash;throughout the length and breadth of this country in order to get votes for Fianna Fáil in the referendum.  I say that is why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies and the Fianna Fáil Party even in this <Col N="1260" /> rag should have some regard to truth and I say that the vital part of the quotation from Deputy McGilligan was left out, where he says: &ldquo;It is not my view,&rdquo; and when Deputy O'Malley makes a statement in this House suggesting that it was his view, and when that statement is made in this propaganda sheet which is to be circulated widespread throughout the country, it is time the Irish people understood the depths to which the Government have been reduced in order to try to get this Bill passed by an unthinking people and people who are shallow enough to accept what is said in a Party propaganda sheet.  I want to protest against that class of thing because I do feel this is a most serious issue for the people and it ought not to be fought merely on the lines of Party political propaganda. There ought to be a possibility of putting a calm and considered case to the Irish people, without resorting to lies.</P>
      <P>I want to refer again to one or two other examples of similar matters in order that I may get home to the Irish people what they have to decide on this Bill when it is referred to them by referendum.  The Minister for Health this afternoon repeated some of these mean and malicious suggestions.  I have with great difficulty, in deference to the ruling of the Chair, in the course of the speeches I have made, prevented myself from answering the sneers and the gibes and the malicious suggestions made from the opposite benches about my colleagues and myself in what they are pleased to call the Coalition Governments from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957.  When the Minister for Health to-day repeats these sneers, I am entitled at least to make one or two comments upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He suggested, as has been suggested before in this debate&mdash;and I passed it over for the reason that I would find another opportunity outside this House to answer these matters, but I cannot let it pass on this, the Final Stage of the Bill, when the Bill with all its provisions is leaving the House for the last time&mdash;that as Leader of the Government <Col N="1261" /> in 1954 to 1957, I abrogated my constitutional duty and right in reference to the right of the Taoiseach to ask for a dissolution of Dáil Éireann from the President.  He suggested, and almost went beyond the point of suggestion, to state, that there was something scandalous and disreputable in the way I had asked the President for a dissolution in 1957 when the Government I led still had a majority supporting it in this House.</P>
    <P>He suggested it was because of some difficulties in the Government about financial affairs or because we were unable to produce the Book of Estimates or the financial proposals for that year and he told us, quite obviously being afraid of Deputy Norton, that of course Deputy Norton did not say it but that some of his supporters did say it throughout the country during the election campaign, that we were not a happy family in the Coalition at that time.  I want to answer that very simply.  I asked the President for a dissolution and got it, as I was entitled to ask for it and to get it, because I felt I was doing my duty to the Irish people.  It had no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to any policy or any financial affairs, any Book of Estimates or anything else.  It was intimated to me that a certain Party supporting the Government at that time were withdrawing their support.</P>
    <P>We had got, in 1954, a clear mandate, as was admitted by the Taoiseach, to form a Coalition Government, as he likes to call it, and when it was quite clear that a certain Party in that Coalition was not going to continue its support, I felt it my duty to put the matter to the Irish people and I did so.  That ends that.  I hope the Minister for Health and all the other people who have been making these suggestions in the course of this debate, and elsewhere, will now cease their false suggestions and malicious and mean innuendoes.</P>
    <P>As I say, I will take another occasion to deal with the sneers and the gibes about Coalition Governments, and the two I had the honour and privilege of leading in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the innuendo of <Col N="1262" /> the Minister for Health this afternoon and some of the things said during the course of the debate, I will say that I had the privilege and pleasure of being associated with Deputy Norton, Leader of the Labour Party, for nearly six and a half years in Government.  During all that time I never had any dispute, difference or anything other than extreme harmony with him.  I hope there will be no more of these lies, suggestions or innuendoes throughout the country. The Minister for Health repeated them to-day.  I want to put an end to that.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate and outside the House it was also suggested that we opposed the First Reading of this Bill because we were afraid to let the Irish people decide upon it by referendum. That, again, is untrue, something that should not be restated.  I want to make the position quite clear. We opposed the Bill from the very start because we felt it was urgently necessary to rouse the Irish people to the dangers of the proposals contained in the Bill which will soon have passed all its stages and go from this House.  We were accused of obstruction. I felt&mdash;and still feel&mdash;that the proposals in the Bill are fraught with such grave possibilities and consequences for the Irish people that it was necessary that they should be thoroughly debated and dissected.  I state these as mere examples.  Time does not permit me to go into all of them.  I will take an opportunity elsewhere and at other times to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to pass to the Bill.  It is, I think, a matter of some little significance that on the occasion, when the Taoiseach has announced his intention of retiring from the active political arena, there should be contained in this Bill proposals for increasing the powers of the President.  I say that the Taoiseach has announced his intention of retiring from the political arena because he will be elected to the office of Uachtarán or he will not.  If he is elected he must cease to be the Head of the Government.  If he is not elected&mdash;if he gets such a rebuke from the Irish people&mdash;I do not think that he could possibly remain on as Taoiseach.  Apparently, the Minister for External Affairs, with his prophetic <Col N="1263" /> vision, says he will be elected.  Assuming he is elected&mdash;I am pretty certain the Taoiseach and his colleagues think it is a certainty&mdash;with that thought in their minds, we find in this Bill a proposal to increase the power of the President.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill I drew attention to the powers of the President in reference to the commission and the dangers inherent in it.  It is not without significance that that addition is put in when the Taoiseach thinks he is going to be President.  I think it is a bad thing to increase the powers of the President; it is worse to suggest&mdash;it seems to be implied&mdash;that there should be some sort of closer relationship between the office of the President, the office of the Taoiseach and the Dáil.  I think it a bad thing to increase the powers of the President to dismiss a judge and the six members of this commission as the proposal stands in the Bill at the present time. It is a bad thing to bring the President into the arena of hot, passionate Party politics.  That is the proposal in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> reflects the view of the Taoiseach in this matter but that correspondent has been singularly accurate in all his prognostications of what was going to happen in reference to the proposals for the referendum and to the Presidential campaign.  On the 9th January, 1959, it was stated by the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> that Mr. de Valera was going to stand for President.  He went on to say that the duties of President would not be so arduous as those of Taoiseach and that under the Constitution he would be constantly consulted on major matters by the Government.  The statement continues: &ldquo;It is believed, too, that Mr. de Valera would tend to draw the office of President more closely to the Government and the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to register here a protest against any such suggestion.  I want to ask the Taoiseach and the members of the Government if this represents their view.  Colour is given to it by <Col N="1264" /> the fact that in this Bill the President's powers are being increased in a way that would seem more closely to associate the office of President with political matters than heretofore.  It is entirely unjustified.  It is entirely undemocratic that anybody should be able to say that the President, who ought to be merely the ornamental Head of this State, merely the figurehead of this State to perform certain very limited functions, Mr. de Valera going, as he believes, into that office, would tend to draw the Presidential office more closely to the Government and the Oireachtas.  I want to know from the Taoiseach to-night, when he is winding up the debate, whether that represents his view because, if it does, we are up against a very serious issue indeed.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for External Affairs to-night and earlier in the afternoon to the Minister for Health. The Minister for Health was obviously reading from a prepared brief.  He did it very badly indeed.  I would say that the Minister for External Affairs put forward such arguments as he did glibly and with a certain degree of coherence.  His efforts, added to those of the Minister for Health, would really make one think that there was never before a more wonderful thing in the world than the proposal contained in this Bill to impose the straight vote on the electorate.  Never was there such a thing before in the world.  There is nothing standing between the Irish people and the proposal which Mr. Khrushchev spoke of yesterday&mdash;more food, less work and no taxes.  All that is standing between us now is P.R. and we will have less work, more food and no taxes.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is perhaps relevant to interpolate at the moment in reference to &ldquo;no taxes&rdquo; that, since Fianna Fáil got into office, they have never reduced taxation.  The only time taxation was reduced since 1932 was when the Coalition was in office.  It was not P.R. that stopped the Fianna Fáil Government during all those years. But whether this is such a heaven-sent gift or not, may we say we are open to a little argument?  There might be something to be said about it but there <Col N="1265" /> is very little to be said for it.  Anything that could be said for the straight vote, any single thing the Minister for External Affairs said to-night in the course of his jumping up and down on the Committee Stage of this Bill was all known in 1937&mdash;every single thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had his officials searching the libraries of Europe for books, documents, and information concerning France, Germany, and other places on the Continent of Europe.  He thinks probably he knows America so well that he need not read any book about it and that he is able to speak <i>ex cathedra</i> from his own knowledge of the United States.</P>

This wonderful system that will bring such great prosperity to Ireland and which is the only obstacle between unheard&mdash;of and untold prosperity&mdash;all that was there in 1936.  The then President of the Executive Council, now the Taoiseach, said at that time that P.R. was the best system and that, by and large, it worked extremely well.</P>

      <P>This has been quoted many times during the debates on this measure.  In Volume 67-68 of the Official Report of the debate in this House on the Constitution, as reported at column 1343, this is what the Taoiseach, who was at that time the President of the Executive Council, had to say in relation to P.R.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in the country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here.  It gives a certain amount of stability.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be grateful for P.R.&mdash; that one system that is standing now between us and untold and unheard-of <Col N="1266" /> prosperity.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is also our present Minister for Industry and Commerce, said at that time that P.R. was certainly a better system than that which prevailed heretofore and which was then in operation in Great Britain.  He said that the system which operated in that country might well give the minority a very substantial majority in Parliament.  That was what they said then, with all the arguments available to them at that time that are available to them now.</P>
    <P>When I had the temerity, doing my duty as a member of the Opposition and putting the case against the proposal, when I put the case that might be put against it, the then President of the Executive Council, the present Taoiseach, brushed it aside and said we should be grateful for having the system and that he intended to enshrine it and imbed it deeply in the Constitution&mdash;and prevent the country from getting the prosperity which it will now get.  Perhaps that is why, all during the term of office of Fianna Fáil, the country did not get the prosperity to which it was entitled.</P>
    <P>Is it not utterly preposterous for Ministers and their satellites, speaking from prepared briefs, to bring forward arguments about France, the United States and other countries, such as we heard from the Minister for External Affairs to-day?  He spoke about France.  That is one of the ways in which they try to dupe the people. However, the Minister was caught out and exposed.  It was clearly shown by independent people that the conditions in France and considerations in reference to P.R. have no relation whatever to the situation that emerged from time to time in that Republic.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs also said that the United States were very lucky because the Almighty gave them, after they had won their freedom, I suppose, a collection of the wisest constitutional lawyers, the most far-seeing statesmen that any country was ever blessed with.  Subsequently, they had men such as Chief Justice Marshall who moulded the Constitution, then in a very sketchy form, in a way that gave it flesh and blood so <Col N="1267" /> that the nation has become the powerful and mighty nation it is to-day.  But it was not the question of an electoral system that brought that about.  It is nonsense to talk about the conditions existing in other countries which have no relation whatever to this country&mdash; deluding the Irish people by talking about France and other countries.  We have to consider our own conditions.</P>
    <P>We are entering upon an untried pathway.  We are entering upon untrodden ground, upon territory uncharted and unmapped.  We have no experience of how the straight vote will work in our own conditions.  It works in a certain way in Britain because they have a tradition of centuries behind them.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, it works under conditions that exist in that country which do not exist here and which enable it to work well there.</P>
    <P>The two big political Parties there take very good care that no other system will get a chance in Great Britain because it suits the big political Parties.  To-day, the Minister for External Affairs referred in his speech &mdash;I could not follow the relevance&mdash; to some system of P.R. that gave control by Party bosses.  Was he referring to the present system that gave control to the Party bosses of Fianna Fáil?  Whatever the system, what is absolutely and abundantly clear is that, under the straight vote system proposed in this Bill, Party bosses will have the first, middle and last say in all things connected with the selection and election of candidates. As I said on the Committee Stage, it is the apotheosis of Party bosses.</P>
    <P>Of course the Tory Party in Britain do not want P.R.  They do not desire to see the 2,500,000 Liberals, who are without representation there, coming upon the political scene.  Neither do the Labour Party because they have, over the years, built themselves up into a powerful Party and, while they are in for one term of three, four or five years, they are out for the next two, three or four years.  They are in and out.  The see-saw goes on between the two big Parties and that suits them fine.  They will never give a chance <Col N="1268" /> to P.R.&mdash;nor will any Parliament elected here, if these proposals go through and there is a straight vote, ever allow the electorate a chance by referendum or even mob law to change that system because it will suit the big Parties that will emerge here in the future far better.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs also gave a very interesting piece of information which, I am sure, will be of great interest to the people.  He said that one of the reasons&mdash;one of the reasons&mdash;why they did not have the straight vote in the Constitution when it was being drafted in 1936-37, and enacted by the people subsequently, was, if you please, that they were afraid the Constitution would not be passed by the people.  It nearly took my breath away.  In the statement I have read out the Taoiseach said we ought to be grateful for having P.R. Now, the Minister says the reason why they put in P.R. was that they were afraid the Constitution would not be passed.  They were in such a bad way, by reason of the foul tactics of the Opposition, that they feared the people would be deluded and the Constitution would not be passed.  In other words, what the Minister for External Affairs has done here to-night is to accuse his Leader, the Taoiseach, of deliberately deceiving the Irish people when&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>He said it could be changed and a means of changing it put into the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not run away from your case.  I took it down here.  On the one hand we had the President of the Executive Council, as he was then&mdash;the Taoiseach, as he is now&mdash;saying we ought to be grateful for having P.R.  On the other hand, if the Minister for External Affairs is right, I repeat that the irreproachable Dev. deliberately deceived the Irish people in order to get his precious Constitution passed by them and that he would not have got it through if he had not.  That is one of the arguments seriously put forward by the Minister for External Affairs in asking the Irish people to approve of these proposals through the <Col N="1269" /> referendum.  He is saying to the Irish people: &ldquo;Your hero, Dev., deluded you or whoever was voting in 1937.  He deliberately deceived you to get the Constitution through. Now in his old age you will absolve him from his mortal sin against you.&rdquo; That in one aspect is very funny but in another aspect it is very serious indeed, when the Government Party and their Ministers have to resort to such tactics as those.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat very briefly what I said in the course of some of the discussion. What amazes me is the arrogance of the Government, of the Party supporting them and all who support them, whoever they may be, in the country&mdash;their arrogance in trying to mould the future of this country in the interests of their own Party.  How do we know what the conditions will be in future years? We are, to use a phrase that has become a cliché, at the end of an era. The Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, who has been a prominent figure in Ireland for good or evil, for many years, will be departing from the political scene, whatever the result of the Presidential election will be.  That will have a paramount effect upon the political allegiance of future generations. We do not know how the people will act in the future but the Government have the arrogance to say conditions will exist for all time in this world, and in this country in particular, exactly as they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to put fetters around future generations in the interests of one political Party, in the interests of a pet notion of the disappearing Taoiseach.  A dying generation has no right to hamper or endeavour to hamper the young generations of Irish men and women.  If the Irish people want to elect through this system of P.R. cranks and cranky Parties, as the Minister for External Affairs said to-night and as the Minister for Health also said earlier, they have a right to do so and it is not democracy to prevent their exercising that right.  It is not democracy to say: &ldquo;We want to have a particular system here because we think it will be better for our <Col N="1270" /> Party&rdquo;, and under cover of all sorts of misrepresentations and slanders get this thing through.</P>
    <P>I pleaded, and the Opposition as a whole pleaded, that time would be given to calm deliberation on this matter, that it would be examined, and that we should not, at the end of this era of a dying generation, foist our ideas, even if we think them good ideas, upon generations of young people who are now perhaps only 17 or 18 years of age and who will be voting at the next general election. We have no right to do it.  We are doing an injustice in foisting on them our own particular notions whether they be valid or whether we hold them sincerely or not.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as the forseeable future for mankind.  We do not know what dangerous conditions we shall create by means of this Bill.  This above all is a matter in relation to which we ought to have gone slowly and cautiously.  We have had experience of this system of P.R.  It has worked well and the people have been able to use it properly for a period from 1922 to 1959 at various elections from time to time.  Now, because particular individuals think they should not have been beaten in two general elections, in 1948 and 1954, the people are told: &ldquo;The system is a bad one.  It should be changed, but we leave that to you to do, so give us your dying benediction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A dying generation such as we are has no right to impose its will upon young people.  I want to emphasise and repeat for the last time in this House that if this system is changed the Irish people will never, certainly not for generations to come, be given a chance, for the reasons I have already given, to change that system whether or not it works well for the Irish people.  They will never get a chance to change it by constitutional means and it will require something like a revolution to do so.</P>
    <P>We have had here something precious.  I used to boast that we had democracy in Ireland brought to its logical conclusion, that we had parliamentary democracy, that we had <Col N="1271" /> adult suffrage and P.R.  Few countries in the world can make a boast of that kind.  We are a small nation, a people who had been derided for centuries and who had been made the butt of the British boast that we would never be able to govern ourselves, but whatever struggles we have had&mdash;and we have had many deep and bitter ones&mdash;at least we have demonstrated to the world we are able to manage our own institutions.</P>
    <P>We built those institutions in hard and difficult times and in spite of difficulties.  It was a source of pride to us and something precious that we valued, that we had parliamentary democracy, representation through adult suffrage and by means of P.R. a chance for every section of the people that required and wished to be represented in an Irish Parliament to get their due and just share of representation there.  That was something of which we were proud.  That is something the Government ask the Irish people to throw away.  Because we built our parliamentary traditions in difficult times and in spite of difficulties, they ought to be and, I think, they are all the more precious to us and we should not throw them away, because we will have a new Parliament, building up some other and probably less precious traditions under the proposal in this Bill.</P>

      <P>My reason for speaking is the fact that no Independent has spoken to-day and as this Bill is designated to eliminate Independents and small Parties, the main victims should have a say in the final appeal.  I am glad the Taoiseach is here because I am wondering has he considered all that has been said here.  It is strange if he has not or if he has not been advised as to what has been said here because it would be tantamount to giving a direction to the people in ignorance of what was said against the proposal.  As has been pointed out, the proposal is very grave.  It means that only a privileged set of people will now <Col N="1272" /> govern this country and that only a privileged set of people will be members of this House.</P>
      <P>I am, perhaps, not the ideal type of member.  Perhaps the ideal type is the fellow who is glad to be here and who keeps his mouth shut.  We have two Parties comprised largely of people who were the product of the national struggle, and those people are now either about to retire, or are in a certain stage of dotage.  They must be, and if it is the policy&mdash;and it has been the policy&mdash;of the Parties to want only those nice, quiet gentlemen who will not say much, that does not bode well for the future.  Performance is not effected by nice, quiet people, but by people with will, and if only nice, quiet people, who are afraid to say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to the leaders, comprise the Parties, who then are to take the place of those older men who undoubtedly had ability but who are now on their way out?</P>
      <P>It is all right to ask what about their sons and all that, but I do not want to make any reference to sons. Let me say this much, however, that there are sons who have undoubted administrative ability, but recently, when a writer tried to defend nepotism in politics, he attempted to show that great men's sons can also be great. What did he do but quote.  Alexander the Great and then jump to Pitt, over 2,000 years of history, to try to trace a couple of people to prove his point? Leadership is necessary in political Parties for the welfare and progress of the country, and to face major obstacles such as our economic problems and Partition, a problem little referred to in this House. How are we to make out, if the main Parties are to be comprised of nice quiet people, perhaps the sons, perhaps the friends of the leaders who are passing out?  It means that to a large extent mediocrity will be in command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the position in England for quite a long period.  It has been established that most of the Prime Ministers there were mediocre in ability and the one man they hold up is Churchill, a square peg of a man. They all conspired to keep him out because he was not the nice, quiet, gentlemanly type, and it was only <Col N="1273" /> because the English people were in real danger, and largely because he was connected with an aristocratic family, that alone saved him and planted him in the Parliament.</P>
    <P>My objection is that this Bill says that any man with natural ability may keep out.  While the Taoiseach may say that a man with natural ability can join a Party, that man is the type who is not wanted in political Parties.  If the Taoiseach has any experience of constituencies, he ought to realise what goes on in them.  Each constituency is comprised of a lot of people.  Some of them have been there a long time and are actually in control of the constituency and, when any man tries to push himself forward, the majority is against him.  Not only that, but that majority will get the blessing of the oldtimers at the top, so that I do not think the Taoiseach really knows politics at the bottom.</P>
    <P>I have said my piece because I wanted to have a say in this final appeal.  I am protesting against this Bill because it means the control of politics in the hands of a privileged few.  It means mediocrity in command and, on behalf of the thousands of people who aspire to be members of this House, I protest, and I protest, and I protest.  I shall say no more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has now come to the final stage of the discussions on this Bill and while many arguments have been used which, in normal circumstances, ought to disturb the Government responsible for the Bill, and while many of these arguments are of a cogency which might call into question the Government's wisdom in the interests of the nation in proceeding with the Bill, I expect we shall have from the Taoiseach to-night a relentless endorsement of the Bill, a profession by him that this Bill is going to lead the Irish people into a land of milk and honey, and that all the difficulties of the past will now disappear and be dissipated, once we adopt the method of election of the single non-transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's only policy in this matter appears to be: when in doubt do what the British do, because <Col N="1274" /> that is the attitude of the Government in this Bill.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Health and the Minister for External Affairs have been sent in here to tell us the advantages which flow from the single non-transferable vote, and they have quoted in support of their view what Lord Craigavon did in order to ensure that his Party would have proprietary rights to Government in the Six Counties.  We have been told why the British Government clings on to the system of the non-transferable vote.  Canada has been quoted and South Africa has been quoted.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there is one thing about the British&mdash;they must have qualities which are not strictly definable, because here, notwithstanding all we have said about them down through our chequered history, the Taoiseach has now reached the stage, in 1959, when he commends to the Irish people the same method of election as the British have adopted and retained.  He commends to our people here the same method of election as the Stormont group have adopted in order to strangle an effective Opposition Party in Stormont, and to rivet themselves in power.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that any Bill has had the unique record of this Bill. Bills have come into this House and have been amended in a variety of ways, on the Committee Stage and on the Report Stage, but this Bill, because of the docile majority who sit behind the Government, has not been amended in Committee.  Not a single amendment has been made in these two contentious Bills and probably will not be made because, once the Taoiseach gets the bit in his teeth and tells the boys that this must be done, then it is as much as their political life is worth to question the wisdom of what he says.  The Taoiseach is still riding through his battle with the bit in his teeth, and his own spurs on his back, in case he should relent in the slightest and listen to the reasonable and common-sense arguments which have been advanced in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>What are we doing in this Bill?  I want to put it briefly.  Here, under this Bill to-night, we are proposing to <Col N="1275" /> abolish the system of P.R. which our people have experienced over approximately the past 40 years.  Here, to-night, we are proposing to abolish a system of election which gives substantial groups of people&mdash;not less than 25 per cent., in a three-member constituency&mdash;the right to have representation on the floor of this House; to put the point of view of those who sent them here before Parliament and before the nation.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to abolish a system with which we are familiar and to adopt a system of election of which none of our people, under 58 years of age, has had any previous experience. Can anybody imagine that this system as it works in the Six Counties, or as it works in Britain, will have any mesmeric economic or fiscal advantages for this country?  If the abolition of P.R. could have made the Six Counties prosperous, they would have been prosperous long ago.</P>
    <P>In this debate, the Taoiseach has pretended to see in the abolition of P.R. the abolition also of many other problems with which this Government promised to deal and which, during the past two years, they have given no evidence of their intention even to think about seriously.  We were told by the Taoiseach that the people knew the system of P.R.  We were told by the Taoiseach, that our people understood the system of P.R.  We were told by the Taoiseach, in 1927, that he would never say that a minority should be denied representation and if the object of those who advised the abolition of P.R. was to wipe out minority representation, they would get no support from him.  Ten years later, he said that we probably get, in this country, the best results under a system of P.R.; that we get better balanced results than in any other country.  He said that we get the benefits of P.R. in reasonably balanced legislation.  The Taoiseach recommended P.R. to the country in 1937 in these words which permit of no ambiguity whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs says that the Taoiseach put P.R. into the Constitution as a masquerade.  The <Col N="1276" /> Taoiseach said he recommended the inclusion of P.R. in the Constitution because of its virtues, which are described in this un mistakable language.  But his Minister for External Affairs said: &ldquo;That is not so at all; we put P.R. into the Constitution because we were afraid it would be beaten if we took P.R. out of it.&rdquo; There is a pretty situation: the Taoiseach saying: &ldquo;We put it in because of its virtues&rdquo; and the new hopeful for the position of Taoiseach saying: &ldquo;Not at all; we put it in there because we were afraid to take it out&rdquo;.  Now, the Taoiseach can be right or the Minister for External Affairs can be right, but they both cannot be right. One of them must be wrong.  The Taoiseach should tell us whether the Minister is right or does the Taoiseach believe what he said when he commended P.R. to the House and to the country in 1937?  There has been no public demand whatever for the abolition of P.R.</P>
    <P>Frequently, it is not very difficult to get local authorities and various other bodies to meet and pass resolutions on various subjects.  Everybody who has had experience of Irish life knows that.  Can anybody recall a local authority, between 1937 and 1958, meeting to pass resolutions demanding the abolition of P.R.?  Can anybody recall any body in the country meeting to demand the abolition of P.R.?  How many Deputies on those benches could put up their hands and say, before they vote this evening on this Bill, that they made speeches demanding the abolition of P.R.?</P>
    <P>There was, in fact, no demand from the public for the abolition of P.R. This demand has arisen only in the Taoiseach's imagination.  He believes he now sees what the Irish people want. He believes he sees the abolition of P.R. as being better for the Irish people.  Lord Craigavon thought the same, that it was better for the sake of the people in the Six Counties.  The Taoiseach, nearly 30 years afterwards, follows faithfully in the footsteps of Lord Craigavon, notwithstanding his condemnation in 1929 of the step which Lord Craigavon took then in abolishing P.R.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> The Six Counties have been quoted to us as an example of a territory where stability has been brought about by the abolition of P.R.  Everybody knows the sole purpose of the Orange group which controls the Stormont Parliament was to abolish P.R. so as to dwarf, and as far as they could, strangle, opposition to them in that Parliament.  The sole purpose of maintaining the single non-transferable vote in England is to keep out the Liberals because the British Tory and Labour Parties do not want to see the reemergence of a Liberal Party which, on its political strength, must get votes and seats, and these seats would inevitably take from the strength of the other two larger Parties there.</P>
    <P>Why compare conditions in a country of fewer than 3,000,000 people, with a dwindling population and with an entirely diverse economic structure, with the conditions which operate in Britain to-day?  The reasons which justify and convince the British that they should maintain the single non-transferable vote are reasons which take stock of the British position and the British economy and the pattern of political life in Britain and of a very long tradition of Parliamentary government there.</P>
    <P>Is anybody prepared to say that all these conditions are repeated in exactly the same form, if on a smaller canvas, in this country?  Does anybody believe that the reasons which justify the British in continuing their method of election are reasons for its adoption here?  When the Six Counties abolished P.R., we said in 1937&mdash;through the mouth of the Taoiseach&mdash;that we would get better balanced results with P.R. than any other method of election, and better results than any country of which the Taoiseach knew.  Now we are asked, in spite of these positive statements, to reverse what the Taoiseach recommended in 1937 and to vote for the abolition of P.R., because the Taoiseach thinks the abolition of P.R. has brought stability to the Six Counties, and that its non-appearance in Britain and Canada and New Zealand have brought stability to these countries.</P>
    <P>That is the sole reason we are being <Col N="1278" /> asked to abolish P.R.  The Taoiseach, however, in the course of this debate, did draw the curtain aside from a secretive mind.  He said, at one stage, that he was not strongly opposed to P.R. himself, that what he disliked were the inter-Party Governments which he said, or alleged, grew up under a system of P.R.  The Taoiseach has gone on record as saying that he hated the inter-Party Government.  He detested an inter-Party Government&mdash;very noble sentiments indeed for the Taoiseach and particularly noble sentiments, if and when he occupies the office of President in the Phoenix Park.  These were the Taoiseach's sentiments as recorded in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Why does the Taoiseach dislike inter-Party Government?  He was quite content with P.R. so long as he could command, as he did, a majority in the House.  He had control of the Government from 1932 to 1948, but when the Taoiseach and his Party were defeated in the election of 1948, the Taoiseach then adopted the attitude that P.R. was detestable, notwithstanding his previous commendations of it.  P.R. was opposed to the best interests of the Irish people and the Taoiseach never forgave P.R. simply because the people, in the exercise of their rights, in 1948, decided that they would vote for Parties other than Fianna Fáil and gave these Parties sufficient strength to enable them to form an inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if that had been the only occasion on which the Taoiseach's Party had been defeated, the people would have been forgiven and the Parties which formed the inter-Party Government might not be detested so much by the Taoiseach, but when it happened again in 1954, the Taoiseach then determined to pursue a line of policy which would prevent the people from ever again exercising their freedom of choice at an election by electing candidates under the well-known, well-tried and strongly-recommended system of P.R. which the Taoiseach commended to us in 1937 and put into the Constitution of that year.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an exaggeration <Col N="1279" /> to say that the Taoiseach's annoyance in this matter is based on the fact that the Taoiseach was put out of office in 1948 and in 1954.  I am prepared to concede that the Taoiseach is a most remarkable man, a unique man in many respects.  Fianna Fáil, will never get a &ldquo;spellbinder&rdquo; like him in the future because many members of his Party&mdash;and I do not know whether it would be fair to exempt the Taoiseach from this body&mdash;believe that the Taoiseach, the centre of all life, must be the centre of all pageantry in this country, that you cannot have a Government without the Taoiseach and that if you have such Government, you have Hamlet without the prince.</P>
    <P>It may be that some people are born with such a mentality that at a christening they want to be the baby and at a wedding they want to be the bridegroom.  I can understand that kind of mentality and I can understand that having been in office for a long time, as this Government have, you can develop a sort of proprietary sense of government, and feel that nobody can do the job better than you can: that you have some supernatural right to rule and that you can do that and think for the people.  You can imagine, too, that you think for them better than they can think for themselves and exercise their votes for them better than they can do it themselves. I understand that; I understand there can be people who believe that; but that is not democracy. That is just rigging an electoral system so as to ensure that it will give you the results which you have previously determined it will give you.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this Bill rests not on any principle or on any deep-rooted belief that the direct, non-transferable vote has virtues over the P.R. method of election.  It rests on one principle only&mdash;and I put &ldquo;principle&rdquo; in inverted commas,&mdash; that if you can rig the system of election, abolish P.R. and introduce the British and Six County method of election, you may be able, for one election, perhaps for two, to get into this House a Fianna Fáil Party which, while in a minority so far as the votes <Col N="1280" /> cast in an election are concerned, will nevertheless be the largest Party when the votes are counted after the poll and that Party can hold on to office for another election and perhaps one after that.  Many people will say: &ldquo;That will see us through, lads.  We will get two more elections.  There is no need to worry about posterity after that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill is aimed at producing a situation in which the Taoiseach, now that he has decided to endeavour to reside in the Phoenix Park, may bequeath to the Party he is leaving behind a method of election which will ensure that even if he has left the Party and gone to the Park, the Party will at least have an election machine under which, as has been said so often in this debate, if you can &ldquo;collar&rdquo; 30 per cent. of the votes on polling day&mdash;even though that is a minority of the electors&mdash;you can still control a majority of seats in the House and the Government as well.</P>
    <P>If anybody on the Fianna Fáil Benches says that this is a scheme to enable other political Parties &ldquo;to have had it,&rdquo; as one Minister said, then I understand it.  Or if it is said that this is a scheme to get results which will keep the Fianna Fáil Party there, I understand it, but it is not a scheme to ensure that the people of the country will be allowed to exercise their votes in a democratic way and I say that it is nothing short of the bitterest violence to democracy to arrange an electoral system whereby a candidate who gets 3,000 votes out of 11,000 cast can come in here to represent not merely his own 3,000 but the 8,000 who voted against him.  If that is democracy, I do not want to be associated with that variety of democracy.</P>

      <P>With the Taoiseach, I believe&mdash;and I think he was much more truthful in 1937 than he has been on this Bill&mdash;that P.R. had, and still has, all the virtues for which the Taoiseach gave it credit in 1937.  I believe he was right then in resisting any attempt to take P.R. out of the Constitution.  I believe P.R., in our <Col N="1281" /> circumstances and in particular with our past, has virtues the significance of which we cannot appreciate because we have tasted no other system.  It has been rightly said that you miss liberty only when it is taken away from you; we may miss P.R. only when it is taken away from us and the damage has then been done.</P>
      <P>P.R., as the Taoiseach said in 1937, is a stabilising influence.  As a method of election, it eliminates the possibility of an hysterical election.  It makes sure that there can be no snap or panic decisions or frenzied voting. It makes sure that no political quacks or pseudo-revolutionaries can engage in a whirlwind campaign to produce a frenzy among the electorate that can have a very disconcerting effect on election results.  With our past, is it not desirable that we should have an electoral method which will eliminate wild or frenzied voting?  The system which we have, as we have known it over the past 40 years, in spite of many difficulties on the home front, has given stability and relative tranquility in this House, when other methods might not have produced the same results.  Why should we throw away these advantages to-day?  What is wrong with the nation to-day that, of all the issues confronting it, we must concentrate solely on this one issue, the abolition of P.R., for which nobody has made any demand and for the abolition of which only the Taoiseach is the inspiration?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the other day that the abolition of P.R. would give stability.  He said exactly the opposite in 1937.  At any rate, he says that, once we abolish P.R., we shall get stability and single Party Government. In Britain they have no P.R., they have the single member constituency and the non-transferable vote.  It is interesting to note that in the 24 years from 1918 to 1942, Britain had a Coalition Government for 15 years, a minority Government for three years and a one-Party Government for six years.  Therefore, even the adoption of the single non-transferable vote will not ensure for the Taoiseach the eradiction of the evils which he professes to see by a continuance of P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Why, then, is this issue catapulted into the arena here?  Is it possible that we have no other problem before the nation?  Is it possible that we have nothing else to do?  Is it possible that, having nothing else to do, we are just filling in our time until the next election?  Does anyone even remotely suspect that there are tremendous issues outside which call for solution, tremendous issues which affect the lives of simple men and women in their little cottages up and down the country?  While we are wasting weeks discussing something which nobody but the Taoiseach wants, the lives of these people are ebbying away and the problems which affect them are being left untouched.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read in a newspaper the other day a speech made by the Taoiseach in the Mansion House, on the occasion of the anniversary of the meeting of the First Dáil.  He deplored the fact that we still have Partition in the country and he used these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The obvious common sense at the moment is to consolidate what we have got; and we have a lot to do before it is consolidated.  We have to try to provide a livelihood for those born in this country, so that so many of them will not have to emigrate.  It is a difficult task, but one to which we should devote ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sympathise with every single word which the Taoiseach has said there. I would suggest to him that, instead of sundering and fragmenting the political Parties in this country by discussing a worthless Bill of this kind, he should use this platform as a forum from which he could make appeals to each and every Party up and down the country, for the good will, for the enthusiasm, to do what he thought he should do when he spoke in the Mansion House last week, namely, everything possible to provide a livelihood for those born in this country, so that so many of them will not have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recognised that it was a difficult task.  Will it be made any easier by the introduction of a <Col N="1283" /> Bill of this kind, by dividing the country into two on the merits or otherwise of this proposed referendum and the new method of voting as compared with the present method?  Why is it being done at this stage?  Surely the Irish people are entitled to a fair chance and a fair break?  We have 83,000 people registered at the employment exchanges to-day and 17,000 of them are registered in Dublin.  There are 60,000 of our people emigrating each year, trying to find elsewhere the livelihood which they cannot get here.</P>
    <P>While the Irish drift all over the world and while Irish blood ebbs out like that, while those left behind are trying to make ends meet, at a time when the cost of living was never higher than it is to-day, the biggest solace the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party have for them is so say: &ldquo;Forget your troubles; we are all right; we will give you a referendum instead of the reforms you were promised when you voted for us in the last election.&rdquo; It is a derisory comment on the intelligence of the Irish people that they should be treated in that way and it is a sordid method of reciprocating the way in which they voted for the present Government in the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All sorts of motives have been suggested for the introduction of this Bill.  The simple motive for bringing it in is to provide for the country a better method of election, a better method of finding a Government, than the one which exists.  That is the purpose.  It is interesting to note the new enthusiasm of Fine Gael for the system of P.R.  I remember occasions when their attitude was quite different.  I pointed out to the House the advertisements which they issued back in 1927.  We heard quite a good deal of the rumbling which was taking place in the Fine Gael ranks about 1933 on this question of P.R., as it is called.</P>
      <P>One of the primary purpose of an election in this country, as I have already pointed out, is to get a Government for the country, a Government which will be able truly to represent the people, the will of the people and the policy of the people.  When there is talk about representative Government, one would think that it is the representation of Parties that is meant and that if there are 20 different Parties the whole idea is to give representation to those Parties.  As far as I understand it, the whole purpose of representative democracy is to try to get into Parliament members who will represent the constituencies which elect them.  That is done by the system of single-member constituencies and the non-transferable vote, in my opinion, far better than it is done by the system which we have called P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When those opposite talk about P.R., one would imagine that, somehow or other, through this system, every section in the country was going to be represented in this House. Under the single-member system there will be individuals who, in the main, will represent the current of opinion in the constituencies in which they have been elected.  Surely that is the best form of representation, that the people in a single constituency will vote for the person they think best represents the views they have in regard to what is best in the national interest.  You get that by the single-member constituency because <Col N="1285" /> the individual elected is the person who gets the predominant vote indicating the opinion in the constituency.</P>
    <P>The fundamental fault of the system we have is that it leads, as was admitted by the Leader of the Opposition when we were discussing this matter back in 1937, to a multiplicity of Parties.  Do we want that?  Do we want to create a multiplicity of Parties here?  A multiplicity of Parties inevitably means Coalition Governments, and Coalition Governments mean, as was stated in the advertisement I referred to on a previous occasion, bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups&mdash;irresponsible because in such circumstances any group can put before the people a policy which they have not the slightest notion of implementing, a policy which they think will be attractive but which they know they would never have the opportunity of putting into effect.  The moment they enter into a coalition, they get rid of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The single-member constituency and the direct vote means that the person elected is responsible to the people for the policy for which he stands, and that the Government composed of a majority of such is a Government which cannot elude its responsibilities.  It has to face them. The purpose of this measure is to try to give the people a system which will avoid this multiplicity of Parties. It is the multiplicity of Parties that is wrong with the present system.  That system makes for disintegration, whereas the system we are recommending is one which makes for integration.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy I listened to to-day said that we should not have back-room methods and bargaining between the various Parties before an election.  It is very much better that they should bargain before rather than after the election.  We want their bargaining to be put to the test before the people.  If they feel that if they go up as rivals they will divide their supporters, it is very much better that they should come to an <Col N="1286" /> agreement that a certain candidate would be the best representative for both groups.  It is very much better that they should do that in the light of day before the election than that they should do it afterwards in the backrooms when the election is over, as was done before, when the people will not have any opportunity of deciding whether they will or will not accept the bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, it is better that bargains be made before the election so that the people can judge upon them.  They should not be made behind the people's backs.  It is because this system we have leads, and has led in other countries, to a multiplicity of Parties&mdash;and where there is a multiplicity of Parties you have coalitions&mdash;that you have unstable Governments, different groups bargaining, irresponsible groups bargaining and weak Government.  As the Fine Gael advertisement put it, you have frequent changes of Government and you have the bursting up of these coalitions.  It is to try to save the country from the consequences of such a multiplicity of Parties that the present Bill is introduced, and for no other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear that this is undemocratic. Is it undemocratic to put before the people a proposal which we think is good, but which is opposed by others and on which the people themselves are to be the judges?  The people are to be the judges in this case.  It is not as if our Party were putting through something by the weight of our majority in the House.  We are using our majority to give the people an opportunity they would not get except under circumstances such as the present.  The Leader of the Opposition says that they will never get the opportunity again, if this system is put through and they want <Col N="1287" /> to change.  Of course, they will have an opportunity&mdash;a very much better opportunity, I would say, when you had two Parties, each of which would come before the electorate to get a decision in favour of a change if they wanted it, than you would have if you had a large number of Parties, each one with a vested interest in keeping the system in vogue that makes for a multiplicity of Parties.</P>
    <P>The single constituency is a workable constituency.  It is in every way more convenient for the people in it to choose their representative.  It is in every way easier for the representative to know the wants of the particular community he represents and to represent these wants here in the Dáil.  It is very much easier for the people, who have any particular matter they want to bring to his attention, to bring it to his attention; and he will have a definite responsibility placed upon him to look after the interests of the constituency and the interests of the country as a whole.  I say there is no comparison between the two as far as the people's convenience and the satisfactory way in which it can work are concerned.</P>
    <P>The next question is the system of the non-transferable vote.  You can work up as many examples as you like. It is very easy to imagine an extreme case and say: &ldquo;Would you stand for this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Would you stand for that?&rdquo; having worked out some extreme case which could occur.  I shall not say any system is perfect.  I shall not say the single-member constituency system is perfect, but I say it is far less imperfect than the other system.  They say to you: &ldquo;Take a case of, say, 40 per cent., 35 per cent, and 25 per cent. Thirty-five and 25 make 60; therefore, the 40 gets in as against 60.&rdquo; Is that accurate reasoning?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The pretence is that if A gets 40 per cent., B 35 per cent. and C 25 per cent., one must add the 35 per cent. and the 25 per cent. and reach the conclusion that A is in a minority.  That does not follow at all.  It does not follow that A is in a minority; and, equally, it does not follow that if second preferences from C are transferred to B, then B has got the greatest number of preferences, first and second.  I have given the House an example clearly demonstrating that C may be the candidate who should be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the other system is simple.  It is understandable.  Under it, the people will size up the candidates, the policies for which they stand and the sort of Government to which they are likely to lead.  Having sized them up, they will vote for them.  Taking the community as a whole, it has been found that, in the long run the simple <Col N="1289" /> direct system in which the voter puts a simple X in front of the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote, gives the best results.  One thing it definitely does is to compel parties, if they intend to bargain, to do the bargaining beforehand.  It does not, of course, exclude, Parties.  There is nothing in it to exclude Parties.  It does not prevent people voting as they please.  But it does prevent a multiplicity of Parties being able to affect government and prevent stable government.</P>
    <P>At this point, I should like for a moment to deal briefly with the constituency commission.  We have been attacked in relation to the commission. When we were discussing this matter on the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill, I pointed out that the idea of having a body independent of the Dáil was mentioned first by the Leader of the Opposition.  We thought it a good idea because it would remove the pretence that there was a danger of some attempt at gerrymandering.  We believed it was a good idea to take a committee of this House, three nominated by the Taoiseach from the majority Party, since in all probability it will be the majority Party which will from the Government, and three nominated from the Opposition.  It has been said more than once here in these discussions that the three from the Opposition will be nominated by the Ceann Comhairle.  That is not the position. They will be nominated by a method which the Ceann Comhairle will indicate.  He will indicate the method by which the nominations are to be made.  That is essential because the Opposition may vary in its form, and a method which might be suitable if there were only one Opposition Party might not be suitable should there be two, or more, Parties forming the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Let me return now for a moment to this suggestion that under the proposed system there will only be two Parties in the House.  That is not true.  One can have more than two Parties.  All we are trying to do is to ensure that the country will have a stable Government with a stable <Col N="1290" /> majority.  That does not prevent the formation of Parties.  If there is some particular area in which Party A is strong, then the Party A candidate is the representative who will be elected.  In another area it may be Party B which is strong, and it is the B Party's representative who will be elected.  In another area it may be C that is strong, and in that area it will be the C Party's representative who will be elected.  One can, of course, have more than one Party under the system.  Undoubtedly the system does make for single-Party government and not a Government made up of a number of divergent groups.</P>
    <P>On the question of nomination then, the Ceann Comhairle, having taken cognisance of the composition of the Opposition Party, or Parties, will indicate the method by which the representatives from the Opposition side will be selected, so that there will then be three on the commission representatives of the Government and three representatives of the Opposition. So far as it is humanly possible to do so, there will be an independent chairman.</P>
    <P>I was if I may say so, positively scandalised by some of the remarks made by the Opposition about judges and Presidents, and so on, as if it were not possible for a man to do justice if the doing of it might in any way hurt himself.  We would all be very just people, indeed, if justice always coincided with our own desires and our own wills.  I take it that justice means that the right thing will be done even though one may have quite human inclinations to do something different.</P>
    <P>Now, the Council of State is not the nebulous body the Leader of the Opposition seems to suggest.  It is a well-defined body with certain <i>ex-officio</i> members.  Some are chosen by the President as suitable advisers. In the future, as in the past, it will consist of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, representing the Government, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, representing the judiciary, the Cathaoirleach <Col N="1291" /> of the Seanad and the Ceann Comhairle, representative of the two parliamentary assemblies over which they preside, and the Attorney General, together with certain other people who formerly held important offices in the State; one of the members of the council held the office of President of the Executive Council. I do not think there is anything nebulous about these.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of State is a well-defined constitutional body and the purpose of it is to enable the President, when he is acting in certain matters in which he has discretion, to hear the opinions of certain advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of State has been constituted not merely of members representative of the Government side. The President very wisely took note of the Opposition, and when there was <Col N="1292" /> a change of Government and some members who had been on the Government side went over to Opposition, he took those, so that in the Council of State the Government side and the Opposition side are fairly well represented. Therefore, when a matter of this sort, such as the choosing of the chairman, came to be decided by him, he would bring the Council of State together.  He is bound to do it according to the Bill.  He would hear the views that might be expressed as to which judge of the Supreme Court, or the High Court, might be most suitable for this particular task.</P>
    <P>Are we to say that the President, having heard these things, would act unfairly or unjustly, and are we to say that a judge, who is not dependent in any way, will act unfairly or unjustly? The judge is free from pressure, just as the President, during his term of office, is free from pressure by any political Party and can carry out his constitutional duties impartially, without any threat of any kind.  Similarly with the judges.  We have chosen judges for important tasks in the past. We have chosen them, why?&mdash;for one reason, because they are independent of political Parties.  We do not say that any particular person who is interested in the well-being of this country is likely to be completely detached as far as politics are concerned; he may have his likes and dislikes; but, when he is put in a position like that, he acts fairly&mdash;unless we are going to say that all people are corrupt and you cannot get such a thing at all as a man acting decently and fairly and in a way that is expected of him when he has any political leanings.</P>
    <P>A judge is chosen also because he is accustomed to weigh evidence.  He is a man who is likely to weigh up arguments, pro and con.  It is his daily task to do that in relation to certain legal matters.  Matters of fact come up before him for determination from time to time and, therefore, he is a person who is eminently qualified to judge on questions where arguments have been put before him on one side or the other.  I do not think that you could get a better man to do this work. <Col N="1293" /> It will be a difficult task, as we have said already, a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>There will be a certain limit on the number of constituencies.  That will have to be determined by law.  Once that is done, then the commission has to work within that limit and to try to see, in so far as geographical and other conditions will permit, that there will be equality of population in each of these areas.  In my opinion, therefore, everything that can be done to safeguard the community from any political Party malpractices is being done.</P>
    <P>Finally, the judgment will lie with the people.  I believe, believe strongly, that the change from the present system to the system of the single non-transferable vote would give us more stable Government and I would say to Deputy Norton and others that stable Government is fundamental for progress.</P>

      <P>All right.  The system we recommend is every bit as democratic as the other, unless you say that Parties have some special claim and that other sections of the community, unless they happen to be in Parties, are not to be represented. I say that if you have an individual who stands up and is elected in a single-member constituency and gets a majority of votes, that does give representation in a better way than if you have two or three people getting in through the transference of votes from one section to the other.</P>
