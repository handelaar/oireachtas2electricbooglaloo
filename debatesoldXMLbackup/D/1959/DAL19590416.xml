    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In matters relating to finance certain standards are requisite if the Budget is to mean anything for Parliament and the people.  Speaking on the Budget at Volume 167, column 599, on the 23rd April, 1958 the Minister for Finance stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As Deputies are aware, there was a deficit on current account last year of £5.88 million.  Table I of the Tables in connection with the Financial Statement compares the outturn with the budget estimates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then goes on to explain that outturn. If these are the true criteria by which a Budget is to be judged, and it was the present Minister for Finance who laid them down 12 months ago, the outturn of the past year presents a very different picture from that presented by the same Minister to the <Col N="493" /> Dáil yesterday.  He has taken credit this year for a yield from levies of £1.78 millions and a yield of levies converted into duties as explained in volume 167, column 19, for the 31st March, amounting to £.69 million and again in April, 1958 of a further £.6 millions giving a total sum of £3,080,000.</P>
    <P>He has had recourse to a procedure described by his colleague, the Minister for Health, as robbing the till. It is true that on the carry forward of the previous year he drew to the tune of £323,000.  He has taken credit on his current receipts for the nonrecurring settlement of moneys due by a foreign Government in respect of one transaction of approximately £500,000.  These sums taken together represent £3,903,000.  He has elected to borrow for subhead O4 in Vote 50 and subhead Q1 in Vote 50, both of which were financed from current revenue in the past and that represents a sum of £650,000.  These various devices amount to £4,553,000 and if from that you subtract the alleged surplus which the Minister claims for last year, £159,000, judged by the criteria laid down by the Minister last year there was in fact a deficit of £4,394,000.</P>
    <P>I think it is a matter of considerable consequence that at some stage of our history we should accept some standards by which annual expenditure would be correctly judged.  I want to query specifically the permissibility of appropriating to our annual revenue for Supply Services purposes the sum of from £400,000 to £500,000 received in respect of the inter-Governmental debt which is included in certain miscellaneous items in the table of receipts.  That is clearly a nonrecurrent item.  It is clearly related to outlay which took place in the distant past.</P>
    <P>What I think is immensely important, over and above the actual charge that may be brought to bear on these several subheads from year to year, is that if the Minister does choose to make changes involving £4½ million by the process of switching of this character he should direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to it and not calmly <Col N="494" /> announce that in respect of one year he has a surplus of £159,000 simply by a variation of a practice which, if it had not been made, would have resulted in a deficit of £4,394,000.  I think it reasonable to direct the attention of the House to this interesting fact&mdash;that if the criteria which commended themselves to the Minister this year had been applied by him to the out-turn of the Budget based on the Estimates prepared by Deputy Sweetman in 1956 instead of a deficit in that year of £5.9 million, as reported by the Minister for Finance to this House there would have been a deficit of approximately £1.3 million and that in a year where provision had to be made for all the consequences of the Suez dispute.  That relates to procedure. That relates to the reliance we can place upon the Minister's reading of his own accounts.  I deplore that type of procedure.</P>
    <P>A further point arises in this connection which causes me grave concern. The Minister went to some trouble last year to explain at Col. 610 of the Official Report that he could not feel justified in suggesting to the Dáil that an allowance of more than £1½ million should be made for the net estimate for over-estimation.  This year for no reason that I have been able to understand he announces that he proposes to assume an over-estimation of £2½ million and that in a financial year when we have been informed that Córas Iompair Éireann are going to receive £1½ million and no more.  Our past experience of Corás Iompair Éireann gives us very little ground for hope that £1½ million will meets its requirements and, as the House well knows, if they arrive on our doorstep in October, November or December and announce they must have more money or close down the railway line we will have to provide the money notwithstanding the fact that we are told that over-estimation may be legitimately increased this year by £1 million.</P>
    <P>But that is not my main source of anxiety regarding this Budget.  While I agree with the Minister that he was right to reduce income tax, he will recall that on the Vote on Account I pointed out to him that if he wanted <Col N="495" /> to give the economy of this country an effective stimulus, probably the best method he could apply would be a reduction in income tax&mdash;an inducement to our employers and producers to expand their activities with some prospect of obtaining a fair share of the profit they earn.</P>
    <P>Is this House forgetting that in the Budget where we are now reducing income tax, relieving sur-tax, removing the tax from professional boxing, greyhound racing and dancing there is included £9 million of a tax upon bread, flour and butter that was put on two years ago and which is still being carried by all the people who eat bread, bake flour and use butter?</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic change in the approach of this Parliament to the whole problem of taxation if with a light heart we tax bread, flour and butter in order to remove the tax from greyhound racing, professional boxing and cinemas.  I think that is something we ought to think of.  It is something in respect of which we ought to examine our conscience because I see the impact of these taxes all round me every day in circumstances which I hope shortly to describe to the House.</P>
    <P>I live in a part of Ireland where most of the farmers are smallholders who employ no labour but I go out amongst a relatively comfortable, proud, self-sustaining and self-respecting community.  They had not a very high standard of living but they were comfortable.  It was often a source of amazement and admiration to us all how the diligent amongst them reared their families and made priests, doctors and lawyers of their children. We all knew that part of that, perhaps, was provided by the remittances of an emigrant amongst the family but the bulk of it was provided by the hard work of the farmer-occupier-owner and by the parsimonious economy exercised by a good wife.</P>
    <P>Those people in the past two years have been required to pay 25/- per ten stone bag on their flour.  They have had 7d. per lb. put on the butter they use.  If they use bakers' bread they have to pay 4d. more a loaf for <Col N="496" /> it.  They have been informed that they are to get less for their milk when they take it to the creamery. They have been informed that the basic price for their pigs has been reduced.  Those of them who grew barley and wheat as a cash crop have been told that they must take less for them.</P>
    <P>There is developing in that part of the country, and in many similar parts of the country, a phenomenon never seen before in my lifetime, that is, families closing the door, putting a lock on it, leaving for England and abandoning their farm.  I want to warn the House that we are getting to a point, in the west of Ireland, in the south-west and in the north-west, in which the people are going to move out <i>en masse.</i>  We have all forgotten them. When we pile on the burden on the cost of living, we can do something to meet the difficulty of the trade union member by agreeing to a national wage increase; we can do something, albeit it is inadequate, for the pensioner or the old age pensioner; we can do something by a reduction in income tax and super tax for the white collar worker and by the increase in wages he has received; we can do something for the civil servant by increasing his remuneration, to meet at least in part the increase in the cost of living.  We have all forgotten that nothing has been done, and it appears nothing can be done, to meet the position of the small farmer&mdash;except to tell him that what he has to dispose of must be sold for less.</P>
    <P>I view that with great dismay, because I believe it will destroy in this country a very valuable element in our social community.  It is particularly irritating to me because it is accompanied by a continual campaign, largely conducted by the Minister for Lands, to the effect that we have experienced over the last ten years a decade of stagnation.  That is simply not true.  What astonishes me is the effort, and the result of the effort, which has been made by the farmers. I think the figures will show, when I come to refer to them, that there has been an element of stagnation in our <Col N="497" /> industrial development, but that has been due largely to the Fianna Fáil policy of high tariffs and to the Control of Manufactures Act, the latter of which has now been in substance abandoned.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural front, extraordinary efforts have been made by the farmers.  If they had not been made, our situation to-day would be very different from what it is.  If in the last 10 years the exertions of our farmers had not doubled the volume and trebled the value of our exports, where would the balance of payments be at the present time?  But for that remarkable achievement, how would we have met the £200,000,000 worth of imports which were received in this country in the past 12 months?</P>
    <P>That is not all that has been achieved from the land of Ireland.  We have to-day, on the land of Ireland, a record number of cattle and a record number of sheep, having faced a situation 10 years ago when we had the lowest number of cattle and the lowest number of sheep ever seen on the land before.  We had a steadily increasing pig population, until that trend was reversed by the decision to cut the minimum price for grade A pigs, taken by the Minister for Agriculture.  In addition to those factors, we have one million acres of land rehabilitated over the past 10 years, much of which was rehabilitated as a result of subventions provided by the Government, but all of which involved a very substantial contribution by the farmers themselves. We have in this country a new crop, which has met practically all our entire requirements for coarse grain for livestock feeding, which did not exist in this country 10 years ago.  I refer to feeding barley.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad, when the discussion was taking place on the Central Fund Bill, covering the Vote on Account, Senator O'Brien intervened to say a word on the viability of our economy. Senator O'Brien is a great authority on the national economy of this country and his words deserve to be listened to with respect.  As reported in Vol. 50 Col. 1590, he quoted from the grey <Col N="498" /> book <i>Economic Development</i>, where it said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is apparent that we have come to a critical and decisive point in our economic affairs.  The policies hitherto followed though given a fair trial, have not resulted in a viable economy.  We have power, transport facilities, public services, houses, hospitals and a general &rsquo;infrastructure&rsquo; on a scale which is reasonable by western European standards, yet large-scale emigration and unemployment still persist.  The population is falling, the national income rising more slowly than in the rest of Europe.  A great and sustained effort to increase production, employment and living standards is necessary to avert economic decadence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien commented on that paragraph by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is a very strong passage. There is one word in that passage with which, with respect to the author, I disagree&mdash;the word &lsquo;viable&rsquo;.  I think every economic system in which people are not actually faced with starvation, death from lack of food, is viable.  The question is: At what level is it viable?  A country may have to reduce its standard of living in the same way as a family may have to do so.  If a family has to move from a big house to a smaller house, it is still viable.  It has a lower standard of living but it is not dying of starvation.</P>
    <P>This country, on the eve of the Famine, was not perhaps viable to the extent it is to-day.  I take it that what the author meant as not &lsquo;viable&rsquo; is that it is not as progressive as some European countries.  I should prefer the word &lsquo;progressive&rsquo;. However, that may merely be a matter of definition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Brien there, but I agree to some degree with the comment of the author of the grey book.  In our circumstances&mdash;certainly in the surroundings where I live in the west of Ireland&mdash;the question has arisen: &ldquo;Is the economy of the people who live there viable in the sense that <Col N="499" /> it is acceptable to the people who live there?&rdquo;  I am afraid it is ceasing to be so, and ceasing to be so very largely as a result of the cumulative imposts which we are putting upon them, because they have just simply been forgotten.  We think of everybody else, but we forget them; and so, there is emerging a pattern there where the economy is scarcely viable, where people cannot live at a standard at all acceptable in the context of the present times, on what is available there on a ten to 30 acre farm in the west of Ireland.  If that continues, adjustments fall to be made which I think would represent a great catastrophe for this country.</P>
    <P>If I ask myself where are we to look for the source of that threat to the viability of the economy, as we knew it, I think it is to be found very largely in a circumstance referred to by the Minister for Finance in concluding the discussion on the Central Fund Bill in the Seanad. He quoted what Senator O'Donovan had said and accepted the undeniable fact that between 1951 and 1954 Deputy MacEntee, who was Minister for Finance for that period, was responsible for an increase of £40,000,000 in the Government expenditure of this country&mdash;£40,000,000 per annum.  It is from that departure, that increased burden, that I believe the evil with which we are contending at the present time largely derives.</P>
    <P>If I saw any evidence on the part of the Minister to correct that trend, I would have some reason for hope, but, in that situation, and at a time when we have decided for the purpose of stimulating the economy to provide taxation concessions out of a deficit&mdash; which is what is being done in this Budget and I am not at all sure that is not the right thing to do in the circumstances we are in&mdash;if that is not backed up by a firm intention to bring the Budget into balance then I think we are setting our feet on a slippery slope which could lead us to final disaster.</P>
    <P>I am caused concern in that regard when I realise in our existing circumstances, balanced as we are on a very narrow edge, we have announced our <Col N="500" /> intention to spend £6,000,000 on the provision of jet aircraft and the spare parts required to service them and we are resolved, apparently, to embark upon a scheme to spend £9,000,000 in building a factory to produce a nitrogenous fertiliser unsuitable for our agricultural requirements, and which will put a burden of at least 5/- a cwt. on the cost of nitrogenous fertiliser for any quantity of it that may be sold in our community.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we are going on with the building of power stations by the E.S.B. at a time when the situation is described in the book <i>Economic Development</i> at paragraph 4, on page 182, in the following terms:</P>
    <P>In recent years the provision of generating capacity has run ahead of the country's requirements, and the E.S.B. has surplus capacity, over and above a reasonable reserve for contingencies, which would enable it to supply current of 400-500 million units a year in excess of the present demand of about 1,775 million units. This alone would suffice for almost four years of growth of demand at last year's rate.  The period of excess capacity will be prolonged by the completion of new generating stations now under construction.  The heavy excess investment in plant adds to fixed charges and represents a deadweight burden on the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>That fact notwithstanding, the plans outlined in the White Paper for Economic Development contain a very substantial sum for future additions to the power stations of this country, set out in Appendix II to the Programme for Economic Expansion at £31.82 million over the next five years.  That kind of programme seems to me to represent a very poor realisation of the real situation with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>When I look at Table 12 in the Economic Statistics circulated with this Budget statement, I think of two things: one, the matter to which I have referred in agriculture and I direct the attention of the House to the first statistic in Table 12, the estimated total labour force and number of persons at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Their numbers have fallen from <Col N="501" /> 496,000 in 1951 to 429,000 to-day, and then I think of the Taoiseach's announcement that the prime purpose of this Government was to get the people back to work, and I think of the poster &ldquo;Women of Ireland, vote Fianna Fáil and get jobs for your husbands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are 50,000 fewer people at work to-day in this country than there were in 1954.  In 1954, there were 1,185,000 persons at work and to-day there are 1,131,000 persons at work. There were 10,000 fewer people at work in 1958 than there were in 1957; there were 32,000 fewer people at work in 1958 than there were in 1956, and 50,000 fewer people at work in 1958 than there were in 1954.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to refer to the Third Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, page 10, paragraph 27, which states:</P>
    <P>The rate of growth in real output and income has been lower here than in Britain and in other West European countries.  Real expenditure has risen at a faster rate than real output: this was made possible by a succession of deficits in the current balance of payments.  In so far as the causes of emigration are economic, balance of payments deficits have in this sense kept the rate of emigration at a level lower than it would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>I rejoice in a surplus on our balance of payments of £9,000,000 or a surplus of £1,000,000 in the ensuing year, but when it has been purchased at the expense of 50,000 people emigrating, I wonder on which side of the account is the true, favourable balance to be found.  When I look at the Appendix to Table I regarding the balance of payments I recall that there was a deficit of £5.5 million in 1954, £35 million in 1955 and which fell to £14 million in 1956; but there were 50,000 more people profitably employed in Ireland in those days than there are to-day.  Then we swopped close on 40,000 people for a favourable balance of £9.2 million in 1957.  We swopped a further 10,000 people for a favourable <Col N="502" /> balance of £1 million in 1958.  But when we come to look at this favourable balance, for which 10,000 emigrants were paid, we find it consists in part of other capital transactions amounting to £17.7 million.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me when concluding on this debate, with reference to Table 1 in the Appendix in <i>Economic Statistics</i>, is he in a position to give us any information of what that £17.7 million is.  It is one of these balancing figures which has been quoted as evidence of a variety of things, but I have never heard anybody tell me with any degree of precision what exactly it involves.  The confusion is made worse confounded by the fact that in this part of the Appendix plus signs mean minus and minus signs mean plus.  But it would be valuable to the House to get some information as to what that £17.7 million consists of or at least to be told, if it is true, that nobody knows.  I suspect that is the explanation.</P>
    <P>I look at Table 9 in <i>Economic Statistics</i> and I find that savings had declined in 1958 from £60,000,000 in 1957 to £45,000,000 in 1958.  I look at the cost of living figure in table 10 and I see it has risen from 107 in 1956 to 111 in 1957 and to 116 in 1958.  I think I am correct in saying that it has risen further since that statistic was made available.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House, in connection with the suggestion that we have been passing through a period of stagnation, that in fact, if you take the figures for agriculture, the increase in the total output in that industry over the last ten years has been no less than 29.5 per cent. which represents an annual increase of approximately 3 per cent.  This is not sensational but, sustained over such a period, is very hopeful.  It has been gravely interrupted in the last year, but that was largely due, I believe, to the weather and conditions associated with the cereal crop which the Government could do nothing to remedy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we are in the presence in this Budget of the realisation of a dream that was <Col N="503" /> first born in 1951.  I think the plan in 1951 was that there was to be built up a substantial surplus by the Budgets of 1952 and 1953 and that there was then to be a general hand-out in the subsequent Budget for the General Election.  That programme was disrupted by two events.  One was the enormous increase in expenditure which the pressure of various vested interests forced upon the Minister for Finance consequent on the immense increase in the cost of living occasioned by his Budget of 1954 and the other was the unexpected General Election.</P>
    <P>This time I think a more astute practitioner is in charge of the Department of Finance.  He had his Budgets of 1957 and 1958 and now, in good time for the Referendum, the hand-out is being arranged.  I think he hoped that, having collected £9 million from flour, bread and butter, he ought by this stage to have accumulated a true surplus which he would be in a position to distribute.  But he has been caught without the surplus by the situation which developed in Great Britain where the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has distributed a true surplus of £250 million.  That has made incumbent on our Minister for Finance &mdash;and I think he was perfectly right to face that responsibility&mdash;to make a reduction in income tax.  This is good as a stimulus to our own economy but essential in order to maintain the differential in the rate of income tax obtaining in this country and that obtaining in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Budget in Great Britain and the Budget here, the Grey Book pointed out, at page 23, that for a married man with two children over 11 and not over 16, the Irish rate of income tax and sur-tax resulted in higher taxation on earned income in the whole range from £2,000 to £10,000 per annum than in Great Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. The Minister was obliged to face that and I think he was right to face it and remedy it by the steps he took.  If circumstances had allowed it would have been a salutary thing to do even more than he has done; but I am <Col N="504" /> prepared to concede that in a situation where these reliefs had to be provided from a deficit, he has probably gone as far as could be allowed under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>But this year, unlike his Fianna Fáil predecessor, I think he is determined on the hand-out in good time for the equivalent of the General Election which is overhanging him.  Mark you, I expect no better from Fianna Fáil. But it is not a pretty picture, after all the protestations of financial rectitude we have heard from the present Minister and his predecessor, to see them under the shadow of a referendum&mdash; which they now believe they are going to lose&mdash;first throwing the person of their own Leader, the Taoiseach, into the scales, and then, having come to the conclusion that even that gesture was not sufficient, that these concessions should be further furnished out of a deficit which they are ashamed to avow in order to purchase votes in the coming Referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not believe they will succeed but I do believe that it puts us in the situation I have sought to outline. Remembering where this country stands at the present time, with its population moving out, with the number of persons employed steadily decreasing, with the dangerous migration from the most vulnerable part of the land where our people get their living, we ought to ask ourselves what is it our economy really wants if it is to experience a sustained and general revival and if it is to avoid the menace of economic decadence, referred to in the grey book on economic development? There is a great deal of talk suggesting that what we want is increased agricultural production. That is true, but it is not the whole truth.  There is not the slightest use in generating increased agricultural production if we have no place wherein to sell it.</P>
    <P>Mark you, I am surprised that the Government do not appear to be concerned to take any measures to that end, beyond providing £250,000 for market research, about which we have heard nothing although the money was provided two years ago.  I am told that certain interim reports have <Col N="505" /> been furnished to the Minister for Agriculture, but he says that he is not yet prepared to let anybody see them. I should like to recall that in 1948 the predecessors of this Government, as one of their first activities, went to Great Britain in order to secure a market for an unlimited expansion of agricultural output here, and we are still enjoying in certain phases of agricultural output the full benefit of the agreement then made.  Surely the time is ripe for the Government to ask themselves the question what do they propose to do now to provide a market wherein increased production can be disposed of?</P>
    <P>We have reached the point in regard to wheat that the more that is produced the less the farmer will get for it.  There is an automatic price scale operating designed to achieve that end.  What is the future of increased agricultural output then for those who produce it?  Have they any guarantee they will be able to sell it?  I do not want to under-estimate the magnitude of the problem.  All I am asking is what are the Government doing to try to find outlets for increased production? Are we turning our eyes to Europe and making up our minds that our best interests lie in membership of the Common Market?  Or are we convinced that our economic association with Great Britain is so close that our object should be to negotiate with that country for a better trade relation in the future involving, in some degree, the integration of our two economies?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the best interests of the agricultural community will be served by a comprehensive agreement giving us the widest possible access to the British market on terms acceptable to them and to us; and I do not believe it is impossible to secure that if efforts are made to set about it now.  But I do want to urge upon the Government that we are reaching a point when any further increase in agricultural output will be materially hindered if the existing doubts as to the possibility of marketing the produce of that increased production are allowed to grow.</P>
    <P>I hear year after year&mdash;against this, I want to protest emphatically&mdash;<Col N="506" /> lamentations from the Minister for Finance, from the Minister for Agriculture and from the Minister for Lands about the terrible subsidies that have to be paid on the export of agricultural produce.  Nobody refers, when talking about subsidies on exports of agricultural produce, to the immense subsidies that the farmers are paying to industrial enterprises in this country. If you want to buy a cup and saucer, if you want to buy an aluminium pot, if you want to buy a pair of boots, if you want to buy a suit of clothes, if you want to buy a pair of socks, if you want to buy a fork, or a spade, or an agricultural machine&mdash;if you want to buy any industrial commodity&mdash;in every case the farmer is paying on that the supplementary price generated by the protective tariff or quota under which the manufacturer is manufacturing here.  But there is no talk about that at all because that is something that cannot be measured. The money to furnish that subsidy never comes into the Exchequer and never has to issue out from the Exchequer; it does have to issue out, however, from the pocket of the farmer who has to pay it.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the entire marketing problem will be resolved and, God knows, I lived long enough with it when I was myself Minister for Agriculture.  I look back with satisfaction on the fact that I believe I did solve it in respect of bacon and did provide the machinery whereunder we have been able to expand our exports of bacon far beyond that which anyone anticipated was possible a very few years ago.  But further activity requires to be undertaken now in that sphere, and in many other spheres, and it is essential that, if new departures in horticultural development, or other branches of agriculture, are to be inaugurated, they should be preceded by effective work to ensure that, if and when they reach the stage of production, their output will be saleable at prices which will provide those who produce the output with a reasonable, albeit modest, standard of living.</P>
    <P>I venture to say&mdash;I do not think it is any serious over-simplification of the <Col N="507" /> problem&mdash;that if markets are provided our people will produce.  I recall with pride to the House the fact that they demonstrated both their capacity and their ability to do that in regard to eggs.  I admit freely that developments in Great Britain resulted in the gravest possible disappointment to our people because the British subsidy policy created a surplus of eggs in Great Britain and that surplus destroyed our market there.  But the moment the market was provided the extent to which our people were prepared to improve stocks and increase egg production in order to avail of the market to the very limit of its capacity to absorb eggs was even more than dramatic.</P>
    <P>I believe our people are prepared to respond in the same way in every other branch of agriculture where a reasonably secure market is provided for them.  I am bound to say, however, that if our people are to be facilitated in doing all that they can do, the advisory services at present available must be extensively developed and improved.  But the essential thing is to secure markets where the produce can be satisfactorily disposed of and, if that involves a national marketing organisation, I would not hesitate to embark upon it.</P>
    <P>I confess freely that I may have made a mistake when I was Minister for Agriculture in depending too long and too heavily on the hope that the marketing of agricultural produce would be undertaken effectively by the co-operative organisation.  I am sorry to say it was not.  I urged the co-operative organisation to undertake the marketing of grain.  I urged them to undertake the marketing of a variety of other products but, with the exception of apples, I could never get them to make any vigorous endeavour, and it was only under very great pressure in the case of apples that I persuaded them to function.  If co-operative marketing, therefore, does not do the job I think we ought to face the fact that there is a lesson for us to be learned from Denmark. There, I understand, the position is that if the farmers are prepared to <Col N="508" /> market their produce co-operatively, every facility and help is given to them, but there is no monopoly.  If some private <i>entrepreneur</i> comes along and says he is prepared to do it better and more efficiently and give the producer a better return, he is allowed to compete.  I think the time has come when we should face the possibility of that here.</P>
    <P>I would add a third point.  If neither private enterprise nor a co-operative society finds itself able to undertake the marketing of our produce, I would not hesitate to establish a national marketing organisation, but I am bound to say that I have no reason whatever to believe that in the majority of cases, such a national organisation would equal in efficiency the enterprise of private enterprise or of a well-run co-operative effort.  But I do not doubt&mdash;and experience has taught me this&mdash;that whether there be co-operation or private enterprise, the one requires the spur of competition from the other.</P>
    <P>Probably the best system would be one in which co-operative and private enterprise would act as a spur upon each other in that field, having in reserve the firm resolve that if neither were prepared to provide the marketing facilities requisite for stability and security of the market for our producers, the Government itself would enter the field and, <i>ad interim</i>, I think the Government again might learn a lesson from Denmark which in the presence of co-operative and private enterprise marketing methods in the British market provide a certain degree of Government assistance by the maintenance of a sales promotion organisation which, though it does not do the marketing itself, takes steps to encourage dealers in Britain to handle the bigger facilities and the marketing organisation to give special terms to merchants who will take 90 per cent. of their total requirements in the form of Danish bacon.  They maintain in England a staff on which merchants with any complaint or inquiry can call with the certainty of getting immediate attention.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, I believe we require increased industrial production. <Col N="509" /> That seems a simple platitudinous sort of thing to say but industrial employment&mdash;that is what matters most&mdash;is going down.  That is the figure that matters, the number of people working in industry, and it is going down steadily.</P>

      <P>I hear the Minister for External Affairs saying it has gone up. I cannot set my information up against the economic statistics issued prior to the Budget, 1959, and compiled by the Central Statistics Office. Table XII gives the estimated total labour force and the number of persons at work in the main branches of economic activities from 1951 to 1958.  I am taking, not the total labour force, but the figure for the number of persons at work beginning in 1951 and the record for each subsequent year.  The figures are 1,219,000, 1,200,000, 1,182,000 &mdash; in 1954, it went up by 3,000 to 1,185,000 &mdash;1,181,000, 1,163,000, 1,141,000, 1,131,000.  Are those figures correct? I assume them to be so.  If they are, I say they are the vital index and if the Minister for External Affairs has not awakened to that fact yet, it is time he did.  I assume he had these figures put before him as they were put before me unless he is living in the happy land of illusion which his interjection that this number had gone up would suggest when in fact it declined by 50,000 in the past four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are figures for the total number of people at work. All I want to say is this: the decline in the number of persons employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing between 1957 and 1958 is from 433,000 to 429,000.  That is 4,000.  The number of persons employed in mining, <Col N="510" /> quarrying, turf, manufacture, construction, electricity, gas and water, commerce, insurance, or finance, transport and communications, defence and other economic activities has declined &mdash;and in agriculture, forestry and fishing&mdash;by 10,000.  Subtract four from ten and you get six.  That would suggest there was a decline of 6,000 in the categories I have read out, other than agriculture, forestry and fishing.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Brennan that if he is in any doubt about this, the economic statistics issued prior to the Budget of 1959 are available to him free and he can study them at his leisure.  I do not think he will disagree that in manufacture, construction, electricity, gas and water, commerce, transport and communications, public administration&mdash;down to that&mdash;there is a steady decline.  I think we are all agreed that it is very necessary that there should be an expansion and an increase in these numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make a suggestion to remedy the present situation. We want to increase industrial employment. I ask the House to pause and ask themselves this question: if after 27 years of high protection, and the Control of Manufactures Act, we are now in the position that employment is declining instead of rising, is it not time that we should ask ourselves what ought we to do about it?  I suggest that one of the reasons for that decline has been the Control of Manufactures Act and the prevention of effective investment of capital in this country, by people who were prepared to give good employment in industries that would supply our people with goods of competitive quality, at competitive prices, on such a scale that they would be in a position to export their surplus output on the markets of the world.</P>
      <P>There is ample evidence of that in the recent developments at Bowaters Irish subsidiary in Athy, the report of which was published this morning, and in the fact that the gypsum industry in Cavan has now established contact with a British firm which is collaborating with it to secure marketing facilities for its output.</P>

The Deputy belongs to a great monolith of a Party, many of whom believe the same thing. In any event, I am concerned with increased industrial production.  It is no use to say to the Minister for Finance in the course of a Budget debate, that we want increased industrial production and leave it at that.  One is bound to say how one believes it might be brought about.  If one wants it, there is no use in saying: &ldquo;Something will have to be done.&rdquo; Suggestions should be made as to how it might be done if it requires to be done.  In this country, we lack two things mainly.  We lack technical know-how and marketing contacts, and we should gladly, freely and liberally import both those things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, I am most anxious to carry conviction to Deputy Brennan.  He is chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party and a most influential man, but I shall not elaborate on that.  What I want to ensure is that the Minister will be informed of what I believe is necessary.  He may not <Col N="513" /> agree with it but at least he will not have it to say that I only said: &ldquo;Something will have to be done.&rdquo;  We lack technical know-how.  If a private person is prepared to pay a reasonable standard of wages, to give good employment and to meet any competition which may arise, he is not asking for protection in order to enable him to take his profit out of the hides of our people.  He ought to be told: &ldquo;The more profit you make, the better the citizen you are.  If you engage in free enterprise in Ireland, we are anxious to see you thrive and prosper, and the more prosperous you become, the more respect we will have for you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A general impression is being spread about that making a profit in Ireland is a disreputable occupation.  We must dissipate that view.  I think that view is born of the atmosphere created by high tariffs and quotas.  It is perfectly true that many people feel that where a manufacturer is protected by high tariffs and quotas, he should not be allowed to take huge profits out of the hides of our people under that protection. It is an entirely different situation when a man says he does not want these tariffs and quotas, that all he wants is freedom to operate his industry and to make what profits he can. We should make it crystal clear to such a man that he is as welcome as the flowers in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I believe such people bring us something that is not otherwise in our power to acquire, that is, access to a marketing organisation which would immensely simplify the problem of expanding industry in this country, because heretofore our great dilemma has been that if we had the goods we had not the marketing organisation to sell them.  If you went out to get a marketing organisation preparatory to providing the goods you sometimes did yourself the supreme injury of undertaking to deliver merchandise to new customers and then finding your industrial capacity not able to meet the demand.  You failed to meet your first delivery, with the consequential disastrous experience that when you were prepared to meet that demand in the future, you discovered <Col N="514" /> that customers once disappointed, were not likely to return for more.</P>
    <P>I know of no way in which that vicious circle can be broken than the way that has been operated, I am glad to say, since the Control of Manufactures Act has been substantially abandoned and replaced by the External Investment Act passed recently by getting people who are prepared to set up subsidiary factories in this country and making available to them marketing organisations which they have built over the years with their larger factories situated elsewhere.  I have told the House before, and I tell it again, of the experience which I had with powdered milk.  We had the capacity for producing powdered milk and I am satisfied that we were in a position to make a product as good as anyone else, but when we made it, we could not sell it though I know now, as I knew then, that at that time, there was available in the tropics and in the Far East an almost unlimited market for that product but we had not the marketing organisation to get in.  We could not get in and we never did get in there.</P>
    <P>If to-morrow we could make contact with some of the big firms who have been in this business for generations&mdash;many of them of course are Dutch; there are some British firms but the Dutch had an immense organisation in the East Indies because they were Dutch colonies and the British had the marketing organisation in Africa and the tropics&mdash;if we could once contact them and pour into that marketing organisation, it would consume a large part of the surplus milk, over and above that required for butter.  These are the really urgent needs of our economy at the present time.  I cannot see that the Government are doing very much, especially with reference to marketing facilities for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The third thing we need is a balanced Budget and by a balanced Budget I mean a capital Budget consisting of expenditure on projects which are calculated ultimately to produce returns either directly or indirectly, <Col N="515" /> sufficient to finance the capital outlay involved in them.  I would have no reluctance in carrying out a bold and forward-looking capital programme, provided that criterion was strictly applied.</P>
    <P>I can see no evidence of such foresight in a capital programme which includes a project for the purchase of jet aeroplanes, a £9,000,000 nitrogen factory which will not produce what the country requires and the building or power stations when our capacity for generating power is already far in excess of our capacity to consume it, &mdash;of having determined the volume of our proper capital expenditure for which we may legitimately borrow, then determining for our Supply Services that we shall spend each year what we are able to provide and imposing on those two spheres of expenditure the overall ceiling that in no year will they be allowed to exceed the sum of our revenue, tax and non-tax, plus the yield of our own people's capacity to save.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, because I believe the savings of our people constitute an essential feature of the ceiling we must set for our total expenditure in any year, that I view the decline in our people's savings in the past year with consternation and alarm.  Budgets should have regard to to-morrow as well as to to-day.  I hope next March the effort described to-day as a balanced Budget will look as alluring as it does to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not deny, and no rational person will, that everybody who pays income tax will be glad to pay less, that everybody who pays super tax will be glad to pay less, that every old age pensioner who gets another half-crown will be glad to get it, and as far as I am concerned, they are very welcome to it.  I am prepared to say I believe the Minister was obliged to take some risk in order to meet the income tax situation and that it was a good thing in our circumstances to reduce income tax not only on account of the British counterpart situation, but because I believe it provides a necessary stimulus to profit earners by <Col N="516" /> giving them the feeling that if they work hard, they will be allowed to obtain the benefits they worked to secure.  But it is not at all as reassuring as if that benefit were provided out of a true surplus and not out of the very doubtful surplus the Minister claims in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I am a confirmed optimist.  I always believe it is possible by hard work to pull this country round, but Deputies ought to read and re-read the paragraph I have read out which calls in question the very viability of our economy.  It would be a ghastly situation if, by improvident financial administration, we created a situation in which Ireland was no longer viable in independence.  I do not believe that day will dawn.  There is the terrible responsibility on us, the members of this Parliament, the electors of this Government and the legislators of this land, to ensure that nothing will be done, for any cheap or unworthy motive, which would put the whole foundation of our economy in serious jeopardy.</P>
    <P>So long as our population is declining, so long as the people at work are becoming fewer, so long as doors are being closed in the west of Ireland and homes abandoned, we have no reason for complacency in the House.  I feel the cause of much of that is the burdens we have been placing on our people, and now, when some of us are rejoicing that we have less to pay in income tax and less to pay in supertax, and that we can go to boxing matches free of duty, I would ask this House to remember the farmers on the small holdings all over Ireland who are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet and in many cases giving up the struggle.  We should ask ourselves are we satisfied to let them go on indefinitely until these people vanish, as the language vanished from a large part of the west of Ireland.  If they go, they will never come back and we shall have lost something infinitely precious in our society.</P>

      <P>One of the most remarkable things about this Budget is that it is the first Budget in my memory <Col N="517" /> that was physically applauded by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party. What significance there is in that I should not like to say, but I would describe this Budget as a politically skilful one.  It certainly has the mark of the politician on it and it is not the type of Budget that was introduced by former Ministers for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not like a Deputy MacEntee Budget; neither is it like any of the Budgets introduced by the Minister for External Affairs, or, as I have said, like a Budget of any of the Ministers for Finance of a Fianna Fáil Government.  Therefore, to a very large extent it is a suspect Budget.</P>
      <P>It would be fair criticism to say this is a Budget designed mainly to gather support for the Fianna Fáil nominee for the Presidential election and to gather support to ensure that the referendum will be carried in favour of the straight vote.  The people assumed in the weeks before Budget day that there would be reliefs, not having regard to the state of the economy but to the fact that there was to be a Presidential election and a referendum.  As a politician, the Minister for Finance has, for the Fianna Fáil Party and their nominee, done a reasonably good job.  The only pity is that we do not have similar elections every year because the people generally might look forward to many reliefs granted in this Budget or granted in Budgets for the past 15, 20 and 25 years.</P>
      <P>This Budget, contrary to what the newspapers have said, was not framed in the last few weeks or in the last month or two.  It is my opinion that this Budget has been in course of being framed for the past two years with an eye on the Referendum and an eye on the Presidential election.</P>

    <P>Fianna Fáil, with the huge majority they now command, introduced the drastic Budget of 1957 and inflicted untold hardship on many sections of the community, particularly on the poorer sections, the small salaried people and those in receipt of small wages.  The 1958 Budget was an &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; Budget.  The plan was carried on which was designed to ensure <Col N="518" /> that reliefs, to some extent, would be given in 1959.  Fianna Fáil assumed that if they blistered people and inflicted hardship on them in 1957 and 1958, then, when they would give some reliefs in 1959, the people would forget about the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the imposition of the various other taxes imposed in the Budget of 1957.  It may be short-term policy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party but I venture to remark that the people do not forget the hardships imposed two years ago and will not be compensated now to the full extent for the hardships then imposed.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Vote on Account, the Minister for Finance admitted that he did not attempt to make an economic survey.  He made little or no reference to the Government's five year plan.  Nor did he comment to any great degree on what is now described as the &ldquo;Whitaker Report.&rdquo;  When concluding, he said that comment on these two things would be better left over until the Budget.  Anybody who listened to the Minister or who read the speech circulated must immediately agree that in his Budget speech he did not attempt to make any sort of a survey of the economic position of the country but rather, with indecent haste, scrambled as fast as he could into the announcement of the welcome reliefs.</P>
    <P>Deputies from every Party talk about the cancers of unemployment and emigration.  The Minister made scant reference to unemployment and I do not think he mentioned the word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; once in his speech.  The reliefs are welcome but they do nothing to relieve unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been described as our most important industry, as the industry in which we are most likely to expand, and, in consequence of that, the industry most likely to expand the national income and the general economy of the country.  What reference did the Minister make to the agricultural industry?  If I paraphrase him correctly, he merely said that agricultural production fell in 1958.  Then he said, in effect, that agricultural <Col N="519" /> production fell in 1958 because we had a bad year.  His third sentence was to the effect that, this year, agriculture will rise if we have a good season.  That is the only reference the Minister for Finance, on behalf of an Irish Government, made to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>It seems to be somewhat of an insult to those who prepared the Government Five Year Plan and to the Whitaker Report, which devoted so many chapters and paragraphs to agriculture, that our Minister for Finance had no comment to make on agriculture except that 1958 was a bad year and that we hope 1959 will be a better year.  By such omission, the Minister has done a disservice to the country and to the agricultural industry on which we depend so much, and on which the Government say we depend so much, for an expansion in production.</P>
    <P>Many months ago we were given the Government's Five Year Plan but the Minister made little if any reference to the proposals contained in that plan. As I said at the outset, I cannot see what immediate effect, if any, this Budget will have on the unemployment situation.  The Minister said that employment in industry rose in 1958 by 2,000.  That is correct according to the figures that were given.  If the Minister meant that as a boast&mdash;that we had 2,000 more in industry in 1958 than we had in 1957&mdash;he forgot to mention, as Deputy Dillion said, that there were 4,000 fewer in agriculture and 6,000 fewer in employment on works of construction.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted to be honest, then, whilst giving the figure of 2,000 more in industrial employment, he should also have given figures with regard to a decrease in employment in agriculture and on works of construction. But, having said there were 2,000 more in industrial employment, he proceeded to say the usual thing that the Minister for Finance says, namely, that the aim of the Government is to do this and that with a view to increasing employment.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, we heard no practical <Col N="520" /> suggestions as to how employment can be stepped up.</P>
    <P>I have heard Government Deputies talk about the unemployment problem which we had in 1955 and 1956.  If anybody mentions a figure of 70,000, 72,000 or 73,000 unemployed then somebody from the present Government benches points out that we had up to 95,000 unemployed in January, 1956.  The figures included in the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> are very significant and show that 1955 and 1956 were better years as far as employment was concerned than 1957 and 1958.</P>
    <P>Table 15 in the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> shows that in April, 1956, 8.1 per cent. of insurable workers were unemployed&mdash;but in April, 1958, that percentage had risen to 9.6.  Therefore, whilst we had nothing to boast about in 1956 so far as employment and unemployment are concerned, the present Government have far less to boast about so far as 1958 is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the same booklet there are very revealing figures on employment and unemployment.  In Table 12 of that booklet we find that in 1951 the total labour force in the country amounted to 1,272,000.  In 1952, it was 1,264,000; in 1953 it had dropped to 1,252,000; in 1954 it was 1,243,000; in 1955, it was 1,235,000; in 1956 it dropped to 1,216,000; in 1957, it dropped to 1,206,000 and in 1958 it dropped again to 1,191,000.  That is not a record of which the Government can be proud or of which any one of us in the House can be proud.  It means that, from 1951 to 1958, 81,000 able-bodied people were lost to the labour force.</P>
    <P>We have lost 81,000 workers over a short period of seven years.  That is not something in which we can feel pride and, certainly, it does not show the prosperous state described by the Taoiseach in his St. Patrick's Day message.  Despite the picture that has been painted by the Minister for Finance it means that from 1957 to 1958 we lost 15,000 workers.  These are workers who, in all probability, have emigrated, in the majority of <Col N="521" /> cases to Great Britain.  It would not be unreasonable to suggest that that figure should be multiplied by three or four in order to get the extent of emigration in that year.</P>
    <P>I was interested and concerned at the statement of the Minister for Finance to the effect that capital to the tune of £4 million earmarked for local authorities was not taken up.  I listened to the Minister and read his speech afterwards.  I do not think he described the heads under which that money was available or the heads under which it was not availed of by local authorities.  I do not think I would be prepared, as the Minister has been, by inference, to put the blame on the local authorities.  It is a peculiar thing to say that the Minister for Finance had £4,000,000 and the local authorities would not take it.</P>

      <P>That £4,000,000 could have provided a great deal of employment. Over the last few years, and especially in the last two years, local authority work has been described as unproductive but it is work that would give employment which would make the lives of many people happier.  I suggest that the blame is not on the local authorities but may be to some extent on the Minister for Finance in collusion with the Minister for Local Government.  Members of local authorities know very well the devices that have been used and that can be used by the Department of Local Government to stop works or to delay them to the extent that they will not be commenced in the current financial year but will be deferred to the next. That is done for a purpose.  It is done, I suggest, by direction, not of the Department of Finance but of the Minister for Finance.  That £4,000,000 could have put many thousands to work and, for that reason, whether the work was productive or otherwise, it would have been well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was that £4,000,000 intended for housing, sanitary services, roads, hospitals, or for what purpose was it provided originally?  That money could have been well spent on the repair and <Col N="522" /> reconstruction of roads.  Many people are under the impression that too much money has been pumped into the roads but in recent years there has been a tendency on the part of local authorities to ignore their responsibilities in this matter in order to keep rates down, forgetting that in three or even ten years' time, there must be a burst up and they will be forced to face up to their responsibilities and repair the damage caused by their neglect over the last few years.</P>
    <P>I suggest, also, that part of this £4,000,000 was saved, if you like, by reason of a device employed by the Department of Local Government, namely, the withholding of grants for the repair, reconstruction and building of houses.  That is a favourite trick of the Department of Local Government on the direction of the Department of Finance.  The Minister said something to the effect that small dwelling loans had fallen in rural areas.  It may be of general application but it is a criticism that would be more appropriate to the Department of Local Government that there are hundreds of applicants for reconstruction and building grants awaiting payment at present, payment which was sought in February and March, before the commencement of this financial year. It is true that the houses had not been inspected but why had they not been inspected?  I suggest that in some cases they were not inspected because, if they had been, people would be demanding and expecting the money, would be asking their local and public representatives to approach the Department in the matter, and it is always a good excuse to say that the house has not been inspected.  Perhaps a small part of the £4,000,000 could be explained away by that fact.</P>
    <P>It has been said in recent times that the housing demand in many areas has been filled.  That may be so.  Great strides have been made since 1947-48 in the provision of houses but there are still many houses to be provided, as the Taoiseach recognised when he spoke here shortly after his election by the House as Taoiseach.  He depended, as I have said before in this House, on the Minister for Local <Col N="523" /> Government, to use his own words, to revise house building and generally to provide work.  The Taoiseach may have believed in 1957 that his Minister for Local Government could revive house building and provide work but he has not done that.  Does it mean that the Taoiseach subsequently discovered that there were not as many houses to be built or does it mean that his Minister for Local Government has failed in the task given to him by the Taoiseach?  The fact is that there are many more people unemployed in the building industry and fewer houses being built at present, but the Taoiseach believed in 1957 that much work could be provided if the building industry could be revived.</P>
    <P>No reference was made by the Minister to the fact that there was underspending in the Forestry Branch, under sub-heads C, D, F (3) and F (4), to the amount of £80,000.  That may be a small amount but the expenditure of that money would have made many rural workers happy.  It is extraordinary that it was not spent having regard to the fact that the Minister for Lands is romping around the country exhorting people to plant trees and telling them of the enormous potentiality there is in that enterprise. Here we have a situation where the Minister, who I am sure has been trying to assure his colleagues that he has not enough money, ends the financial year 1959 by not spending all the money provided for him by the Minister for Finance.  As I say, these are small sums of money but they would have done good work and they would have provided employment which was badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht underspent, under sub-head F (1), a sum of £12,000.  It was a small amount but it was money which could have been usefully spent I am sure and which could have given useful employment. The Department of Industry and Commerce was underspent to the tune of £117,000.  Industry and Commerce is such a vast Department&mdash;one, in my opinion, that should be subdivided into Ministries&mdash;that it would be difficult, <Col N="524" /> I suppose, to regulate its expenditure and finances generally without some underspending or overspending in the region of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  The Minister, in any case, according to his figures, found himself this year with a small surplus and, taking into consideration overestimation, he had a surplus of something like £1¼ millions&mdash;£1,369,000 in his own words&mdash;and of that he has decided to give a sum of £883,000 for the relief of old age pensioners, those in receipt of unemployment assistance and those in receipt of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>May we say immediately that we welcome any relief given to that very deserving section of the community? I do not want to grudge the Minister anything he has done in this Budget, especially in regard to pensioners, but I am afraid there would have been a great outcry if some relief had not been given there.  All sections of the public should get as much credit as the Minister, or the Government, for that relief because over the past two years, since old age pensioners got the last increase, there has been a spontaneous outcry from all sections of the community for relief for the old age pensioners.  It has come from the trade union movement; it has come from the employers and from the professional class, and it would have been a scandal, to say the least of it, if the old age pensioners had not received some relief in this Budget.</P>
    <P>There may be sardonic smiles from the opposite side of the House when I say that it is not enough.  I know what it means to provide 2/6d. a week for old age pensioners.  We have the figure off by heart&mdash;£1,000,000.  I know it is not easy to get a million pounds but as one speaker said yesterday&mdash;I think it was Deputy Norton &mdash;there has been no real improvement in the allowance paid to the old age pensioners since old age pensions were first introduced in 1909.  The 5/- given at that period, 50 years ago, is now, according to the Taoiseach who replied to a Parliamentary Question on the matter yesterday, worth 24/7d. It means, therefore, that the 25/- <Col N="525" /> which the old age pensioner now has is still the same in real money values as the amount given to him 50 years ago, but it must be agreed that the standard of living of those old age pensioners cannot have improved much in those 50 years.</P>
    <P>The standard of living of workers has improved, as everybody knows, in the 50 years.  The standard of living of employers, no matter what type of work is concerned, has also improved. The standard of living of professional people has also improved.  I think it correct to say that, as far as practically all sections of the community are concerned, the standard of living has improved vastly in those 50 years. We cannot, however, say the same about the old age pensioner.  The unfortunate thing is that the old age pensioner is played off between the Government and the local authorities. I do not know whether a Government has any statutory obligation to provide any definite amount for old age pensioners but there is a statutory obligation on local authorities to look after those people who cannot provide for themselves.  That statutory obligation is imposed in the Public Assistance Act of 1939.  Apart from there being a statutory obligation on these local authorities and, should I say, the community, to provide for these people, either destitute or near destitute, there is a moral obligation on local authorities and on the Government to provide even the bare minimum on which these people may exist.</P>
    <P>The attitude of various Ministers for Social Welfare in this House over the years has been: &ldquo;Well, we give them certain allowances, but the local authorities can, or may, or should come to their assistance.&rdquo;  But the local authorities' attitude is: &ldquo;We have no responsibility for them.  The Old Age Pensions Act is the responsibility of the Government and therefore the old age pensioners are the responsibility of the Government.&rdquo;  I think there should be a more generous attitude adopted by local authorities, especially towards the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans in receipt of non-contributory pensions. <Col N="526" /> As an aside I drew to the Minister's notice, acting for the Minister for Health, the fact that in my constituency some old age pensioners are not given medical cards.  The Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning it purely as an aside and I merely meant to demonstrate the lack of responsibility which local authorities felt they had for old age pensioners.  I do not intend to pursue the subject.  While welcoming any relief for old age pensioners, I think it right to repeat what Deputy Norton said yesterday and what was said during the discussion on the Vote on Account, that the cost of living index figure may be said to have increased by so many points, or such and such a percentage, but so far as old age pensioners and widows and orphans are concerned, and as far as those in receipt of unemployment assistance are concerned, the main item in that index which concerns them is that in respect of food.  Food prices have gone up by over 17 points since February, 1957.  That means that from February, 1957, up to November, 1958, food prices have increased by 17 per cent. and mind you, old age pensioners in this Budget have not been compensated to the extent of anything like 17 per cent.</P>
      <P>I think it wrong that in every concession given to old age pensioners they should be allowed to lag behind when one has regard to the cost of living index figure, or the cost of food index figure, because if my calculations are correct, I repeat that since 1957 the price of food has increased by 17 per cent.  Food is important to these people because other items contained in the cost of living index figures are items with which they are not really concerned.  They do not buy furniture or household goods because they just could not afford them and very seldom would they be concerned with the purchase of any type of expensive clothing except the essentials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £58,000 has been given by the Minister for an increase in <Col N="527" /> certain pensions to ex-State servants, to the Army, the Garda and, I think, to the three different branches of the teaching profession.  I think it desirable that this should be given but I was sorry to see that one of the things that has concerned the teachers in recent years has not been rectified in this Budget.  I had hoped, with the pleas not alone from this side of the House but from the Government side of the House, that the Minister would have made provision for those teachers who resigned prior to 1950.  I am not fully conversant with the circumstances of the dispute between these teachers and the Minister for Finance but it seems to me that they were given an understanding or a promise that a balance that was left over would be given to them in 2, 3, 4 or 5 years.  I know that this has been rejected by various Ministers for Education but I had hoped that, with the unanimity which seemed to be in this House on the Vote on Account, the Minister might have relieved that particular section of the community. Of course, this £58,000 does give them something.  It does give them some relief in the pensions they receive at the present time.  The sum of £23,000 is for military service pensions.  On that I have no comment to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to make a tax concession to the cinema industry to the tune of £150,000.  The Minister truthfully enough said that this tax concession would not find its way down to the cinema-goer.  I think it is a good thing he cleared up that immediately because, in the case of a tax concession like this, the public are inclined to take it for granted that any concession to an industry such as the cinema industry goes automatically down to the patrons of the cinema.  This is something which may not be the concern of the Minister but it is something to which he referred last year.  The cinema industry asked for some tax concession. I think the basis of their argument is that television and other forms of amusement have been responsible for falling attendances.  I do not think it correct to say that television in this <Col N="528" /> country is a strong competitor of the cinemas.  I have the utmost sympathy with the cinema industry inasmuch as it employs so many thousand people but I do say that the reason that there are falling attendances in the cinemas in this country&mdash;I do not pretend to speak for Britain&mdash;is the fact that the films are bad.  The films are of poor quality.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's action in granting this concession of £150,000. He puts no bones on it.  It is to keep people in employment in a big industry.  That in itself is commendable. The cinema owners in this country cannot be held responsible for the type of films we get.  There is no point in talking about television or giving any other excuse for falling attendances at cinemas.  In my opinion and in the opinion of many cinema-goers the reason for the falling attendances at cinemas is the fact that the films are of no use whatsoever. They have deteriorated greatly in the past four or five years, mainly I believe because many of the prominent actors in the cinema business today want to produce, direct and act in their own films and they made a bad job of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said all I wanted to say about films.  The Minister has also given a concession to &mdash;how should one describe it?&mdash;the dancing profession or industry.  In any case, the fact is that he has made some concession to those people who go to dances or rather to those people who promote dances because there is no doubt that any concession the Minister might give, so far as the dances are concerned, will not find its way down to the ordinary person who dances.  The tax on dances has changed so much since 1952 that if you ask, not alone the ordinary citizen but the dance-goer, whether or not he was paying tax he would not be able to tell you.  It is a fact that he would get his tax ticket but he does not know whether or not it is a ticket on which there is a stamp.  This concession, <Col N="529" /> as the Minister says, will go to those who promote dances.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is a good thing. The position, as it was, was all right. It was a source of revenue to the Minister.  I think it is a source of revenue he should not have easily given up, but this is a political Budget. The largesse must be distributed as widely as possible no matter how big or small the largesse is.</P>
      <P>In addition, I do not think it was wise to take off the tax on professional boxing and greyhound racing. I know that the tax on professional boxing was practically non-existent. Whether or not this will induce promoters from London or elsewhere to have professional boxing matches here I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from leaving the tax on these things, I would not be averse to having a tax on horse racing.  I do not think there is anything wrong with it. There are things taxed that the ordinary person uses from day to day.  I know horse racing may be an industry as well but essentially it is an amusement for the Irish people and for most people.  It can easily bear a tax.  People who go to horse races and who pay 10/-, 15/-, a guinea or whatever they pay, are people who attend horse races not to see horses running, not to admire the colours worn by the jockeys, not to applaud or go into hysterics about the movement of a horse but to back horses.  The man who attends the various race meetings in this country regards the 10/- or 15/- which he pays as an entrance fee as mere chicken feed.  He goes in to back in the knowledge that he is going to lose £5, £10 or £20 or get £5, £10, £15, £20 or £100.  Any tax that would be imposed, whether 1/- or 2/6, would not concern him in the least.  Also&mdash;I would not say this is general&mdash;but it is pretty general: they are prepared to lose £5, £10 and up to £50 and whether they win, lose or draw they are prepared to have a fair good night after the race meeting.  The 1/-, 2/- or 2/6 they might contribute to the Exchequer, through the Minister for Finance, for the relief of other people such as old age pensioners, widows and orphans and those on the dole and sick would <Col N="530" /> not be missed in the day's sport which they enjoy.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is a welcome, by those who pay income tax, for the announcement by the Minister that it is to be reduced from 7/6 to 7/- and, in the other category, from 3/- to 2/9.  I suppose it means an amount of money for certain people, as we see from the excellent table this morning in, I think, the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Whether or not that stimulates employment I do not know.  The Minister seems to think it will.  I do not believe that a reduction of 6d. in income tax, the reduction in another way in sur-tax, and the concessions which are given to industry in respect of income tax, are going to stimulate employment.  I do not think these incentives will stimulate employment to any great degree.  The only thing I did notice was that, for instance, the single man who has £1,000 a year, under this Budget, according to the table we see this morning, gets approximately £18 per year as relief in his income tax.  That ought to be measured against the £6 10s. which is to be given to the old age pensioner from the first of August next.  It means that for the year 1959-60 the single man in receipt of £1,000 a year gets approximately £18 from this Budget, and the old age pensioner for approximately half of the year gets a sum of £6 10s.</P>
    <P>This Budget seems to me to be the work of a politician.  It is a politically skilful Budget and is designed for the purpose which I mentioned in the beginning of my speech.  It is unfortunate to some extent that there has been such a build-up in preparation for the Presidential election and for the referendum.  The propaganda was touched off by the Taoiseach's St. Patrick's Day message.  Anybody reading that message by the Taoiseach and listening to the Minister for Finance yesterday, would imagine that most of the difficulties in this country had been solved and solved presto, in a very short time.  The fact is that we still have many of our problems. We still have our unemployment problem, which was worse in 1958 than in 1957.  What the prospects are for 1959 I do not know, but <Col N="531" /> it would be fair comment to say that there will not be any improvement in 1959.  The incentives which have been given, both to agriculture and to industry, whilst they may be well-intentioned on the part of the Minister for Finance and designed to create more employment, will not have the results he may visualise they will have.</P>
    <P>I advocate, and I repeat it here, the intervention to some extent by the Government in the creation of employment by the establishment of factories.  Governments over the last 25 years have been successful in the establishment of industries and factories now called semi-State companies. No one would disagree with a policy whereby the Government would use their initiative in the establishment of these factories and industries to provide employment.  It does not seem to me that, with all the incentive that the agricultural industry gets and has got over the last 30 or 35 years, that industry is better to any substantial degree.  The real sign of an expanding economy in this country would be evidence that there were more people wanting to go back on the land, more people from year to year going into the agricultural industry, but the fact is that, despite all these incentives, agriculture is becoming more and more dependent on the State and on Governments.</P>
    <P>I have heard critics of social welfare legislation say that we are now approaching the Welfare State.  We approach the Welfare State when a Government decides to introduce legislation to assist people who are unemployed, people who are sick, and to come to the assistance of the aged people and widows.  They never talk about it being a Welfare State when money is injected into a particular industry.  Since we have not to any great extent a tradition for the establishment of industry, I do not think the incentives which various Governments, including this Government, have given to industry will have any substantial effect.  Therefore, I think the Government must take the initiative and, as far as I am concerned, <Col N="532" /> they will have my full support. They have been successful in Bord na Móna, in the E.S.B. and in the establishment of the different sugar factories.  The last Government was successful in its initiation of the Whitegate project.  The Minister for Finance through the Industrial Credit Company&mdash;I suppose with the assistance of the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;seems to be successful in the initiation which took place in the establishment of the Dundalk Engineering Works.</P>
    <P>Someone may tell me that the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company are different in that these projects were so big that they had to be initiated by the Government.  However, we have other examples where the Government took the initiative. No one can tell me that any group thought up the idea of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  It was done by the Government because it was a serious matter and the Government had to face up to the unemployment, which would be concentrated in one town.  I honestly believe that, if the Government take the initiative in establishing other factories throughout the country, in a very short time we will not be complaining here about 40,000 people emigrating each year and about an unemployment figure which ranges from 40,000 up to 95,000.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish remarked that the Budget was received with acclamation from the Fianna Fáil benches.  I think it is right that it should be so received by them and indeed by the country as a whole.  The Minister is to be congratulated that, in his third Budget, he has cleared up the second financial mess left by Coalitions.  Not only has he done that but, as his figures show, during the course of his administration of the Department of Finance he has set the country again on the road to steady progress and prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before 1948 we had reached an annual increase of about three per cent. per annum in our national output, our national income, and we have again got back to that three per cent. <Col N="533" /> It would have been more but for the fact that the disastrous weather, to which Deputy Dillon alluded, last year caused agricultural output to go down by about £9,000,000.  As against that disastrous outcome for the farmers, agriculture has built up its capital in the land.  It has been improved by lime and fertilisers and, in January of this year, there were 83,000 more cattle than in 1958.  Significantly, 32,000 of those 83,000 were accounted for by 32,000 more heifers in-calf.  The number of sheep also went up between 1958 and January, 1959 by 233,300, that is about eight per cent.  For cattle, the percentage increase represented by the figure of 83,100 was 2.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Not only has the agricultural capital increased the ability of the farmers&mdash; with the help of God&mdash;to produce more of the things we want for home consumption and for export next year, but industrial output has gone up.  Industrial output has increased and last year there was the very welcome increase of 2,000 in the number employed in industry.  It is true, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, that that 2,000 increase in industrial employment was accompanied by a fall in agricultural employment.  That is a trend that has been evident here over the last number of years, just as it has appeared in other countries.</P>
    <P>In the United States, between 1947 and 1957, there was a decrease of 7,000,000 people on the land.  About a quarter of the people who had been on the land in 1947 had disappeared by 1957 but in the United States, up to recently, the people who left the land could get employment in the towns. Our difficulty here will be to keep pace with the numbers of people who are not required to work on the land in order to give the output that we can sell at home and abroad.  Along with doing all that we can to increase agricultural output and, if possible, to increase agricultural employment, we must not neglect to do everything possible to increase industrial production.</P>
    <P>During the last three years a great deal has been done to develop education, industrial education and agricultural education, industrial research and <Col N="534" /> agricultural research and a great deal has been done to give incentives&mdash;to give all sorts of assistance&mdash;for the increase of agricultural and industrial output.  We cannot take this Budget alone and find in it all the evidence of Government activity in these fields. We have also to cast our minds back to the Estimates which the Minister introduced on the Vote on Account, and we must throw our eyes over something to which he called attention in his speech&mdash;the things that were being done for increased education, increased research and increased production.</P>
    <P>Grants for agricultural fertilisers were very big in relation to our circumstances. About £1,600,000 odd was given as a subsidy for phosphatic fertilisers and over £450,000 for lime.  If the farmers take advantage of these grants and subsidies, and put the lime and fertilisers on their soil, they will undoubtedly help greatly to increase agricultural production next year.  We can look forward at the same time to having stock to use the increased output of grass and crops that will be the result of the increased use of lime and fertilisers.  Apart from lime and fertilisers, subsides are also given for other agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon deplored the fact that a number of small farmers were leaving the land, but, as I pointed out, a great number of small farmers left the land in the United States of America between 1947 and 1957 because they could not get on the land the standard of living available to people in the cities.  I am afraid that a number of our people are leaving their very tiny farms&mdash;if one could call them farms&mdash; those with £1 and 30/- valuations, simply because they could not get from that amount of land, or a farm with that valuation, a living anything comparable to that which a family living in the city could get, even on the unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We have done, and are doing, our utmost to help the very small farmers to stay on their land.  The subsidy for the relief of agricultural rates this year is over £5,500,000 and a great deal of that goes to the farmers with small valuations.  By far the greatest proportion <Col N="535" /> of it goes to these very small farmers and they have also available to them lime and fertilisers at cheap rates. They are getting better facilities for credit to obtain pigs, sows and heifers, and they are getting more attention from agricultural supervisors and agricultural instructors than heretofore. It requires but the will on their part to increase the output from our farms.</P>
    <P>This Budget has to be examined not only from the narrow point of view of balancing the financial accounts of the Department of Finance but also in relation to the general overall national balance.  We succeeded last year in reducing the deficit in our balance of payments to a very small figure of £1,000,000, so that our balance of international trade has been very steady.  Not only that, but the income to the Exchequer was buoyant and everything was set for a strong effort on the part of the Minister for Finance to induce further production, knowing that increased Exchequer payments and reliefs would not have an inflationary effect on our balance of trade or putting the Exchequer into the red.</P>
    <P>In that favourable climate, the Minister for Finance was perfectly justified in giving the reliefs he did to the various sections of the community. The reliefs he gave were not only appreciated but they were recognised as a sign of confidence in the future&mdash; confidence that, although we had a late start in the industrial race and in applying scientific agricultural methods to the land, at least we were getting ahead and that we could look forward in the future to increased output in agriculture and industry and increased buoyancy in the Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the reliefs given by the Minister to the various sections and the additional assistance he gave to the old age pensioners and pensioners of all descriptions will have the effect of increasing the confidence of the Irish people in the future.  The first thing we want to do is increase that confidence because it was sadly reduced by the activities of the two past Coalitions.  The first Coalition skedaddled, leaving a deficit of <Col N="536" /> £6,000,000 in the previous year's accounts and leaving a gap of £15,000,000 to be filled by the Budget of 1952.  The second Coalition skedaddled, leaving a deficit of £6,000,000 and, not only that, but leaving a deficit in the Exchequer balance on the first occasion in 1951 that resulted in an adverse trade balance of £61,000,000; and in their second term of office they had in one year an adverse trade balance of £35,000,000.</P>
    <P>These unhappy consequences of the first Coalition were reversed by the Budgets of 1952 to 1954, and the unhappy consequences of the second Coalition have been largely eliminated by the very sensible and wise operations of the Minister for Finance.  Not only is output in industry going up and not only can we look forward with greater confidence to an increased agricultural output next year, but we are selling more abroad in places we never sold anything worth while.  Our trade with the United States has gone up from £3.2 million in 1952 to £7.4 million in 1958.</P>
    <P>Tourism not only increased between Great Britain and here but it increased also between the United States and this country.  In 1951, 18,000 American tourists came here; last year, over 70,000 came.  If Irish Air Lines had been allowed continue and if their machines had not been sold by the Coalition, a greater number than 18,000 tourists might have come from America in 1951.  Now that we have our own air lines and can look forward to our own jet planes, I think we can expect a greater increase in the number of tourists from the United States.  Air travel has facilitated the increase in the number of Americans coming to Europe; in recent years there has been a very much greater increase in the number of American tourists coming to Ireland than to Europe as a whole.  It has come to the point that, with the difference in hotel and amusement costs between here and the United States, an American who wants a couple of weeks' holidays can come to Ireland by air and save a lot of money on his holiday.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made some of his usual statements, which I am afraid <Col N="537" /> he would find very difficult to sustain. He complained that the more wheat a farmer grew, the less he would get. Of course Deputy Dillon knows that that is not true.  Until the harvest exceeds 300,000 tons in any year there will be no cut in the fixed price. It is gratifying to find Deputy Dillon now careful of the interests of the wheat farmer.  It is not so long ago since he was hoping that wheat, and beet, and peat would all go up the spout.  Had they gone up the spout, as Deputy Dillon at one stage wished they would, our balance of payments position today would be very much worse and our Budget, if we wanted to do the things for our people that we have done by way of education and certain reliefs, would have to include a very much higher incidence of general taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's mentality was patently disclosed by his railing at the proposed expenditure on a nitrogenous fertiliser plant.  Deputy Corish was anxious that we should increase Government activity in the industrial sphere by setting up more Government companies.  Deputy Dillon, on the other hand, does not want us to set up a company to produce nitrogen for ourselves, the raw materials for which are readily available in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to power generating stations.  He does not like the idea of increasing power generating stations.  He quoted from a Government publication in an effort to prove that we have 400,000 kilowatts excess capacity.  That may have been true at the time the publication was issued, but the E.S.B. have since changed their minds in relation to capacity chiefly, I think, because of the buoyancy of our economy and the fact that they are now able to sell more electricity.  There is no talk now of over-capacity; they want more and more power generating stations developed.  It is significant that the use of electricity is growing.  The fact that electricity consumption is increasing proves clearly that production is going up and, with it, the standard of living.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the <Col N="538" /> decrease in the number of agricultural workers.  I have already referred to that.  I am afraid his figures for emigration are very wide of the mark. The only figure we can get of net emigration is the net outward passenger movement.  In the twelve months to February, 1958, the net outward passenger movement was 59,000. In the twelve months to February, 1959, the net outward passenger movement was down to 33,000.  That shows a drop of 26,000.  Those are the best figures we can get to show the pattern of emigration.  One deduction that can be made as between those two sets of figures is that emigration went down substantially last year.</P>
    <P>If we want to eliminate emigration and give those who want to stay at home an opportunity of remaining in their own country, the only way in which we can do that is by increasing production.  If Deputy Dillon's outlook is the outlook of Fine Gael for the future, then it is a poor look out for those of our people who might like to stay at home.  We are told we should not develop a nitrogen factory; Deputy Dillon believes that the nitrogen produced would be unsuitable.  That is quite false.  We are told we should cut down the number of power stations merely because consumption goes down temporarily.  It is only through an increase in our industrial capacity, in addition to agriculture, that we can provide our people with some opportunities for remaining at home, thereby cutting down forced emigration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon advocated unlimited subsidies on agricultural exports.  He is not satisfied apparently with the millions given for the subsidy on the export of bacon and the millions given for the subsidy on the export of butter. He wants us to spend more and more millions.  In the good old days, when we first introduced the subsidy to give our farmers a fair price for their milk and enable us to sell butter at the price we could get for it, Deputy Dillon, supported by the Fine Gael Party and others, accused us of starving the Irish people in order to subsidise John Bull's breakfast table.</P>
    <P>We have come, I am glad to say, a good way from that attitude.  If, as <Col N="539" /> time goes on, Fine Gael adopt more and more of the Fianna Fáil attitude, they may eventually be a good Government&mdash;if they ever get that far.  We are now in a much better position to make progress as compared with some years ago.  More and more of our people have acquired industrial skill, scientific training and experience in management.  More and more of our people are prepared to put their money into Irish industry.  If we join the skill and the money to our capacity for work there is no doubt that production will increase and more and more of our people will find steady and remunerative employment at home.  The sooner we get away from the old mentality of Fine Gael that we could not start an industry here except at the expense of the farmers the better it will be.</P>
    <P>We have I am glad to say reached reasonable wisdom in certain aspects of finance.  Deputy Dillon and his friends brought the country almost to a halt in the first instance and almost smashed it in the second in declaring that our external assets were bits of waste paper.  When Fianna Fáil were trying to keep a steady balance during and after the war they were denounced for not using these external assets, these bits of waste paper as Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Mulcahy called them from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>When they came in in 1948 they proceeded to treat our external assets as bits of waste paper and in one year they spent £61,000,000 of them.  Then they got out and left Fianna Fáil to clean up the mess. They did not gain very much wisdom under Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance and they continued that line of argument half-way through the Fianna Fáil Government that followed the first Coalition and was endeavouring to clear up the mess.  Indeed, even under the second Coalition they were still treating our external assets as bits of waste paper and in one year they <Col N="540" /> spent £35,000,000 on importing goods in excess of what they could pay for. £35,000,000 of the national savings of the people went down the drain.</P>
      <P>I am glad that, in this Budget debate so far and in recent months, we have not heard them describe our external assets as bits of waste paper that should be got rid of as quickly as possible.  The fact that they have stopped that propaganda and have come round to a reasonable financial viewpoint is a good augury for the future and will help the Government in its policy of development.  In the good old days when our external assets were waste paper, according to the Coalition, they were of course very keen on developing the standard of living.  They have now come to realise, as Fianna Fáil has always realised, that there is no use in willing the end unless you will the means to the end. If we want to increase the standard of living of the people on a permanent basis we must increase production of the goods required to give them that increased standard of living and if we behaved so improvidently as to run away with all our savings, as the Coalition did to the tune of £61,000,000 in one year, we will shortly reach the point where, if we want to develop here, we must go abroad for the money and get a foreign loan.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying that the Minister for Finance is to be congratulated, not so much on this Budget but on his courageous Budget of 1957 when he took the unpopular measures which were necessary to restore equilibrium in our balance of payments and a fair balance in the Budget.  The progress that has been made since then flows, and the progress that we look forward to with confidence in the future will flow from the fact that he had the courage to do the right thing by the Irish people in balancing our accounts and in putting every penny he could scrape together into assisting agriculture and industry.  It is by these methods alone that we can hope to build up the prosperity of the country and we in Fianna Fáil confidently look forward to that building-up.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Finance sat down yesterday, <Col N="541" /> smiling, happy and confident amid the plaudits of his supporters, I think this House began to realise then or shortly afterwards how useful it is to have an Opposition because in the short speech that Deputy Sweetman made he demonstrated that, in spite of the statement by the Minister for Finance, in spite of the reliefs he was giving and in spite of the fact that there was an attempt to bring home to the House that those reliefs were due to the sound economic circumstances of the country, there was just an element of doubt as to whether the Minister had at his disposal the money he was supposed to have.  Was he taking that money from current expenditure or was he transferring it from capital account?  Was he not relying on buoyancy to give him the money for these reliefs?</P>
      <P>In other words, as an Opposition Deputy, is one not justified in doubting that this is a genuine Budget?  Is one not perhaps led into that belief by virtue of the particular political circumstances in which we are to-day in that we have two major national decisions coming, the Referendum and the Presidential Election.</P>
      <P>In the remarks I shall address to the House in regard to economic and financial policy I think one must take the overall period for which this Government has been in office.  The present administration came into office two years ago and proceeded to remove the subsidies.  I have an open mind on subsidies but we must remember they were built into our economy and that although economic advisers may tell the Government: &ldquo;The easiest line is to remove something that is not economic and fundamentally sound,&rdquo; that is an economic adviser's duty.  It is the duty of the Government, as elected representatives of the people, in touch with the people and with every facet of political life, to weigh and measure that advice and see whether it is sound advice to accept or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to offer a dogmatic opinion on that point because I have not the advantage that the Minister has of having all the economic facts at his disposal but I can at least <Col N="542" /> express an opinion as a Deputy on the overall position.  I would like to deal with one aspect of the removal of the subsidies which I think was false economics.  I would go so far as to say it was rotten economics&mdash;the removal of the butter subsidy.  When the butter subsidy whatever it cost&mdash;I have not the actual figure at the moment&mdash;operated here butter was consumed in the country.  The Minister removed the subsidy and had at his disposal considerable sums of money.  He had straight away to utilise a sum of over £2,000,000 to counteract the removal of the butter subsidy. If the Minister has any answer to that, I should be glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that by the removal of the butter subsidy which was costing less than what was subsequently paid to enable us to sell our butter in a market in which there was overproduction, it cost more to pay the external subsidy than the internal subsidy to our own people.  As I say, on paper, it may be good economics to do things like that.</P>
    <P>The Government made great play with the fact that they were committed to private enterprise.  Ministers went up and down the country and told us that national expenditure would be cut and that State schemes would be cut, that their policy was a policy of private enterprise and of changing over from State schemes to private enterprise. It is easy to say things like that. Perhaps it is good policy.  I would not gainsay that to develop private enterprise is a good thing, but, as I said, we must always look at the overall picture, and that is where this Governmen have proved themselves to be a failure.  You have to remember that if you suddenly cease to operate schemes which are giving employment&mdash;such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act, the Land Project or housing schemes under local administration&mdash;you cut the ground from under that employment, and before you can replace it, untold harm will be done to our economy.  That is where the Government have failed completely, and that is where we have had the rising rate of unemployment which has reached <Col N="543" /> catastrophic heights, in spite of the fact that it has seen offset by emigration.</P>
    <P>Speaking here a few moments ago, a very responsible Minister, a senior Minister, the Minister for External Affairs, said that there are no statistics compiled to indicate the degree of emigration.  Every Deputy, whether biased or unbiased, knows perfectly well that the rate of emigration to-day is higher than it has been at any time in the past 50 years.  I shall give the Minister some figures.  From 1st January, 1958, until 31st October of the same year, a period of nine months, 46,000 Irish emigrés applied for insurance cards in Britain.  If, in nine months, 46,000 people, men and women, applied for those cards, you can take it that the rate of emigration out of this country is over 50,000 a year.  That is the policy of the Government who are tied to their economic advisers and have no policy of their own to offset that, and no organising ability to see that things are cushioned gradually, and that is what the country has been up against.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance introduced his first Budget here, he earmarked a sum of £250,000 for the purpose of securing markets.  I understand that after two years the only thing done to secure those markets is the setting up of some sort of committee and some thousands of pounds have been spent on fees or in paying the travelling expenses of that committee for the purpose of coming together to discuss marketing.  No active step whatsoever has been taken to expend that money and it is money that could have been well spent because one of the primary difficulties facing the country to-day is the securing of markets.</P>
    <P>Any increase we want to make in the economic sphere or in relation to the new situation that is developing in Europe will have to be achieved by securing new markets.  I submit that the Government during the past two or three years have done nothing whatsoever to create a better situation. They have removed the food subsidies and created a rising trend in the cost of living and by removing the food <Col N="544" /> subsidies, they have created the embarrassments and difficulties they themselves have had to face.  If we are to advance in this country, and if we are to develop a viable economy, we must have a reduction in expenditure. I do not see anything in the Minister's statement or in the plans of his Government, or even in the White Paper, produced for the Government by their expert advisers, which in any way tends to show that there is a trend towards a reduction in national expenditure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction in taxation, it is of course welcome, but I feel inclined to say to the Minister: &ldquo;Thank you for nothing.&rdquo;  If millions of pounds are saved on subsidies, one expects a reduction in taxation.  I may have a very suspicious mind, but I cannot help feeling that if the British Budget had not come out a week or so before our own Budget, we might not have got those concessions.  Such reductions in income taxation and the raising of the limit for sur-tax are very useful in making for a viable economy.</P>
    <P>To get the benefits from that and to expand our economy, both industrially and agriculturally, we must have a reduction in taxation.  Our great difficulty has been to encourage people to come in here and have confidence in the nation.  I have no hesitation in saying that one of the great difficulties since the advent of native government has been that so much has been dependent on State expenditure.  It is a good move to turn over to private enterprise, and private enterprise should be encouraged and fostered in every way possible.  These things have to be done by degrees, and if harsh measures are taken, more strenuous measures will have to be taken to counteract them.</P>
    <P>I do not think any reasonable, unbiased person can say that the Government have done anything to help our economy except in the reductions in taxation which were made yesterday.  Nor do I think anyone could say they have made the best distribution of the funds at their disposal.  It was the line of least resistance to take £9,000,000 in a full year in food subsidies but, having decided that that was the foundation <Col N="545" /> of their policy, one would have expected that that £9,000,000 would have been utilised in a different way from the way it has been.  One would have expected that concomitant with taking that sum of money they would have had an overall scheme for a reduction of national expenditure, that they would have taken cognisance of the fact that they would be causing untold hardship to certain sections of the community and that they would have assisted those people to bear the heavy burden they were throwing on them.  Admittedly the Minister has given half a crown to the old age pensioners, to the blind pensioners, to the widows and orphans, but as someone stated here, it was the pressure of public opinion that forced him to do that.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an expanding economy some Minister at some stage must realise that a small country like this, with under 3,000,000 people, cannot afford the huge public services we have.  Someone at some time will have to effect drastic reductions in the size of the staffs of Departments and the general administration, and the only way that can be done is at Governmental and Ministerial level. In my experience as a Deputy, a system has grown up in the country of spending a shilling to save a penny.  The Minister for Finance must finance all these Departments.  I do not think there is a single Department in which there could not be drastic reductions. Whenever there is a simple State transaction, the buying of State property, the transfer of property from private individuals to the State or from the State to private individuals or even the transfer of anything from one Department to another, the result is an enormous file which goes through half a dozen officials.</P>
    <P>If the Minister seriously wants to make a contribution to enable this country to get on its feet again, to give private enterprise a full opportunity of developing, he cannot go on indefinitely, in a small country like this, piling up taxation.  This is a makeshift Budget.  It reminds me of a person in financial difficulties gathering a few pounds together to carry on for a little longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> No Government in the history of the State has had an opportunity like this Government has had.  They were given a huge overall majority.  They talk about unity of Party, unity of thought, and despise and denigrate coalitions. They have had it all their own way. They were given five years in which to formulate a policy.  Two years have gone by and the Minister has given us these reliefs.  Those in the Opposition, both Fine Gael and Labour, who have been in Ministerial office and who know the facts behind the scenes, have said that this is even a dishonest Budget, that in spite of the many hardships this Government has imposed upon the people, the net result is the same. It is a makeshift Budget put together to tide them over and to give the people the idea that Fianna Fáil are really doing what they said they would do from the hustings and for which the people returned them.  It is another betrayal of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It may be there would be some improvement in conditions.  Any small reduction in taxation is welcome but as long as you have the state of affairs obtaining whereby people are leaving the country in thousands with no prospect or hope for the future, this Government cannot consider itself successful. The best thing for the Minister to do&mdash;and as the Minister for Finance he is the only person who can do it, in conjunction with the head of the Government whoever he will be; we understand changes will be taking place&mdash;is to formulate a long term policy to put this country on a sound economic basis so that this Government may serve the people properly as they have been elected to do by a majority, to try to keep our people at home, give employment and mitigate the hardships instead of increasing the burden on them by excessive taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suspicious of this Budget.  The concessions announced yesterday for those with the least income&mdash;the old age pensioners, widows, blind pensioners and those on public assistance&mdash;whatever the Government says they will effect, will not mean an extra half crown in their case.  Most of those people are on <Col N="547" /> home assistance.  I would say half of the old age pensioners receive from 2/- to 5/- from home assistance. Practically 90 per cent. of those who are unemployed and married receive home assistance.  Most blind pensioners receive home assistance and most widows&mdash;because they have accommodation of their own, with rent to pay&mdash;receive home assistance.  I have been assured from investigations this morning, and I know from my experience of the past, that if they get this half crown it will be deducted from the home assistance.  In other words more than half of the total number of people now said to have get an increase of 2/6 will get nothing.</P>
      <P>That is no hearsay.  Every Deputy ought to know that.  The average married man cannot live on his 30/- a week.  If a married man is on assistance, that is all he gets for himself and his wife.  If he has a family, let it be six children, he receives a maximum of 11/- extra public assistance.  He cannot live on that so he gets so much extra from home assistance.  He goes to the home assistance officer and he may give him, say, 3/- up to a maximum of 10/-.  Even if you have 20 children you will not get any more than 10/-.  During the past year they investigated every single case and wherever they thought, from their point of view, the person had enough they reduced or withdrew the assistance completely.  They saved £40,000 on public assistance in Dublin last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that every person who should receive a half crown under this Budget will have that amount deducted from his home assistance.  That is the Budget in a nutshell.  Quite a number of old age pensioners who have a pension of 15/-, £1 or 25/- from their employer are allowed a maximum of 42/- from the State; if they have 25/- they get the difference, which is 17/-.  If they have 30/- of a pension from their job they get the difference which is only 12/-.  If they have £2 they get only 2/-.  Therefore, they will not get this half crown.  In a great many cases where there is no <Col N="548" /> home assistance, where people are living in corporation houses&mdash;and a large proportion of the working class of Dublin now live in Corporation dwellings&mdash;half of them are on differential rents which means that all those people will have to pay an extra nine-pence or a shilling in rent as soon as they receive this 2/6d., because that is the differential rent system.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the unemployed and the old age pensioners got 1/-, they were docked from 3d. to 6d. each in their differential rents.  In other words, they did not get the 1/-; they got only 6d. or 9d.  I put down a motion at the Dublin Corporation and the Minister was shamed into agreeing to accept the proposal that that 1/- should not be taken into account. However, up to the time the motion was passed and approved of, those people who got the 1/- were docked 3d. and 6d. a week.</P>
    <P>Half of the people will get nothing extra under this Budget unless the Minister gives the House an assurance that he will see to it that what happend in the case of the 1/- increase last year will not happen in the case of the 2/6d. increase this year.  He may wave his hands and say to the home assistance people he is not responsible for that&mdash;as he has on previous occasions&mdash;but that is what will happen because I got it officially this morning.</P>
    <P>It is significant that this increase will not come into operation until August next.  The reason is obvious. Lots of the old people are simpleminded and do not understand things until something hits them.  When August comes, it will probably be too late for them to know that they will not get this 2/6d. and, furthermore, the elections will be over.  Supposing they were to get the 2/6d. next week or next month and suddenly found the amount cut.  What would happen? There would be mutiny.  The Government do not want that.  They hope to stupefy the old people into believing that they will get 2/6d.  They are safe until August.  Many old people will not know their real position as regards this 2/6d. until after August. when they are hit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> This is the Government total sum of relief for people on the ground&mdash; 1/- last year and a questionable 2/6d. now, which most of them will not get in full.  Because of the withdrawal of the subsidies, all these people have had to withstand the same increases in foodstuffs as persons in employment. However, persons in employment demanded an extra 10/- a week to meet the increased cost of living and got it.  People who had a week's wages, and of whom it might be said they could manage, nevertheless demanded 10/- a week extra to make up for the increased prices of foodstuffs and they got the increase.  But the old people with the miserable £1 or 22/6 got 1/- last year and will now get a questionable 2/6d. and that is the total summing up of the Government's efforts on behalf of people who are on the ground.</P>
    <P>I see no great hope in this Budget of a reduction in unemployment.  If you read the statistics in the live register, you will see that 6,000 fewer male persons are employed and an extra 250 female persons are employed.  In other words, girls of 14-16 years are able to get a few jobs but males&mdash;juveniles or adults&mdash;have no hope of getting a job.  It seems to me that that state of affairs will continue.  Only two days ago I contacted C.I.E. in an effort to get any kind of a job, even a temporary job, for a man.  I was told that there are no jobs and that they propose to let a lot more go shortly.  The writing is on the wall.  Everything will be done for the sake of economy and the only way to do it is to let people go.  Therefore, so far as employment is concerned, this Budget contains no hope.</P>
    <P>There are some reliefs for sport.  I know there are people who will say that the money could be put to better use but I think that the relief was overdue.  We have enough common sense to realise that the cinema is in danger and, as time goes on, will be in greater danger.  It is a source of good employment and it is only right that it should get some relief.</P>
    <P>There are people who will sneer at the relief for dancing.  I know something <Col N="550" /> of the dancing world.  I ran dances; I do not do so now.  The taxes on dancing forced all the small people out of business and forced me out of business.  You could not pay tax on a small dance.  The trouble was that you could pay it when you were making money, but when you started losing, you could not carry on.  You were paying on dances that were losing and therefore you just chucked in your hand.  There are no cheap dances in Dublin because of the tax.  It is only fair that that amusement should get some relief.  People are entitled to amuse themselves as they think fit. Some people sneer at a dance but those same people will back a horse or drink a &ldquo;small one&rdquo;.  Everybody has his own form of amusement.</P>
    <P>I shall now leave this Budget to the experts.  I want to put my finger on the alleged relief for persons on assistance, old age pensioners, the blind and widows.  I want to emphasise again that this is a relief for only a small number of people.  Many people will get nothing as the amount will be docked out of their home assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Budget.  I have come to that conclusion, after listening to the debate this morning, more definitely than ever. On the one hand, it has been condemned for not giving any worthwhile reliefs and on the other hand, we are told that it is purely an election Budget. An election Budget generally gives benefits and it is therefore a good Budget.  This Budget cannot at the same time be an election Budget and yet not give anything to anybody, as somebody has described it.  I am satisfied that neither elections nor any influence other than a genuine desire to further our policy of economic expansion in any way influenced the Minister in the production of what, to my mind, and what I think will be agreed by everybody is a sound and sensible Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said the Budget should have regard for to-morrow as well as to-day.  I think that slogan could be applied very strongly to some of the Budgets introduced by the coalition Governments.  If we had to introduce <Col N="551" /> harsh Budgets in the past two years, it was precisely because some of the previous Budgets had not regard for to-morrow.  In fact, if the finances of this country have at times reached a stage at which the public lost complete confidence in our economy, it was due more than anything else to juggling around with Budget figures by coalition Governments on occasions when they merely tried to create the impression that things were all right for to-day.</P>
    <P>Those who say that the present Government have done little are not serious and are trying to make a case when it is difficult to do so.  Nobody can fail to realise that the confidence which has been restored in the economy and finances of the country over the past two years is immeasurable. One can perceive the different atmosphere in the House in this Budget debate as compared with that which prevailed in previous years when we did not know where we were going or what would be the outcome of a disastrous situation, where one financial crisis seemed to follow another.  The steadying of the financial situation over the past year is a matter on which we can reflect with the greatest pleasure.  The Minister is to be congratulated on having done more to bring that about than any other person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin seems to deprecate the allowance provided in the Budget for old age pensioners and other pensioners in certain home assistance categories. The £883,000 provided for that purpose is no bagatelle and is a very welcome contribution to a deserving class.  It ill becomes people, especially members of the only Party in this House that is on record as having reduced old age pensions in their time by one shilling, to suggest that the Minister was forced by public opinion to take that action.  I am sure the old age pensioners are grateful that the Minister has given them on this occasion what is a reasonable increase having regard to the small surplus which he had at his disposal.</P>
    <P>If we were to go into figures as to what would be enough for an old <Col N="552" /> person to exist on without any supplementary income or without help from relatives or friends, 30/- or £2 would not be considered equitable but I do not believe Deputy Sherwin, who never seems to see beyond Dublin North Central or some other part of the city, that 90 per cent. of the pensioners are in receipt of home assistance.</P>

      <P>The people of Dublin do pretty well out of social services.  When one takes into consideration the small number of persons in productive employment, on whom the rest are living, one must realise and appreciate the amount that is being done for those who are living in built-up areas, who are in non-productive employment or living entirely on social services.

      <P>Not everyone has welcomed the relief to the cinemas but it must be appreciated that something had to be done in that direction. <Col N="553" /> The relief to cinemas will cost £150,000 in this financial year.  Most of the speakers referred to the cinemas as a source of employment.  That is so; cinemas employ a small number of people.  Cinemas must also be regarded as a source of cheap entertainment for the people, particularly in the cities.  Yesterday, Deputy Sherwin was alarmed by the amount of crime being committed in this city, particularly juvenile crime.  One can easily see that if suitable sources of entertainment are not available, there may be an increase in crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Sherwin's statement that he did not say that this crime was justified.  The small increase in service pensions to the old-I.R.A. is also welcome though I should like to see a larger amount. The provision is a recognition of the need to do something in that respect. The cost is £23,000 in the current year.</P>
      <P>The income tax reliefs, which will cost over £1 million, must necessarily be an incentive to industry.  While some of those who claim to represent and to speak for the working class people claim that there is nothing to be gained there, I say that the worker can have little hope of success when the employer is not in a sound financial position.  The success of industry leads to the success of the worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, the reliefs which the <Col N="554" /> Minister has been able to give in this year's Budget and the increases he is giving to the most needy classes are commendable and much better than most people thought would be possible. I wonder, sometimes, if the public know exactly where we are going when they read or listen to debates in this House.  When a Minister tries to do something calculated to be for the general good and, to the best of his ability, designed to improve and stimulate our economic programme of expansion, somebody on the other side of the House immediately tries to negative his efforts.  To-day the <i>Irish Independent</i> tries to represent this Budget as a silly, political Budget.  The <i>Irish Times</i> applauds it as a sound, useful Budget.</P>

If the public are to take the lead from this House they will find themselves in a dilemma in assessing the situation.  Deputy Corish went almost all-out in favour of the nationalisation of industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the Budget in previous years I always pointed out the indications for the future, judging from the past.  I think that the recovery which has taken place in the last two years, the improvement in our general financial position and the restoration of confidence which undoubtedly has set in, provide the greatest indication of our future success.  Some Deputies complained that the Minister had no regard for the White Paper which was recently issued but I think the entire theme of the Budget is designed to implement and encourage the provisions outlined in the White Paper on Economic Expansion. Anybody who says that, without illustrating his point, is merely making a reference which he expects the people to believe because he has said it.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the Budget is designed to implement the provisions of the White Paper and, furthermore, I am quite happy that the Minister has been prudent in the provisions he makes for the various reliefs or benefits.  Above all, he cannot be accused of producing an election Budget.  He has not done anything sufficiently spectacular to be accused of having produced an election Budget. He merely gave reliefs within the limits of the resources at his disposal and has recognised the need of certain sections as far as he could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six per cent increased Old I.R.A. pension would hardly be regarded by any of us as being sufficient <Col N="557" /> but we all agree that it is a recognition of the need to help a section whose emoluments have never been commensurate with the hardships they had to undergo to earn it, if you like.  The purchasing power of those small emoluments has decreased considerably. Even six per cent. is a recognition that at least they are a section which is in need.  The same applies to the old age pension allowances and other allowances.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems to be able to make a target out of dance halls whenever relief is given to them.  I wonder do we appreciate how much the dance halls are used as a medium of recreation?  I would almost say that they are really the main source of recreation.  If we are to show a complete disregard for those things which are the media of entertainment and talk about emigration we must realise that people can go abroad and have any form of amusement without restriction.  We are not really being serious about what is important in our social life when we criticise anything done to improve it.  I do not think people should find a political motive behind attempts to improve it.  There is nothing of a political nature or no ulterior motive behind what the Minister has done.  It is done in the best interests of what I think is an important means of amusement and an entertainment, a form of amusement which is entitled to some little allowance to enable it to carry on.  We all know how charitable organisations have to resort to the dance hall when raising funds.  Those who are responsible for our spiritual welfare also find it the best way of building up funds when schemes of development are necessary and parochial building funds have to be supported.  I do not think anybody should find anything wrong with giving a slight increase in this regard.  The increase amounts this year to £25,000.</P>
    <P>In the speeches so far, the Opposition have dwelt on the question of unemployment and emigration.  Deputy Dillon pointed out the increased unemployment figures and tried to avoid the real issue behind the question.  The table at the end of the economic <Col N="558" /> statistics which were circulated the other day showed an increase of 2,000 in industrial employment. Deputy Dillon attributed the decrease in the other spheres of employment to, in the main, as he said, the conditions of employment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, to the Control of Manufactures Act.  I do not see for one moment how the Control of Manufactures Act could contribute to the decline, even in a small way.  It is perfectly well known that the decline in agricultural production is, in the main, due to mechanisation on the land.  If any Deputy on the other side has a practical suggestion to make which will improve or tend towards the improvement of the agricultural employment situation, I have yet to hear it.</P>

I said that if you have money to drain land, you should drain the land and if you have money to repair the roads, you should repair the roads, but you should not try to bring in a sort of scheme that is related to both and does not effect either.  I do not think anybody could be genuinely enthusiastic about that type of thing.  Let us put money into the roads, if we want <Col N="559" /> money to make roads and let us expend money on drains, if we want to make drains.  I see in Donegal where drains were made along mountain roads which were not capable of carrying pedal cyclists.  Drains were made on these roads in order to use funds allocated by the Government at the time.</P>

If we get money for draining land, it should be used for that purpose and if we get money for repairing roads, it should be used for that purpose.  This is a scheme which was immediately suspect and was very often used wrongly.  Some counties went in to drain fields and other counties kept strictly to the terms of reference and used them for the benefit of the roads.</P>

      <P>If there is one indication more than any other of a good Budget, it was reflected barometer-like on the faces of the Opposition Deputies as the Budget speech was being unfolded.  I remember when in 1952, as a result of the financial mess in which we found ourselves, the Minister announced the removal of the subsidies, the light that lit up the face of the Opposition.  It was a question of welcoming what they knew would be an unpopular Budget.  The only thing that entered the mind of most of the Opposition was whether this was a Budget which would further their political interests.  The effort of every speaker is to try to establish in the minds of the people that it was done merely for political purposes; that there is nothing good in it and that we were heading for disaster all the time, according to the Opposition. The Opposition speak of deficits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have dealt with those to the extent that the credit squeeze that crippled the country, as a result of coalition policy, has eased off and for the first time in the history of this country the most deserving section of the community&mdash;the agricultural community&mdash;can now get reasonable credit facilities.  I remember when those opposite applauded their Minister for Finance coming into this House because he had kept down the bank rate even at a time when it had risen in England.  They swallowed their words two weeks later when the banks did anything they liked and exposed that you had nothing to do with it.</P>
      <P>These are the type of things of which we had too much in the past. Let there be as strong an Opposition as you like in regard to something they do not approve.  Let us be genuine in our attempt and let reality permeate our work here.  The present Opposition has often tried to avoid that attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's statement and think his reference to the internal position is worth repeating.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I believe that increased investment, important though it is, does not by itself hold the key to the solution of our problems.  More important still is the human factor&mdash; the will of our people to work for their own and the country's betterment and their efficiency as organisers, producers and salesmen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we can get people to realise that the be-all and end-all is not in what the Minister does at Budget time&mdash;in this or any other country&mdash;we are doing a good job.  It is by their own initiative, their own effort and their own exertions that in the ultimate the position will be improved, and the sooner we get them to realise that the better.  We must not bring them to the stage where they are led to believe that they may expect something to be <Col N="563" /> handed over to each section by the Minister for Finance in his annual Budget.  I would be prepared to go far beyond the limits of our national income to support a programme of enhanced social welfare.  When we complain here that this or that section is not getting relief, we are merely fostering an idea which is already too prevalent, that the Minister, by the mere manipulation of figures, can leave every section of the community happy without any effort on their part.</P>

      <P>Our approach, ever since we first were a Government, has been in that way.  If our efforts were frustrated at different periods, that is no fault of ours.  We are working now on a definite programme of economic expansion, designed to increase output, to put more people in employment and eventually to uplift the standard of living of the people.  That is not something which can be done overnight, but it is something for which the foundations are now truly laid.</P>

      <P>Nothing will make us deviate from that course.  There is nothing really spectacular in this Budget to justify the accusation of its being an election Budget.  It is a sound, sensible Budget, framed to meet a situation from which we hope to make further progress and greater development.  While all indications point to greater progress in the future, I am with the Minister every step of the way in supporting him and congratulating him on his effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that, two years ago, in this House, I would hardly believe we could ever reach a sound financial situation again.  I go further and say that many of the economists of the time, many of the experts who were competent to deal with these matters, <Col N="564" /> were doubtful certainly with regard to the time which must elapse before we would reach a period of recovery, where stability and progress would be envisaged.  We have reached that situation now.  Let us keep on that road. Let us get away from unbalanced Budgets and from political expediency in budgeting.  Let us face our problems in a realistic manner, as the Minister has done on this occasion.  Let us give what we can, according to the resources we have at our disposal.  Let us give relief, according as we can, where it is most needed, where it is calculated to improve and expand production, to give more employment and produce a higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>If we keep on that course and cease to foster amongst our people the thought that they can live on benefits handed out, without any corresponding increase in national income or national output, agricultural or industrial, we will continue moving in the right direction.  The present Budget is the green light to that policy in the future and for that reason I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reluctance of the Opposition to get in on this debate reflects the true import of the Budget.  I remember when, in 1957, the Fianna Fáil Budgets were introduced, Budgets which had to redress radically the serious financial situation, Budgets which had to withdraw food subsidies and directly increase the cost of living, Budgets which perforce had to increase taxation in certain respects.  At that time, Deputies opposite were jumping out of their seats with joy and rubbing their hands with glee.  I would not like to accuse them of taking joy out of the hardships which they expected would be experienced by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were obviously looking forward with some optimism to the political effects which these Budgets would have&mdash;and which, in effect, they did have.  The Budgets were occasioned by what can only be described as profligate spending and irresponsible administration by the two previous Coalition Governments.  They were, nevertheless, necessary in order <Col N="565" /> to set right the finances of this country. The fact that we now have achieved for the first time in many years a position of being able to present a balanced Budget indicates how successful those measures were.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is hardly surprising that we see on the opposite side only three Deputies, representative of Fine Gael, none of the Labour Party and none of the other organised Parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard some words of wisdom yesterday.  The Budget was introduced yesterday, but that was not the only thing introduced yesterday. There were also introduced sour grapes, bucketfuls of them, dispensed freely around the House by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton.  Deputy Sweetman sought to prove that the Budget was not balanced but was in deficit to the tune of something in excess of £4,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>£4.3 millions, to be exact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The formation and composition of that Budget followed exactly on the lines of the two previous Budgets of the Minister but Deputy Sweetman on those occasions, because he saw that these Budgets were not balanced&mdash;that the accounts at the end of the year were not balanced&mdash;did not lay about him as effectively as he thought he did yesterday.  I suppose he was happy on those occasions as long as he thought the present Minister <Col N="566" /> for Finance was not able to do better than he did.</P>
      <P>As we all remember there was a deficit of £6,000,000 at the end of the financial year 1951, which was the real cause of the withdrawal of some of the food subsidies.  That was after three years of the first Coalition Government. In 1952, which was the first year Fianna Fáil took office after Estimates introduced by the Coalition Government, we found at the end of that year that the Budget was in deficit to the tune of no less than £15,000,000. It was little wonder then that drastic action, unpopular political action, had to be taken on these occasions which was avidly availed of by Opposition Deputies who showed no reluctance, on those occasions, to come in and denounce the hairshirt policy which Fianna Fáil were obliged to introduce as a result of mismanagement by their predecessors.</P>
      <P>In 1956-57, Deputy Sweetman was unable to balance his Budget to the tune of about £6,000,000 again, and that £6,000,000 in deficit was reflected in the accounts at the end of 1957-58. The point was made yesterday by Deputy Sweetman that having regard to the savings on the food subsidies and the compensations that were provided in that year, there was left in excess, out of these food subsidies, a saving to the Minister for Finance of something like £5,000,000, but that £5,000,000 was still less than the deficit, the legacy of deficit, that was left to Dr. Ryan by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this year drew to a close and as figures were made generally available to the public, economists and people who are otherwise qualified to assess these figures, were able in newspaper articles and in radio features, to predict a small surplus.  Their predictions were well founded and, in fact, there was produced a small surplus.  Nevertheless, despite the predictions of these people and despite the positive results from their examination of the figures when they became finally available, we find that only Deputy Sweetman and his advisers were able to produce this deficit of £4.3 million&mdash;as I have been corrected by Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;as being there in the current year.  Instead <Col N="567" /> of being accused of brazenness and of political dishonesty, surely Deputy Sweetman might have had the decency to compliment the Minister for Finance on doing something that neither he, nor his predecessor in the coalition as Minister for Finance, could do, that is to produce a balanced Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton made light of the tax concessions and of the social welfare benefits provided in this Budget. He spearheaded his attack on the Budget by alleging that it did nothing for the relief of unemployment and that the Minister, in his 42 pages, did not refer to the prospect of increased employment as a result of the Budget. That was clearly incorrect on the face of the document itself.  However, there is no point in denying something that is blatantly untrue.</P>
    <P>The Budget, of course, is usually regarded as an instrument of portraying Government policy and as a means of inducing not only the administration but the country as a whole to take its part in the programme which flows from that policy.  While the Budget could very well justify being termed in itself an instrument of policy, as a means of putting into effect that programme of economic development, of economic recovery, in the first instance, and then development, it must be taken in the context of the Government's policy announced through the medium of the White Paper and, not only as announced in the White Paper, but as given effect to by various legislative measures and by way of financial provision in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Vote on Account, I instanced some of these measures, for example, in relation to agriculture, the phosphates subsidy scheme for which a sum of £503,000 was introduced last year by way of Supplementary Estimate.  That scheme operated as from 1st September and this year £1,750,000 is being provided in the current Estimates.  The primary object of that scheme, of course, is to encourage the increased utilisation of phosphates on the land so as to improve the grasslands themselves, and <Col N="568" /> the livestock carrying capacity of the land.  For the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, there was increased provision, not only this year but last year as well.  That provision was £984,000 in 1957-58; it was increased to £2,000,000 odd in 1958-59; and increased to £3,500,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman commented on the decrease in the bacon industry but that too has been taken into account, and there has been an increase of £150,000, from £400,000 to £550,000, in the Government's contribution to the subsidy for the production of Grade A bacon.  These are just a few points taken from the Government's programme which must be taken in conjunction with the Budget to indicate that the Budget follows a definite pattern that has already been set down.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, during the debate on the Vote on Account, I pointed to some of the positive provisions made for State, semi-State and even outside companies, in order to increase production capacity and, as a result, the employment content in these industries.  I pointed to the increase in the capital provision for Bord na Móna whereby they are now empowered to increase their capital from the existing limit of £14,000,000 to £19,000,000.  Bord na Móna, as Deputies opposite well know, is one of the greatest employment giving agencies in the country and that increase naturally will facilitate Bord na Móna in providing increased employment in the areas of the country in which they operate.  There is also the provision of £2,000,000 to Irish Steel Holdings to enable them to improve their premises and their plant, so that their products can be more competitive, and so that they will be enabled, in the long run, to increase the employment content of that industry.</P>
    <P>We must remember, too, the Government's commitment in respect of the development of Rushbrooke dockyard which, unlike the oil refinery, definitely means some active participation by the Government.  For the few minutes I was listening to him <Col N="569" /> this morning, Deputy Corish mentioned some of the outstanding successes in State and semi-State industrial undertakings, and included amongst these the oil refinery at Whitegate.  The Government did not have to provide one penny.  When the oil refinery project was first mooted the Government of the day did not have to provide one penny towards the establishment of it.</P>

      <P>These are some of the instances from industry and agriculture in which Government action has not only created opportunities for increased development and new employment but will continue to provide <Col N="570" /> opportunities for new employment in these respective industries.</P>
      <P>I do not think I could be blamed if I instanced one other outlet for which Government policy has provided.  That is the school building programme. Despite the fact that last year 92 new schools were built and 65 major reconstruction schemes undertaken&mdash; about twice as much as was done in any previous year&mdash;we have an increased provision of £250,000 over and above the sums provided last year for new and reconstructed school buildings, primary and vocational.  That is another instance, side by side with this Budget, indicating the means whereby the Government hope to increase employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton suggested that the Budget did not deal with unemployment in any way.  I should like to ask him to reflect on the incentive to employment which the Budget is bound to give by way of tax relief.  We must add to all these State undertakings the initiative and stimulus these tax reliefs will give towards increasing employment in private industry.  From the other side of the House for many years, and even quite lately from the Leader of the Opposition before the Budget, we have been told that unless such relief was given, there would be no incentive to private enterprise to increase the availability of employment in the country.  That has been achieved by the reduction in the standard rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>If this were an election Budget, as is being suggested by the other side, the Government could have used the money required for the reduction in the standard rate of income tax in a much more politically advantageous manner. As Deputy Corish suggested, they could have increased certain family allowances and earned income allowances. That would help more clearly the private individual.  Nevertheless, the Government, in its desire to continue its policy of creating opportunities for economic expansion, resisted that political temptation on the eve of an election and instead gave this straight tax relief, which is designed to help industry and increase employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Having regard to what I have outlined, does it not seem inevitable that the confidence generated throughout 1958 and the expansion experienced throughout that year will be increased as a result of this Budget?  I heard Deputy Corish comment on unemployment figures this morning.  He said that the figures for 1958 were higher than those for 1957.  Deputy Corish must have access to statistics not available to me or any other Deputy.  The figures available clearly indicate that there has been a downward trend ever since this Government took office.  In 1956, the figure was 84,100; in 1957, 75,600 and in 1958 70,300.  Yesterday Deputy Norton commented on the percentage this represented of the total numbers in insurable employment and castigated the Government that this should be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 2,000 more at work in December than there were last year.  Deputy Norton is one of the last people who can afford to comment on the level of unemployment figures.  There is a popular song at present in which a certain gentleman is admonished to hang down his head &mdash;a Mr. Tom Dooley.  I do not know what the message in that song is, but in relation to unemployment figures Deputy Norton has much more reason than Tom Dooley to hang down his head, and much lower than Tom Dooley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Norton was Minister for Social Welfare he set up a commission on emigration.  That commission was set up for the first time in April, 1948.  After 151 meetings, it reported about the middle of 1954.  Having set up the commission in 1948, Deputy Norton was able to sit back and let things take their course.  A new Government intervened, but when Deputy Norton came back as Minister for Industry and Commerce that commission reported to him.  He was then in a better position, as Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, to ensure that the unemployment <Col N="572" /> figures would be decreased; but instead we find that, when he left office, they had reached the high level of between 95,000 and 100,000.  It ill becomes Deputy Norton then to criticise this Budget from the point of view of its failure to give hope to the unemployed. On the contrary, it gives every hope and encouragement to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In 1958 we saw an increase in the national income from £477 million to £493 million.  Despite the 3.6 per cent. decrease in exports, largely caused by the bad harvest, there was an increase in the value of these exports.  Right down through the year there was an upward trend in the output from most industries.  The confidence generated by all these activities and expansions was reflected by the fact that the £15,000,000 National Loan was fully subscribed&mdash;a better record than the Coalition could claim for their two National Loans&mdash;the E.S.B. Loan was fully subscribed and small savings increased considerably during the year.</P>

      <P>There is only one heading &ldquo;Whiskey&rdquo; in the Official Import List, under the headings of which imports are classified, and it is therefore not possible to distinguish <Col N="574" /> separately imports of Scotch whiskey.  In fact the original import documents themselves do not in all cases specify whether the whiskey imported is Scotch or not but it appears from an examination of some of these import documents that most of the whiskey imported from Great Britain is Scotch whiskey.  It is possible therefore to provide the Deputy only with data in respect of total imports of whiskey and to give the Country of Origin as an indication to the type of whiskey.  I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing for the periods in question the total quantity and value of whiskey imported, distinguishing countries of origin.  The figures for the year 1958-59 refer to the period 1st April, 1958, to 28th February, 1959, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the usefulness of helicopters generally, and especially in view of their importance for rescue and relief work, he will consider, in conjunction if necessary with other Departments, the purchase of two such aircraft.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question by him on this subject in Dáil Éireann on 4th December, 1957.  The question of the possible use of helicopters for rescue and relief work was examined in my Department, in conjunction with other Departments, and I am advised that at least six helicopters would be required in order to ensure that, as far as possible, a helicopter would be available within a reasonable time on the occasion of any disaster in the vicinity of our coastline.</P>
      <P>The provision of helicopters is kept under review by my Department and other Departments concerned; I can, however, give no indication of early intentions to provide helicopters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Par. Sec. aware that the figure has doubled since the question was first asked in 1957? The Minister for Defence in his speech that year stated it would take three helicopters to do the work.  In view of the fact that three would have been sufficient in 1957, will the Par. Sec. now inform us as to what has been <Col N="583" /> responsible for increasing the figure from three to six, as suggested in his reply now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a suitable type of helicopter can be purchased for around £36,000, would the Par. Sec. not consider that the expenditure of an adequate sum for the purchase of three such machines would not be out of the way, in view of the tremendous uses to which such a service could be put? Will he now have the matter reconsidered in conjunction with the other interested Department?</P>

      <P>The Deputy in his reference to the use to which helicopters can be put was referring to rescue work around our coast.  The fact is that the Deputy is not, of course, so well informed in the matter as other people are.  It is problematical whether in the event of shipping disasters around our coast, helicopters could in fact be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what steps have been taken to promote the export and sales of blended whiskey in the United States of America; what effect these steps have had; whether he is satisfied that these steps form the most effective method of expanding the sales of blended whiskey; and what <Col N="584" /> amount of money has been expended on advertising of this type of whiskey since the inception of the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The official promotion of exports of Irish whiskey to the United States has been entrusted to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.  In conjunction with the whiskey exporters, that body has been carrying on an extensive advertising campaign for all types of Irish whiskey.  During the year ended 31st March, 1959, C.T.T. expended approximately £45,000 on this campaign while it plans to spend £80,000 during the year ending 31st March, 1960.  The individual whiskey exporters have also spent considerable sums advertising their own special brands.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to give separate figures of expenditure on advertising blended whiskey.  The advertising campaign covers all types of Irish whiskey without distinction.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this method of advertising is the best means open to the Government, or to any Government agency, for promoting sales of Irish whiskey in the United States.</P>
      <P>It is as yet too soon to judge the success of the advertising campaign but it is significant that in the last quarter of 1958 exports of Irish whiskey to the U.S.A. and sales of Irish whiskey by American importers, were 12 per cent. and 50 per cent., respectively, greater than in the corresponding quarter of 1957.  It is clear from the letters which have reached Córas Tráchtála Teoranta that widespread consumer interest has been stimulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the Córas Tráchtála pamphlet which was specially issued blended whiskey and potstill whiskey are referred <Col N="585" /> to as two separate items and the campaign is directed to ensure that the sales of blended whiskey in America will go up as well as those of potstill?  Can the Par. Sec. tell the House whether the campaign in connection with blended whiskey has proved successful?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <P>The total number of transatlantic passengers (i.e. from the U.S. and Canada) who disembarked at Shannon Airport during the year ended 28th February, 1958 was 18,176.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figure for the year ended 28th February, 1959, was 25,723 passengers, of whom 5,843 were carried by Aerlínte and 19,880 by other companies.  It will be noted that the Aerlínte figures related to a period of ten months only while the other figures related to a full year; further, Aerlínte did not, of course, carry any passengers direct from Canada.</P>

      <P>Only a small number of parcels for Waterford would be more expeditiously cleared through a customs depot there than at Dublin. As the cost would be entirely disproportionate, the re-establishment of a parcel post customs depot at Waterford would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>Given the requisite co-operation from traders in complying with customs requirements, undue delay in the clearance of parcels through Dublin should not arise.  In general, I am unable to agree that the existing arrangements cause great inconvenience but if the Deputy is aware of any such instances I shall be glad to have them investigated.</P>

      <P>It was only to be expected that the receipts from Prize Bonds would not continue at the high level of the first year after their introduction.  Nevertheless, the intake from the last three half-yearly issues has been most satisfactory.  The total net receipts last year were £2¼ million.  The success of the Bonds naturally affected to some extent the support given to the traditional forms of small saving but, in spite of this, the net receipts from Savings Certificates and the Savings Banks at £2.7 million showed an increase of £2 million over 1957-58.  Taken together Prize Bonds, Savings Certificates and the Savings Banks brought in £5 million of new savings in 1958-59.</P>

Right through the year, there was an air of ever-increasing confidence. That confidence was reflected in a stimulation of business activity generally and it was remarked by outside agencies.</P>
      <P>During the course of my remarks on the Vote on Account, I referred to the report of 1958 on Ireland by O.E.E.C.: &ldquo;The positive progress and expansion were possibly more markedly reflected in the fact that there was an increase in external capital investment from £1.1 million in 1957 to £17.7 million in 1958.&rdquo;  Recently, I was glad to remark further observations as to progress made by agencies outside our own country.

      <P>Added to all the improvements to which I have already referred there was, as everybody knows, a big increase in bank advances last year, again reflecting an air of confidence not only within the country but also outside the country. All this indicates very clearly a steady improvement in our economic position, an improvement which has been noted by other countries.  The Budget introduced yesterday, while it has not been put forward as a panacea for all our ills, can definitely be claimed to be a contribution to this positive programme of expansion which has generated such confidence in the country's future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget comes to the assistance of the weaker sections of the community. We would like to come to their assistance to a greater extent but, in so far as the money was available, assistance was given to those weaker sections and at the same time relief was given in a direction where it was badly needed.  In the words of Deputy Sweetman, the Budget gives that shot in the arm to the economy which is so essential.  It would have been possible, of course, to put a better face on things by presenting a not-so-honest Budget, a Budget that would perhaps provide certain capital moneys in order to put a better face on the unemployment figures, for instance, but again the Government resisted that temptation.  The Government have decided that the cure for unemployment is a long term one and that sops, while they may provide an <Col N="603" /> immediate remedy, tend only to aggravate the position in the long run.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted to present an election Budget, as has been suggested, it could quite easily have been done. Instead the Budget that has been presented is designed to produce that steady improvement which alone can be of lasting benefit to the community. It has been acclaimed by impartial people, so far as we can judge, as a good, businesslike Budget, as a Budget which will give the necessary stimulus to private investment and to production and, as a result, give the necessary stimulus to the means of increasing employment.  I believe it has been acclaimed and accepted in that form throughout the country and that, taken with the White Paper and taken with the positive programme the Government has, it will give the people even further confidence than they had during the year 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the Minister yesterday I got a copy of his speech because I wanted to make sure, in the light of what we are constantly <Col N="604" /> saying from all sides of the House, that agriculture is the most important part of our economy.  It is our most important industry yet 6½ lines are devoted to agriculture in the Budget. They appear on page 7 and are well worth noting:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The drop in agricultural production last year, which caused the net fall in national output, was due entirely to the bad harvest.  With reasonable harvesting conditions this year, agricultural production should more than regain the lost ground, especially in view of the gratifying increase in breeding stock and young cattle recorded at the livestock census in January last.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, coming from the Minister for Finance, almost makes me bleed to death when I think of the smell of stinking calves all over the country. Now we are told it is good to have cattle.  The people who had T.B. tested herds, when neither the Minister nor his colleagues knew what a T.B. tested beast was, had to sell them and were almost compelled to throw them away.  Then we are told that Fianna Fáil policies were right&mdash;Ministers for grass, going around the country, making fun of all the stockholders and all the people with livestock or connected with that industry.  The people who were going around the country making fun had nothing to lose but the people who were protesting had something to lose and they lost it.</P>
      <P>The decline in the agricultural industry last year was not altogether due to the bad harvest.  A lot of farmers got out of pigs because the Minister's colleagues cut the price of Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs&mdash;an action which he was told here was the most injurious thing he could do to our economy.  I deplore the fact that, in an Irish Budget, the Minister for Finance had nothing to say about agriculture except those few lines.  He had nothing to say about our biggest productive industry.  Where will all this wonderful economic production and economic expansion come from if not from agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish farmer is not buying any newspaper now&mdash;not even the <i>IrishPress</i>&mdash;<Col N="605" /> which tells him to grow more wheat.  The Government are letting this slide along.  Have the Minister and his colleagues any idea of what is happening in the country?  They had a problem last year with wheat because of bad weather.  They had a problem the year before with wheat because there was a surplus.  They had never read their Bibles, not one of them, because if they had they would have read in <i>Genesis</i> that when a Pharaoh had a surplus of wheat it was stored in the years of plenty so that when the years of scarcity and famine came there was corn in Egypt.</P>

      <P>It cost some hundreds of thousands of pounds to give away our wheat, to give a lot of it to English feeders.  The Minister's colleague made sure that English feeders would get wheat at a lower price than any foodstuff in the whole world&mdash; and they would not give it to their own farmers to feed it here.  If the Minister will think back&mdash;he comes from farming stock&mdash;he will realise that if they had given it to their own farmers there would not be a decline in pig production.  Are these good policies?  Are these tactics anything to be proud of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our farmers are now switching over to barley.  The Minister has made many forecasts.  It reminds one of what happens on meeting the tipsters going to a race meeting.  He is only chancing his arm.  I shall not chance my arm.  I shall make a forecast here and stand over it when the time comes.  It is that if the Minister has a good harvest he will have an enormous surplus of barley on his hands. The Irish farmer has got out of wheat-growing. He has got no encouragement from this great Fianna Fáil Party who have always said &ldquo;Wheat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wheat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wheat&rdquo;; &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo;; &ldquo;Wheat is <Col N="606" /> the whole business.&rdquo;  They are not telling the people to grow it now.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil blamed the inter-Party Government for cutting the price of wheat but they themselves cut the throats of the wheat-growers.  Yesterday, Fianna Fáil Deputies clapped and cheered the Minister but none of them was here this morning.  The Minister for Education said we were not anxious to speak on the Budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way I can give my opinion on the Budget and the Budget Statement is by skimming through it.  At page 3, the Minister states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In many areas housing needs appear now to be almost fully met. Building work on hands was held up by the wet weather which prevailed during the summer and autumn.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing to be able to speak for one's constituency.  Building work in Waterford was held up by the Minister for Local Government and his Department.  There is still a very big demand for houses in Waterford, not just for very low-priced houses. There are 16 houses almost completed, which represent the last vestige of building there, and the local authority are inundated with applications for those 16 houses at 27/6d. a week each. We submitted a scheme to the Minister's colleague in October and are still awaiting sanction.  We have the site and everything ready.  The majority of the building workers have gone to <Col N="607" /> England.  The few left and who are at present engaged in completing the few houses still in course of construction in Waterford will have to go if this scheme is not commenced.  The statement in the Budget is a poor response to that need.  It tries to infer that there are no housing needs in the country when, in fact, there are.  It tries to infer that where houses are needed the Government are only willing and anxious to provide the necessary sanction and the money.</P>
    <P>At page 7 of the Financial Statement the Minister says:</P>
    <P>Though the unemployment figures for recent weeks are running about 5,000 less than a year ago, they are still much too high.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister great credit for that admission.  He is the first member of Fianna Fáil I have heard saying that for a long time.  They just gloss over the unemployment problem and say that the figures are down, that everything is fine.  They know that there are 50,000 fewer workers in the country and 50,000 fewer pay packets than there were a few short years ago. Deputy Briscoe is frowning.  That figure is correct.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>Indeed, in many countries the situation worsened during the past year in contrast to the improvement achieved here simultaneously with a fall in emigration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is bound to be a fall in emigration because we could not produce young men and women at the rate at which they were leaving the country for the past couple of years.  They have nearly all gone now.  As I mentioned before a Deputy called for a House, there were 50,000 more pay packets being spent in this country only a few years ago than there are now.  Consider the business represented by those pay packets.  There is a considerable fall in the consumption of all classes of consumer <Col N="608" /> goods.  I gathered from speeches I have heard in this House that the biggest loss from emigration occurred in the West of Ireland, but I consider that a good criterion as to a decline in population in various areas is the decline in the consumption of flour in those areas.  I am informed that there is a considerable drop in the consumption of flour in rural areas in the East of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education was discussing who was responsible for Whitegate and who was not.  I do not give two rows of pins as to who was responsible for Whitegate or anything else.  The main thing is that we have these industries.  I shall not join in the famous song of a Fianna Fáil Minister when he attacked colleagues of mine here for promoting State industries. He called these industries white elephants.  It is a great thing for us to have these industries.  The Minister says that the economy has gained ground generally.  That is the reaction of little Jack Horner, who put in his thumb and pulled out a plum and said &ldquo;What a good boy am I&rdquo;.  By whose actions was that achieved?  What has the Minister done to substantiate that claim since he came into office or since he read his Budget speech here two years ago?  The Minister has done nothing.  His colleagues have done nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister further says:</P>
    <P>Productive home assets have been built up.</P>
    <P>What are the productive home assets that have been built up?  These are only words.  I am tired of listening to this type of speech trotted out by Ministers at Chamber of Commerce dinners and the like all over the country. They mean nothing.  He says again on Page 10:</P>
    <P>External reserves have benefited from a capital inflow which indicates external confidence in our economy. Current revenue and expenditure have been brought into balance.  At the same time, we must see that we do not overspend for current purposes or waste in any other way the capital we must use productively if <Col N="609" /> we wish to raise our living standards permanently.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible for this.  I discovered in the Estimates that there is about £10,000,000 earmarked for arterial drainage, the equivalent of what Deputy Brennan decried as &ldquo;digging holes.&rdquo;  The Minister finishes with this remark&mdash;</P>
    <P>More important still is the human factor&mdash;the will of our people to work for their own and the country's betterment...</P>
    <P>Where is the work for the 20,000 unemployed?  I should like to ask that question and I put it now to the Minister and to his colleague who is now on the road to Rome, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Is he flying home? am sure that some thousands of men will be employed tomorrow when he comes home.  I wonder has he got his fairy chest with his £225,000,000 in it.  The figure of £225,000,000 was trotted out to us during the election.  He had £225,000,000 and 100,000 jobs.  I will settle for 1,000 of these jobs, for 100 of them in my constituency.  I do not care if you wish to hand them out to the members of the Fianna Fáil Cumann.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes on to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>... the will of our people to work for their own and the country's betterment and their efficiency as organisers, producers and salesmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where are the organisers and the salesmen? The Minister earmarked £250,000 for a great drive for increased markets for our goods two years ago.  What have we done with the £250,000?  We have had two years to send out these salesmen. In my opinion they are the kind of people who could not sell plums to birds on a frosty <Col N="610" /> morning.  The Minister should see to it that that money is spent and that we look for markets and send out people who know something about sales technique.</P>
    <P>The Minister has raised the old age pensions by 2/6.  That was delayed action.  Having taken away the subsidies two years ago, and having driven up the cost of living for all people&mdash;and it leaned harder on these unfortunate people&mdash;they are now getting 2/6 a week of an increase which is to be delayed until the 1st August, 1959.  We can only say: &ldquo;Thank God for small mercies.&rdquo;  The cinemas are getting some relief.  That is wonderful.  The cine variety is also benefiting, which is marvellous.  We will all go dancing and we will go to the dogs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the setting up of Bord na gCon, the Minister said that one of its functions was &ldquo;to protect and foster the breeding and export of greyhounds.&rdquo; That occurs on page 20.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of many other people, it is protecting and fostering more than greyhounds.  It is protecting and fostering a good many of the friends and members of the Board.  They were very coy here when they were asked for the names and addresses of the people appointed and we would not be told.</P>

      <P>This is something that must be done and done with some dispatch and we must thank the British Minister for Agriculture and the British Government for their generosity to us in extending the time.  But for the fact that they extended the time our whole eradication scheme would have been a failure because the Minister for Agriculture would not have been able to carry it out.</P>

      <P>Well, the person of the Minister for Agriculture is more important than the person of the whole agricultural community, and the person of the Minister for Agriculture is more important than the whole of the Irish cattle trade.  The Minister for Education <Col N="612" /> said that Deputy Sweetman described this Budget as a &ldquo;shot in the arm&rdquo; and he thought that was a compliment.  I think you give shots in the arm only to people when they are in a very bad way.  The Minister for Education said that the cure for unemployment is a long term policy.  He need not have told us that at all.  I remember the famous slogan: &ldquo;We will do away with unemployment and call back the emigrant.&rdquo;  That was 27 years ago and it is going on still and people are falling for it still.</P>
      <P>It is a wonder the Minister did not mention the Common Market as one of the cures for unemployment, so much has been made of it by his colleagues. I said before, and will say again, that any time spent in travelling or talking about the Common Market is only a waste.</P>
      <P>It has been said here about this Budget: &ldquo;Our efforts were frustrated at some time, but that is not our fault.&rdquo;  Thank God, they were frustrated, when they tried to destroy the export trade and the British market. It was also said: &ldquo;During the year, there was great stimulation of business activities&rdquo;.  I have not come across that amongst shopkeepers in Dublin or in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This £50,000 was an important sum of money and that was the reason I mentioned it.  It shows how my constituency has been treated by the Minister for Finance and by other Ministers for Finance in his Government.  I have been putting down a series of questions for some time, to see how much money has been spent in my constituency, and I have come to the conclusion that there must be some kind of partition there to keep the money out&mdash;as if we were not paying any taxes or doing anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish mention unemployment.  The Minister for Education very cleverly twisted that around and said the unemployment figures had gone down. Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish are well able to defend themselves, but what they meant was that the number of jobs had gone down considerably. That is the important thing.  The Minister then said that the song which would apply to Deputy Norton was: &ldquo;Hang down your head, Tom Dooley.&rdquo;  If that applies to anyone, it would apply to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who promised the people he would put them back to work.  He said: &ldquo;Let us get cracking&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wives, vote for Fianna Fáil and put your husbands to work.&rdquo;  He cheated the people and blackguarded them in that way.  Deputies opposite may laugh, but it is no laughing <Col N="615" /> matter to the unfortunate woman looking at her husband still coming from the labour exchange, or to the whole families which have gone away to England.  Deputies opposite were always good at laughing it off.</P>
    <P>Then there was the famous statement that money was not scarce, that he had £225 millions and 100,000 jobs.  I am repeating that and shall keep on repeating it.  He went around the country and said that at function after function, at cumann after cumann and at public meeting after public meeting.  What has he done about it?  He has been two years in office.  The first time I mentioned it, I was told they had only just come into office.  Now he has been two years in.  Those opposite were clapping this Budget yesterday.  Let them go to the Shelbourne Hotel or the Gresham Hotel and they will find people who will say that this is a wonderful Budget.  But let them ask the man in the street, the working man, or the man working in the fields or in the factories, or the man who is not working.  Let them ask those people's wives what this Budget means to them and what benefit they will get out of it.</P>
    <P>The Government owed a duty to the people.  By the removal of the levies, they put up the cost of living substantially, including the cost of bread, butter, tea and sugar; but they have not mentioned one word about those commodities in this Budget.  I expected&mdash;the ordinary people of this country expected&mdash;that the restitution the Minister would make, when he had a small bit of a surplus, would be to endeavour to reduce the price of bread or butter</P>

      <P>We have just listened to a magnificent contribution to the Budget debate by Deputy T. Lynch. Of course, he could not resist the most personal approach.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about our inviting all the emigrants home from <Col N="616" /> England.  I think his memory must be failing him because it was the first Coalition Government which published the booklet inviting all the emigrants home to the jobs they were going to create for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch remembers all right but confuses the people who extended the invitation.  A great many references were made to the number of unemployed.  The Minister quite frankly said in his Budget speech that, although there was a fall in the number of unemployed, it was to be regretted that we had even the high figure of unemployed we have.  It is with that attitude we should approach this question.</P>
      <P>I should like to place on record something that I said many times. Perhaps, the Minister himself might do what I suggest or maybe he might induce some of his colleagues in the Cabinet to do it.  I think the time has come to examine carefully those who are registered as unemployed.  I think there should be a segregation made as between those who are employable and those who are no longer employable and that those who are no longer employable should be transferred to the Social Welfare register.  Then, we would get a realistic picture of our unemployment situation.  I said that before and I think that if time is given to the examination of this matter, particularly in the city of Dublin, we shall get quite a different picture and we shall be able to examine ways and means of dealing, again in a realistic way, with our unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often been asked to break down the figure of unemployed registering <Col N="617" /> at our exchanges, the number of male adults able for work, the number of female adults and the number of juveniles male and female.  I find it very difficult to get a clear picture in regard to all.  I am not speaking from mere guesswork.  I have close knowledge of this matter in recent years since the Government enabled the Dublin Corporation to take on men who were on outdoor assistance, on what are called public relief schemes. We have been able to find out to a certain extent the numbers and the types of persons suitable for the class of work which we engage in and which is available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Budget, I remember on two specific occasions, on the introduction of a Budget by Fianna Fáil Government, where we were abused and criticised because the Budgets were severe.  They were called hair-shirt Budgets.  Today we are discussing a Budget which is reasonable and which is admitted everywhere to be a good one and one which in every aspect brought reliefs and we are again criticised.  It is suggested that it is not based on realism; that it is an election Budget.</P>
    <P>In fact, we lost two general elections because we were truthful with regard to the situation and because in the interests of the country and the people, when we saw danger, our Minister for Finance in those days and the Government faced up to it and brought in Budgets which imposed great hardships on the community at large in order that in time to come we could look to a better situation ahead.</P>
    <P>We have got to balance our views between these attitudes of behaviour. When the Fianna Fáil Government saw there was danger, they imposed restrictions and in a sense, heavy taxation in order to try to balance the situation. Now, what have we got?  We have a good Government with a substantial backing in this House so that they can carry out their policy.  They do not have to bargain with anybody else.  They do not have to fear that in going on a certain line and in a certain direction, they may not be able to carry on.  After two years of office, the country is in quite a different condition from what it was when they took over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> Nobody will deny that there has been re-established complete and full confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government and, as a result of that, in the welfare of the country.  Nobody will deny that there is an upward trend in everything and that not only is there confidence among the people at home, but there is confidence now in this nation and in its people among people in various parts of the world.  You cannot transform a country in 24 hours.  It cannot be done in a year or two but it is quite obvious that there is a transformation going on.  It is recognisable and as year follows year the speed at which the improvement takes place will increase in momentum.</P>
    <P>What do Fine Gael spokesmen say? They cannot appreciate what has been done in this Budget.  For a long time before the Budget was announced, there were questions in the House. There were meetings outside and there were petitions that the Government should do something for the old age pensioner.  The maximum that was thought to be possible in the minds of all our opponents was that in the Budget it might be possible to force the Government to give an extra 1/- or, perhaps, 1/6d. to the old age pensioners.  The fact that the Minister was able to divide the benefits in a way that allowed him to give 2/6d. to the old age pensioners just stunned our critics.  They could not believe it.  In addition they cannot understand how it was possible to administer the past year and to make provision for the coming one by giving additional benefits all around.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch, when referring to the Minister's Budget statement, put his fingers on the pages and talked about the Minister having devoted five and a half lines&mdash;I think that is what he said &mdash;to agriculture, the country's most important industry.  The Deputy did not think it worth his while to admit that it was not necessary to give more than talk to agriculture because, only yesterday, the Minister indicated in answer to a question that State aid to agriculture under various heads amounted to something between £19,000,000 and £20,000,000 per annum.  These are things that are much <Col N="619" /> better than words.  I am not capable of speaking on behalf of agriculture but I do feel that agriculture to-day is also benefiting by good Government and by having a good Minister in charge.</P>
    <P>I do not think that our opponents appreciate the thought behind items in the Budget and the consequences which flow from decisions when they are implemented.  It may seem very niggardly and very small that the Minister has increased the allowances to charitable organisations.  In order that their functions might be free of tax, their expenses could not exceed 50 per cent of the total, but that is now raised to 60 per cent.  What does it mean? It does not mean very much as far as State finances are concerned but it means a great deal in employment.  It means that these functions will now be held to a greater extent and, as a result, employment will be given.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the variety of entertainments tax remissions.  The bulk amounts that will be lost by revenue will not be very significant but they will result in increased employment because of the continued existence of this class trade, commerce, or whatever you like to call it.  If it improves it means additional employment but, of course, this is lost sight of also.  I should like to have heard criticisms, item by item, of the things that were done, the remissions in direct taxation and the benefits given to industrial development.  All these things will bring benefits to the individuals who will become employed, and to the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the opponents of Fianna Fáil can face this Budget.  Their behaviour in this House, and their absence from the House throughout almost the whole discussion, shows how lacking in anxiety they are to get in and punch holes in the Budget itself.</P>

It is a wonderful thing to see that at last in this country we have been able to bring about the use of our people's money on a short-term loan basis.  In every possible way there has been confirmation of confidence in this Government.  As I say, this coming financial year will show further improvement.  There may be two more Budgets before we are faced with a general election.  When the second of these comes, I am inclined to believe it will be so good that the Deputies opposite will indeed say it is in fact an election budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I thought the Deputy meant speakers.  This is the Minister's third Budget.  Presenting it, he said that the Budget had balanced.  Deputy Sweetman in his observations referred to that contention and showed conclusively that the Minister's claim to have balanced the present Budget was not a proper one to make.  Not only did the Minister say the Budget balanced, but he said it showed a small surplus in contrast with the deficit of roughly £6 million incurred in 1956-57 and 1957-58. Deputy Sweetman pointed out that judging the present Budget on the same basis as those Budgets, it could be shown that the present Budget ended with a deficit of a little over £4 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the present Budget has been balanced, but we are prompted to ask the question: how was that Budget supposedly balanced? For the Minister to say that it finished on a level figure is very misleading.  We must remember that there was certain juggling and manipulation of figures by the Minister.  I notice that manipulation took place in duplicate.  Not only did he use the levies to meet current expenditure but he transferred certain moneys from the current expenditure programme to capital purposes, and said he would borrow a certain amount.  In that way, he has to a certain degree presented a balanced Budget for the current financial year. It is easy to balance Budgets by using that device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reliefs provided in this Budget are being financed through the medium of over-estimation.  That is a very singular device for providing reliefs. In this connection, it is interesting to contrast our position&mdash;in proportion, of course&mdash;with that obtaining in Great Britain; the reliefs given in the British Budget were given as a result of a surplus. That is the proper way in which to provide reliefs; reliefs should be given through the medium of profits <Col N="625" /> made, so to speak.  We cannot, of course, compare this country with a very rich country like Britain and I merely make the point to confute in some degree the claim made by the Minister that he was presenting a good Budget and one which was providing certain reliefs.</P>
    <P>He over-estimated to the tune of £2,500,000.  It is very doubtful if he will not have to come to this House before the end of the current year and ask the House to give him leave to find that £2,500,000&mdash;and maybe more&mdash; in the form of Supplementary Estimates. The record of this House in relation to Supplementary Estimates is an unenviable one.  It is certainly not a good one.  As a rule, governments find it impossible to finance the various projects they initiate from year to year and they have to come again to raise more money at the eleventh hour.</P>
    <P>I should describe this Budget as a Budget of presumption.  The Minister is presuming that he will spend £2,500,000 less than the total estimated. It is certainly not a Budget of assumption, for assumption means that one bases one's prognostications on events which have already taken place. Presumption, on the other hand, relates to prophecies or expectations of what may happen in the future.  The Minister shows no surplus in the current Budget, despite all his protestations, and he cannot therefore lay claim to having put his financial house in order.  He has shown a fictitious surplus.  I think the amount is round about £100,000.  That has been arrived at by juggling with and manipulating the figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred yesterday to the National Debt.  At page 5 of his Budget Statement, he said that the increase in the public debt this year was £15,000,000.  On page 6, he said that a sum of £9,000,000 was effectively applied to the reduction of the public debt.  I should like him to reconcile those two statements when he is replying. He has quite rightly pointed out the importance of reducing the incidence of national debt.  Admittedly, such debt is an almost insurmountable obstacle to material progress.  Our basic financial position is falsified if we put on the long finger the settling <Col N="626" /> of our accounts.  A day will come when eventually we will find that a large proportion of our current expenditure must be applied towards reducing our National Debt, towards the redemption of borrowings we have made.  National debt is one of the greatest obstacles towards reducing indirect taxation. From our experience in local authorities, we know that these borrowings must be financed in the form of loan charges every year.  Loan charges must be met out of the moneys collected by way of taxation.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the current year the amount of national indebtedness is something in the region of £20,000,000. I do not know whether I am right or wrong in that figure, but I certainly read it somewhere.  Does that include the indebtedness of local authorities as well?  Is the figure an inclusive one?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred yesterday to the various Government services and he made some very pertinent remarks, remarks with which I agree.  It is axiomatic that there can be no public service without the personnel to administer and provide such a service. The Minister gave some very illuminating figures in relation to the amount spent on the various staffs in Government Departments and elsewhere: the Civil Service costs £17,000,000 in salaries; the Defence Force £3.3 millions; the Garda Síochána £3.6 millions; the teachers over £10,000,000.  The total is £34.2 millions.  Last year, the Minister in his Budget Statement said he would do all he could to economise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years past, organisations and members of the public have sought to have established in this country a helicopter service for relief and rescue and other types of work.  On numerous occasions in the House, Deputies have pleaded with the Government to establish such a service.  Deputies from all sides have joined in and forgotten Party politics in the hope that their united efforts would be sufficient to force the Government <Col N="627" /> in power to accede to a most reasonable request.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to give many examples of the excellent work done by helicopters in other countries in rescue and relief and fishery protection.  I have asked a number of questions here over the past two or three years, in the hope that by constantly urging the Ministers concerned, at some stage there would be a decision to purchase helicopters. To-day I repeated the question I have already asked on a number of occasions and, whatever about replies received in the past, to-day's reply will undobtedly shock and disappoint those who had hoped that by now we could afford a helicopter service, for use particularly along the west coast.  The reply given by the Par. Sec. to-day was that the provision of helicopters is kept under review by his Department and other Departments concerned, but he could give no indication of an early decision to provide helicopters.  That is the kernel of his reply.</P>
      <P>The most important and significant thing about the reply, I think, is that he has sought, in the course of it, to suggest that it would take at least six helicopters to ensure that as far as possible a helicopter would be available within a reasonable time on the occasion of any disaster in the vicinity of our coastline.  He has sought to suggest two points by that statement: one, that the sole use of the helicopter would be for rescue work along the coast; and two, that it would take&mdash;in order to achieve any success in that field&mdash;at least six helicopters.  I say that the Par. Sec. and his advisers are deliberately trying to mislead the general public on this very important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that a committee examined the question of using helicopters generally, and I use the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; to include their use for rescue work on the coastline and as an ambulance service to help to bring urgent cases from the islands off the coast to hospital, to help, for instance, to bring maternity cases from outlying islands to hospital on the mainland <Col N="628" /> rather than have expectant mothers undergoing that horrifying and, at times, terrifying journey by lifeboat as they have had to do for years back. That is a use to which helicopters could be put but in regard to which the Minister made no reply.  He did not even acknowledge it in his reply to my question, but he sought to suggest that the sole purpose of helicopters, so far as the question was concerned, was to save peoples' lives in the case of disaster at sea.</P>
    <P>I think the Par. Sec. showed contempt for the members of the House by giving such a reply.  I made it quite clear in the wording of the question that the usefulness of helicopters could extend to fisheries, that a helicopter or two, or three, could be of inestimable value to our fishery protection craft in spotting foreign fleets and foreign vessels when, or if, they were likely to break the three mile limit.  It is admitted that helicopters would be of tremendous advantage for such a purpose.  It is admitted that they are a most useful means of carrying out hydrographic surveys and ordnance surveys and both are an essential type of work that could be undertaken here and should have been undertaken before this.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the uses to which helicopters can be put and when those points were included in the question to-day, the Par. Sec. deliberately ignored them and concentrated on suggesting that I wanted a helicopter service established just for rescue work along the coast.  Let us deal with that alone, if the Par. Sec. wants that. Other Deputies raised the question of a helicopter service for that specific purpose and early in 1957, strong pressure was brought to bear in this House to have a helicopter service established on the west coast.  Some Deputies wanted it in Donegal to serve the entire west coast from Donegal to Kerry down to Cork.  The Government refused to establish the helicopter service.</P>
    <P>We all remember that in October of that year, 1957, the country was stunned to hear of the tragedy off the west coast, the terrible tragedy in Clew Bay where five people lost their lives. These people left Clare Island on Tuesday <Col N="629" /> in a currach and set out for the Mayo mainland which they never reached.  A search was undertaken for those people by the Kilronan lifeboat on Wednesday.  On Thursday, two days after they left the island, Baldonnel sent down a plane to search along the coastline.  That plane was not there 40 minutes searching along the coastline.  It could not do anything because conditions were too bad for them to stay longer.  It is the considered opinion of people who know the situation along the west coast that at least two of the unfortunate people who were lost would have been saved if a helicopter service had been based on the west coast.  That is the general impression of people who know.</P>
    <P>If it is suggested at this stage that we must depend for rescue work of that nature on the helicopter service based in Eglinton station in Derry, I believe it is wrong to take that view. We must thank the British authorities for their co-operation and assistance every time it has been sought for rescue and relief work on the west coast.  Every time a call was made on the British helicopter station in Eglinton, they responded generously with help in rescue and relief work right down along the coast.  It is beyond denial that by their early intervention and help they have saved numerous lives during the past five or six years.</P>
    <P>It would appear, therefore, that, up to the moment, we have been depending on a helicopter service based on Derry to help us in rescue and relief work right down the coast as far as Cork.  That is deplorable, especially in a country like this which claims to have sovereignty and claims to be one of the leading influences in the world, so far as independence is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is one instance where it is quite possible lives could have been saved.  Some of the Minister's experts may now say that that could not happen.  That is only their view as against the views of people who are on the spot and living along the coast line.  I challenge contradiction of that.</P>
    <P>Let us take the question of the relief work.  I quote now from a cutting from the <i>Irish Press</i> headed: <Col N="630" />&ldquo;Lighthouse Keepers Stormbound off Mayo.&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A bid to relieve the Eagle Rock Lighthouse, 14 miles off the Mayo Coast, failed yesterday when mountainous seas prevented the relief boat, <i>St. Mary,</i> in Scotchtown harbour from going to the aid of the three keepers who are overdue relief... Rough seas during the last three weeks have made relief impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have another cutting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 11th December, 1926, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tory Island (population 300) still had no mail yesterday.  Because of heavy seas it is more than three weeks since the mail boat&mdash;which usually makes three sailings a week &mdash;has been able to reach the island.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were 300 people on that island for three weeks in such conditions.</P>
    <P>I could go on instancing such cases all round the coast, so far as rescue and relief work are concerned, and yet the Government say the cost is too high.  The cost is the key to the whole question&mdash;the cost is too much.  When the question of cost arises, we should examine our consciences because this country has always been anxious for what is known as prestige.  For the purpose of prestige, we are prepared to spend, and have spent, over £1 million for three jet aircraft and the servicing of them.  We were told that one of the reasons for the purchase of these jets was to ensure that Irish pilots would be trained in the flying of these planes and that the pilots might, at a later stage, be employed in civil aviation, perhaps in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I think we could buy three suitable helicopters for less than £100,000 and those three helicopters would be of inestimable value for the purposes I have mentioned.  Remember, the helicopter is the first aircraft that has ever saved more lives than it has taken, and we should be privileged to have these helicopters rather than the jet planes in Baldonnel whose aim is the taking of life.</P>
    <P>I should like the Par. Sec. to clarify the following matter which needs <Col N="631" /> clarification.  In answer to my question, he said that it would take six helicopters to do the work to which he referred in the earlier part of the answer.  In reply to a supplementary question, he said that was the recommendation of a committee which had examined the matter. That committee, I presume, was composed of experts from the various Departments concerned.  I should like him to explain how it is that when the Minister for Defence was asked about this very problem on 27th March, 1958, he stated in the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The range of these craft is extremely limited and one helicopter would be absolutely no use.  It would be purely a matter of coincidence if it happened to be in the right spot at the right time.</P>
    <P>&mdash;This is the important part&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the very minimum that would be of any practical use would be three.</P>

      <P>Col. 1209, vol. 166, of the Official Report.  The Minister had been queried by me six months prior to that and he was queried by Deputy Blowick a week before that.  He was not replying for the Department of Defence alone but on behalf of every other Department which had considered this problem. In reply to the question, he mentioned rescue services along the coast, and his argument was that it would take three helicopters to do the work.  The reason I asked in my question: if the Minister would consider purchasing two such aircraft was that I felt that three were necessary.  Originally, I thought one would be useful but I came around to the Government's view that one would not be sufficient and so I asked them to purchase two and the answer I got was the astounding revelation that six would be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is advising the Department? What kind of experts sit down and advise the Minister for Defence that it will take three aircraft and who are <Col N="632" /> the experts who advise the Par. Sec. to-day that it will take six?  Does not that show that no thought whatever has been given to this problem for the past 12 months, and that the Par. Sec. and the Government have nothing but contempt for Deputies who dare to ask questions on such problems, when they are not even prepared to give consideration to them?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Par. Sec. to reconsider this matter, and if he suggests that it would cost too much, I would ask him to consult with his Minister for Finance who told us yesterday and to-day that he is prepared to hand back the sum of £25,000 to dance-hall proprietors for the rock-'n'-roll merchants.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I would prefer the Par. Sec. at this stage to say whether he is prepared to reconsider the position in view of the benefits that would be conferred on the public generally and particularly on the people in the West of Ireland.  If three helicopters, were purchased they could be based at Limerick or anywhere that was thought suitable.  I do not mind where they are placed.  My argument is not on the basis of selecting any particular locality.  Let the experts decide about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Par. Sec. to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan seems to take umbrage at the fact that he was told today by me that the minimum number of helicopters required for any operation was six.  He seems to think that because some time previously the Minister for Defence said the very minimum should be three, there is some conflict of opinion between the various Departments as to what exactly would be required for a helicopter service to be of use.</P>
      <P>What use should be made of a helicopter service is all a matter of opinion.  When one is answering a question of this kind one has to decide in one's own mind what exactly the service can be used for.  If a service were to be provided to meet all the eventualities enumerated by the Deputy in his speech, it would take a large number of helicopters to be of effective use, if they would be of any effective use. Deputy McQuillan referred to the taking of maternity cases off the islands around our coasts.  Previously he asked questions in regard to the relief of storm-bound islands.  He also had in mind apparently the use of helicopters for commercial and other purposes. The Minister for Defence, of course, was replying to a specific question in regard to the use of helicopters in a military sense and in his reply broadened out to refer to their use in a general way.</P>
      <P>A committee of representatives of various Departments have made certain recommendations and have advised the Minister that six helicopters would be required as a bare minimum.  You would also have to provide maintenance for the helicopters and a staff of persons to provide the service.  Then it would be problematical whether or not all these helicopters could be used in the type of sea rescue work that would arise around our coasts in bad weather. Deputy McQuillan mentioned their use in the event of an island being stormbound for a certain length of time, but if there were very high winds on that occasion a helicopter might not be of any use.</P>

      <P>We are as up-to-date as the Deputy.  I do not purport to have technical knowledge on the use of helicopters but every Minister charged with responsibility to this House and to the country must take the advice of technical persons in relation to the provision of a service such as this or any other service that the State provides.  He cannot be influenced by suggestions made by persons who may not have the necessary knowledge to enable him to come to a proper decision on such questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak whether he interrupts or not.  Deputy McQuillan seems to think this question is still not being considered.  It is being considered and we shall not have to go to the trouble of having the question reconsidered.  It has been considered and will continue to be considered until a satisfactory solution has been found.  There are other persons interested in the provision of a helicopter service in this country and if their proposals can be fitted in to suit the requirements of the State the matter will be given active consideration, and the State will be prepared, I would say, to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy raised any other question which calls for a reply from me.  We know the provision of two helicopters would be absolutely useless.  I have said six would be essential for a minimum operation and, if we were to consider the provision of a full-scale service such as that advocated by Deputy McQuillan, it would take a good deal more money and it would have to be provided out of sources other than those suggested by the Deputy in his speech.</P>
