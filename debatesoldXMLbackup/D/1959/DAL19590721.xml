      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has investigated the possibility of entering into bilateral trade agreements with the member-countries of the Common Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement on external trade policies which I made in this House on he 3rd June, 1959, in the course of my reply to the debate on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce (Vol. 175, columns 941-2).</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade agreements are already in operation between this country and two of the member-countries of the European Economic Community, namely, Germany and Italy.  We have had a trade agreement, negotiated annually, with France, but that agreement expired on the 31st March last and, as I mentioned here in the course of the speech to which I have referred, negotiations which took place with representatives of the French Government failed to provide an acceptable basis for a new agreement.</P>
      <P>We have also an agreement with Belgium for the supply of cattle for serum purposes.  This, however, is an agreement designed to assist in the control of disease rather than a trade agreement in the ordinary sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the future, it is the policy of the Government to negotiate trade <Col N="1476" /> agreements with member countries of the European Economic Community, and with other countries, when opportunity offers and where it is considered that such agreements would serve the essential interests of this country by assisting the expansion of our total agricultural and industrial exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the statement of the Tánaiste of the 12th instant referring to past activities of the President; and, whether in order to avoid controversy, he will take the steps necessary to ensure that references to the President in a political context by members of the Government are not made in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the statement by the Tánaiste referred to in the Deputy's Question.</P>
      <P>The remarks reported as having been made by the Tánaiste concerning the President relate to events which occurred many years ago and which were of such a nature that they could not give rise to political controversy now.  The Deputy may be assured that no statement will be made by any member of the Government that would be inappropriate in relation to the Constitutional position of the office of President or would, in any way, tend to impair the respect which is due to the holder of that office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree, at the same time, that if references are made to the President by members of the Government Party, even about events that occurred a long time ago, that does allow the Opposition to have the same liberty and, in these circumstances, surely it is not unlikely that political controversy would arise on this question, which would be most undersirable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly by the Minister for External Affairs.  Would the Taoiseach specifically obtain from anybody in the area the speech made by the Minister for External Affairs the other day in, I think, Killaloe&mdash; East Clare&mdash;when, most improperly, he said the President would wish a certain candidate returned in this by-election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The privillege of questioning Ministers about their speeches is a one way affair.  May I reply to Deputy Dr. Browne?  It is obviously a matter for individual judgment.  Clearly, we cannot contemplate a situation where no reference at all can be made to the history of this country in the past 40 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference in the speech to which the question relates dealt with an action by Mr. de Valera when he was President of the League of Nations.</P>

      <P>Statements which the mass of the people listening to the Minister understood him to make.  In those circumstances, does the Taoiseach appreciate that members of the Opposition will be driven, in the discharge of their public duty, to rebut what the mass of the people have understood a member of the Government to have said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say quite definitely that I did not bespeak votes for the Fianna Fáil candidate on the grounds that the President wanted him returned.  That is quite untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the admission by the Minister for External Affairs that he did mention the President, will the Taoiseach not appreciate that, once the President's name is brought into a by-election meeting, inevitably it is going to mean that he is going to become a political football?  We, of course, took the view immediately after the last President was elected that, when he was elected, he was President and that ended politics in the matter.  I take it that should be the case now. Otherwise, if members of the Government are going to mention him at election meetings, we shall do the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to the statement by the Tánaiste on the 12th instant that the Government were asking the Irish people in this election to stand behind the Irish Government which was trying to find some way of avoiding the war which was so imminent; what information is at the disposal of the Government to justify the statement that war is imminent; and what steps have been, or are to be taken, by the Government to try to protect the people to the extent that this is possible from the consequences of such war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the statement by the Tánaiste referred to in the Deputy's Question.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Tánaiste was alluding to the dangers of the existing international situation&mdash;dangers which must be obvious to the Deputy, as they are to everybody else.  It is the policy of the Government, in the domain of external relations, to make whatever contribution may be in our power towards the preservation of peace.  At the same time, the situation is kept under constant review, and the Ministers more particularly concerned, including the Minister for Defence in respect of Civil Defence measures, are making such preparations as are practicable, in our circumstances, to reduce the risks that would be involved for the people of this country if war should in fact occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase used by the Tánaiste was &ldquo;that war was so imminent,&rdquo; I ask the Taoiseach would it not be reasonable to assume that any responsible Government which has reason to believe that war was imminent would have taken certain <Col N="1480" /> obvious steps such as the recall of military reserves, the arrangement of civilian supplies, not to mention food for the civilian population, arrangements for casualties and so on? Has any one of these steps been taken by the Government in view of the suggestion that war was imminent?</P>

      <P>I assume that the Question refers to capital expenditure on hospital building projects and not to payments in respect of the revenue deficits of voluntary hospitals and miscellaneous payments such as those made in respect of the expenses of the Hospitals Commission, grants to the Medical Research Council, minor expenditure on necessary repairs and provision of <Col N="1482" /> items of essential equipment in the case of voluntary hospitals, etc.</P>
      <P>At the 1st July, 1959, the Hospitals Trust Fund was committed to the payment of grants totalling about £1,600,000 in respect of hospital building works still in progress or completed but not fully paid for.</P>
      <P>It is now estimated that grant payments totalling about £9 million would be required to meet the liabilities that would arise if certain other projects involving capital expenditure included in the Hospital Building Programme, in respect of which definite undertakings were given to the promoters prior to 1st April, 1957, were to be allowed to proceed.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that grants totalling about £930,000 will be made in the present financial year on capital projects, including payments in respect of works in progress and schemes which have been completed but have not yet been fully paid for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the estimated number of mentally handicapped children in the State in need of special institutional treatment, and (b) the total number at present in special institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult to estimate with any accuracy the numbers of mentally handicapped children needing special institutional treatment.  It has, however, been estimated that, on the basis of studies carried out elsewhere, there may be about 7,000 mentally handicapped persons of <i>all ages</i> who would require institutional care and training. It is not possible on present information to indicate how many of these would be children.</P>
      <P>On 31st December, 1958, the latest date for which figures are available, they were 2,394 mentally handicapped persons being maintained in special institutions.  Of this number, 1,750 were under 20 years of age.  Arrangements are in train which will add an additional 300 to 360 places to the number at present available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the <Col N="1483" /> provision of premises is only one facet of the problem.  The onerous and exacting nature of the work calls for a special type of vocation and the right kind of management is also of considerable importance.  When, therefore, a group with wide experience of the work elsewhere, vouched for as being suitable by a responsible authority, expressed its willingness to utilise existing available premises to open a home for upwards of 200 children, I welcomed the offer; but it would appear that unexpected difficulties will prevent this happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>While persons who come to this country for permanent residence are chargeable to Irish Income Tax on their total income from all sources, nevertheless the charge to Irish tax, so far as the income arises from sources in the United States, is modified by the provisions of the Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the Government and the United States Government.  Each individual case would of course require to be studied on its facts in relation to the provisions of the Convention but it may be broadly stated that, under these provisions, certain categories of income such as interest and copyright royalties are, subject to conditions, chargeable only in the country where the recipient resides.  It is a condition that exemption from United States tax is not allowable if the Irish resident is a citizen of the United States.</P>
      <P>It is provided further by Article X of the Convention that any salary, wage or pension paid by the United States Government in respect of services rendered by the pensioner to the United States in the discharge of governmental functions shall, if he is a citizen of the United States, be exempt from Irish tax.  It is to be noted that a citizen of Ireland does not qualify for the exemption unless he is at the same time a United States citizen.  Pensions payable by the United States Government to retired Federal personnel (civil servants, members of the army, navy, etc.) are regarded as within the exemption from Irish tax under Article X if the condition as to citizenship is fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> Special army allowance pensions and disability (wounds, etc.) pensions payable to retired members of the United States armed forces qualify for the exemption from Irish tax under Article X unless the pensioner is not a United States citizen.  Pensioners of this kind returning to Ireland from the United States would for the most part be United States citizen.  Apart, however, from the Convention and without regard to citizenship a disability pension in respect of services with the United States armed forces would be exempted from Irish tax if it were granted in respect of what is or what may be regarded as service-connected disability.</P>
    <P>All other United States pensions (e.g., pensions payable by local authorities, companies, etc.) purchased life annuities derived from sources in the United States, and United States social security pensions are chargeable to Irish tax.  By virtue of Article XII a resident of Ireland who is not a United States citizen may secure exemption from the tax of the United States in relation to such pensions or annuities.</P>
    <P>It should be explained generally that where, under the provisions of the Convention, income from sources within the United States (including pensions) is chargeable to both Irish tax and United States tax, a credit in respect of United States tax paid on the income is allowable, under paragraph (2) of Article XIII of the Convention, against Irish tax payable on it.  Double taxation if it arises is in this way relieved.</P>

      <P>I have no functions in relation to demolition orders, which may be made by housing authorities only where they are satisfied that the dwelling houses concerned are unfit for human habitation, and incapable of being rendered so fit at reasonable expense.  The housing authority's decisions in these matters are subject to appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>There is adequate provision in existting law for distinguishing between dwellings of a temporary type, which may be used for summer lettings and others.  Powers for the regulation of temporary dwellings are available to sanitary authorities under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister state whether, if a building is accepted as being suitable purely for temporary use, as he has indicated, and the person who has been in such a building previously permantely moves out, does that disqualify the local authority from subsidy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit too complicated. I shall set out the details in a separate letter to the Minister. In this case is the Minister aware that the decision was to prevent summer usage and was, in fact, made because that was the only way in which the local authority felt they could get the subsidy from the Vote on the transfer of the house?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under that Act. There is another Act.  In the Sanitary Services Act the following definition is given:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A temporary dwelling is defined for the purposes of the Sanitary Services Act as (a) a tent, or (b) <Col N="1494" /> van or other conveyance (whether on wheels or not), or (c) shed, hut or similar structure or (d) a vessel on inland waters.</P>
    <P>As far as summer dwellings are concerned, there is no distinction in the law.  What serves for one serves for the other.  If the Deputy still wants to get information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely what the Minister has just said is in contradiction to what he said earlier, that the fact is that there is no difference and that if someone is living in a house suitable for summer usage and not suitable for permanent usage, the house must be demolished.  That seems cracked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I shall repeat what I said.  No legal distinction exists between a permanent dwelling and a temporary summer dwelling.</P>

      <P>The Tipperary South Riding County Council have drawn up a programme of major water supply schemes which they propose, in agreement with my Department, to implement in accordance with an order of priority determined by the Council.  The planning of the first two schemes of this programme has reached an advanced stage and when these are put in hands the others will be dealt with in rotation. There has been no avoidable delay but it will be appreciated that as most of the schemes in the programme are large-scale water supply schemes involving considerable preparatory works as well as the acquisition of land and water rights, it is not possible to secure the same rate of progress as with smaller and less complex schemes.</P>
      <P>The Council's programme of minor water supply schemes has been largely completed.</P>

Contract drawings have been approved and the specification and bill of quantities are now being prepared.  The necessary steps have also been taken by the county council for acquiring the additional water rights and reservoir site required for the scheme.</P>

      <P>I have been told that under this Vote I could raise the question of amplification in this House. From time to time I, and other Deputies, have had to cock our ears, otherwise we could not hear what was being said.  Only a few minutes ago, when the Minister for Finance was speaking, I could not hear him.  It is a practice for members of the Government and the Opposition to talk to one another across the floor of the House but what about us here behind? We are also entitled to hear what is going on.  Everything said in this House should be heard by every Member of this House.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with serious business. We are dealing with the making of laws and we all should have a say in what should be law and what should not be law.  At times I notice the gentlemen of the Press give up and stop writing when they cannot hear certain members of the House and there are Deputies in this House who cannot be heard.  I can be heard all right but I find it difficult to hear some others here.  I think the time has come when speeches in this House should be amplified in some way.  Microphones could be placed here and there in the House and when there is a complaint about a speaker not being heard that speaker could move closer to the microphone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in the gallery come here to hear what we have to say and they have the right to hear.  They say that sound moves up and perhaps the people in the gallery hear better than we do.  Some form of amplification is badly needed.  There is amplification now in practically every church and there is a microphone on every altar in Dublin.  Surely it would be no harm to have amplification in this House. <Col N="1504" /> Everything said here should be heard by every member of the House.</P>
    <P>I now want to raise another matter on this Vote, a matter which is a delicate one and one on which the average member will whisper but is afraid to talk about.  That is the question of allowances for members.  I do not care what people think of what I say but I am not in this House for what I get out of it.  I estimate that I had another £5 a week income before I was elected here.  From what I know no member of this House is making anything by being a member.  One of the reasons why so few Deputies are present in the House is that they are out attending to their private business because they feel that if they did not do that they would have to be going around looking for a loan.  That would be a bad thing for Deputies to do.</P>
    <P>I know that the public and certain sections of the Press are constantly referring to the tax free allowances of Deputies.  I am not suggesting here that our allowances should be increased but I do suggest that something should be done to make those Deputies having no other income, or very little other income, a little independent so that they will not have to run away from their constituents as was the case of a member who resigned from this House last year.  He resigned because he had no money for the last week of each month that he was a member of this House.  I saw a pawn ticket for a suit of clothes in that man's hand.  I know that there are wealthy members of the House but I still say that the whole question should be examined.  I read a reference some time ago in the life of James Connolly to this subject.  At that time legislation was being introduced in the House of Commons to provide allowances for members.</P>

I would prefer to be in the House if I had nothing in my pocket.  However, there are other members, people with jobs, jobs which they must surrender when they become members of the House.  If these people are to play their proper part in this House they should be made independent.  The allowances here are such that a man could not keep his family and attend to his duties at the same time.</P>

It may seem inappropriate to raise the question of heating at this time of the year but I should like the Minister to tell us whether arrangements have been made now to ensure that native fuel is used in heating both Houses of the Oireachtas in winter time rather than imported fuel, which has been used up to recently.  I understand that there was <Col N="1506" /> some difficulty with regard to the equipment, that alterations were necessary in order that native fuel could be used, but it is essential that whatever difficulties there are should be surmounted because, if this House does not set the example with regard to the use of native resources and raw materials, there is very little use in appealing to people in the country to use native resources.  The Dáil and Seanad should set the example.  I should like to know from the Minister now whether any progress has been made since the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas was discussed last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether legislation will be required to deal with the matter to which I wish to refer.  I do not think legislation would be needed.  I think it is recognised on all sides of an Assembly such as this that, in order to make Partiament function, there must be an effective Government and an effective Opposition but, if there is to be an effective Opposition, the complexity of legislation and government has now become so great that it is becoming virtually impossible for an Opposition to function without some kind of secretarial assistance. Anybody who has any experience of it knows that a Minister, of necessity, coming in here to defend any proposition or, indeed, to answer a Question, must be fortified with a considerable brief to which he can make reference. <Col N="1507" /> Anyone with experience knows that to carry on an intelligent discussion even on a simple Parliamentary Question, not to mention a motion or a Bill, considerable briefing is requisite from the Minister's point of view.</P>
      <P>Up to a certain point, an Opposition can carry on without any corresponding assistance but I think it is becoming more and more obvious, as those of us with some experience have found, that if the Opposition is to give truly effective service in the House, without requiring it to undertake altogether unreasonable burdens, some plan should be worked out whereby a part of the Oireachtas staff would constitute the secretariat of the official Opposition.</P>
      <P>I think our people, who have a tendency to criticise public expense, which, I suppose, is a healthy thing, often overlook the facilities which are available to legislators in other countries. It would not be reasonable for a country with our resources to emulate the example of the Congress of the United States of America, nor should we aspire to have available to us the same facilities as the members of Congress have, but it is to be borne in mind that every member of Congress, and that is everybody, every Senator and every Deputy in the House of Representatives, receives not only the Parliamentary allowance of $22,500 but he has attached to him a secretary, a not inconsiderable secretarial staff and a suite of offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is manifestly something far in excess of anything that would be required here but I do think the time has come seriously to consider the provision of what, for want of a better word, I shall describe as a skeleton Civil Service for the Opposition.  I recognise at once that to arrange this will not be altogether easy but I do not believe it would be impossible.  I would imagine that such persons as were mutually agreed on all sides of the House as being necessary, could be chosen by the Opposition they were intended to serve and be allowed to function as temporary civil servants and have their rates of remuneration equated with persons in corresponding <Col N="1508" /> rank in the permanent Civil Service. What would transpire when there was a change of Government, I cannot myself clearly foresee at this time but I do not believe that it would create insuperable difficulties.  I imagine personnel of that character could be incorporated into the permanent Civil Service on such occasion as the Opposition became the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too deeply into the detail of this but I think it is a suggestion that might with advantage be considered by all Parties in the House. In the ordinary course of affairs and in the ordinary healthy swing of the political pendulum, we are all likely to find ourselves from time to time on the Opposition or the Government benches and it ought to be our common interest in that we are all members of Parliament and in that we all believe in the Parliamentary system, seriously to consider a reform along the lines which I now suggest, not for the benefit of any particular Party which happens for the time being to be in the Opposition, but for the benefit of the better working of Parliament itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the fuel situation I would have preferred if that question were raised on the Board of Works Estimate.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to answer it though I think I can say that I have seen turf delivered.  I do not say that turf is solely used, but turf is delivered to the furnaces that keep this place warm.  I shall make inquiries about the matter to see what is the position.  Acoustics and ventilation would be matters for the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and I think that Committee, if it has not done so already, is about to consider the question of acoustics.  It could also consider the question of ventilation and, if that Committee recommends that any course should be taken, I am quite sure that there will not be any difficulty in implementing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question which the Deputy raised with regard to salaries and which you, a Cheann Comhairle, ruled out of order, all I have to say is that I agree with a great deal of what the Deputy said and, with regard to the <Col N="1509" /> secretariat for the Opposition, I see no objection to that in principle.  There may be some difficulty in working out the matter but if the Deputy, or the Party, would put up some proposition it would certainly receive very sympathetic consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to article 33 of the Constitution, which I shall read out to him:</P>
      <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The words I want to emphasise to the Minister are &ldquo;to audit all accounts of moneys administerd by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  The remaining subsections of that Article are not relevant to my argument and are merely declaratory of his tenure of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="1510" /> General is given special status under the Constitution, in consideration of his duty to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and, properly, that has created in the minds of all those familiar with his office the impression that his duties are, where he considers it necessary, to be critical of the Executive in their administration of money and to report to the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann any apprehensions that he may have, and any criticisms he has to make, so that they can be examined by that Committee and, if necessary, reported to Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, he is regarded as an absolutely independent person, charged with the responsibility of being critical where that is desirable.</P>
    <P>The tendency has grown up through legislation, from time to time as we have constituted in this House State-controlled bodies, to place upon the Comptroller and Auditor General the duty of auditing their accounts.  I want to suggest to the Minister for Finance that, in the light of the words of that Article of the Constitution, that is one course of action that we should not pursue because his function is to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas, but the moneys of State-controlled bodies are, by definition, not administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.  We take great pains to emphasise that they are not administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas by declaring, again and again, that no Minister can properly answer for the administration of the funds of a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that, instead of sanctioning the continued practice of naming the Comptroller and Auditor General as the appropriate auditor in legislation for semi-State bodies or, indeed, for any bodies other than the Exchequer, the Minister should object strenuously and give his approval only in the most exceptional cases.  Personally I cannot think of any case in which I would urge the Minister to give his approval to such a proposal because I think, on the whole, it would be better to stick strictly to <Col N="1511" /> the terms of the Article, and to shift audit responsibility in all other cases to chartered accountants who are obliged, under the Charter of their profession, to carry out certain duties before they are prepared to sign a certificate for publication with the accounts of any enterprise that they may be called upon to examine.</P>
    <P>In that way I think we avoid the very undesirable situation arising that every company which is not directly responsible to this House but which is, in fact, responsible to nobody else, can shelter under the umbrella of the certificate of the Comptroller and Auditor General who, as far as I know, has no permanent staff qualified to carry out commercial audits and who, in practice, has to call in consultants.  Yet, when the certificate comes to be published it is published as the certificate of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would much sooner see such bodies publishing the auditor's certificate that they have got from commercial auditors.  Then, if this House is, at any time, dissatisfied with the quality of the certificate tendered to it by the State company, or when the Minister on its behalf lays the annual report on the table of Dáil Éireann, one of the intelligent remedies that this House could prescribe would be that they would like a second firm of auditors to do these accounts so that there would be public concurrence between two firms of standing and, if necessary, that, on occasion, foreign auditors might be brought in where there was any reason to believe that circumstances rendered that course desirable.</P>
    <P>It is a common thing in Great Britain if a firm is large enough and has international associations, and it is a common thing in the United States of America in similar circumstances, to find the accounts certified by a firm of London auditors and a firm of New York auditors, and in the case of a New York firm, to have a firm of London auditors and a firm of American auditors signing the same balance sheet.  That necessity might never arise here but, in my judgment, it would be a very desirable thing that where you had commercial companies operating a <Col N="1512" /> semi-State monopoly they would be required to produce accounts annually in a form acceptable to commercial auditors, in the knowledge that such auditors would be fully equipped to query their accounts and insist on all disclosures customarily required in the course of commercial audits, appropriate to the kind of activity that such a body would be carrying on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question arises nearly every year on this Estimate. Although the Constitution lays it down that we must have the Auditor General to do what might be regarded as the accounts of Government Departments, it does not say he should stop there.  I believe that there was an Act passed which is still in operation, one of the Exchequer and Audits Departments Acts 1866-1921.  These place certain duties on the Comptroller and the Auditor General in relation to the trading accounts of State bodies.  I could not say in how far any Government Department is bound by these Acts but they do put certain duties on the Comptroller and Auditor General. Apart from that, as Deputies are aware, many Bills dealing with State companies when going through the Dáil actually specify that the audit will be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That, I take it, is put in by the Minister concerned because he wants to have the audit done in the same way as other State companies and somewhat on the lines of Government auditing generally so that there will be a certain conformity or likeness between the audits of the various companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the objections made by Deputy Dillon and I am sure he could argue that point just as well as he could argue that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be left where he is.  All I can say is that I certainly have an open mind on this matter and if the question of appointing the Comptroller and Auditor General to any new company arises we shall have it examined.  I should like to say that some of those who have the Comptroller and Auditor General are anxious to get a change for various reasons, not, indeed, that they have anything against the Comptroller and <Col N="1513" /> Auditor General, but they do not like the tie-up, as it were, or the apparent tie-up, with the Government.  For that reason, they would prefer to be released from that obligation of having the Comptroller and Auditor General and, in one case, I consented to that.  I do not know if there is to be a movement in that direction or not.  I can assure the Deputy I have an open mind and I would certainly consider sympathetically any application made to me for a change by any of those companies.</P>

First, I should like to suggest to the Minister that changes in the order of Estimates cause unnecessary inconvenience and give unnecessary trouble when one is trying to trace where the various Estimates are.  This year, for example, the Department of Agriculture moved from No. 27 to No. 49. It had been No. 27 for ages and I cannot see what the point of the <Col N="1514" /> change was or why it was introduced.</P>
      <P>I think it is also time that rates of pay were set out on the proper, modern scales and not on the old basis.  The rates, I know, are set out in the sub-heads to the various individual Estimates but the rates that are set out in the preface in Page IX in the beginning, are the old rates which have been varied down the years by each different award.  The same pattern is followed on Page X and I think also the standardisation in the amendments is set out on page VII.  Would it not be better that the actual amalgamations that there are of the various pay orders would be published not merely as they are shown to have been made through the years, but that they would be actually published at the rates which are applicable on pages IX and X?</P>
      <P>I have always wondered why the sub-heads were set out as they are. I have the greatest difficulty in making sure that I am comparing like with like and I have always forgotten to ask why.  If the Minister looks at any sub-head of any Estimate he will see that the number of civil servants in the Department or in the section of the Department is set out and, in the first column, it is the number that were there in the preceding year; in the second column it is the number that is there in the current year.  But then, when we go over to the cost of those, on the right hand side of the particular page we find that the order is reversed and in consequence of that very frequently when people try to compare cost with cost, confusion arises. I cannot see what was the reason for switching the columns around.  I suppose it has probably come down from some hallowed Treasury minute of many years ago.</P>
      <P>It seems to me it would be much easier to have the same basis for both and I think it would be worth considering changing this in the future. The Volume of Estimates has become so complicated now that anything that can be done to simplify reference to it is worth doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to make any general observations on the Minister's Department except in regard to the subject that was touched on the other day in the discussion on the Ministers <Col N="1515" /> and Secretaries Bill.  The Minister for Finance is the Minister most concerned with State companies partly because, in relation to some of them, he has the specific statutory power of appointing directors and partly because he, by reason of his shareholding, elects the directors otherwise.  I want to put it to the Minister that very different considerations should apply in regard to existing directors and new directors. Unless there is a most specific reason which the Minister is prepared to justify in this House I think it is not desirable that when a director's term, the term for which he was originally elected on appointment, comes to an end he should not be reappointed.</P>
    <P>The method that has been adopted by the Minister during the current year of not reappointing certain directors of certain concerns, merely because they happen to have been originally appointed by another Government, does not add to his credit and certainly will not inure to the efficiency of the service of the boards of these companies.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that we shall not be able to get people of the calibre and standard that everybody would wish to act as directors of State companies if they are to be removed for no other reason whatever except that the Minister feels they were appointed by another Government and therefore he should remove them.  We had considerable public discussion about that last year in relation to the Chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The Chairman, who was the first President of Macra na Feirme, was removed simply and solely because the Minister wanted to put in a political pal of his own.  We had another case in relation to the Sugar Company where a place was found in that way for an ex-Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I am making no comment about him personally at all. The first Chairman of the Young Farmers was removed and not reappointed to make way for that new appointee.</P>
    <P>I had frankly hoped that that system was changed when two appointments to the Industrial Credit Company <Col N="1516" /> were made in the Spring of this year and in respect of which everybody would agree they were excellent appointments. But I was appalled to discover recently in relation to another State company that a man who, in the particular sector of the economy in which that State company operates, is justly recognised as being in the forefront, was not reappointed by the Minister. He is a man who has had not merely success in his own business in that line of country but who, by his achievements, has brought very great honour and profit to the country.</P>
    <P>When his term of office came to an end in the ordinary way he did not even get from the Minister the ordinary civil letter of thanks for his service that anybody would be entitled to receive. He did not even receive from the Minister a notification that the Minister was sorry he could not reappoint him. The secretary of the company concerned received from an official in the Department of Finance merely a formal notification that at the meeting Mr. So-and-So was to be appointed a director; and the director who had acted for three years, and given of his time and trouble to a manner and a degree that would be many thousand times the director's fee in that concern, was not even told by the Minister for Finance or by anyone on his behalf that he was not to be reappointed in the ordinary manner.  I think that was discourtesy to a shocking degree and I think&mdash;I have no complaint whatever about the person appointed subsequently&mdash;it is a practice that will mean we shall not get for our State-sponsored companies the type of man we want if they are to continue to operate in any sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will turn back the files and see that, when I was there, I reappointed many people who, I knew when doing so, were Fianna Fáil.  They had been appointed by previous Governments but I thought they were competent for their jobs and reappointed them as a matter of principle.  There can be no question whatever&mdash;none&mdash;of the competency of the man I had in mind.  He is outstandingly competent but merely because <Col N="1517" /> he was appointed by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, and myself, he has been thrown overboard by the present Minister for Finance.  That will not make for continuity in policy; it will not make for the prestige of the company concerned and it certainly will not make for the prestige of the Government or of the House.</P>

      <P>When we passed the Vote for the President's Establishment I stood up and I was told I was late but that I could say what I wanted to say on this Vote.  I should like to protest formally against the amount of money spent on the President's Establishment.  It is over £50,000 and is equal to what half the members of this House receive in allowances.  That is a vast amount of money for a poor country to spend on what is a ceremonial office, the work of which could be done, I am sure, by the Chief Justice or some other person.  I object to it on other grounds.  This large sum is to support a person who is merely the nominee of one or two groups.  If the money has to be spent, it should be spent in some way from which the country would benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it makes much difference.  The Deputy pointed out that the number of officers is given on one side for 1958-59 and then 1959-60, and the cost is reversed on the other side.  That is done for comparison purposes.  It is the same system as that adopted in balance sheets.  The comparison is on the outside in each case.</P>
      <P>With regard to consolidated pay, the staff asked recently for an up-to-date version of the scales.  That is being considered at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman raised a point with regard to the appointment of directors.  As far as changing directors goes, it is done by both sides.  It appears to be the prerogative of the Minister to appoint the best director, from his point of view.  Sometimes he leaves the man who is in the post, irrespective of politics; sometimes he does not.  I am sure any Minister could make a defence if he were challenged about any change.  I do not think we need discuss the matter any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point in relation to sub-head B.  I <Col N="1525" /> raised it on the Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and I was told that they act only as agents for the Minister for Finance. I refer to the Savings Committee and to the fact that the record over the past 18 months in regard to savings is very, very far from being a happy one. The figures published by the Minister show that there was a drop of approximately 25 per cent. in 1958 compared with 1957.  They were down from £60,000,000 to about £45,000,000.</P>
      <P>When we come to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs we find the drop in relation to small savings is particularly noticeable and it is in relation to small savings that the Savings Committee does its most valuable work.  Is the impression that I get correct?  That impression is that the Minister is trying to kill, by inaction, the Savings Committee, that he does not want the committee to go on with the job for which it was appointed and that it is being allowed more or less to drift out of operation. I should like to see, on the contrary, an energetic savings drive but in this Estimate the amount has been almost halved of the small expenses in relation to the Savings Committee.  If that is so, it must mean the Minister does not intend the Savings Committee to undertake any drive for savings during the current year and that it is merely a trifling service here.  That is a mistake and it is a retrograde policy, going back on the principle that was adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like the Deputy to come to the conclusion that I am in any way trying to kill this Committee.  I have done everything I could to encourage the Committee to go on with the very good work they were doing.  The Deputy will be aware that there were some changes made due to resignations.  They were not made by me.  We had to replace certain people.  I remember one of them saying to me: &ldquo;It is very difficult to carry on after a year because your ideas run out and you are full of frustration when you cannot think of anything else.&rdquo;  I have great sympathy for these people.  They have worked <Col N="1526" /> very hard and have achieved very good results.  The first five months this year are very encouraging.  We have got more money in from the two sources of the savings bank and savings certificates for the first five months this year than in 1957 or 1958. 1958 was a bad year generally for savings.  We know from the returns that farmers' incomes were very much down in 1958.  I would be very sorry indeed that anyone should get the idea that I had not the greatest admiration for their work or was not prepared to give them every encouragement.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £72,200 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for payment of Increases in certain Pensions, etc., in respect of public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to cover the Budget provision for the increase of pensions to State pensioners.  The cost of that provision in a full year would be £127,000.  It is payable this year from the 1st August and consequently the cost is £72,200. The factors which govern the grant of <Col N="1529" /> this increased pension are length of service and salary on retirement.  Superannuation terms are prescribed by statute and in most cases provide that pension on retirement would be a due proportion of retiring pay and this addition is given in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Generally the increases will be payable to the classes covered by the Pensions (Increase) Acts 1950 and 1956, that is, former civil servants and officers of local authorities (including vocational teachers), former members of the Garda Siochána and their widows, and pensioned national teachers.  Army retired pay and disability pensions, military service pensions and Connaught Rangers' pensions will also be increased.  Corresponding increases will be allowed in the pensions of former employees of local authorities and of harbour authorities, and a small provision has been included in the Estimate to meet any charges which may fall upon the Exchequer during the current financial year in respect of recoupments of increases in local authority pensions.</P>
    <P>The increases are restricted to pensioners whose pensions were calculated by reference to the salaries payable before the general pay increase of 1952. The pensions of those who retired before the operative date of the general pay increase of 1948 will be increased by six per cent.  The pensions of those who retired after the 1948 pay increase and before the operative date of the general pay increase of 1952, will be increased by four per cent.  The operative dates in most cases will be the 1st November, 1948, or the 1st November, 1952, but cases where the pay increases were effective from other dates will be determined by the appropriate dates. An overriding limit will apply so that no pension will be increased to an amount greater than the pension payable to a pensioner of corresponding rank and service who retired immediately after the 1952 pay increase.</P>
    <P>The work of assessing the increases in the various pensions is already in hand.  A few pensions will, however, have to await the passage of the new Pensions (Increase) Bill before payment can be made.</P>

They will all have to be fitted in with this Bill when it comes along.  It was found impossible to have it drafted in time.  I am quite sure that the Bill will be ready when we meet again in October.  Most of the pensions can be payable in the meantime.  There are just a few who may have to wait until then.  These few in any event will be paid retrospectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there will be.  The regulations were so complicated that it was found hard to cover all the cases. It was recognised before that the fact that the Bill was introduced was sufficient to give me authority to pay the pensions in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is rendered necessary by the decision of the Minister in his Budget statement to grant certain increases to retired civil servants and public servants.  He estimates that the cost of the present increases in a full financial year will be approximately £127,000.  I think he said in his Budget speech that the cost for the remainder of the financial year would be approximately £58,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to grant an increase of six per cent. in the case of persons who retired before the 1st November, 1948, and to grant an increase of four per cent. where a person retired after the 1st November, 1948, and before the 1st November, 1952.  I think these increases of six per cent. and four per cent. are rather small having regard to the extent to which the cost of living has increased since many of these persons retired before 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> It is true, of course, that under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950 and 1956, other increases were granted.  I think that under the 1950 Act it was at an increased cost of £200,000 and unler the 1956 Act about £120,000. Nevertheless, the position of many of these pensioners is really deplorable, particularly where they belong to grades where the salary scales were low.  While the percentage may look impressive, nevertheless, the total amount of the pensions could be, as it is in a great many cases, insufficient to provide many of these pensioners with a reasonable means of sustenance.</P>
    <P>Many of these people in the Civil Service and elsewhere retired when the cost of living was substantially lower than it is at present.  Many of them were superannuated on a salary scale or wage scale which was low and their pensions are correspondingly low.  I think it is estimated that there are about 1,500 of the persons now in receipt of basic pensions of not more than about £2 per week.  To grant pension increases of four per cent and six per cent on basic pensions as low as that does not, in fact, provide any substantial relief for persons of that type because the increase will amount to nothing more than about 2/- to 4/- a week increase for such persons and with the 1939 £ now worth only 7/4½d, an increase of 2/-, 3/- or 4/- per week makes a very imperceptible contribution to the solution of the financial difficulties of such persons who have served the State for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I should hope, therefore, that by the time the Minister comes to introduce his legislation proper so as to give statutory sanction to the payment of these increases, he will find it possible to be more generous than he is in the percentages of six per cent and four per cent which are granted under this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to an aspect of this matter which does not seem to be dealt with by him in connection with these increases.  As I understand the position, to get even the benefit of the four per cent increase, one must have retired before the 1st November, 1952. If you <Col N="1533" /> retired in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957 or 1958, you get no increase whatever. It can be said that, perhaps, if you retired in the past two or three years, you, nevertheless, get a rate of pension based upon adjusted salary scales.</P>
    <P>Admittedly that case can be made but it does seem a bit hard to draw the line at the 1st November, 1952 and to say that if you retired after that date no increase is payable to you.  After all, the index figure in mid-February, 1952, was 114 and the index figure for February, 1959, was 147 so that in fact there has been a substantial increase in prices since many officers retired after the 1st November, 1952.  In the case of those retiring immediately after November, 1952, and who have not got the benefit of wage and salary increases since that day, because they were not serving officers, the burden is particularly heavy.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will examine this matter further and see if he is in a position to extend the retiring date in order to allow people who retired later than November, 1952 to participate in the increase in pensions which this Estimate is intended to cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought he was merely going to explain figures.  I want to reinforce the point I made earlier about passing this Estimate, which I should be very glad to do, and which will increase pensions for some people between this and the Autumn, but I do not want to be precluded from raising the whole range of pensions when the legislation comes before the House.  I take it that the Minister agrees that when the legislation is introduced it will be possible to raise the question of all pensions and not merely those amounting to say £7,000 for whom it is impossible to make any provision in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely want to add to what <Col N="1534" /> Deputy Norton said on this Estimate. The old pension increases ranged from 50 per cent. in the case of very low salaries up to 30 per cent. and these increases of 6 per cent. and 4 per cent. certainly do not look very benevolent compared with the others.  Deputy Norton pointed out that a considerable number of pensioners are either in the £100 class or less than £100.  That means increased pensions may be granted to some of these people for the highest rate appropriate, which is 6 per cent.  I am informed that a number of these come down as low as half of that.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to the date of retirement in order to be entitled to the increase.  I do not know whether that date has been fixed but it is a point which I should like to raise on another occasion when there might be a better House present and more time to give it consideration and when it might be possible to influence the Minister to bring in more substantial increases than those now being offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the points raised by Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan.  Instead of having just a flat increase of 4 per cent. or 6 per cent. could the increase not be related to the size of the pension?  Apart from what Deputy Norton has said, I am completely in the dark about the size of the pensions. I do not know whether the Minister has given the House information on this matter on a previous occasion but I find myself passing an Estimate not knowing the amounts of the pensions involved in it.  On the question of the Bill, when it is introduced will it be possible to table amendments to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Only a member of the Government may put down amendments to increase taxation so that the Deputy would be precluded from putting down such an amendment.  He <Col N="1535" /> would be quite free to put down an amendment to reduce taxation.</P>
      <P>I received deputations and representations from the State pensioners of various grades and classes.  I was more impressed I must say by those who spoke for those who retired in 1948 and before 1952.  As I had only got a limited amount of money I asked for a scheme to cover pensioners who went out in 1948 and before 1952 which would as far as possible bring them into line with those who went out after 1952.  I do not say that we have done that but we have done it as far as possible.  Of course the officials who prepared that scheme would have produced a very much better scheme if we could have given them more money.  I think myself that, with the amount of money available, it was better to bring the older pensioners up to a level approximating that of those who went out in 1952 rather than to spread it out over the whole lot.  For that reason it was done in that way.  With regard to a possible discussion on the Bill I am not in a position to say definitely what might happen.  I have no objection to anything being raised provided the Ceann Comhairle allows it.</P>

It would mean 5,000 people, if that was the reason for it, fewer in employment.  At that rate, it would be about that figure.  But it is more than that, as it is a much bigger decrease in respect of employment, because there has been an increase in the rate and, therefore, an increase on the supplemental, excluding the employment.</P>

      <P>I think it is on this Estimate that this matter arises.  I got n acknowledgment last year or in 1957, I forget which, from the Minister or Finance, that the point I had raised in relation to the panel of official arbitrators was correct.  There has been only one official arbitrator, but the Act says that there must be a panel of arbitrators, and it was admitted that one was not a panel.  The matter was to be rectified, but I cannot find in this Estimate any indication at all that it <Col N="1540" /> has been so recified.  I would be glad if the Minister could deal with that.  I think it is in Subhead F1.  It seems to be the same as before.  It is at the bottom of page 74, where the Minister will see it mentioned that there was only one referee and arbitrator.</P>

I gather the situation to be that there is one official arbitrator, that is, the person we know for many years acting in these cases and against whom quite a number of appeals have been taken successfully; and in addition to that there is a member, so to speak, of a civil service staff &mdash;so that the applicant whose land is being taken is told now: &ldquo;You can take either the ex-military man who has been an official arbitrator for years, or you can take someone from the Department which is interested in acquiring your land.&rdquo;  That does not seem to be in accordance with the Act &mdash;certainly not in accordance with the intention of it.</P>

Under Stores, there is an increase of £3,840.  Provision has been made for the purchase of increased paper and chemical supplies and new equipment.

If the recipient of a cheque, the payee, wants to collect money over the counter, the bank can hand him out the money without his endorsing the cheque, if they so desire, and they are not liable as being negligent, but as a matter of protection, as I understand it, they have expressed to the Minister their present intention of requiring endorsement in such a case.

      <P>Very well.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned on the Second Stage of this Bill that we seemed to be incorporating <Col N="1547" /> into the Bill a principle which derives from previous legislation.  I think at one stage we took the wrong line.  The history of this business is that the original Electricity Supply Act passed about the year 1926, if the truth is to be known, was a long and complex measure.  A strategy not unknown to skilled advisers was employed. There were incorporated in the Bill certain minor provisions on which an industrious Opposition might reasonably be expected to fasten.  It was thought desirable that certain such provisions should be inserted which might, without jeopardy to the main principle of the Bill, be jettisoned by the Minister in order to satisfy the industrious Opposition which was concerned to improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>As so often happens, &ldquo;the best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley.&rdquo; That was one of the particular bones upon which the hounds of the Opposition did not concentrate their attention and so it remained in the Bill and became part of our statute law.  There it lay unobserved by anybody until Deputy Maher presented himself as a candidate for Laois-Offaly.  It suddenly transpired that, according to the strict letter of the 1926 Act, it would appear that Deputy Maher had rendered himself liable to all sorts of pains and penalties because he did not retire from the service of the E.S.B. prior to offering himself as a candidate for Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I think the general consensus of opinion in this House then was that though that might be the letter of the law, nobody felt it would be appropriate to disqualify Deputy Maher from membership of this House.  The general feeling was that the appropriate provision in the law should not be invoked.  It was generally disregarded and Deputy Maher remained a member of the House, though I believe he rendered himself technically liable to certain penalties.</P>
    <P>It was quite evident that everybody in the House took the view that the provision in the original Act was unreasonable, that Deputy Maher was properly elected and that, if the statute said otherwise, the statute had either to be ignored or amended.  That <Col N="1548" /> is my certain knowledge of the general feeling of the members of Dáil Éireann when the true significance of this section of the 1926 Act came to be examined.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, as so often happens, an undesirable precedent had crept in.  When, subsequent to 1945, after the war, various other Acts setting up statutory bodies came to be drafted analogous legislation was referred to and the wretched section of the original Electricity Supply Act was lifted out and poked into a series of other Bills which came before this House.  Again nobody adverted to it because during the same period an alternative form of section was sometimes used.  The alternative form of section said that where a person who was a member of a public body&mdash;when I say a public body I mean a State corporation&mdash;got elected to Dáil Éireann or appointed to the Seanad, he thereupon ceased to be a member of the Board.  I think that is a reasonable arrangement. Or, alternatively, the formula which appears in this Section for officers or servants in the employment of the Board was used and that is relatively unobjectionable because I think we will all agree that where a person is either an officer or servant of a State company it is inappropriate that he should continue to be a member of Oireachtas Eireann.</P>
    <P>I think the Leader of the Labour Party suggested that he was prepared to go the whole hog and to say that he did not think there was any objection to a servant or a director of one of these Government corporations being at the same time a member of Oireachtas Eireann.  I am not prepared to go that far with Deputy Norton.  I think it is reasonable to provide that if a director or an officer or a servant of a State company is elected to Oireachtas Eireann he ought to resign or at least be seconded from his existing employment until such time as he ceases to be a member of Oireachtas Eireann.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, that is the rule that applies in regard to the servants of public bodies.  I think if you are working for a county council you can <Col N="1549" /> get leave of absence but when you cease to be a member of Oireachtas Eireann you are entitled to go back to your work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about rate collectors but I do know that people working in a county secretary's office or employment of that kind are ordinarily seconded and when they cease to be members of the Oireachtas return to their jobs.  What I am thinking of is, if a man becomes a member of the Government and is working in public employment, he is seconded and when he ceases to be a member of the Government he can go back to his work.  It is acknowledged that if national teachers become members of the Oireachtas they are facilitated in providing substitute teachers while their public duty requires them to be here.  If it ceases to require their attendance here, they can go back to their schools.</P>
      <P>All I am suggesting is that we should not provide here that where a member of the Board is nominated as a candidate for election to either House, that automatically disqualifies him from continuing in his ordinary employment.  I think he should be entitled to be so nominated.  If he gets elected, he should retire.  If he fails to get elected, he should continue in his existing job.</P>
      <P>There is a snag which I have tried to meet in my second amendment, because the Bill says in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a member of the Board is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is clear and simple.  Then the section goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or as a member of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That provides that if he happens to be one of the eleven nominated by the Taoiseach to the Seanad, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Board.  I seek the deletion of the words, &ldquo;either as a candidate for election <Col N="1550" /> to either House of the Oireachtas or&rdquo; and to leave it to read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a member of the Board is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Board&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and to provide:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a member of the Board becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am bound to confess that I do not believe that a case of this kind is ever likely to arise.  I think it is not at all probable that a member of one of these Boards should put himself forward as a candidate at a Parliamentary election and desire to remain a member of the Board but the purpose of my amendment is to rebut what appears to be the implication of the section as it at present stands, and that is, that entrance into public life makes a person in this country almost suspect and unfit to occupy the position of director of a public Board.  I believe the very reverse to be true.</P>
    <P>It may be a gratifying thing to become the repository of a Minister's confidence by being appointed to be a member of a public Board but it is a very much more distinguished and honourable thing, in my judgment, to become the repository of the electors' confidence by being elected to this House by the voters in the exercise of their constitutional right and duty to choose their Parliamentary representatives and I want the House to go on record as assenting to that general principle.</P>
    <P>I am bound to admit that I do not believe my amendments have much practical effect but I think they have a very important effect in declaring that being a candidate for election to either House of Oireachtas Éireann cannot be a disqualification in any capacity in this country.  I think I should mention in that context that there is some other Bill before us at the present time which has a similar provision in it.  If my representations prevail with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I hope he will accept my amendments and undertake to incorporate them in the other Bill <Col N="1551" /> which is at present passing through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the principle of Deputy Dillon's amendments.  I am not quite certain whether it was on this Bill or the other Bill that he has mentioned that I too commented on the fact that a person nominated as a candidate to either House of the Oireachtas becomes automatically disqualified from membership of one of these Boards.  I would have preferred a simpler solution to this difficulty by deleting entirely Section 14, subsection (1) and substituting Deputy Dillon's second amendment, which would make the position clearer but that is only a matter of drafting and I rise just to support the argument.  I think it is wrong that because a person is nominated and may possibly be unsuccessful, he should give up his seat on one of these Boards, particularly if he is a useful member of the Board concerned and I hope the Minister will agree to make the necessary adjustments in the Bill.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon mentioned this matter in the course of the Committee Stage of this Bill, I was impressed by the argument that we should not as a general principle seek to decry people engaged in public life by declaring them ineligible to act on State Boards once they have been nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas.  I want to say that I fully approve of the idea behind Deputy Dillon's amendment but, having examined the situation more closely since, I propose to resist the amendment as put forward for the following reasons.</P>

    <P>Many of these State bodies have a very high employment giving potential and, therefore, a person who is a member of one of them, for example, the E.S.B., Córas Iompair Éireann or Bord na Móna, might be considered to have some advantage by reason of that fact, in putting himself before the electorate.  There is also the case which we can envisage of a member of one of these bodies going forward for <Col N="1552" /> election and of his being approached by a number of the employees of that State body who might have a real or an imaginary grievance, and who would ask his support to put that grievance right, possibly in return for promised or expected support in the election.  We all know that, particularly at election times, organised bodies who have grievances to redress frequently present documents and memoranda to Dáil and Seanad candidates and, in these memoranda, ask for a reply to be given before the date of the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  They seek a candidate's view on their own particular grievance.  I agree with telling them to go to hell but some people feel it would be better in their own personal interests to avoid making direct answers to such questions.  However, the fact remains that people on these State-sponsored bodies are put there by the Government of the day, and are in certain positions because of enactments here in this House and in the Oireachtas generally.  It might be suggested for that reason they would be in a privileged position vis-á-vis other candidates who have not got that privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I think it is more desirable that a member of such a body, on being nominated, should be deemed to have resigned.  I say this at the outset in order to make my position clear but, to revert to what Deputy Dillon described as the history of this position, it is true that under the 1927 Act a person who was a member of the E.S.B. was disqualified to become a candidate, or to become elected to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is true that the same provision applied to Deputy Maher. At the time of his original election to the House he was an employee of the E.S.B. and, therefore, under the law as it stood would be deemed to have broken the law and, perhaps, rendered himself disqualified from being elected at all.  Deputy Maher settled that matter for himself by resigning his position in the E.S.B.  Rather, he settled it to a limited extent, but the <Col N="1553" /> section continued in force until 1957 when the E.S.B. Bill of 1958 was being prepared.</P>
    <P>At that time the Department of Local Government directed the attention of other Departments to the fact that this provision in the 1927 Act could well be declared unconstitutional, inasmuch as it would deprive a citizen of his right to become a candidate in a general election or in a Seanad election.  It was then that the matter was examined and, for the first time, the new formula was inserted in the E.S.B. Bill of 1958, which passed through this House in December of that year.  It is possibly true that Opposition Deputies did not advert to the fact that a new principle was contained in that Bill but, nevertheless, we can only conclude, by its passage into law, that the principle was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>As far as national teachers are concerned I think they are in a special position.  The Department of Education is not the employer of national teachers.  The contract of employment exists between the teacher and the school manager and, even though I believe that from time to time the position of national teachers coming into this House has been referred to but not examined, the fact that the contract of employment is between a private individual, a school manager and the teacher himself, that has decided in favour of not, for the moment at any rate, and perhaps for all time, interfering with the right of a national school teacher to enter this House.  In general, I think it is more desirable that the provision in the Bill should remain as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say again that I am in full sympathy with what Deputy Dillon has referred to; that membership of the Oireachtas, that being actively engaged in politics, should not disqualify a man <Col N="1554" /> or render him less fitted for any other type of employment but, for the reasons I have outlined, I have to resist the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to record our appreciation of the facilities afforded us by the Minister in regard to seeing the approximate outline of what the Government has in mind in regard to the base line proposals suggested under subsection (2).</P>
      <P>I would like to ask what exactly is the position?  When we publish our charts, what happens then?  Is there any international tribunal or any international agreement under which our base lines are accepted or do we have to negotiate bilaterally with every other State to secure their assent to our jurisdiction for prosecution for what we will regard as illegal fishing within these base lines ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We do not have to negotiate with other States.  The Convention lays down very clearly what our rights are in the matter.  We publish the Order and the map and our Courts are bound to exercise jurisdiction where the map shows they have it in certain respects.  That would be the situation.  The law will be there and the Courts will be bound to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (2) we take a certain course and declare part of our coast to be deeply indented and on foot of that declaration we indicate the base line which we regard as the true coast line ignoring deep indentations and we define the waters within the new base line drawn by us on our charts as being our fishing waters within which it is an offence against the law to fish.  Suppose <Col N="1556" /> Spanish trawlers turn up and&mdash;as commonly happens&mdash;are fishing off the Continental shelf 150 miles south of Ireland.  They are told by their own meteorological service by radio that storms are impending and these Spanish trawlers come to Bantry Bay or to one of our harbours for shelter during the storm and possibly are received.  The difficulty usually arises when these trawlers are returning to their ordinary fishing grounds that they begin to trawl at a time which in our judgment is too soon to let out their trawls within our territorial waters and if we catch them at that we arrest them, prosecute them in the Court and impose appropriate penalties.</P>
      <P>Suppose these trawlers say: &ldquo;We are not within your territorial waters. We question that your base line is properly drawn within the meaning of the Convention to which you have subscribed&rdquo;.  Is there any tribunal provided by the conference which drafted this Convention to which a legitimate difference of opinion on the interpretation of the Convention would be properly referred?  I fully appreciate the situation in Iceland does not arise from this problem at all.  The problem in Iceland derives from the fact that the Government of Iceland claimed to extend its territorial waters and Great Britain refused to accept the extension to the limit which Iceland wished to define.  We now have a most unfortunate situation obtaining in these waters where I think the British accept a six mile limit but, in the area from that six mile limit out to the 12 mile limit, contention is proceeding between the naval forces of Iceland and of Great Britain as to whether British trawlers shall legitimately fish in the six mile belt of water to which rival claims are made. There does not seem to be any Court of competent jurisdiction to enforce agreement between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a Convention to which I gather the vast majority of maritime nations subscribe.  Surely somebody has foreseen the possibility of a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> difference arising as to the correct interpretation of the Convention and ought there not be some simple procedure for the resolution of such difficulties especially inasmuch as <Col N="1557" /> it has been generally agreed among the signatories of this Convention that we should separate economic considerations from strategic and territorial considerations in relation to the drawing of these baselines?  As I understand it the baselines for the definition of fishery waters are not understood to carry with them any political implications or declarations of the right to restrict or restrain ordinary shipping. They simply define the area within which each signatory claims exclusive fishery rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember, I am sure, that some years ago Norway adopted this straight baseline system and the matter was thrashed out in the International Court. Britain objected, but the Court held with the Norwegians that they had a right to draw these baselines and since last year the Geneva Conference agreed upon a Convention which clearly set out the rights of the coastal States to define their territorial waters with reference to the straight baseline system.  If there are objections to our Order I expect the objecting State could take an action against us in the International Court and we would have to defend the baselines that we had drawn.  Once the Dáil passes this legislation our own Courts will decide cases of contravention of the fishery limits in accordance with that legislation and it will operate until it is changed by Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly content so long as the Minister is able to say to me that if we do this and if somebody questions the propriety of the baselines drawn by us it will simply go to the Court of International Justice and the decision of that Court will bind us both.  All I want to ensure is that we are not doing something that might get us out on a limb and into an argument with somebody with whom we have not the slightest desire to have an argument.  At the moment we are in a position to say: &ldquo;If you do not like our baseline or think it is inconsistent with the Convention, we will meet you at The Hague, argue our case and agree.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it applies to Section 9 or 10, but one thing requires to be clarified.  I personally am in no doubt, but perhaps the Minister would avail of this occasion to clarify it?  As I understand it, the effect of Sections 9, 10 and 11, taken together, is that if a foreign ship commits an offence against our fishery laws within our exclusive fishery limits, as defined by Section 4, the ship and its master will be answerable to our Courts as at present without any interference by the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed our misunderstanding of the Minister's position in regard to the drawing of the baseline and I do not want to qualify that.  However, I see a number of enactments repealed in the Schedule. The Sea Fisheries Act, 1843, the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868, the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, the Sea Fisheries Act, 1883, the North Sea Fisheries Act, 1893 and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  In repect of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, and the Sea Fisheries Act, <Col N="1560" /> 1883, has the repeal of these Statutes been examined from the point of view of the impact such repeal might have on our sustained position on the much wider question of the territorial waters of Ireland?  The Minister will recall there are certain questions which are outstanding and which, by decision of our Government, have been allowed to remain in abeyance, but we have never conceded that any Statute heretofore enacted has effectively under any system of law, foreign or domestic, operated to transfer the jurisdiction of the Irish Government over territorial waters from the Irish Government to anybody and that not even the extreme extent to which that argument might be pressed could call in question the appropriate jurisdiction for the waters of Lough Neagh.  I agree with the Minister that in the context of this Bill there is no necessity to raise these issues, but at the same time I should not like inadvertently in the Schedule to this Bill to repeal an Act to which it might be requisite at some future time to refer him in substantiation of another and graver matter which we might be concerned to argue before an appropriate tribunal, national or international.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will notice in regard to these Acts being repealed that, with the exception of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, the extent of the repeal is that we say: &ldquo;The whole Act is repealed in so far as it is or ever was in force in the State.&rdquo;  It is held in regard to these Acts being repealed, barring our own Act enacted this year, that their application here is very doubtful, but we want to remove the doubt.  These Acts were all enacted to give effect to international conventions which make reference to fishing within three miles off the coast.</P>
      <P>It does not affect the other issue to which the Deputy refers.  We are merely getting rid of things which might be held to conflict with exclusive fishery limits as defined in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand that it is expedient to remove doubts by repealing these Acts in so far as they ever applied here.  All I am concerned with is to ensure that, in taking that decision, we do not do anything to our own disadvantage.  Reference has been made to the possible implication of the acknowledgment of the force of these Acts by other parties within this jurisdiction.  To put it quite bluntly, there may have been an implied acknowledgment by other persons that the effect of these Acts was to recognise the sovereign authority of the Irish Government over our territorial waters in the period in which it was recognised as the 32-County Government.  Subsequently, in legislation which purported to subtract from our jurisdiction six counties of Ireland, inadvertently or otherwise, there was no attempt made to deal with the territorial waters of these six counties.  Therefore territorial waters were left in the original jurisdiction. Has the repeal of these Acts been considered in the light of the desirability of preserving that position in case it should be necessary to argue it at some future date?  Or could the casual repeal of these Acts be brought in evidence in some entirely different context to argue that, by the repeal of these Acts, in so far as they apply within our jurisdiction, we are acknowledging the effective withdrawal of the territorial seas around our North-East corner as having been effected?  I do not know whether the Minister has looked at it from that angle.</P>

      <P>There is no difference between us.  All I want to do is to take precautions.  This is a Bill to make provision in respect of the territorial seas and the exclusive fishery limits of the State, and to provide for the conservation of the living resources of the sea.  Quite bluntly, we have never conceded anywhere that the territorial seas of our country are other than the seas that wash the four shores of Ireland.  Rightly, I think, in the present context the Government elect to leave that question in abeyance for the practical purpose of drawing a straight x baseline to define fishery law in respect of that area over which we effectively exercise jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister that, in deciding on that course of <Col N="1563" /> action at this time and in incorporating in the Schedule the repeal of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act of 1878 and the Sea Fisheries Act of 1883, we are doing nothing which could hereafter be availed of by an antagonist in an argument as to the correct definition of the territorial seas of Ireland.  I wish to be assured that nothing is being done in this Bill that could be correctly described as conceding that the seas that wash the North-East corner of the territory of Ireland are not the territorial seas of Ireland.  If the Minister has looked at the matter from that point of view and if he is satisfied that nothing in this Bill, in its Long Title or in the Schedule, will give any ground for such an argument being made hereafter, I am content.  But I think it is important to register here and preferably by declaration of the Minister on behalf of the Government, that nothing in this Bill is to be taken as a recognition of any claims which may be advanced by any party to the exclusive jurisdiction which is the prerogative of the Government of Ireland to the territorial waters of the 32 counties of this island.</P>

When this Bill is enacted its effect will be to add to the territorial waters in certain parts of the coast.  It will not reduce them in any part.</P>

      <P>The Minister's phrase is entirely directed to territorial seas which are defined in Section 2 with two limitations.  I am more concerned with Section 5 which deals with the internal waters and we may as well state the claim which has always been maintained as to what are our inland waters.  The Articles of Agreement for the Treaty established the whole island with its territorial waters and inland seas with power being given to certain counties to opt out if they so wished.  Six counties did so opt away from the State but they were only given six Parliamentary counties or land.  They were given no sea and no water.  Our claim is that the entire waters of Lough Foyle, Carlingford <Col N="1564" /> Lough and Belfast Lough belong here and our extreme claim would include the waters of Lough Neagh which is entirely inland.  Is that claim covered by Section 5?  I doubt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not affected.  After all, the extent of our territorial claim is set out in the Constitution.  We cannot amend the Constitution by ordinary legislation.  This Bill does not purport to change or affect any claim we have over the territorial waters as they exist today.  When the Bill is passed it will extend our territorial waters and will not restrict them or take anything from them.</P>

      <P>The Constitution refers to the territorial waters which are marked from the baselines or from the Islands.  I am not worried about our territorial waters.  They are effectively preserved by this legislation.  I am thinking of the inland waters.  It was in respect of those that the claim was originally sustained and has always been maintained by us.  That claim has been stated by Deputy Dillon and myself and I take the Minister's assurance that no part of that substantial claim is being waived or is intended to be waived by this Bill.</P>

      <P>On the Final Stage, I want the Minister for External Affairs to refer to the points raised by Deputy <Col N="1565" /> McGilligan and myself.  These points should be carefully examined.  I agree with the Minister that it is desirable to pass the Bill so that the new baselines should be drawn at the earliest possible date.  At the same time I do not think we should do anything by inadvertence which might embarrass us at some future date.  I am satisfied, if the Minister, after full consultation with those competent to advise him, is satisfied that no existing claim which has been sustained by this country in respect of our territorial waters is being waived or prejudiced by the terms of this Bill.</P>
      <P>If there is an amendment required to safeguard that situation I would ask the Minister not to hesitate to introduce it in the Seanad even if that involves some little delay in drawing the new baselines.  The results would be most unfortunate if, by inadvertence, we did something of that kind and, with an improper appreciation of its gravity, we allowed the thing to slide in order to get this Bill into operation a few months earlier than it otherwise might be.  We should take all proper steps to preserve our constitutional claims which are, after all, matters of substance.  I would not like to pass the Bill outright without an assurance from the Minister that if it did emerge that there was something in the points we have raised he would introduce an amendment in the Seanad to deal with it.</P>

      <P>The matter was examined in the course of the preparation of the heads of the Bill and I can assure Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan that nothing in this Act waives or abrogates any claim we have to any territorial waters around our coast.  Its net effect is to add to our territorial waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £18,730 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; No. 38 of 1938; and No. 24 of 1947).</P>
      <P>It has been the practice for some years past for the Taoiseach, on his Estimate, to give a full survey of the state of the economy as a prelude to a general debate.  While I agree as to the desirability of this practice I have some doubts as to whether this is the best time of the year for a debate of that character.  The Taoiseach's Estimate is taken at the end of the long Spring and Summer session of the Dáil during which Deputies have many opportunities for debates on economic topics, on the Budget and on the Estimates for the Departments that are concerned with economic matters.  I think that it might be better, if possible, to devise arrangements for future years by which the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach could be postponed to the end of the year.  I am putting forward that idea for consideration.  I accept that it could not be implemented except by general agreement and also that it would not be appropriate to the circumstances of this year.  I propose, therefore, to follow precedent and to comment upon the economic situation generally but avoiding the repetition of statistics which are in any case available to Deputies in the published reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics are, of course, the essential tools of government and their value depends upon their accuracy and on their prompt publication.  Improvement in the Government statistical services is having constant examination.  The document entitled <i>Economic Statistics</i>, which was published prior to the Budget this year, contained much up-to-date information, including balance of payments estimates and preliminary national income estimates, <Col N="1567" /> and provided information which normally was not available until the Statistical Survey was published in July.  The Statistical Survey will be somewhat late this year because I am told that various revisions are deemed to be necessary in national income figures.  We are considering the question of revising the form of the Statistical Survey.  The aim will be to try to have published before the Budget much of the information normally held over for the Survey and then to publish in July, when the information is available, a separate document on national income and related topics.</P>
    <P>In any survey of economic developments the first statistics to which one naturally turns are those relating to employment and unemployment.  The position in that regard shows some improvement. In round figures, the unemployment register this year is running about 4,000 below the 1958 level and about 10,000 below the 1957 level. Employment in transportable goods industries in the first quarter of 1959 was 2,700 greater than in the same period of 1958 and 4,600 greater than in the same period of 1957.  The index for transportable goods production rose from 101.9 in 1957 to 104.4 in 1958.</P>
    <P>For the first quarter of this year, the industrial production index was one point up on the first quarter of last year and 7.6 points up on 1957.  The expansion in the industrial sector was not sufficient, however, to offset the effects of last year's bad weather on agricultural output, which received a temporary setback.  We can hope that a better harvest this year will enable the country to take two steps forward together.  In the early part of 1957 the economy was going downhill at what seemed to be an accelerating pace.  By the end of 1957 that downward movement had stopped and the long haul back uphill to a high level of activity began but it has not yet gained sufficient momentum to keep it going by its own weight.  The need for exceptional and special measures is still very clear.</P>
    <P>In May, the consumer price index was unchanged as compared with the February figure and one point higher <Col N="1568" /> than in May of 1958.  At present, prices generally can be said to be stable. While the inflationary forces which had such a serious and continuing effect upon prices since the end of the war have lost much of their impetus, it is not yet certain that they may not survive.  On the other hand, there appears no danger of a general price slump, which would be even more serious in its economic and social effects.</P>
    <P>The index of industrial wage earnings was 2.2 points higher in the first quarter of this year as compared with the first quarter of 1958 and ten points higher than the corresponding figure for 1957.  I think it can be said that there is nothing happening now which could cause prices generally to rise, except internal factors.  If our internal costs can be kept from rising, and particularly if wage increases are related to higher productivity, prices need not be forced up again.  The workers of Ireland have learned in the hard way that, in a race between wages and prices, wages nearly always lose.  Now that prices are stabilised, it is in the workers' interests to try to keep that position.</P>
    <P>The expansion of employment is a main aim of the Government's policy and I am sure it is that of the trade unions also.  Higher prices mean reduced sales and consequently less employment. If we have products to sell at competitive prices we will get sale for them.  We cannot expand output on a non-competitive basis.  I suggest these considerations are fundamental.</P>
    <P>I have frequently urged that in each industrial group the representatives of management and of the workers should sit down together to consider development possibilities and to concert measures to exploit them.  I want to make it clear that there is no question of trying to bring about that situation, however desirable we would regard it, by legislation, but rather to encourage its development by the growth of an intelligent understanding that it is only by pulling together that the results which everybody desires&mdash;more employment and better wages based upon increased productivity &mdash; can be permanently secured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> As the real national income expands we shall want all sections to share in the benefits, but it is clearly in everybody's interest to work together to get it expanding first.  There need not be any rivalry between management and labour in that effort, but it may be that it is only when they sit down together to discuss possibilities that their common interests will become more widely accepted and recognised.</P>
    <P>It must now be generally realised that the country is entering a situation in which every section has to take a new look at old policies, and be willing to make a contribution to the vital task of making the whole of the national economy as efficient as human ingenuity can devise.  During the course of this session we had a number of discussions, on various occasions, on the significance of our emigration statistics such as they are and on the figures which were published in <i>Economic Statistics</i> regarding the country's labour force.  As long as net annual emigration continued at a rate which exceeded the national increase of population then the total population of the country and the available labour force declined.</P>
    <P>The natural population increase is approximately 26,000 per year.  For some years past, as Deputies are aware, net emigration has exceeded that figure but there are indications that may not now be the case.  The only guide we have to the emigration rate is the net balance of passenger movement by sea and air.  That is not a very precise guide, but it affords a fairly reliable indication of the trend.  In the twelve months to the end of February last the balance outward revealed by these figures was 32,000 compared with 58,000 in the corresponding period ending in 1958. I should explain that it is considered better to work on figures from February to February rather than on the calendar year so as to eliminate the element of the Christmas traffic. The fall in the rate of emigration revealed by these figures seems to be continuing.  The net outward movement in the five months of this year to the end of May was 7,000 below the corresponding figure for 1958.  If, <Col N="1570" /> as these figures seem to suggest, the emigration rate is not now in excess of the population increase, it is still very much too heavy, and that situation emphasises the need to accelerate the growth of economic activity and justifies the exceptional measures upon which the Government have decided.</P>
    <P>Our fundamental need is to increase national production and income so that the country will earn enough resources to maintain its population at living standards which are sufficiently in line with those prevailing in Britain to persuade our young people to stay at home, and to diversify productive activities so as to increase the variety of employments, and to give to everyone an opening suitable to his individual talents.  The best and most secure prospect of expanding national resources arises in agriculture and it is on the making of the fullest use of the country's agricultural possibilities that the whole national economic programme depends.  It is probably through industrial developments that job variety can best be promoted.</P>
    <P>Government aids to agriculture and to manufacturing industry have been expanded, and are being channelled into the type of development which appears to be the most promising.  The views of the Government in that regard have been set out fairly fully in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and are now, I think, fairly generally known.  When I was speaking here earlier this year, in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I referred to the Central Bank's forecast regarding external payments this year which was published about that time.  They then forecast that the payments deficit this year might rise to about £9,000,000. The year end position depends to a very great extent on what may happen cattle exports during the rest of the year, and that is a subject upon which even experts are reluctant to give a forecast.  In some circumstances a payments deficit of the order of £15,000,000 might arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance dealt fairly fully with that matter in the Seanad last week and I do not wish, this evening, to traverse unduly the same <Col N="1571" /> ground as he covered.  The recent upward trend in imports was due largely to the consequences of last year's harvest.  In the four months, January to April, 1959, increased wheat imports accounted for more than half the total import increases. The bad harvest also affected some exports adversely as, for example, butter and bacon.  Part of the anticipated external payments deficit of 1959 will arise out of increased investment in productive capacity and it is to that extent a matter for satisfaction rather than the reverse.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that if more machinery and equipment is purchased abroad these increased imports will be reflected in our external trade statistics considerably in advance of the higher exports of our own products which these imports will facilitate.  Apart from that factor, the balance of payments deficit in this year is, in the main, due to the delayed impact of last year's bad harvest.  No need for any corrective action is seen.  The increased external trade deficit in the first four months of this year has not been accompanied by any corresponding diminution in the external reserves of the banks and the position in that regard is not unsatisfactory.  Indeed, bank credit has tended to expand.</P>
    <P>The Government, as was stated in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, contemplate increased state investment activity.  That will, of course, tend to cause imports to rise. The extent to which higher State investment can be maintained in future years will depend on the success of our efforts now to expand production and exports.  There is, as the White Paper indicated, no reason why we should hesitate if the need arose to have recourse to international sources of capital to support projects which are fully productive in the financial sense but investments of another kind, however justifiable in their long term effect upon the efficiency of the country's economic organisation, must be financed if possible from our own resources.</P>
    <P>The need for the encouragement of a high level of savings, therefore, is as great as ever and, indeed, greater if the <Col N="1572" /> advantages of increased investment activities are to be realised.  There is a patriotic duty, if I may so describe it, to avoid purchasing any class of imported merchandise when Irish products are available and on the private owners of external investments to seek more energetically for openings for the utilisation of these resources here at home.</P>
    <P>We have had much discussion in the Dáil and outside it concerning the situation which is developing in European trade.  It is clearly a situation which calls for and has been receiving our very close attention.  I should like to preface what I have to say in that regard by congratulating the Irish Council of the European Movement upon having brought important European Statesmen to Dublin to five us the benefit of their comments upon these developments.  Whether or not we agree with the views which they expressed it can do us nothing but good to hear them.</P>
    <P>While the establishment and the gradual growth of the European Common Market together with the emergency of this new plan for a smaller Seven-Nation Free Trade Area creates problems for this country I think it is undesirable that the seriousness of that situation should be exaggerated.  It is a situation about which we need to think calmly and objectively.  Indeed, as some of the speakers at the European Movement meeting pointed out, it is a situation which may well offer us new opportunities as well as new problems.  So far as the Common Market countries are concerned the situation is that each of the individual countries is still making bilateral trade agreements with countries outside the Community.  As the House was informed today in reply to a Parliamentary Question, the only country with which negotiations for an agreement of that character, with countries within the Common Market, have failed in this year was France.</P>
    <P>That situation is now the subject of further diplomatic approaches.  At some stage as the institutions of the European Community develop, and particularly when they have agreed their common external tariff which the <Col N="1573" /> Rome Treaty obliges them to maintain, there will be collective negotiations with these Common Market countries through the European Economic Community.  We propose, therefore, forthwith to open discussions with the Council of the European Economic Community with a view to establishing formal diplomatic relations with it as other countries have done or are now doing.</P>
    <P>The proposals which are at present being discussed at the Stockholm conference do not, in so far as revealed by any published information regarding them, involve the imposition upon the countries adhering to that agreement of any obligation to maintain a common or uniform external commercial policy. It is contemplated that each of the countries participating in that agreement will be free of any general obligations in their trade arrangements with non-members.  Apart, therefore, from the effect of the agreement, the situation regarding trade negotiations with these countries will not be altered.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps inform the Dáil that we have recently suggested to the members of both groups individually &mdash;the members of the Common Market and the countries that are negotiating at Stockholm&mdash;through our representatives accredited to these countries that so far as this country is concerned, having regard to the frequent declarations of intention to work towards an eventual seventeen country agreement&mdash;perhaps I should say eighteen-country agreement now because Spain was admitted to OEEC yesterday&mdash;under OEEC auspices, they should agree to give us now, as a temporary arrangement, the benefit of tariff reductions conceded to members without reciprocal obligations on our part and pending later discussions of these obligations if, and when, the OEEC negotiations are resumed.  We think that is a course worthy of their consideration on the stated assumption that all these present developments are a prelude to the reopening of wider negotiations of the same character as were attempted last year.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that in any circumstances our main interest lies in trading with Britain and nothing could <Col N="1574" /> conceivably happen in Europe which could alter that situation in any way. We had indeed taken no decision, as I have made clear here on various occasions, to join the 17-nation Free Trade Agreement if it had been successfully negotiated, although we participated actively in the negotiations.  We certainly tried to ensure that the Agreement would be so framed that it would be possible for us to consider participation in it, having regard to the modification of the obligations agreed in our case.</P>
    <P>We had, however, contemplated that if an agreement had been completed we would then consider all the alternatives and discuss them with the British Government as our principal customer in Europe.  We are, of course, a European country and we are dependent to an exceptional degree for our prosperity on external trade.  We are indeed very well aware that our economic progress depends to a great extent upon the prosperity of Western Europe as a whole.  Everything which tends to promote European prosperity must have our goodwill, although the manner and the time of our participation in any European economic arrangement would necessarily depend upon our own assessment of where our economic advantage lay, both in the short-term and long-term.</P>
    <P>In view of all these recent developments, and particularly because of the uncertainty regarding the resumption of negotiation for a wider argreement, we decided to discuss trading possibilities and future arrangements with the British at this time.  As the official communiqué issued after the discussions on Monday of last week mentioned, we put forward certain possibilities which the British Ministers agreed to examine.  These negotiations are still in progress.  It could be that their outcome will have a decisive bearing on the development of our economic policy and on our attitude to any general Western European agreement, if and when that likelihood reappears.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated during the course of my speech during the debate on the Department of Industry and Commerce that it may be worth our <Col N="1575" /> while to consider departing from the non-discriminatory basis on which, except for the British preference, our trading arrangements are generally based, and to seek to improve the country's export prospects by diverting trade to countries which afford reasonable prospects to us.  That is not a decision which could be taken lightly. But, in the circumstances which may emerge for a time in Europe, it may indeed prove to be the only practical course for us.  A policy of bilateralism &mdash;that is to say, regulating our imports in accordance with obligations accepted in bilateral agreements with individual countries&mdash;would clearly involve some economic penalties, but, as a temporary course, it may offer us the best chance of protecting our interests.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have in the past pointed out here that there are European countries with which our existing trade leaves us with serious deficits.  While our first concern is to balance our trade with the world as a whole, when other European countries are entering into special trading groups we cannot allow theoretical considerations to deprive us of any weapon by which we can promote our own trade expansion.  I should, perhaps, make it clear that these comments of mine relate to European trade only.  By reason largely of the growth of our tourist receipts, our dollar payments are in balance.  Various market investigations which have been carried out have shown quite good prospects for trade in selected products in other areas of the world, particularly with some of the newer countries, primarily, of course, for industrial goods.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the country's economic situation on which I wish to make some observations. Since taking office as Taoiseach, I have commented, in Press interviews, on the problem of Partition.  I re-stated our national position&mdash;that Ireland is historically and geographically one country with a fundamental right to have its essential unity expressed in its political institutions.  We cannot and will not step back from that position. We hope that, in time, a climate of <Col N="1576" /> opinion will be created in which the realisation of that national aim will be achieved in harmony and agreement.</P>
    <P>That climate may not exist now.  We do not disguise our hope that if we can promote the growth of co-operation, wherever it can contribute to the economic development of both parts of the country, it will help to create a better climate.  Our motives are not hidden.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have that hope of eventual unity is not, I suggest, a reason why people in the north should refuse to consider even now possibilities of concerting activities for the practical economic advantages that may result.  Ireland without its people means nothing to us&mdash;no more than it did to James Connolly&mdash;and if it is in our power to contribute to the welfare of Irishmen anywhere, we would want to do it.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes stated that the economic development programme now being applied in this part of Ireland is causing or may cause economic difficulties in the north in some trade sectors.  We should certainly be prepared to consider any suggestions or representations made to us from Northern Ireland in that regard.  We have recently agreed to a proposal of the British Government to set up a permanent Committee of senior officials to discuss problems as they arise in Anglo-Irish trade.  Would a similar committee dealing with internal Irish trade be advantageous? Because of our hopes for the eventual economic unity of the country, we could not in principle be adverse to considering adjustments in our trading arrangements which might expand trade opportunities for bona-fide Irish products originating in the Six County area.  Could the very practical difficulties which would arise in working out arrangements for that purpose in present circumstances be reduced by detailed examination of them?  Are there possibilities for a combination of effort in the field of tourist trade, an all-Irish promotional campaign which would benefit the whole country?  In both North and South vigorous efforts are being made to attract and develop new industrial projects.  Could these efforts be coordinated <Col N="1577" /> with mutual advantage? Are there problems arising in cross-channel shipping which would be worth joint examination?</P>
    <P>Whatever the future may bring, we have to live in the present and anything which may contribute to the welfare of Irish people anywhere and to the solution of the problems of to-day is, in our view, well worth pursuing.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my personal view that in the world of the future the smaller countries will have to organise themselves very efficiently and to exploit their economic opportunities and possibilities to the fullest extent if they are to hold their own with the powerful combinations which are now predominant in world trade.  Ireland's difficulties in that regard arise partly from her island character and geographical location, partly from the neglect, over long historical periods, of her economic development.  These handicaps are multiplied in their effect by present divisions.  It seems to me that it is only common sense to seek to minimise these handicaps.</P>
    <P>I said recently that a new spirit is becoming apparent in the country.  I see as evidence of it the growth in the number and in the activities of many voluntary organisations, all of which are making important contributions to the national progress.  The work of such organisations as Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, Gael Linn, Muintir na Tire, and the Voluntary Labour Service is the outcome of personal decisions of patriotic Irish men and women who saw something worth doing and decided to do it.  There are other organisations, such as Tuairim, the European Council to which I have already referred, and the Junior Chambers of Commerce, whose interests-lie in encouraging thought on national problems by debate and study and whose activities are greatly helping to increase understanding of the country's possibilities and opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have constantly argued that national progress requires a concerted effort of the whole people and will be realised in direct proportion to the adequacy of that effort.  The spirit <Col N="1578" /> which has brought these voluntary movements into being is what this country needs most to encourage.  The work of the major organisations&mdash;the National Farmers Association, the Congress of Irish Trade Unions, the Association of Exporters, the Federation of Industries, the Federation of Trade Associations and so forth&mdash;is well known and its value is understood, but the most encouraging development in recent years is the emergence of these other movements I have named. Whether the Government will always agree with everything they do, or attempt, or whether they will approve of everything the Government does is of no importance.  What is important is that they represent the desire of the people, particularly the younger people, to have a direct share in the great work of national development.  I hope that they will continue to command an ever-growing volume of public goodwill and support.</P>
    <P>As a review of Government policy, this statement I am now making must be taken in association with the speeches I made earlier in the year on the Industry and Commerce Estimate and also in association with the speeches made on divers occasions by both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture.  I realise that there are many important aspects of Government activities, even in the economic sphere, on which I may not have touched.  I have changed within the month from the position in which it was my duty to know everything about something to one in which it is my duty, as I conceive it, to know something about everything, and I do not claim to be fully qualified yet.  I hope that will excuse any shortcomings in the statement I have just made.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am willing to accept the Taoiseach's humble request that we should excuse any shortcomings.  There were no shortcomings really except that it was rather difficult to find something definite, something concrete, something tangible of which one could take hold or in which one could find a clear <Col N="1579" /> statement of a clear position in relation to something.  Like the Taoiseach, it may perhaps be my shortcomings that I cannot appreciate to the full his detailed analysis of the topics upon which he touched.  I may not have got him down absolutely accurately, but I did find it just a little difficult to follow him in so far as I was trying to extract a definite statement on each of the topics with which he dealt.  I must confess I failed in that respect and, to that extent, his speech was disappointing. However, as I have said, that may be my own fault.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach did refer to the practice that had been established in my time of dealing with this Estimate by giving a sort of general review of the economic position and of Government policy.  To some extent I sympathise with his approach in this matter in that I fully realise that, from the time of the debate on the Vote on Account down through the debates on the Budget, the Estimates and the Finance Bill, general economic policy and a background of the economic condition of the country come in for pretty detailed review.  It is, at the end of the year, rather difficult to make a speech introducing the Taoiseach's Estimate considering that most matters of economic importance have already had a fairly general review.</P>
    <P>I think that on the last occasion on which I had the privilege of introducing this Estimate I departed somewhat from the practice which was in operation for some years and, instead of giving an economic review of the economic condition of the country, I took two or three specialised topics which I thought of some considerable importance at the time.  I have a most distinct recollection of the irrepressible Deputy MacEntee, as he was at that time, making a most violent assault on me because I dealt with the problems of emigration, and the growing up of cynicism and disbelief in our institutions and the general malaise with regard to politics and politicians generally. Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, made a most violent assault on me for departing from the usual procedure <Col N="1580" /> although I had given the reason that a few weeks before we had had lengthy discussions both on the Budget and on the import levies which had just been put on.</P>
    <P>This Estimate gives an opportunity for discussing general public policy, particularly in the light of our economic background.  While I have some sympathy with the point of view at the moment of the Taoiseach I would not be prepared to agree that anything would be gained by postponing discussion on this Estimate until December. I think it is generally felt that the period from the resumption of the Dáil to the Christmas vacation is one in which Bills are introduced.  It is sometimes a problem to get legislation to keep the Dáil going and generally the Government has not enough Bills to do so.  The whole attitude seems to be somewhat of a vacuum.  I know that would not be a good atmosphere in which to discuss general Government policy which only emerges when the Budget proposals are revealed and when the economic policy of the Government, as evidenced by their proposals, becomes available to Deputies.</P>
    <P>At all events it is a matter which we can consider but at the moment I find it difficult to see what Deputies could discuss on the Taoiseach's Estimate if they were told that such a matter was one for more detailed discussion on another Estimate and that such another matter would be relevant for discussion on another Estimate. Again they would be told that they could not talk on general Government policy because it is a matter that comes on in December.</P>
    <P>I entirely sympathise and agree with the Taoiseach's attitude towards statistics and the necessity for improving the machinery.  One of the most irritating things about statistics, and there are many irritating things about them, is that they are always out of date.  I find it difficult to convince myself, not to talk of convincing my audience, about the value of statistics when they are always six, eight, ten, or twelve months out of date.  I find it difficult to convince myself of the state of unemployment today when I have to go back to the end of December to find <Col N="1581" /> out the number of jobs which people had at that date as compared with the year before.</P>
    <P>While the Taoiseach has not painted this afternoon any rosy picture of the decrease in the unemployment position the figures we have been working on are figures which show that there were 32,000 fewer jobs in December, 1958, than there were in the corresponding period twelve months before.  I may be told that that figure is six months out of date but that is the figure we have.  It would be of great value if these statistical matters could be brought more up to date.</P>
    <P>I find it just a little difficult to find out what was going through the Taoiseach's mind when he purported to tell us of Government policy.  His speech left me with the impression that he was largely skating lightly over the problems.  While it must be appreciated that he cannot, and that he ought not, give any over-optimistic view of certain problems we might have had the benefit of a little more detail on the position.</P>
    <P>Looking back at the year that has just passed, realising that two years and four months have elapsed since the Government were formed in March, 1957, and knowing that the present Government have already run more than half of their allotted span, I think we are not entitled, nor are the Government entitled, to take any very great credit for the achievements up to date.  During that period we had a situation in this country which certainly did not inure to our benefit in the difficult time of 1956 and early in 1957.  For the past two years the terms of trade have been in our favour and the policy of the British Government has been one of expansion and growth in economic activity.</P>
    <P>Those two factors, the fact that the terms of trade were in our favour and that there was a policy of expansion in Great Britain, ought to have inured to our benefit and the Government ought to have taken the opportunity, then to be availed of, to ensure economic growth in this country.  I must emphasise that they have failed in that opportunity and wasted substantially that period of time.  I shall not fight again <Col N="1582" /> the old battle of proportional representation. I have already stated my position on that&mdash;that instead of taking advantage of those opportunities of the last two years, and instead of putting into effect what they say now is their policy as outlined in the White Paper published in November of last year, they have had to rush the necessary legislation to do that in the last two or three months, in which matter we have greatly facilitated them.  It became essential for us to educate the people during those months and, from the point of view of the Government doing the job it was sent here to do, much valuable time was wasted, and opportunities have been passed over which may never recur.  We find ourselves, then, at the end of nearly two and a half years of a period when economic conditions from outside were favourable. The forces impacting on our economy from abroad were not in our favour; they were entirely against us in our time.  We had the terms of trade against us.  We had the economic recession in Great Britain and we had an adverse balance of payments and in that set of circumstances we were faced with a condition and a very serious series of difficulties which no other Government in this country had before.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Lands last Sunday in Ennistymon making the extraordinary allegation that there was no such thing as a crisis, that Suez had nothing to do with us and the difficulties we were in.  The Taoiseach has to-day, as I understood him, stated that in his view our economic progress&mdash; I am paraphrasing him; correct me if I am wrong&mdash;depends upon the concerted effort of all sections of the community. I have stated and restated that that is the fundamental approach from our point of view to the problems of this country but what sort of approach are you going to get?  How will you harness together the united efforts of every section of the community, when we find defamatory observations and untrue statements about us and our policy being repeated and reiterated again and again by Ministers who ought to be responsible?</P>
    <P>I do not mind their commenting <Col N="1583" /> upon the inter-Party Government or what they were or what they were not. We can deal with that in another time and in other circumstances.  But, what I do object to is where these matters impinge upon the stability of the country and impinge upon the respect which our people ought to have for the institutions of our State.  I do suggest to the Taoiseach that, when he has now taken upon himself this responsible task and when he has, I think in all sincerity, made certain resolutions, at least he ought to impress upon his Ministers that it is about time that they stopped making serious allegations against their predecessors in Government, about their financial policies and the ruination that was brought upon the country by these policies, and the country put in pawn.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his colleagues ought to know that these allegations are quite untrue.  If a responsible Minister gets up in public for the purpose of getting votes and says that we had a crisis in our time, in 1956 and 1957, and that we gave the excuse of Suez and that there was no validity in that excuse, then I ask the Taoiseach to inquire from his responsible Ministers, from the Department of Finance, from his own Department, from the Central Bank, is there any truth in these allegations or was it not a fact that we at that time were faced with a series of difficulties entirely outside our own control, from forces from abroad, from conditions that we in fact inherited from the infamous Budget of Deputy MacEntee in 1952?  Those were responsible for the policies that we had to put into operation and did put into operation at the expense of our own political lives.</P>
    <P>I do suggest to the Taoiseach, when he is asking for that co-operation, that he ought to give that instruction, to put an end to that.  At least, let him inquire from the responsible people to whom I have directed his attention&mdash;his own Department, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank&mdash;and we are prepared to be judged by their judgment and by the information they give to him <Col N="1584" /> and his colleagues.  But, you will get no co-operation from the people whom we represent as long as these defamatory statements are being made nor as long as we have the sort of thing that the Minister for Health, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Tánaiste&mdash;all these high persons, as Pooh Bah said&mdash;make a speech such as was made in Dunshaughlin last Sunday.  I shall refer to that in another context, in the context of economics and Government policy, in a few moments.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that, if he is sincere in his statement that his belief is that our problems require for their solution the concerted effort and co-operation of all sections of the community, then there ought to be an end to that type of false propaganda, however much they may hope to get political support for their Party.  We are prepared to accept as part of our life as politicians that we shall get hard blows and give hard blows but, at least, any criticism that is made of us, any charges levelled against us, ought to be made on the basis of fact and on the structure of truth.</P>
    <P>We have facing us at present, after two years and four months of the present Government's activities or lack of activities, a situation where things are in many respects very disquieting, very confused in certain aspects and, in some respects, very menacing indeed.  We were told during the general election of two and a half years ago that the one thing that was required in this country was stability of government, that it was required for the solution of economic problems that there should be a one-Party Government with a clear majority in this House and with a policy that could be put into operation without any fear of political upheavals or Parliamentary disturbances.</P>
    <P>The present Government got that position which they asked for two and a half years ago.  They had the biggest majority that any Government in this country ever had.  Is not the position that, since they came into office with that clear majority and one-Party Government, first, that they had no policy until last November and, secondly, that practically since they came into Government <Col N="1585" /> there has been nothing but instability, insecurity, talk about general elections, discussion about proportional representation, a Presidential election, a referendum and now an election as a result of a change of Government?  That is what has been brought about by this clear majority and this strong Government.</P>
    <P>Our people are still talking around the lobbies of this House and outside about the possibility of a general election. Stability of Government is essential but, if you cannot get stability from a Government formed as this one is, with a clear majority and from one Party, with no fear of anything going wrong in the Division Lobbies, and if as a result of that, we have had nothing but instability, insecurity, and uncertainty, is there not something wrong?</P>
    <P>A position of uncertainty exists at the present time, because, as I say, there are still rumours going around that there may be a general election and that there will be a general election if something happens in these three by-elections.  That is two years and four months after the Government was formed.  That is very bad.  It may be that that position has emerged from the ill-fated and ill-advised proposals of the Government, of trying to change the electoral system and trying to change the Constitution, that these brought disunity and disrupted our efforts and did away with that notion, which the Taoiseach said is essential and with which I am in full agreement because it is part of my political philosophy, that there must be, in order to find some solution for our problems, co-operation from all sides of the people reflected here in the Parliament of the people.</P>
    <P>It may be that that disunity and the strife that it caused, all during a period of certainly nine months, is responsible for the condition existing at the moment but one thing is absolutely certain and that is that the country has not got the advantage of that stability, the pursuit of a single-minded policy, carefully thought out by a Government that has a clear majority in the Dáil and sits down <Col N="1586" /> to do its work in the sure knowledge that it is pretty certain, as certain as things can be in this life, of a period of life of at least four years and possibly five.</P>
    <P>So that the ordinary people of the country may go about their business, undisturbed by political strife and political animosities, or the fear of dislocation caused to business and industry by general elections and other analogous procedures that cause similar effects, I must earnestly suggest to the Taoiseach that he should consider it worthwhile framing his policy and directing his colleagues in the Government to secure that co-operation which I believe, and which he says he believes, is essential for the solution of our problems.  You will not get that by making divisions in the country, by making false charges against previous Governments or by trying to get political advantage by making false statements and erroneous statements about men who did their jobs in difficult times.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside for the moment and looking at the country's economy as it stands, there are disquieting features about it.  The Taoiseach himself, in the course of his remarks, did not give me the impression that he was satisfied with the employment position. It is gratifying that he did not try to over-paint the picture and to give a false impression of what the position is because everybody knows that the position is serious, if not dangerous. Certainly, in the City of Dublin, there is very, very serious hardship, caused not merely by employment and the fear of unemployment, but caused by Government policy in raising the cost of living by abolishing the food subsidies. That resentment exists in the City of Dublin and in other towns and cities of Ireland I am certain.  I cannot speak for rural districts but I do know there is very serious disquiet over hardship caused by the rise in the cost of living, brought about by deliberate Government policy in taking away the remaining prop of the food subsidies, and also caused by fear of unemployment and distress.  I hope the Taoiseach is right in his suggestion, from the figures, that emigration has <Col N="1587" /> become, more or less, static.  I doubt it.  We all know how difficult it is to find out exactly what the figures for emigration are.</P>
    <P>It is easy to talk about emigration, and nobody was more eloquent about emigration and the haemorrhage of our national life blood than the Taoiseach and his colleagues when they were over here.  We knew the problems that afflicted the country at that time and to gain political advantage out of it was not for the national good.  On the emigration front and the unemployment front is there anything to be smug, complacent or remotely satisfied about?  We have the position, adverted to by the Taoiseach in the course of his remarks, of our adverse balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I always took the attitude, and I am on record in this House, both on this side of the Chamber and on the other, that we ought not to be obsessed by the problem of an adverse balance of trade.  It is a matter which must be carefully watched.  It is a matter that should be properly safeguarded, and there should be every possible examination given to the consideration of what is causing an adverse balance of trade and whether it is likely to continue for a period of one, two or three years.  Senator Professor O'Brien dealt with this matter very adequately, and in his usual expert way, in the debate in the Seanad on the Finance Bill.  He said that the adverse trade balance was a thermometer indicating whether the country was suffering from a fever or not.  Judging the country's economy by that test, I think that the thermometer is certainly over and above the normal and gives a warning sign to the public not to overstate the position.</P>
    <P>We took steps to deal with a very serious balance of trade crisis caused, not by us, caused not by any policy of any of our colleagues or of the Government, but caused by external factors over which we had no control. We rectified that position and handed over the economy of the country to the present Government in a condition where it was improving and where it did, in fact, improve as a result of the efforts we made.  It deteriorated <Col N="1588" /> slightly last year and now, at the end of six months of this year, certainly the figures that are available &mdash;not to overstate the matter again&mdash; give some cause for apprehension.</P>
    <P>The figures for imports show a very high degree of increase indeed.  That may be explicable, as the Taoiseach said, by certain considerations, by unexpected imports caused by the adverse weather conditions of last year. If that be so then it is something to ease the worry and to calm any fears and apprehensions that may exist, but I doubt if that is the whole explanation. That is pretty well the only explanation the Taoiseach gave.  On the other hand, there is the fall in our exports which is a very much more serious matter than the increase in our imports&mdash;which may be transitory and may be explicable by passing circumstances&mdash;but, if our exports fall, and if they continue to fall in the way that the trend appears to give at present, then we are in for a very serious position indeed.</P>
    <P>We took steps, by way of import levies, to remedy a serious situation. Those steps are no longer available to the Government and if, by any possible chance, conditions do turn against us here and we have an increase in our adverse balance of payments and an adverse change in the terms of trade then the position is going to be very serious indeed.  What is dangerous about the present position is that not merely is there an increase, a very big increase, in imports and a pretty big decline in exports, but also there is the fact that those things occurred at a time when favourable trading conditions existed so far as forces from outside were concerned.  Prices that we had to pay for our imports remained low, very much lower than in our time. Prices that were got for our exports remained pretty constant and pretty high.  They show some tendency to go down now, that is, export prices, but I hope that is only temporary.  At all events, in that state of affairs where you have a big adverse balance of trade in the first six months of this year then there is serious ground for apprehension.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach can <Col N="1589" /> assure the House, and through the House the country, that something is going to happen in the next six months, or even in the next year, that will avert the danger but, unless he can, he ought to tell the House and the country what he proposes to do about the problem.  In our time the conditions of trade, the terms of trade, were very adverse indeed.  Export prices were going down and import prices were going up.  Freight charges and freight rates were catastrophically high and, while we had the situation as far as the balance of trade was concerned in hand, causing, unfortunately, unemployment and while the situation was in the way of diminishing, we had the Suez crisis causing shortage of petrol here. Of course, the Minister for Lands said there was no Suez crisis&mdash; because it did not happen in England why should it happen here?  If there was no crisis does anybody know why we had petrol rationing when garages had to close down causing unemployment?</P>
    <P>We had all the repercussions from the Suez crisis going out like waves in a pond when a pebble is thrown into it.  Yet, at Ennistymon, the Minister for Lands said there was no Suez crisis.  That sort of thing ought to stop and stop immediately and never be repeated.  That was the situation we had to face and which we did face at that time and if we had the position that faced this Government in the last two or three years we would be very happy.  If the terms of trade had changed to what they are now, we would have had no balance of payments crisis at all, even if the amount of imports increased. That is the situation that should be appraised and a stop should be put to the utterly false propaganda and misrepresentations throughout the country in which many of the Taoiseach's Ministers are indulging.</P>
    <P>The only key to the present situation as, I think, the Taoiseach knows and fully appreciates, as everybody does, lies in increased exports.  I think the Taoiseach said so this afternoon. There can be no doubt about that proposition.  We cannot contemplate any possibility of increasing the speed <Col N="1590" /> of our economic activity, encouraging the expansion of industry and of agriculture unless we are able to export our goods.  We shall have this recurring nightmare of a balance of payments problem year after year, or certainly every few years, unless we increase our exports.  The only real way to increase our exports is to increase our agricultural exports.  I think the Taoiseach gave but one sentence in his 40-minute speech to recognising the absolute importance of the agricultural industry.  For the rest, I think he spoke about matters other than agriculture and that appears to me to be the distinguishing mark of the present Government's policy, certainly as indicated by the actions and activities they have undertaken in connection with their hope for expansion of our industry, either manufacturing or agricultural.</P>
    <P>Look at all the Bills that we have passed and what do you find?  Is there a single item or a single one of those Bills that has anything to do with the agricultural industry?  The Minister had only one sentence in his entire speech about agriculture, recognising its importance and the way we relied upon it.  Industrial activity, he said&mdash; if I have taken him down correctly&mdash; would give more variety of jobs.  I think that is what he said and he can correct me if I am wrong.  He said that industrial activity would mean a variety of jobs but here we have to face up to a situation now that is of a very menacing character.  I used that description at the outset of my remarks. It is here that the menace arises.  Look at the amount of our exports, even while exports are increasing, and compare the volume of the products of manufacturing industry as a percentage with the volume of our total exports.  I think it would be an understatement to say that in comparison they are infinitesimal.</P>
    <P>The necessity for exporting our industrial products is realised and is absolutely urgent and must be kept in mind but even if we must concentrate on getting export markets for the products of our manufacturing industries the amount that will thereby be gained, no matter what is done by this <Col N="1591" /> or any Government, will be the smallest possible contribution to our general overall problem.  It would seem to be the view of certain people, particularly of some members of our business and commercial community, that there was no industrial policy but a tariff policy and, for 25 years under the auspices of the present Taoiseach, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that tariff policy was let rip to its logical or illogical conclusion.  We are now going to reap the false fruits of that rather bad policy, which was ill-conceived and not entirely designed for the circumstances of this country. It was brought in without adequate consideration and entirely too fast. We had the view on our side before Fine Gael was established, at the time of Cumann na nGaedheal, that the entire basis of our policy was the building up of a sound agricultural industry first and on that basis erecting a strong structure of industrial effort.</P>
    <P>During 20 years of Fianna Fáil administration, all the effort was concentrated upon building our manufacturing industries to the utter neglect of agriculture.  We are paying the price for that to-day.  I think the Taoiseach himself did say in one of his speeches &mdash;I think it was on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce&mdash;something which certainly, to my mind, conveyed the impression that our manufacturing industries, which were built up behind the shelter of a tariff wall, must now look after themselves and could no longer rely upon the restricted home market we have here and that they must export.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that has arisen and must be faced but it is not going to be faced easily nor are the results going to be obtained without some very adverse effects on employment, nor without general uneasiness and personal loss to workers in these industries. There has been a period of something like 27 years, from 1932 to 1959, during which restrictive tariff policy under the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, got full rein.  On the two occasions when we were in office we <Col N="1592" /> recognised there was amongst industrialists and business people a certain suspicion of our attitude towards Irish industry.  I objected to that and condemned it on the basis that Irish industry had been made the sport of politics, but we did endeavour to carry on that policy because you cannot reverse engines all of a sudden like that.  We did the best we could in order to keep things going and increase employment. We did more than that; we improved the policy and demonstrated the fact that there was an industrial policy which was something better than a mere tariff and quota policy and one that caused tremendous cost to the community through the neglect of our principal industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>At least we gave two very valuable contributions to the building up and strengthening of our industrial fabric. We gave incentives to export for the first time, shortly before we left office. We gave these incentives by way of tax remissions and other incentives of that kind.  In our first period of office we established the Dollar Export Board which ultimately gave birth, if I may put it in that way, to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta which is doing an extraordinarily good piece of work in getting markets for our industrial products.  We are entitled to take credit for that.  That was something that had not been done until we took office.  It was done by that Coalition Government that the Minister for Lands was so eloquent about in Clare last week.</P>
    <P>At least we have that to our credit and this also&mdash;we established the Industrial Development Authority under Deputy Morrissey when he was Minister for for Industry and Commerce. The Taoiseach, when he was over here in Opposition, denounced the establishment of the I.D.A. and said that when he would get back into office he would repeal the Act.  I was faced with the resignation of a couple of people I wanted to put on that Authority because of what the Taoiseach said then when he was in Opposition. The I.D.A. was set up in the teeth of opposition from the Taoiseach but he kept it on when he returned to office and all credit to him for that.  Even though he had opposed the measure <Col N="1593" /> and even though I was faced with the resignation of some people who would have given very valuable service on that body, the Taoiseach did keep on the I.D.A. when he came into office as Minister for Industry and Commerce and it has given extraordinarily good service in the development of industry.</P>
    <P>In addition to that we established the principle of foreign investment and put it into operation&mdash;something that had been neglected for very many years by Fianna Fáil but which we now see in operation under the present Government.  We now see the results of our policy in the remarkable growth of foreign investment in Ireland. It is a complete change from the policy imposed in the Control of Manufactures Act which prevented the full development of Irish industry and investment by foreign enterprises we might have taken every possible step to encourage and to invite to operate in this country.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters of industrial policy to which we gave our little contribution.  But now the present Government, or any Government succeeding them, are faced with the position that a structure has been built up here behind high tariff walls.  We have the Taoiseach himself&mdash;as I and my colleagues interpret it and as the country interprets it&mdash;admitting that this policy of wholesale self-sufficency has been a failure and that we must now, because of the restricted home market available and because of the change that has taken place in international economic affairs, take drastic steps to adjust our situation from the point of view of our industrial structure in order to meet that very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>For some time past we have this situation confronting us.  It was very shortly described and not very well detailed by the Taoiseach&mdash;I did not expect him to do so&mdash;in the course of his remarks.  We have the Common Market, the six countries in agreement on international trading relations, leaving the rest of Europe outside.  Then we have what is called &ldquo;The Seven&rdquo; coming along.  Then we have the Danes stealing a march on us while we were talking about whether we should vote <Col N="1594" /> one, three, five, and six or put an &ldquo;X&rdquo; before a man's name on a voting paper. There again this country lost its opportunity. The Taoiseach tried to give some excuse for that, not in his remarks here but during a Press conference last Saturday.  I do not think the excuse he gave is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, from this side of the House, on our behalf for months past has been urging on the Government the absolute necessity of going over to England and negotiating a trading agreement having regard to the very serious situation developing in Europe. And we did that before the Danes stole a march on Ireland.  Is it any wonder that the Deputy Secretary of O.E.E.C. yesterday gave what must be regarded as a public rebuke to the Taoiseach for a policy that has been proved not to be operative in present circumstances? The Deputy Secretary is, I understand, a man of great independence of view and of thought, who freely expresses his opinions in the European Councils. In addition to that, he knows Irish conditions and has studied Irish conditions in Ireland.  He is largely responsible for the chapters in these economic reports issued by O.E.E.C. from time to time about countries such as ours. He said, in effect, that our tariff policy is a failure, that for 25 years we had an economic dictator in the Department of Industry and Commerce relying entirely on the tariffs in the home market, and now conditions exist here which render that state of affairs impossible.</P>
    <P>I say that the Government's policy has entirely failed.  I cannot see in all the plans and policies put forward here in White Papers and Grey Papers and in all the Bills and Acts of the Oireachtas what the proposals for agriculture are.  Agriculture is our only hope.  The Taoiseach says he has great plans for the development of State capital expenditure.  I wish him success in that.  State capital expenditure was started by us in the sense that we developed it from practically nothing to something where we had sufficient work here to approach almost the point of full employment at one stage in our career as Government.</P>
    <P>We were denounced, of course, by <Col N="1595" /> all the economists, by the bankers and by Fianna Fáil because of our programme of capital expenditure and our Capital Budget, initiated by Deputy McGilligan when Minister for Finance.  We were told it was bad economics to build hospitals throughout the country to house the people suffering from tuberculosis, who could not get beds after 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration.  We were told it was bad economics to use the capital moneys of this country, the savings of our people, and even to eat into our external assets for the purpose of doing what we, in fact, did: to build sufficient hospitals to enable all our people suffering from tuberculosis to be cured and to reach the position in which we are now where there are too many hospitals because, thanks be to God, most of these people have been cured.</P>
    <P>The economists said it was bad policy to spend our external assets on housing, that we were wasting our time and the country's substance. Nobody was more eloquent than the Minister for Lands in that period of controversy from 1948 to 1954 on our expenditure on social benefits such as housing, hospitals and other matters which did not produce an income but which certainly produced tremendous social benefits and improvements for the ordinary people and which were humanitarian in their endeavour and results.</P>
    <P>This employment was given by us and we rejoice we were able to make it available.  I certainly rejoice.  It was one of the proudest recollections I have that I was sent to the radio by my colleagues in the first inter-Party Government to ask our emigrants to come back from London and elsewhere to do the work available for them here, building houses, hospitals and schools.  They came back to do that work in Ireland.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers will have ample opportunity of criticising us and the things the inter-Party Government did when he or any of his colleagues can get up and have the same boast as I have here to-night&mdash; that only during the period of the first <Col N="1596" /> inter-Party Government was there any stoppage of emigration of any account and that our workers came back to work for Ireland when I went to the radio and asked them to do so.  When they can say that, they will then be entitled to talk about what the inter-Party Government did or did not do or to cricitise our economic and financial policies.</P>
    <P>I have frequently stressed, in connection with the necessity for increasing our export trade, the absolute necessity for a proper foreign policy and a proper outlook in connection with our people abroad.  I have no patience whatever with those people who try to appeal to the lowest instincts of our people by alleging that some of our officials in the Department of External Affairs are doing nothing but attending cocktail parties and wasting time and public money. They are doing a good job, or ought to be doing a good job.  By and large, they have done a good job.  I should like to pay tribute to the officials, not merely of C.T.T. or other semi-State bodies of that kind including Bord Fáilte, but also to the officials of the Department of External Affairs who, unlike some of these State bodies, never get publicity and are never heard of but who, from day to day and all day, are endeavouring to improve the conditions of the country abroad and particularly to promote our trade.</P>
    <P>Foreign policy is not merely confined to the issues of peace and war, however important those issues may be in existing circumstances and in the very dangerous conditions that exist in international affairs at present.  We can, as I have expounded here, play a very strong part and a useful part as a small nation, as a Catholic and entirely Christian nation, in promoting world peace and in doing our best to make our due contribution, as an independent if you like, to promote world peace.  It is not my intention to deal in any great detail with foreign policy in its application to either peace or war.  I want to emphasise that, apart altogether from the question of our relations with other countries so far as either peace or war are concerned, foreign policy has a very important <Col N="1597" /> aspect, and one that should always be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Foreign policy has an important bearing on our trading situation and on our capacity for improving exports. Anybody who has had any experience of international conferences and knows how they are conducted, appreciates the situation as it actually exists. Relations between countries are conducted very largely on an entirely selfish principle&mdash;the principle of: &ldquo;You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.&rdquo;  That is largely the operative principle underlying the foreign policies of nations, big and small.  One thing I have noticed in particular: where Ireland did a good turn for a particular country in a matter in which it was concerned, when Ireland subsequently wanted a good turn done for her, then her previous attitude was very frequently remembered.  That is something that has to be borne in mind in relation to our endeavour to create trading relations with other countries.</P>
    <P>Our foreign policy directly impinges upon that aspect of our economy.  If one does not make friends with countries, big and small, then one cannot hope to have the support and the friendly relations so vital to our economy.  Every country needs friends. Opportunities arise more frequently than people might think wherein this country can be of service even to a big country.  As a result of that, where matters of trade are concerned&mdash;matters, perhaps, of not very great importance to the other country, but of supreme importance to us&mdash;we can draw with confidence upon the draught of goodwill that we have left behind us <i>vis-a-vis</i> our foreign relations. From my experience, that is an aspect of policy of vital concern in connection with the expansion of our economy.</P>
    <P>Some of the Taoiseach's utterances to-night were rather cryptic.  He said we could improve our exports by diverting them to other countries and ignoring theoretical considerations: &ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;allow theoretical considerations to deprive us of our weapons to produce favourable trade relations.&rdquo;  I do not know what these theoretical considerations are.  It <Col N="1598" /> was our experience that we bought vast quantities of goods from certain countries.  Do you think we were able to get anything out of those countries by way of reciprocity?  We were not. We got the minimum of reciprocity. I do not understand the Taoiseach's implication that by approaching the Scandinavian countries, we shall get some form of <i>rapprochement</i> or a continuation of the discussions from the point at which they left off relative to the Free Trade Area.  As I understand him, we are to ask the Scandinavian countries, and certainly Sweden, to give us the benefit of their trade and their discriminatory approach in relation to other people, and we shall give nothing in return.  I do not understand that.</P>
    <P>We were able to point out to certain countries that we bought millions of pounds worth of goods from them and they took only hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of goods from us.  Do you think we could stir them from that position?  More and more it is being borne in upon us that what the Deputy Secretary of OEEC said yesterday is true.  Indeed, when he said it, he was only repeating what Deputy Dillon said long before him: there ought to be a plan between this country and Britain to integrate the British and Irish economies.  We have criticised this Government in the past, and I criticise them again now, for their failure to take advantage of the situation long before this.  I appreciate the Taoiseach and his Ministers going over to London, even belatedly, to try to start negotiations&mdash;I hope something will come of them&mdash;but this is not the time.  The proper time would have been 12 months ago, because that would have been 12 months before the general election.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers go over at a time when the British Government, if one can put credence in rumour and belief in Press reports, are within measurable distance of a general election.  I interpret what happened to the Taoiseach and his colleagues as a polite &ldquo;brush off&rdquo; in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>According to the Taoiseach, we will not touch the Seven.  We cannot touch the Common Market.  Neither can we touch the Free Trade Area in existing <Col N="1599" /> circumstances.  We have done nothing to integrate our economy with the British.  We may find ourselves in the altogether disastrous position in which we will be the only European country not associated with anybody. There exists in this country&mdash;it may be a legacy from our providential escape from active participation in two World Wars and even from any very heavy impact from those wars&mdash;a sort of notion that if we isolate ourselves, we will be immune from the forces operating in international affairs, and particularly from war and from economic conditions.  We are now in danger of being isolated.  It almost looks to me as if people like isolation.  That is a menacing and a dangerous situation in which to find ourselves.  The most powerful and the wealthiest countries in the world have not been able to stand in isolation.</P>
    <P>The distinctive characteristic of most of these European countries right down through the 19th Century, and subsequently, was their insistence upon their separate sovereignties.  We all learned that in our history and in our constitutional law.  Following on the Napoleonic Wars, each country became an entity, a sovereign independent nation.  It insisted on its rights; it forgot its duties.  After the First World War, there was an attempt to bring about some sort of conception or some appreciation of the fact that a country had obligations and duties as well as rights.  If a country insisted upon sovereignty, it had also to remember that that sovereignty brought duties as well as rights.  After the First World War, it was not possible to get that concept accepted.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Second World War, new forces of economic circumstances impinging upon countries forced people to an acceptance of the principle that sovereignty implied obligations as well as rights and that they could not &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  They could not stand in economic isolation.  That is why we have today this movement towards integration of economies, towards the establishment of free markets and common markets, and so forth.  We cannot live in isolation in that economic set-up.  The sooner <Col N="1600" /> people are made to realise that, and to accept it, the better it will be.</P>
    <P>When I was in America, the topic on which I was asked to speak was Ireland's foreign policy.  I spoke at Georgetown University in Washington, to two bodies in New York and at Yale University and I spoke on that subject on all these occasions.  These documents are in existence.  Then, when Deputy Cosgrave was sent, as Minister for External Affairs, to take Ireland's place for the first time at the United Nations, he made a remarkable speech in which he explained our entire foreign policy.  That foreign policy was well conceived, designed and thought out and I say that there was a fund of goodwill created in America towards this country.</P>
    <P>Practically every other country in Europe and in South America was looking to see what this country was going to do as an independent and a young State but a State with a tremendous tradition and respect throughout the world.  We had something to bring to market there, something that we could bring to market, not for material considerations, but something that could have brought tremendous moral value to this country and considerable material value as well.  We had access to a tremendous fund of goodwill which could have been used in the development of our resources here.  As I have said, that announcement of our foreign policy had set up for us a great fund of goodwill. That has now been thrown away but I shall say no more about it at the moment.</P>
    <P>What I do want to draw attention to is what was said by the Tánaiste at Dunshaughlin last Sunday.  The Tánaiste, who is the Minister for Health and the Minister for Welfare all combined, made a speech in Dunshaughlin in the course of which he referred to me and what he called my folly in relation to the External Relations Act.  I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Monday last.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By his folly in repealing the External Relations Act Mr. Costello had prejudiced the right, which had been established under the 1938 Agreement, for our producers to be <Col N="1601" /> given preferential terms against all suppliers, Danes or otherwise, who were not members of the Commonwealth and equal terms with those who were.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that was meant to be a reply to the criticism we made from this side of the House that the Government had failed in their duties to be up and doing in the past 12 months at least and endeavouring to effect a new trade agreement with Great Britain. That is the reply&mdash;that, by his folly, Mr. Costello had prejudiced the preferential terms got under the 1938 Agreement.  We criticised the Government for the time spent cavorting around the country dealing with proportional representation and this is the Government's reply.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Tánaiste implied that under the 1938 Agreement we got preferential treatment over countries that were not members of the Commonwealth.  From that it is implicit that in 1938 this country was not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I am accused of losing all the preferences given to members of the Commonwealth because of that membership and the Minister for Health says that those preferences were got by agreement in 1938.  Those preferential terms were not got as a result of the 1938 Agreement.  They were here in operation from Mr. Cosgrave's time, from 1922 to 1932. and then they were brought into operation again by the Ottawa Agreement of 1932.  They were being kicked about from 1932 to 1938, but, according to the Minister for Health I, through my folly, prejudiced the right of this country to get these preferential terms.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Paddy Hogan, as Minister for Agriculture, got a preferential rate of 10 per cent. for all the agricultural products of this country, long before the general election of 1932. The Minister for Health is not satisfied with that little piece of misrepresentation, but he goes on further.  I pass over certain comments he makes as to why I repealed the External Relations Act and declared the Republic.  He makes wild and entirely false statements as to my reasons for doing that.  Some day I shall give the details of that matter and <Col N="1602" /> categorically deny the allegations made by the Minister for Health that it was because it was of something that was said to me in Canada that I made the change.  Can anybody outside a lunatic asylum believe that there is the slightest bit of truth in these allegations brought in here in answer to the charges we have made that the Government have wasted their time and lost opportunities to prevent the Danes getting inside our farmers in the export of pigs and bacon?</P>
    <P>That is the sort of fraudulent misrepresentation at which the Minister for Health is such an adept.  He goes on and says that I repealed the External Relations Act because I apparently became very impulsive in Canada.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should look up the Government records and he will find there that the decision of the Government to repeal the External Relations Act was taken in August, before I left for Canada at all.  He goes and he says: &ldquo;Because in this grave matter Mr. Costello spoke first and thought afterwards.&rdquo;  I take amusement at that description of myself as being impulsive and taking a running jump at these important matters.</P>
    <P>He goes on and says: &ldquo;In these matters Mr. Costello spoke first and thought afterwards.  Because of his childish and wretched diplomacy, Ireland under his leadership suffered the most grievous harm and when the political, economic and social consequences of that action became apparent, they fell into a panic and the bravos of a few days before ran to London and Paris so as to get the British to mitigate for them the consequences of what they had done.&rdquo;  Parliamentary procedure does not permit me to describe that statement in the way I would describe it outside but I say that Christian charity has no room in the mind of the Minister for Health.  The law of defamation, from the civil point of view, does not exist so far as he is concerned.  There is neither charity nor truth in one single word or one single line of that statement of the Minister for Health.  Not a single word is true.  It is entirely a misrepresentation and a false statement of fact.  It <Col N="1603" /> is both a <i>suggestio falsi</i> and a <i>suppressio veri.</i></P>
    <P>But why is it done?  We accused the present Government, when they told the people that they wished to have a change in the Constitution and to change the electoral system, that they were doing so for the purpose of putting a veil between themselves and the people in order to hide the failure of the Government to do anything during the two years they were in office.  That is why the Minister for Health is doing that now.  There are three elections on now and he wants to get the votes of certain classes of people by defaming me and by making wrong statements about me and my colleagues.  There is not a single word of truth in what the Minister for Health said for the purpose of distracting the attention of the people from the fact that the Government have failed, and failed miserably, to take the steps necessary to safeguard the agricultural industry from&mdash;I was going to use the word &ldquo;depredations&rdquo; but that would be an insulting word&mdash;from the perfectly lawful activity of the Danes which they took while we were asleep and the Government were diverting the attention of the people to something irrelevant. There are three by-elections on and the Minister for Health made an utterly fraudulent statement about me and my colleagues.  There is not a single word of truth in it.</P>
    <P>Are we to assume that the Minister for Health is following his colleague Deputy Boland in saying &ldquo;When the repeal of the External Relations Act was going through this House I was against it and could not speak against it.&rdquo;  Why was there a civil war brought about in connection with these matters? Is it not proper to ask that if the Minister for Health objects to what I did and says, that we jeopardised the rights of this country to get the preferential treatment given to every member of the Commonwealth of Nations, if that was something prejudicially affecting this country, its economy and the people and particularly the agricultural industry, why do this strong Government not repeal that Act?  They have a strong Government.  They have been <Col N="1604" /> in office twice since that Act was passed.  If the Minister for Health is right that the repeal of the External Relations Act prejudiced our rights to get preferential treatment, why was it not in turn repealed?</P>
    <P>I should just like to pass this last remark before commenting on another matter.  I should like the Taoiseach, his colleagues, and the House, and through the House the country, to know that if the External Relations Act had not been repealed, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, then President of Ireland and now ex-President, could not have gone to the United States of America as the Head of this State.  We are told by the Government and by their spokesmen of the wonderful economic results gained by the visit of Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly to America.  I hope they will come about.  I have nothing but respect for Mr. O'Kelly but he could not have got most of these benefits if the External Relations Act had not been repealed because he would not have been the head of this State and could not have been received by Mr. Eisenhower.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health now says that we prejudiced the right of this country to get these benefits, privileges or preferences, that we suffered the most abject humiliation.  What did we do?  We went to discuss in London and Paris what would be the consequences of the repeal of the External Relations Act and how they could be best met.  It was agreed that so far as this country was concerned if the External Relations Act was repealed and this country recognised, as it was, subsequently, as a Republic, we would be in exactly the same position economically, and from the point of view of mutual intercourse, as citizens of Ireland, as British subjects; we would have mutual rights and get the same preferential rights as Canada and New Zealand.  That was what we got and the Minister for Health in order to get votes and to divert the attention of the people, sinks so low as to make use of words of that kind, no single one of which was true.  Nothing in the speech he made so far as it concerns me or my colleagues in relation to the repeal of the External Relations <Col N="1605" /> Act, or the consequences which followed from it, has the slightest basis of truth.</P>
    <P>It secured the benefits of what used to be known as Commonwealth preferences for this country, mutual recognition of British subjects in this country and Irish citizens in Great Britain.  Everything was exactly the same as before from the point of view of our relations with Great Britain, except that we laid a better basis for abiding friendship with Great Britain than had been there before and in addition, and above all, we put a stop to the kind of gunmanship which had been going on for years under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the problem of Partition and I mention it only for the purpose of expressing my agreement with what he said in practically every respect.  I do not think that much will come of this offer at present.  As in the case of everything else, time will have to elapse before the relations between this part of the country and the Six Counties can be on any proper basis.  What the people of this part of the country want is to forget the past and that is where the Minister for Health so far failed in his duty as to drag up these matters.  The people want to forget the past and look beyond to the problems of the future. Until existing personalities who were involved in the Civil War, and in the activities of the years subsequent to it, have passed from the political scene, and until those people in the North who similarly have their roots deep in the controversies of 1912 and controversies previous and subsequent to that, have gone and until a more Christian outlook obtains in the North than exists at present among the majority of the people there, we cannot hope to have much progress.</P>
    <P>I do agree most sincerely with the Taoiseach that every effort should be made to improve trading conditions between the two areas.  There is no use repeating what has been said so often that an Ireland united in friendship with England would be a tremendous force for peace in the world and would bring great advantages to every <Col N="1606" /> part of Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>England by itself is not a self-contained economic entity.  Neither is this part of Ireland which is at present under our jurisdiction and certainly neither is the Six Counties.  The Six Counties is suffering from serious economic problems which can be solved only by the subventions and the help it gets from Great Britain and from politicians in Great Britain.  We can solve some of our problems by unification in Ireland or by joint effort, pending unification, to solve our economic problems.</P>
    <P>If we could secure, pending, or without prejudice to, ultimate unification, some sort of agreement for mutual trade then we could bring advantages to both countries but even if we were united in one Parliament and as one country we would still have economic problems.  England is not a self-contained economic unit by itself but Ireland and England together would be nearer to a self-contained economic unit and if our economic and financial policies were integrated, we would have very considerable hopes of a greater increase in prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most remarkable feature of the speech we have just listened to from Deputy Costello is the fact that not for the whole hour and a half during which he has spoken has he suggested any radically different policy from that advocated by the present Government. We heard him rave about statements made by Ministers on this side of the House.  We have heard him refer to the urgent necessity for expanding exports.  We heard him talk about what he regards as an apprehensive position in relation to the balance of payments.  We have heard no mention of an alternative policy, we have heard no elaborate detailed dissection of the Programme for Economic Expansion.  Deputy Costello did not suggest even in any indirect way that the Programme was grossly deficient.  He did not even take the trouble to examine its major features and suggest that they were unrealistic and that insufficient capital was being offered for its implementation <Col N="1607" /> or that they were hypocritical in character or that they were glossing over realities.  We have had an hour and a half of oratory from the Head of the Opposition and, as I said, during that entire period the Programme for Economic Expansion on which the Government rests in relation to its economic policy did not come in for any serious criticism.</P>
      <P>On other occasions we have heard Fine Gael Deputies say that the Programme was of their own devising. Some Fine Gael Deputies have denied that any Programme existed; but when Deputy Costello had the opportunity of saying something new, of turning over all the policies framed in that document and of saying: &ldquo;Well, the situation has changed since it was written, something much more is required, the programme is pale now in comparison with what is needed,&rdquo; we heard nothing.  I think it is the best possible comment one could make on the attitude of the Opposition in general.</P>
      <P>Suggestions were made by Deputy Costello that we should stop speaking of what we believed to be the attitude of the Coalition towards the balance of payments problem when they were in office&mdash;as though we were speaking in bad faith, as though we were raking up the past with evil intent.  At the same time, during the whole of Deputy Costello's speech, he made accusation after accusation against the Government. He made suggestions of dereliction of duty, without the faintest evidence to support it.  For example, he made the deliberate accusation against the Government that because we had a Referendum on Proportional Representation, the negotiations with Great Britain in connection with our trade were taking place at too late a day.  Deputy Costello can hardly expect us to whitewash all the deficiencies of his Government and forget the past and apparently to refrain from what is regarded as the ordinary rough and tumble of politics in which Parties criticise each other and each other's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that, he comes out with what I would describe as a damnable statement against the present Government <Col N="1608" /> in regard to the present negotiations. The position is&mdash;and I hope it is well known to the country&mdash;that from the time the negotiations on the Free Trade Area commenced, until yesterday, the Government have received at constant and continuous intervals the most detailed reports on every phase of those negotiations.  As most people in the country know, we had the opportunity of attending negotiations in relation to the establishment of the Free Trade Area.  The Government has received constant reports from all our diplomatic agents in regard to the trends of thought and the variations of opinion and all the conflicting ideas that have characterised first of all the Free Trade Area negotiations and later, their limitation to the Common Market and later still the opening of negotiations for the Seven.</P>
    <P>The Government decision as to the point at which it was wise to engage in trade discussions with Great Britain is based on what we think offers the best advantage to the country.  If at any time we thought the negotitaions along those lines should be proceeded with earlier we naturally would have taken action.  At no time did our examination of any other phases of our policy&mdash;either the Presidential Election or the Referendum&mdash;prevent the Members of the Government, individually and collectively, from studying the continuous mass of reports made available to us and of having frequent discussion at stated intervals on what was best to be done under given circumstances. It is absolutely childish to suggest that automatically we should have engaged in these negotiations at a certain period before the present period.  There is no evidence to support it.  Anyone who has watched the whole of the complicated proceedings that have taken place in Europe for the past 24 months would have known how difficult it is to introduce an examination of trade relations between this country and Great Britain and how to judge the propitious moment.  I want to make that clear, because when I hear Deputy Costello's reference to the Minister for Health interpreting a phase of history and when I hear him afterwards accuse us <Col N="1609" /> virtually of being traitors to the interests of the country, naturally I cannot but feel indignant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has once more suggested that the Suez crisis was responsible for the economic recession in 1956 and that the Government had no act or part in it.  Therefore, he tries to show that the difficulties we have faced since that time in reestablishing the economy are non-existent or vaporous, because in fact they were not responsible for the crisis.  I do not want to go over the ground covered many times before on that matter, except to say that it is a fact that other countries did not suffer the same depression as this country suffered at that time and that countries that had lost all their savings during the second World War, countries that had been devastated and that had to restore their economy and had to undergo deprivations were able to survive 1956 with flying colours, expand their exports and increase employment.  I repeat that the failure of the Coalition Government to look after the balance of payments situation in 1951 was one of the originating causes for there being a ridiculously low level of bank reserves in 1956, resulting in the difficulty of facing a trade crisis which should not have been serious under our circumstances.  If the finances of the country had been handled properly during the two periods of Coalition Government, there is no reason why we should not have had sufficient reserves in this country with which to meet a change in the terms of trade to which Deputy Costello referred.</P>
    <P>It was their lack of consideration for the retention of ultimate reserves at a previous period which was one of the major causes of the crisis.  We recall the time when in 1951 if anybody in Fianna Fáil suggested that there should be a very ample reserve to meet just the kind of crisis that eventuated in 1956 he was laughed at and told he was un-Irish.  It was considered to be almost a mortal sin to speak of having ample reserves to meet a situation in which the costs of imports suddenly rose in relation to the value of exports. We heard a great deal about it in 1951. So long as you dissipated war-time <Col N="1610" /> savings you had the green flag wrapped around you, according to the members of the Inter-Party Government.  The Coalition Government in 1956 would dearly have loved to have had some of the savings dissipated in 1951.  That is the position and we do not say that even if there had been these reserves there might not still have been difficulties, but that they could have been more easily overcome.</P>
    <P>We also heard Deputy Costello suggesting that we criticised the capital expenditure required for the housing programme and the hospital programme that was engendered in 1948. I have always said, and I still reiterate it, that, if at the end of the war far more of the savings made during the war and the immense internal reserves then accumulated, had been spent on increasing production, profits from that production would have been sufficient to carry out the building programme without using savings.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil initiated the housing drive and the hospital drive, and we naturally wished to see these schemes completed but the fact remains that money was spent on housing that could have been spent on industry and on agriculture during the period of office of the first Coalition Government and if so spent, there would have been ample reserves as a result of increased employment and the spending of money to carry out the same programme out of production profits.  That is all we ever said about the matter, but it is typical of the Coalition to go back to the past and try to excuse themselves for their deficiencies at that time.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Costello has suggested that because of the referendum we in the Government have failed to work for better production conditions, for a revival of the economy and a resurgence of the economy.  The fact is that almost never before have there been so many Bills placed before the House for increasing the amount of credit for industry and trade as during that period; and all for stimulating these incentives for exports, for greater promotion of exports, providing new agencies and for stirring the ambition of our producers to engage in new industries. <Col N="1611" /> Never before, except perhaps during the early period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932 and 1933, were so many new measures devised in a short space of time to stimulate the economy.  These measures were processed to a very large degree during the time when we were debating the referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Costello should exaggerate what he described as the disturbing effect the referendum had upon most of the people.  The only disturbance which took place, was in this House.  The only violent conflicts were in this House.  I think that the people took the referendum amazingly quietly.  They debated it amongst themselves and I never saw any evidence at public meetings of bitter feelings. I never saw any evidence at public meetings or in the course of any associations which I had at the time of bitter feelings because of the referendum or that people with ambition had suddenly stopped thinking, or stopped criticising the Government about economic matters, or stopped thinking of new ways and means of developing the economy.  In all the journeys I made to stimulate afforestation and fishing when visiting the voluntary associations to which the Taoiseach so rightly paid tribute, I never found it impossible to do useful work because there was to be a referendum on proportional representation. I regard all that as utter nonsense.  The people took all those discussions very calmly and quietly and to suggest that it created a sort of bitterness among the people which was not there before is absolutely ludicrous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major features of Deputy Costello's speech was his insistence on the necessity for expanding agricultural production and he once again gave the people of the country the idea that Fine Gael alone were responsible for agricultural development in this country.  He failed to mention the proposals in the <i>Programme For Economic Expansion</i> relating to agriculture.  He failed to <Col N="1612" /> criticise them.  He did not suggest there were any great omissions.  He implied, by not saying it, that the programme was satisfactory, and yet, at the same time, he asked what were the Government doing about agriculture. He suggested that the fact that there were no Bills before the House in relation to agriculture indicated a lack of activity.</P>
      <P>It so happens that partly because of war-time controls and partly because of the rather comprehensive nature of agricultural legislation already in force, a great many new policies can be engendered in the Department of Agriculture without reference to legislation and Deputy Costello should know that as well as anybody else.</P>
      <P>He made no criticism of the Government's decision with regard to the development of the livestock trade as being of the utmost importance and it should receive new stimulus of a kind never received before at any time because of the growing demand for meat products by the more prosperous sections of the English population and the populations of other countries.  He made no criticism of our decisions to subsidise fertilisers.  He did not mention our decision to engage in experiments conducted as rapidly as possible to enable better breeding of livestock or to our decision to expedite and intensify work on better grasslands.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies in Fine Gael tried to ridicule the Government by suggesting they have changed their policy.  The position is quite clear.  We advocated tillage; we took on a tremendous tillage drive and we established cash prices for farmers' crops and the job was so reasonably well done, at least in most parts of the country, that Deputy Dillon who would not be seen dead in a field of wheat found himself with a surplus of wheat in the last year he was in office which apparently was unmanageable because he left it to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having done that job of encouraging tillage, we felt, having regard to present economic conditions that the expansion of livestock was the most valuable work we could encourage.  The Opposition so frequently say that all <Col N="1613" /> good agricultural policy was theirs that we have to repeat almost <i>ad nauseam</i> for the benefit of the younger electors and the younger people the policies devised by Fianna Fáil to expand the agricultural industry.  Repetition perhaps might be unnecessary, were it not that there is a growing generation of people in the country who may not have studied political history sufficiently.  This usual Fine Gael claptrap about our disregard for agriculture has to be answered at frequent intervals until, I hope, for all time the people are convinced of the truth.</P>
    <P>The list of policies devised by Fianna Fáil, and which have since been incorporated in the Economic Programme, is somewhat long.  Deputy Costello will not be allowed to make these kinds of charges without their being fully answered.  We have to go back a long time to see the long list of devices and decisions taken.  I have in mind the decision to provide a minimum price for milk; the guaranteed price for wheat; the expansion of the beet credits; the decision to increase the number of agricultural advisers.  I have in mind the Farm Buildings Scheme whose regulations were prepared in 1947 and not by the Coalition Government as has frequently been suggested by Coalition Deputies; the establishment of the soil analysis service at Johnstown Castle; the establishment of the first cattle breeding centres, the first pilot ground limestone scheme established in County Wexford in 1947; the land reclamation scheme established in 1939 and mechanised and extended later by Deputy Dillon when petrol and machinery were available.  I have in mind a great deal of the very useful work done under that scheme and well remembered by farmers.</P>

      <P>I have in mind the bog development schemes to help farmers, that were initiated by Fianna Fáil.  I have in mind the first major subsidies for fertilisers that were created last year.  A great many credit <Col N="1614" /> facilities were provided for the purchase, for instance, of farm machinery&mdash;and other credit schemes were extended by the Fianna Fáil Government. Furthermore, the Fianna Fáil Government Department of Agriculture is co-operating fully with the National Farmers' Association through the subsidy for fertilisers and the present plan for the retention of heifers and in the advance of credit by the commercial banks for that purpose.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that it is during the time of the present Government which is supposed by Deputy Costello to have created instability, to have created an atmosphere in which people think of an impending general election, that the commercial banks for the first time have engaged in credit schemes of a specific character, designed to increase production on a specific basis.  They have introduced credit schemes in which the normal type of security is not required and on a common sense basis.  Those credit schemes have been taken advantage of.</P>
      <P>Apparently our small farmers do not find that instability in our economic life which was suggested by Deputy Costello.  In one town in my constituency one bank alone has advanced £50,000 mostly to medium-sized and small-sized farmers for the retention of heifers.  The farmers are engaged in the improvement of their grasslands. They are buying larger quantities of fertilisers because of the subsidy.  They are helping to increase their stock density.  When the operation is completed it will help in the campaign so urgently demanded by Deputy Costello to increase our livestock exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that effort does not suggest instability or that the country is teetering on the edge of a crisis.  It suggests that a great many small farmers and large farmers as well have abundant confidence in our future.  I mention small farmers because it is delightful to find that this scheme is being considered by small farmers who naturally need to expand their production from the standpoint of their family income as rapidly as they can in the face of modern conditions and the demands for a better standard of living.  It does not suggest that they feel the instability <Col N="1615" /> to which Deputy Costello referred. Nor is it true that the country people believe they are facing an inevitable general election or that the result of the Referendum has produced a sense of uneasiness in the mind of the Government as to its future. Month by month, every member of the Government concerned with production is trying to encourage confidence and ambition in the minds of the people and doing the best we can to stimulate their imagination, knowing full well that the Programme for Economic Expansion can never succeed unless the hundreds and thousands of producers, big and small, feel a sense of confidence and have a sense of faith in the future.</P>
    <P>Not for a single moment at any time since that programme has been published, have members of the Government failed in their obligation to keep in touch with the community at large and to try to make the programme live so that, apart from remaining a dull State document, it is something that breeds hope in the minds of the people and gives genuine encouragement to producers and potential industrialists.  None of us could ever feel entirely satisfied with our efforts in that regard.  It is literally impossible to do too much in the direction of that kind of stimulation. No matter what efforts any member of the Government would make, he would always feel he might have made more.  It is a matter of doing one's best and always of feeling in some way inadequate because of the gigantic task to be performed if we are to get our production up sufficiently to provide the kind of employment we would like to see available in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello suggested, by implication, that if his Government were in office the position would be different.  He made no proposals.  He made no alternative suggestions as to what he would do.  He knows perfectly well that in a rural community it takes time to bring about permanent expansion.  It is easy enough to spend a couple of hundred million pounds on non-productive projects <Col N="1616" /> which have no lasting value and then to go boast of an increase in employment but in a rural community it must take time to bring about the right kinds of results.</P>
    <P>It is amusing to hear Deputy Costello criticise Deputies on this side of the House for blaming him as being in part responsible for the 1956 crisis and at the same time his colleagues go ceaselessly round the country saying that every promise made by Fianna Fáil at the general election was broken.  They go to great means to quote the blueprints for expansion that were published in the year before the election as proof that we had broken our promises.  One of the most remarkable features about the development of policy by the Government since 1956 has been that the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> follows to very large extent many of the policies advocated in the blue-print&mdash;policies that were subjects for study and examination, that were encouragements to economic thinkers. If any Opposition Deputy compares the Programme for Economic Expansion with the final suggestions made in October, 1956, he will find that a very large number of the suggestions then made have been put into operation. All the incentive to aid industry, suggested in the later document, have been implemented, and more besides.</P>
    <P>A great many of the proposals for aiding agriculture have been put into operation, proposals for studying better marketing opportunities, reflected in the decision of the Government to study very carefully the proposals of the Agricultural Marketing Committee on the pig trade. for example.  Deputies will find that in fact the study made of the kind of policies we needed to develop our economy in the year before the general election proves that the forecasts then made, allowing for the changes in the economic conditions that took place in the interval, were remarkably accurate and that the prediction of the amount of capital, private and public, that would have to be raised to expand the economy were not inaccurate, allowing for the fact that we had no opportunity <Col N="1617" /> at that time to examine all the facts which are only available to a Government when in office.</P>
    <P>We have made a maximum effort to encourage investment.  We have guaranteed, for the first time, for a period of five years, the capital for both industry and agriculture.  For the first time, both industrialists and farmers have been promised a stable economic policy, the capital for which is guaranteed as far as anything can be guaranteed in this world.  We believe that, if there is ambition and if there is a desire on the part of the industrial and agricultural community to take advantage of the capital offered and the incentives offered, we should make progress.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that since 1956, while conditions have improved, they have not improved sufficiently for our liking.  We have had to face many difficult conditions.  For example, the number of persons employed in housing and in ancillary industries connected therewith have been decreasing for a very considerable period.  It is interesting to note that the Coalition Government during their second period of office showed no evidence that they were making the kind of provision which would have been required and which should have been made in the very first year of their office, if they expected to replace the employment in housing in local authority areas where it was known that the needs of housing were being rapidly met.  That was work which should have begun in 1954 because at that time there was evidence that, even allowing for expanding the school building programme, for example, which we have been doing, for carrying on with sewerage and water schemes and for re-examining all the housing needs of areas where at one time it had been thought enough houses had been built, there would be a decline in housing activities.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest difficulties we have had to face is that we will have to re-employ an equivalent number of persons, who have lost their employment because of the actual completion of housing schemes, in industrial or other employment before we can claim an overall increase in employment. <Col N="1618" /> This will inevitably be a difficult task. The Minister for Local Government has been examining again the housing needs of the country.  He has been examining ways and means of expanding other building works as far as possible.  The Government have again been examining the question of building in Dublin and the difficulties connected therewith.</P>
    <P>Because of that, we must have an industrial drive of an intensity which, quite apart from developing the country's resources, will compensate for the losses arising from the completion of the normal post-war building programme which was very intensive while it lasted, in respect of which I should think near European records of building were established, and which inevitably left a problem when the housing was completed.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what the Taoiseach said, that there is undoubtedly a better spirit in the country than in 1956.  There is, unquestionably. There are far more people engaged in voluntary work and in private effort to think of new ways and means of expanding the economy than ever before in the history of this country.  No matter where one goes, people can be found interested in considering how the economy can be expanded, interested in applying science to agriculture, and interested in finding ways and means of self-help in many areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best example of that I can give, because I am most nearly associated with it, is the expansion of the tourist industry in relation to angling.  It may not be a very important factor in the whole of the programme but the fact is that there are some 40 committees throughout the country consisting of people most of whom gain nothing from their work helping to build up an industry which should eventually bring £2,000,000 more into the country.  The expansion of the tourist angling undertaking is an indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there are people who really do believe in the future of the country.  It is interesting <Col N="1619" /> to note also that, in spite of this tremendous blast from Deputy Costello, that the major producers associations in this country have no major fault to find with the Programme for Economic Expansion.  If they had, we surely would have heard it.  If the National Farmers' Association, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers or any of the other producer groups felt that the programme was a fraud, that it was nothing but a White Paper, that there was no real capital behind it, that there was no real ambition on the part of the Government to see that it was implemented, we would have heard from them.  The fact remains they have not so stated and the Government rely upon their Programme for Economic Expansion and on the amount of capital offered as a justification for the rightness of its policy and for its confidence in the future.</P>

      <P>We have had a speech from the Minister for Lands and it must be perfectly clear to the few Deputies of the Fianna Fáil side who listened to the Minister that, now that the Taoiseach is the only Fianna Fáil Deputy in the House, it is a remarkable thing that the Minister for Lands at least appears perfectly satisfied with the Minister for Lands.  I do not think this House has been treated for many years to a more self-complacent speech from a complacent Deputy than we have heard from the Minister for Lands.  He ends up a speech this evening by reference to the angling clubs in the country.  One would imagine that angling in Ireland started only when Deputy Childers became Minister for Lands and Fisheries two years ago.  We are told it is a gratifying thing to learn that there are now 40 different angling clubs in Ireland, the inference being that every group of anglers in this country, who form themselves into an angling association, are in some way furthering the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that so far as inland fisheries are concerned, that is, ordinary angling, the only person, since the State was formed, who did anything worthwhile for angling was Deputy Dillon <Col N="1620" /> when he established the Inland Fisheries Trust in 1949, but the present Minister disregards all that. Apparently, he asks this House to believe that time started in 1956 when he was given charge of this important Ministry.  I mention that because it is symptomatic of the complacency expressed here this evening by the Minister for Lands which I fear is one of the problems facing the present Government.</P>
    <P>All of them are perfectly satisfied with themselves.  The country is going well.  Everything is fine and it does not much matter that nobody outside quite agrees with them.  I would urge the Taoiseach, if he achieves nothing else in his Government, at least to have a bit of spring-cleaning mentally.  Let him try to get his Government to realise that things are not going well and that there is a problem still to be faced.  Whatever inroads may have been made upon them, the problems facing the country are very serious indeed.  They will not be solved by the kind of Coue-ism the Minister for Lands expects the country to indulge in.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The Taoiseach's Party took office a little over two years ago.  They took office as a result of a general election, the pitch of which and the issues in which were largely dictated in the circumstances then obtaining by the Taoiseach.  As the spokesman for the Opposition at the time, he elected to make the unemployment and emigration problem the keystone of the election.  It was his decision at the last election that the phrase that unemployment was to be the test of Government policy was created, put before the people by him and at his suggestion the people were asked to condemn the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that it was his mind and his plan that throughout the country, and particularly throughout the city, Irish voters were told by means of Fianna Fáil posters that they could vote themselves a job by merely taking a pencil in their hand and voting for Fianna Fáil candidates.  Two and a quarter years ago, we had Fianna Fáil posters throughout the country advising women to get their <Col N="1621" /> men to work by voting Fianna Fáil. At the last election, a clear case was made that unemployment could be solved by the election of a Fianna Fáil Government.  Indeed, on the eve of the last election, the Taoiseach stated, with all the confidence and emphasis of which he is capable, that, beginning next week, a Fianna Fáil Government would work relentlessly for the ending of unemployment.</P>
    <P>These are the considerations which must arise some 28 months later.  The man who was the architect of the Fianna Fáil election campaign in 1957 now presides over the Party as its Leader and as the Head of a Government. We are entitled to know in what way these promises, so liberally made, have been satisfied in the past 28 months.  I do not propose to engage in discussing figures here.  We do know that in so far as the latest available figures disclose, there are fewer people in employment than there were two years ago.  That, perhaps, does not signify.</P>
    <P>We also know that in the past 28 months, there have been a considerable number of our people who voted for Fianna Fáil, we may assume, to get a job at home in Ireland, who have had to emigrate.  Possibly spokesmen on behalf of the Government may say that it is not possible to prove what the emigration figures may be.  I can see that but I do assert that in the past 28 months, so far as the impressions available to anyone are concerned, the emigration tide has not diminished.</P>
    <P>If after all that is said, it still appears that we have a large unemployment figure in this country, we in the Fine Gael Party, the main Opposition here in this House, are entitled to know what effectively has been done by the Fianna Fáil Party to carry out the pledges they made.  The Minister for Lands is quite happy about it.  He says there is the plan for economic recovery and all the rest of it.  His speech puts me in mind of a speech made by the Taoiseach when he was on this side of the House some years ago, when he said that plans and blueprints do not put men to work.  They may intend to do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> They may be evidence of good intentions but where is the evidence in providing a job for a fellow out of work in this city or elsewhere throughout the country?</P>
    <P>I do not mention these things in order to suggest that the Government have not been doing their work as well as they can do it.  I am sure that they are as concerned as anyone else is about the problems facing the country. I mention it in order to demonstrate how wrong their campaign was 28 months ago, how wrong it was for them to suggest to decent Irish people that they could vote themselves good times by simply putting into office a Fianna Fáil Government, how wrong it was for them to suggest to the people in Drimnagh, Kimmage and elsewhere in Dublin City, some of whom will vote tomorrow, that it was possible for them to get their boys a job here at home merely by voting for the Fianna Fáil candidates.  It is proven now that that campaign was wrong and I believe that those who indulged in it realised that it was an election gimmick and that if it met the situation it was worth doing.</P>
    <P>It is worth also recalling now, 28 months later, that the other plank in the Fianna Fáil election campaign was in relation to what was termed by Fianna Fáil the financial crisis facing the country.  People were told by means of multicoloured posters that they could beat the crisis by voting Fianna Fáil and the crisis 28 months ago, in Fianna Fáil terminology, was because we had throughout 1956 a balance of payments difficulty.  Neither the Taoiseach nor his colleagues at that time were prepared to accept that the then Government had taken the appropriate steps to deal with that situation and an air of insecurity about the future, an air of doubt and uncertainty, was created by the Fianna Fáil Party.  People were led to believe, 28 months ago, that Ireland's future was black indeed and that even though they held down a good job now it was a wise thing to get out lest their job might not pay them a living wage in a short time.  All that atmosphere of crisis was created because it was felt. <Col N="1623" /> 28 months ago, that it would suit the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Again, we are entitled to know what is the present situation.  When the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party was elected as Taoiseach, with a new Fianna Fáil Government, on the 20th March, 1957, his Minister for Finance took over the financial situation, which it is now admitted was well under control.  The steps taken by the inter-Party Government in 1956 yielded a result in 1957 and at the end of that year the balance of payments was in order.  We are entitled to know now why is it, 28 months later, that we are again running into a balance of payments difficulty.  We do not say it is approaching crisis dimensions.  We put it as it was put today by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The facts are now, 28 months later, that this country is buying more than she is selling and again we are entitled to know in what way the present Fianna Fáil Government have faced up to that situation.  Of course, we know that they are in certain political difficulties about whatever lack of balance there may be in our balance of payments because they turned their back on the measures taken by the inter-Party Government, &ldquo;too little and too late&rdquo;.  They have made it impossible for a Fianna Fáil Government to impose import levies, as had been imposed in 1956, and possibly there is a certain amount of wishful thinking that things will turn out all right.  I hope they will but, certainly at the moment there is some explanation due to the people.</P>
    <P>I mention these two matters of unemployment and balance of payments as being two of the features of the last general election, 28 months ago, which do not appear to have diminished in any way since the change of Government took place.  I have little doubt that if the present Taoiseach and his Party were on the right hand side of the Chair the reason that would be given as to why these things had not been solved would be that there was an inter-Party Government in office, that such a Government could not agree on a policy and would have internal <Col N="1624" /> difficulties.  That excuse, if excuse it be, is not available to any member of Fianna Fáil.  They asked for, and they obtained from the people, a majority sufficient for them to enforce and to operate any policy that they desire to operate.  Nevertheless, these problems still remain.</P>
    <P>I do not say that things are not better in the country.  I believe they are better.  I think they will probably improve.  I believe they would improve much more quickly and a great deal sooner if there were a change of Government.  I think things have improved since 1956, which was a black and difficult year for the country and I believe it would have been as black and as difficult, irrespective of what Government was in office.  I think it is true to say now, three years later, that there is an improvement in industry and in business.  There is evidence that foreign capital is becoming available for industry.  I have little doubt that there are many industrial projects ready and about to go into operation and I should like to stress that that did not all come about in the last 28 months.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the improvement in our condition is a result of wise decisions taken by two successive inter-Party Governments in the past ten years.  It was not a Fianna Fáil Government that established the Industrial Development Authority.  In fact, if the truth were known, a Fianna Fáil Government might have succeeded in abolishing such an authority.  It was not a Fianna Fáil Government that established Córas Tráchtála, nor was it a Fianna Fáil Government that conceived the idea, and put it into operation, of providing tax incentives for persons engaged in the export trade. I think it is true to say that in many ways in recent years efforts have been made, initiated largely by the two successive inter-Party Governments and continued by Fianna Fáil Governments, which are beginning to have an effect now.  If that improvement continues it certainly will be welcomed but I have little doubt that, when such improvements take place, we shall have Deputies like the Minister for Lands coming along in future years seeking to say it was all due to the fact that <Col N="1625" /> a Fianna Fáil Government were in office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, shortly after he was elected by this House, gave a Press interview in which he expressed the wish that the level of debate in this House might be higher, and that we could discuss here and elsewhere our differences in points of views in a more reasonable and proper fashion. Most Deputies would and did express their agreement with what the Taoiseach said.  The reason I refer to the Taoiseach's remarks at that time is that not very long after he issued that statement, a member of his own Party, to my mind, appeared to ignore the recommendation and advice given by the Taoiseach, and I would strongly recommend the Taoiseach to look at the report of a speech made by a certain Deputy which appears in Column 605, Volume 176, of the Official Report.  I hope, when he has read that Report, he will take that Deputy aside and repeat his advice to him.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, Deputy J.A. Costello referred to a speech made last Sunday by the Minister for Health in Dunshaughlin.  I was in the unhappy position of being a member of the Minister's audience.  I cannot profess to repeat in detail precisely what he said but I am prepared to go by the report of his speech which I saw subsequently in the following morning's papers.  It seemed to me that the Minister appeared profoundly dissatisfied with the definition of this country's status in 1949 as that of an Irish Republic.  It appeared to me that he felt that was a mistaken step and, in his opinion, that decision caused, and was causing, this part of the country injury and harm.</P>
    <P>The Republic of Ireland Act was passed through this House in 1949 unanimously.  Every Deputy in the House supported it and the Taoiseach, speaking from this side of the House, expressed his profound regret that it was not introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It has now been in operation for ten years and, during that period, we in the Republic have received representatives from other nations proudly accredited to our President, and we have sent our <Col N="1626" /> Ambassadors abroad bearing a document signed by Uachtarán na hÉireann.  We have also, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, sent our President to the American Republic as the head of a State, and in the past ten years we have earned respect and recognition for the fact that we are not merely in our own eyes but in the eyes of others an independent, sovereign Republic.</P>
    <P>I also thought that even those amongst our citizens who might not have agreed with the decision taken in 1949 had learned to accept it and to respect our status as an independent, sovereign Republic.  Therefore, it gives grounds for some concern to find &mdash;not a Fianna Fáil backbencher who disclosed a particular point of view two weeks ago, but this time a senior member of the Government&mdash;the Tánaiste, stating as he did last Sunday, that this was a profound mistake which caused and was causing harm to this country.  I should like to know what policy this Government are following?  Is there to be leadership? Will the new Taoiseach, if he cannot get the Minister for Health to toe the national line, at least ensure he is muzzled and not permitted to make nationally harmful speeches such as that again?  I think it is shameful that every time we in this country proceed to achieve, even from different approaches, a common national outlook, somebody is always prepared to rake up the cinders in order to fan a flame for some purpose of his own.  The Minister for Health, in Dunshaughlin last Sunday, was not concerned about any ill-effects from the Republic of Ireland Act because he voted for it. Through his deputy leader at that time he expressed regret that he had not a hand in passing it.  He was not concerned about that; he was concerned merely in trying to get a few people who had forgotten an incident of ten years ago to remember it when they go to vote to-morrow morning.  I do not know that that effort will achieve what it was intended to achieve; perhaps it will, perhaps not, but I have little doubt that the speech of the Tánaiste has not been conducive to the advancement of this country.</P>
    <P>We know that within the last three <Col N="1627" /> weeks, since the Taoiseach was elected as leader of the Government, one ex-Minister, now a back bencher, expressed profound disagreement with what was the Fianna Fáil policy in relation to this country's possible associations outside.  We now have a member of the Government also expressing profound disagreement with this country's present status.  I should like to know if it is the policy of Fianna Fáil&mdash;I shall leave aside Fianna Fáil back benchers because I know one of them has a particular view on this&mdash;to put this country back into the Commonwealth and if it is not, why is the Minister for Health not asked to resign from the Government?</P>
    <P>Although as a Party we were chided because we were associated with other Parties in forming a Government at least our view has always been clear on what we stood for and what we believed and we have never permitted, while we were in Government, a doubt to exist in the minds of the people as to what Government policy was.  I hope the Taoiseach will take it upon himself at the conclusion of this debate to define clearly what the policy of this Government is in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>I must again refer to the Minister for Health but I do so not in relation to his mental aberration at Dunshaughlin last Sunday, but in relation to his responsibilities in his own Department. I know it would not be proper for me to discuss in any detail the policy of individual Ministers and I do not propose to do so in relation to the Minister for Health, but I should like to recall to the House that when the Estimate for the Department of Health was taken earlier in this session I suggested to the Minister for Health that it would be wise for him to consider meeting members of the Irish Medical Association to discuss whatever difficulties might exist between them and his Department.</P>

      <P>I accept that and I am not in any way countering that view of yours but I submit that the Taoiseach is responsible for the manner in which he ordains the business of the Government and I am suggesting that I am in order in directing the Taoiseach's attention to the situation which one of his Ministers, the Minister for Health, has permitted to arise between himself and the I.M.A.  I take it I am in order in so doing?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in supplement to his reply of 2nd December, 1958, he will estimate for each of the years 1959/60 to 1963/64 (inclusive) the cost of (a) the interest charge, and (b) the sinking fund (indicating also, if possible, for each of the said years the amount likely to be received by way of interest on exchequer advances) on the assumption (1) that in each of the said years half of the amount estimated on page 50 of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to be financed from Exchequer and non-Exchequer sources is borrowed on the same terms as those on which the latest national loan was raised, and (2) that in each of the said years the whole of the amount so estimated is similarly borrowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumptions the Deputy wishes to make, close approximations to the figures for the debt charges can be obtained by increasing the figure for 1958/59, viz. £24.634 million, by 7% (interest 5½%, sinking fund 1½%) of (1) half of the amounts referred to in the question in respect of each of the years 1959/60 to 1963/64 and (2) the whole of these amounts.</P>
      <P>The estimate of the amount likely to be received by way of interest on Exchequer advances in the year 1959/60 is £9 million.  It is not possible to attempt an accurate estimate in respect of the subsequent years but it would not be unreasonable to assume an annual increase of between £300,000 and £500,000 at present interest charges.</P>
