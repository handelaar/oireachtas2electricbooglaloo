      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go on to deal with the Vote on Account, I want to give one quotation to show the futility of discussions in this House between two groups who have had responsibility for Government, two groups who do not differ fundamentally in their outlook with regard to Government.  This quotation is from the debate on the Vote on Account on <Col N="644" /> 15th March, 1956, Volume 155, column 624:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is not any evidence of any great change in policy in any Department, but the overall picture is one of administrative costs mounting out of control.  There is no evidence of any efforts being made by the Government to deal with that situation or to apply to themselves the exhortations which they are addressing to the public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the priceless part:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I suppose the only possible solution of this problem is to get rid of this Government.  That will come sooner or later.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That quotation could have been made by any member of the present Front Bench when in Opposition or by any member of the present Opposition Front Bench.  However, that quotation was made by none other than the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>If we examine the figures of expenditure since 1956, in a period when Fianna Fáil had two years with the greatest majority they ever had in this House, we find that the expenditure of a non-essential type has mounted each year in spite of the control they wielded.  The argument of the Tánaiste in 1956, to the then inter-Party Government was to this effect: &ldquo;You are not able to control the situation. There is only one way to deal with this situation and that is to get out this Government.&rdquo;  Have we not the same position to-day?  Is there any change with regard to the control being exercised by this Government on mounting expenditure?  Have they shown any more power of control than the people they ousted from office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back to what I said last night. Many Deputies are beginning to realise that power to control the destiny of the Irish people, power to control employment, the cost of living and the right to live in this State, lies outside this House.  Every day, inside this House, efforts are being made to smother and to stifle justifiable criticism, even though this House can now be described only as a rubber stamp <Col N="645" /> for passing legislation and as a talking shop.  Efforts are being made by this Government to destroy even that limited function of discussing business in this House and I shall give evidence to that effect in the course of my remarks.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the people at the present time have either contempt for politicians or they are cynical towards public life.  Can they be blamed?  In the past few years especially, we have had a surfeit of promises.  We have had blueprints; we have had grey papers and we have had White Papers.  From the various Ministers each week, we have had announcements of great things to come as a result of discussions between interested groups within the country.  Even on the Vote on Account, the Minister in his opening remarks said that he and his Department were having discussions with various groups in the country&mdash;the bacon industry, farmers' associations, business groups and so forth&mdash;on how increased production can be achieved and how to ensure that more employment will be given all over the country.</P>
    <P>Those blueprints, White Papers, grey papers and consultations, have made the public fed up.  What they want now is action, and I am afraid they are not going to get the action.  I am afraid they are not going to get action because if action has to be taken, the very people who support politicians in this House will have to be stamped upon, people outside this House who exercise control and use Cabinet Ministers as puppets.  Those people and their vested interests will have to be brought under control and there is no individual on the Front Bench of this Government who is prepared to sacrifice his personal interest, or his company interest, for the public good.</P>
    <P>I have said that the power is now going outside the House.  Let me give a few examples.  For some time past, there has been a committee functioning on the question of the marketing of agricultural produce and a sub-committee was set up to deal with another most important means of livelihood of the small farmers in the West of Ireland, namely the pigs and bacon industry. They sat for a considerable period <Col N="646" /> and made a report to the Government. I asked the Minister, in this House, if he would tell us what the report was and if the Government would implement the report.  The Minister&mdash;it was the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;in his usual fashion said the Government had the report under consideration.  In his opening speech yesterday, the Minister for Finance said that consultations were going on for the purpose of modernising the bacon factories.  Let us be clear on that.  The report of that committee which discussed and worked out the best means of improving the bacon industry, and preventing the exploitation of the farmers, decided that control would have to be exercised by the State on the pig curers and that the pig industry would best be dealt with on practically the same lines as the sugar company.</P>
    <P>Do the Government propose to adopt that approach?  I say they will not because they themselves have control, as individuals, of a number of bacon factories and are closely associated with them.  Not alone are the members of the Government associated with them, but the back benchers are also associated with them.  Then we are told that the interests of the small farmers will be looked after by this Government.  The pig industry is on the way down again.  It is subject to fluctuations year after year.  There is no long-term policy for it.  The producer is at the mercy of the middle-man in this matter.  I do not for a moment think that there are not big difficulties with regard to marketing and exporting, but we are not even dealing with that aspect.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem in regard to production.  There is a feeling of dissatisfaction and distrust on the part of the producer himself because he knows he is being exploited.  If prices are to go down, the man who will lose is not the middle-man, or the retailer, but the man at the bottom, the producer.  Strong action is needed to put that industry on its feet, strong action on a wide basis to ensure that the interests of the producer, and the small farmer, are looked after.  Will we get that strong action from the Government when members of the Government are closely associated with <Col N="647" /> the industry, not as producers, but as middle-men, up along the line?</P>
    <P>Again I say that power now lies outside this House.  Since I came into this House, I have read the various reports of the Central Bank and I have taken time off each year to read the speeches of the bosses of the various commercial banks.  Every year, we have had this wailing and moaning and groaning that too much money was being spent and that there was always a constant danger of inflation. The Central Bank, acting as a kind of mouthpiece for the commercial banks, kept up this whining every year.  The result was that they frightened the Government into taking action to prevent so much money being circulated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, as a result of the advice given to him by these banks, decided that he would put the hair-shirt on the Irish people every time he got back into power, and he put that hairshirt on the Irish people every time.  As a result of that, the poor people become poorer and the rich became richer; bank deposits went up and external assets went up; bank dividends went up and what happened then?  The unemployment figures went up and the figures for emigration went up, as each year these gentlemen, the bosses of the banks, pronounced on the danger to the community of spending money.  The fact of the matter is that the Government, in their conservative fashion, accepted the advice of the banks in question.  They have no option.  The State exercises no control whatever over its monetary policy.</P>
    <P>For ten years, we listened to that weeping and wailing about spending. What happened then?  Overnight the situation changed, and anybody with an honest face&mdash;like any member of this House&mdash;could go into the Bank and on his appearance was supposed to be entitled to a loan.  Suddenly, the restrictions went by the board as far as certain sections of the agricultural community were concerned.  A few years ago, would any Deputy from rural Ireland have said that a small farmer, or any farmer, could walk in and get a loan from the commercial banks?  Despite the fact that the <Col N="648" /> commercial banks had on deposit from the farming community three times the amount lent to them, the farmer was not regarded as a sure person to whom to give credit.</P>
    <P>However, all that changed overnight; and I should like to know why. I have my own suspicions.  I should like to have clarified for me where the pressure came from to change the banking outlook.  We know that the British agent and British farmer who depend on the Irish store cattle trade have been worried for the past couple of years in case the Irish programme for the eradication of bovine T.B. should not be completed, and that consequently a large section of the British farming community would be deprived of store cattle from Ireland.  A number of commercial banks here with headquarters in Britain have on their controlling authority a number of people closely associated with the British farming community, and we find them offering overnight credit schemes for cattle to the Irish farmers. That move came from Britain.  This Government had nothing whatever to do with it.  The organisation known as the N.F.A. were, if you like, used, as far as that scheme was concerned.</P>
    <P>For the past 100 years, we have maintained that Britain wanted this country purely as a ranch to breed and rear store cattle for Britain.  Are we not walking right into that trap? Remember, there are no loans or credit from the commercial banks with headquarters in Britain for the farmer who wants to go into horticulture, tillage, pigs or anything like that; but there is a loan for the farmer who wants to go into grass.  Even with the limited tillage and mixed farming we have, the aim is to get into grass to suit the British buyer.  I mention this because for the past 25 years, under the direction of the Tánaiste, this Government built up tariff walls for every &ldquo;chancer&rdquo;, speculator and pal who wanted to make a few quid on some tin-pot industry; but now the tariff walls must go.  There is panic in the Fianna Fáil camp and in the camp of their followers who have made well on this position for the past 25 years.  The alternative is &ldquo;back now to the policy <Col N="649" /> of grass&rdquo;.  The store cattle trade and grass are to save this country.</P>
    <P>I said here last night that a great deal of power now lies outside this House but inside the House efforts are being made by this Government to stifle criticism, to stifle questions on matters of public importance and to deny the airing of the justifiable grievances of the community.  All legislation dealing with State or semi-State companies contains the provision that the conduct and working of such companies will not be subject to interference by question or otherwise in this House.  I am the first to maintain that State and semi-State companies in this country are outstanding, but the Government are doing a very bad day's work for such concerns by not bringing them to a greater degree under the control of the Oireachtas, so that the public will have some say with regard to the policy and the manner in which the money voted in this House is expended.</P>
    <P>It has reached the stage at which the Government, through legislation, have prevented Deputies from raising matters of public importance by question, and now they are seeking to prevent Deputies from raising questions in connection with State companies by way of motion here.  Within the past three months, the Government have sought to prevent motions dealing with State companies from appearing on the Order Paper.  If they get away with that, what will be the position here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting away with it as far as questions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the latest attempt is to do away with motions. I challenge the Minister to deny that. Of course, the aim is to have it nice and quiet in this House.  If P.R. disappears and there are 15 to 20 men on the other side and 80 to 90 quiet, disciplined men in the back benches of Fianna Fáil, the Government will be in a position to pass legislation here to cut out Private Members' motions dealing with State or semi-State companies.  They are not in a position to do it at present because the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="650" /> look after the interests of Deputies and the public interest.  I shall not deal with that any further.  I mention it as an example of the whittling away of Deputies' powers.  The Government are not interested in democracy.  A Minister like the Tánaiste is interested only in a free passage: get things done; do not mind Dáil Éireann.  But the gamble has not come off yet, and I shall endeavour to prevent it.</P>
      <P>Another cause of cynicism and contempt for this House is the question of privilege conferred.  This has particular reference to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Every day of the week we read about inquiries in America concerning graft and corruption in various concerns.  There is a need for them here.  But even if graft and corruption are not discovered in a particular sphere, the very fact that such a committee can sit is, in itself, a warning to those who might be tempted.</P>
      <P>What have we in our present set up? Licences can be issued for the inportation of commodities, whether shoes or other commodities, by the Minister and the names of the individuals to whom the licences are issued will never be published or reach the public.  On what basis is that done?  When a question is put down to the Minister asking why the names are not made public, he becomes abusive in this House and fails to answer in a responsible fashion the public demand.</P>
      <P>Every time a licence is issued, a benefit is conferred on some individual over another individual.  The public are entitled to know who that individual is.  If there is an issue of haulage plates by the Minister, the public are entitled to know why certain individuals get haulage plates and others do not.  Would it be that certain individuals get them because they are closely associated with the Fianna Fáil Party?  Would that be the reason why licences for the importation of fuels are issued to certain individuals? Would it be because they have subscribed heavily to the Fianna Fáil funds?  These are fair charges.  Why are the names not disclosed to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> People who get such licences do well out of them.  They make money out of those licences.  The fact that they get these licences means that traders and others are deprived of these facilities.  That type of carry-on is going on under the Tánaiste and I think it is time it was exposed.  I think it is time, when we bring measures before this House, that they are examined more carefully and that Deputies on all sides of the House will ensure that there is no room left for any Minister afterwards to hide behind the Act.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House what the Minister's answer was to me when I asked a specific question on the matter of licences.  It was that the specific Act of 1936 did not specify that the names must be published.  That is the answer he hides behind.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Tánaiste said that the next five years would be critical.  Even the limited freedom in this country would be jeopardised, unless big strides were made within the next five years.  He is willing, as usual, with his brass audacity to keep on gambling that he will be able to bluff the public for the next five years.  Perhaps, he will.  God knows, he and the Taoiseach have bluffed the public for many years now.  Perhaps another five years is not a long period when you think of 20 years of bluff by that Party, but I think that when the Tánaiste said the next five years would be critical, he was talking with his tongue in his cheek.</P>
    <P>He knows that the critical stage has been reached.  It is doubtful at this stage whether we can turn the hands of the clock back and prevent what is known throughout the country as the big sell-out.  In my opinion, we should discount his talk that the next five years will be critical.  In my opinion, this Government have thrown in the sponge.  This Government have already made up their minds that they are not able to cope with the huge problems that have to be faced in this country.  As I have already pointed out, the reasons are quite apparent in many aspects in their association outside this House as directors and ex-directors of various companies.  The fact that if <Col N="652" /> they take action now as a Government, they will be hurting their own pals and vested interests outside has left them powerless to intervene at a vital stage. They talk about promises while the big sell-out is going on.  I think they have panicked.</P>
    <P>Speculators are welcome from the four corners of the globe.  It does not matter whether they are American, Canadian, British, German, Swedish, or Italian.  They are all welcome here; they are all welcome to Ireland. They will get first-class facilities in Ireland.  Some of them undoubtedly may be first-class men and sound. Some of them, as we know, are anything but sound, but we know they will all get preference over the Irishman at the present time.  If a proposition is put forward by a foreigner and an Irishman, you can bet your bottom dollar that the foreigner will get preference when it comes to any question of help from this Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies may think that I am exaggerating when I talk about the sell-out.  They may think that when we get people from Canada or elsewhere to help us exploit our mineral resources, it is unfair to criticise the Government along this path.  I want to be clear.  With regard to certain aspects of mineral development, I blame both Governments in the past five years for what I can describe as a sell-out.  It cannot be denied, as will be proved to this House in a very short time, that the individuals who have control to a great extent over our mineral development here, with particular reference to Wicklow, have made over one and a quarter million pounds on the Stock Exchange without leaving one finger on the works in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>There was no opening for the Irish speculator or investor.  It was all limited to the individuals concerned in Canada.  That is the turn-over these gentlemen made on the schemes as manipulators.  Without ever touching the mine, they made a profit.  They were welcomed here because they were foreigners.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Vote on Account, the Minister has pointed out that he is preparing legislation to help private <Col N="653" /> interests for the purpose of going ahead with mineral development.  Had we not a body in Minraí Teoranta which did excellent work here as a State concern?  The excellent work done by that body was handed over to private enterprise after the hard slogging was done, in order that private enterprise would reap the profits out of the excellent technical work done by that State company.  Here we have the Minister in this Vote on Account making provision to hand over more of the public money to private companies, most of them outside this State, to help them in their mineral development search, after the State companies had done all the hard work.</P>
    <P>People often wonder how it is possible for those to come over here. There are half a dozen ways by which you can do it.  First of all, if you are an American, you discover you have at some stage or another a great-grandmother who was Irish.  If you cannot discover such in the family, you find some naïve clergyman or perhaps a couple of clergymen in America who were born in Ireland. They use them.  They take them on a trip to Ireland and they bless the old country.  Because they accompany these speculators, we can afford immediately then to allow an industry to be handed over and exploited by these individuals.</P>
    <P>If you want to get support from the Government and bluff the Irish people with regard to minerals or anything else what do you do?  We stuff our hats with shamrocks and we christen the mines after some unfortunate saint here in Ireland.  If that does not work, you put up a good proposition to the members of the Government and appoint as directors of your new outfit pals of the Government in office.  We see this happening every day of the week.  For years past, we have had the freedom to paint our letter boxes and our buses green and have been free to put up the tricolour, green, white and orange, but those are the very symbols of our freedom that are being exploited by outsiders with the consent of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> We talk about an air service to America.  We have an air service controlled by Americans, but the plane is called after an Irish saint.  If they want to put on a show, they take the President off to America for St. Patrick's Day to spend a week with the American President and they proceed to change the interior of the plane, to paint the seats green, white and orange and put shamrocks on the outside.</P>

      <P>I am not criticising the unfortunate President.  Far be it from me to start discussing him on the Vote on Account.  I am merely referring at this stage to the methods adopted by the outsiders to gull and fool the Irish people.  The development and sale of our mineral resources has been handed over to non-nationals, while we export technicians and scientists to Britain, men who are prepared to come back here and work honestly and loyally to develop their own country.  There are first-class scientists in major concerns in England anxious to bring their families back to live and work in Ireland.  Instead of giving them the opportunity to live in Ireland, we bring in aliens, many of them undesirable.</P>
      <P>The Government are charged with the responsibility of ending congestion and utilising agricultural land where it is available for the relief of congestion and to end the misery in Kerry, Deputy Moloney's county, in Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and elsewhere.  What do we find?  We find that any group can come in here from Britain, America or elsewhere as a combine and buy up the best land in any locality.</P>

      <P>All that is necessary in this instance is for the Government to make more money available to the Land Commission to carry out the policy for which it was set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not advocate legislation.  He is advocating restrictions on the purchase of land by aliens, which would require legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money made available in the Vote on Account and the full amount made available for lands would not be sufficient for any year over the past ten years to buy land which comes on the market and which would be suitable for the relief of congestion. There is no necessity whatever to bring in legislation such as the Chair suggests I am advocating.  Take two estates sold in Carlow and Roscommon. The one in Carlow was sold at an average value per acre of £35-£40. That is low when you consider that in the West of Ireland, if a farm of land is up for sale, that farm will sell at £100 per acre, and that might not be the best of land.  The farm in Carlow containing first-class land was sold at approximately £40 per statute acre.</P>
      <P>If funds were available, the Land Commission could purchase such land, instead of allowing foreign combines to purchase it, but they do not do that. When you bring in these investors, you are taking away the fundamental thing that should belong to the Irish people, namely, the land.  That is why I say the Tánaiste is talking with his tongue in his cheek when he tells us that the next five years are critical.  He does not give a damn whether they are critical or not because when the new sell-out is completed, the Tánaiste and his group will be associated with the directors and friends of the new people who control the land, minerals and wealth of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested to hear the discussion on Shannon.  From listening to the Tánaiste, it was my impression that the company being set up, the Shannon Development Company, was a company set up for the purpose of dealing with social and economic problems that had arisen at Shannon <Col N="656" /> as a result of the likelihood of the jet planes overflying that area, and that Shannon is now a vested interest which must be looked after.  When the Tánaiste says that Shannon is an important social problem, I am in full agreement with him.  How does he go about remedying it?  He sets up a company, gives it certain powers, puts it under the control of a certain individual, and says: &ldquo;Your function is to build up industries in this area, to keep the employment content up to what it is now and not allow that to drop if the air business goes down.&rdquo; The Tánaiste has charged a State company with the responsibility of preventing unemployment in an area and with increasing employment, if possible, and every facility is being made available to that company to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Let us look a little further up the Shannon at the West of Ireland.  Have we any facilities like those being provided for Shannon?  The West of Ireland has been looked upon merely as a breeding ground for the export of children to America and Britain. Have the Government ever thought of setting up a somewhat similar body under the control of a group of experts to deal with the economic and social problems that exist in the congested areas?  They do not worry about those areas.  They are not strong or organised.  They are not able to bring pressure to bear on the Government. More luck to the people in the Shannon area who have the Minister in the palm of their hand.  They are able to get help and encouragement, but for those who live further along the Shannon, very little assistance is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>When it even comes down to the question of improving the lands in these neglected areas which are subject to flooding for many months in the year, we find that the amount made available last year has been wiped out. There is no money for the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;not a penny piece.  I drew Deputy Haughey out last night&mdash;he is very close to the Tánaiste&mdash;in order to confirm that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was a waste and that it was a bad Act.  He <Col N="657" /> speaks as the mouthpiece of the Tánaiste.  He used the very words which the Tánaiste told him to use three or four nights ago.  That is the mentality of the Tánaiste, that the small farmers and the persons in the rural areas do not count.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that I was visiting in the West of Ireland and I met a person who said that he had been told very bluntly when he asked how they existed there: &ldquo;We export children.&rdquo;  Of course, that is true. That is really the means by which they live.  If it were not for the regular cheques from Britain and America, there would be very few people left in the West of Ireland to-day.  The few who might be left would be the demoralised few, demoralised by the Fianna Fáil dole, and privileges for speaking Irish.  That is the charity dole which was brought in by Fianna Fáil 30 years ago that is all over the areas of the West to-day.</P>
    <P>I can give an example.  I was in Connemara one morning and I spoke about afforestation.  I did not speak in a very political manner but a man came up to me and said: &ldquo;What good are trees here?  Why do you not tell the people that you will increase the £5 allowance for children who speak Irish, or that you will increase the dole?  That is what we want here.&rdquo; That is the demoralisation that has been brought into that part of the country by the quacks who are in Government at the moment.</P>
    <P>What do we find then?  The Taoiseach looks into his heart and says we must restore the Irish language, and the method by which we restore it is that we sound an alarm that we are in a bad way economically and let every foreigner of every description pour into the country.  Is it through these that the Irish language will be restored?  It is time the public woke up to the way they are being gulled.  The Taoiseach said on a number of occasions that if he found he could not get the improvements or the advances inside the system he was prepared to go outside it.  I heard him say that on a number of occasions.  I wonder is he satisfied with the system now?</P>
    <P>I am not referring at this stage to <Col N="658" /> the system of election because I am afraid that is what he is going to change.  He intends to have a system of election which will imprison the community in the conditions we have at the moment.  That is what he will achieve by a change in the system. Is he prepared to change the system and to be blunt enough to say that there are big things to be tackled in this country and that only the State is in a position to do that job with the resources which it has, that only the State is in a position to deal with the rings and vested interests that exist within the State?  Is there any hope that the Taoiseach will change his mind about that, instead of pretending to worship at the shrine of alleged private enterprise?  Private enterprise in this country has reached the stage at which it is just a matter of complete exploitation of the public.  When it is a question of a reduction of prices, on the basis of the reduced costings of commodities that affect the everyday life of the people, the prices of these commodities are not reduced and reductions are not passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>There are rings within rings there all the time and no effort made to break them up and to give a fair crack of the whip to the consumer.  Are the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach prepared to take action?  I believe they are not, especially the Tánaiste.  We are faced with the position that if P.R. goes, the Tánaiste will be the boss of the concern which now controls the country.  When that day comes, let us remember that fundamental things will go by the board.  The land, the people engaged in agriculture, and all that has to do with rural Ireland do not count for a snap of my fingers to the Tánaiste.  Yet he is to be in charge of a Government who are supposed to be responsible for an improvement in conditions, the expansion of agriculture, the setting up of as many economic holdings as possible within the State and the development of the diverse aspects of agriculture. What interest has he in these matters? It is time the public knew these things and took the necessary action.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will happen to the referendum; I do know that it does not matter whether the people <Col N="659" /> want it or not; but the day will soon come when the Irish people will pray that the terrible Colossus, the terrible imposition, known as Fianna Fáil will be wiped out completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in this House for about as long as Deputy McQuillan, but, apart from the couple of years during which he supported a Coalition Government, I have seldom heard from him a speech that was not permeated with the notion: &ldquo;A plague on both your houses.&rdquo;  We have heard little from him by way of contribution since he left the inter-Party Government, but carping criticism of both sides of the House and of institutions and organisations that have been endeavouring for a number of years to build up the economy of the country.</P>
      <P>His particular line of attack on this occasion was not so much pouring contumely on people on both sides of the House who are members of organised Parties, but it was directed mainly at the Tánaiste and people who have made capital available for the development of different aspects of our economy by means of private enterprise.  He referred also to the manner in which our State sponsored and semi-State sponsored bodies are being run and omitted to mention that during the ten years during which he has been a member of the House, many measures have been put through the House by the Fianna Fáil and inter-Party Governments, which established the position which many of these companies now hold.  I have yet to see Deputy McQuillan going into the Division Lobby and opposing any of these measures.  It is typical, of course, of a man who is responsible to nobody, who can come into the House and criticise destructively almost every institution in the State and offer no constructive suggestion as to how the ills of which he has complained might be cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enough, however, of what Deputy McQuillan has said because the content of his speech does little credit to himself or the House.  For some <Col N="660" /> months past, it has been said here and outside that the Government have been ignoring the economic questions that beset the country at present and have devoted all their energies to the measure, which has been passed by this House and which is at present before the Seanad, for the abolition of P.R. If such a statement is made often enough, no doubt it is possible that some of the people will be induced to believe it but facts and performance have clearly proved that such an allegation is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, it has been suggested that the time of the House has been taken up unnecessarily in the discussion of some stages of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  To my knowledge, it has not been adverted to that the House was brought together in January, sat for practically the whole month of January to discuss the P.R. Bill, and that the month of January is a month in which the House is not normally brought together. Therefore, to suggest, to that extent at any rate, that the time of the House was being wasted is completely groundless.  As I have said, the efforts and performance and, to a large extent, results of these efforts and performance belie entirely that charge.  I hope to mention in the course of my speech a few objective sources that sustain that contention by me.</P>
    <P>The first one to which I will refer is the O.E.E.C. Report or Analysis on Ireland for 1958.  The report for 1956 made sad reading for the Irish public. This year, the report is not only hopeful but refers to the positive advances that have been made towards our economic recovery.  It refers in its earlier part to the gross national output which, it says, recovered in 1957 by slightly more than the fall experienced in the previous year.  Total output rose by almost 2 per cent. in real terms&mdash;certainly nothing to be exultant about but something that clearly shows progress.</P>
    <P>With regard to manufacturing industries, the report says that recovery began in the last quarter of 1957 and has been sustained in 1958.  The report says that agricultural prices increased <Col N="661" /> by 7 per cent. in 1957, after a fall of 10 per cent. in the previous year, and were generally maintained in 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only 23 pages devoted to Ireland in the report. I am sure the Deputy will have no difficulty in pin-pointing the quotations I have extracted.  Unfortunately, I did not mark them.  The report continues that exports rose in volume by some 19 per cent. in 1957.  From our own experience, we have seen the upward trend in recovery and in confidence. These have been particularly exemplified in the success of the National Loan for £15,000,000, which was over-subscribed, and in the success of the E.S.B. loan for £5,000,000.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to suggest that it is apparent that a much more extensive orientation of Irish industry towards export markets needs to be secured, if an adequate rate of development is to be achieved and if the balance of payments problems are to be avoided.  In that respect, I need only point to the provision in the current Estimates for Córas Tráchtála, which shows an increase of £31,000 in the coming financial year over the present year.  The O.E.E.C. Report goes on to say that it is important that the development of the economy should be guided by a balanced and realistic longer-term national objective.  Ireland is now taking steps, the report says, to make a longer-term evaluation of her position through the Capital Investment Advisory Committee and it goes on to refer to other agencies.</P>
      <P>The O.E.E.C. Report on Ireland for 1958 concludes:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This, in itself, by leading to a clear appreciation of the directions in which economic development <Col N="662" /> would be most appropriate should exert an important and beneficial effect on the evolution of the Irish economy.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This report, as far as I can make out, was written some time before the publication of the White Paper.  Nevertheless, the White Paper, in itself, gives force to the prognosis of O.E.E.C. with regard to the longer-term evolution that Ireland is now making for the realisation of her national objectives.  I shall refer later to certain aspects of the White Paper and to the implementation of it which is reflected in the current Estimates and in recent legislation.</P>
      <P>There is another encouraging aspect of 1958 which is worth recording and from which we can garner one of our main elements of encouragement and hope, namely, the downward trend in emigration during 1958.  In 1957, so far as the statistics that are available to us can convey to us, 60,000 more people left Ireland by sea and air than entered the country.  The net balance for the 12-month period ended June, 1958, was reduced to 48,000 and the figures for the 12-month period ended 31st December last showed a further reduction to 40,255&mdash;40,000, in round figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We can refer again to the decrease in the register of unemployed to indicate that what the Deputy is now suggesting is not so. However, with regard to the British Ministry's figures, there has been a downward trend in the number of <Col N="663" /> British social insurance cards issued for the first time to Irish citizens. These reached 60,000 in 1957 but dropped to an estimated 48,000 in 1958.  These are not net figures; these are gross figures.  They take into account people such as migrants and students who emigrate to England for short terms and who would return in any case irrespective of their receiving British social insurance cards; but taken side by side with the downward trend of the net balance in outward and inward air and sea passengers it indicates clearly that there is a brighter outlook for the country.</P>
      <P>So far as emigration is concerned, a drop in emigration in itself is not sufficient indication that there has been some recovery and in many cases it is often offset by a rise in the unemployment figures.  Certainly that was not the case in 1958.  At the end of December, 1958, compared with the figures for the end of December, 1957, there were 5,300 fewer on the unemployment register than there were in the previous year, reflecting a decline of 7 per cent.  As we all know, it would not be quite fair, or accurate, to isolate one month and compare it with the corresponding month in the previous year, but the figure at the end of December last is a culmination of a trend that has been apparent in every month right through 1958, taken in comparison with 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been, of course, other concrete evidence of that progress and high in the category come the recent activities of the commercial banks in making increased capital available for industry and agriculture.  There was, in fact, an increase of 22½ per cent. in bank advances last year, over the previous 12 months.  Deputy McQuillan has suggested that the relaxation of credit restrictions by the commercial banks was influenced in Britain and not here in Ireland.  I do not know what justification he has for making that statement, or to what authority he can point on which to base it.  Deputy McQuillan seems to forget that there are men on the boards of these banks who have given long service to the advancement of <Col N="664" /> Irish economy, and who have given long service to the national objectives as a whole.</P>
    <P>These men, naturally, must have regard to their primary functions as members of such boards.  Nobody can deny that they have the interest of the whole country at heart and so far as they can achieve improvements, and achieve a more progressive outlook in the activities of these banks, I believe that even such a cynic as Deputy McQuillan seems to be must admit that they have done quite a good job on the boards of these commercial banks.  When we remember the refusal, in 1955 and 1956, of these commercial banks to advance credit, not only to individuals but to local authorities and, to an extent, to the Government, one welcomes all the more the new outlook of these banks.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1955 and 1956, as a member of the Cork Corporation, going on a deputation which was largely composed of the Oireachtas members of the Corporation, to the Munster and Leinster Bank, in order to secure money to enable Cork Corporation to proceed with its building programme and we met with a pointblank refusal.  The reason given to us was that the board of the bank had, as its primary duty, its duty towards its depositors, even though they were prepared to have regard, in the exercise of that duty, to the interests of the country.  Nevertheless, we failed completely to get, in those two years, any relaxation of the decision of the banks to refuse to advance money to the Cork Corporation.  The same applied to many local authorities throughout the country.  Having regard to the stated duty of these boards to their depositors, as being their primary function, their new enterprise and relaxation of restrictions can only reflect their increased confidence in the country and the outlook for the country.  The manner in which they are now acting is very welcome in every respect.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I referred to the suggestion that the Government had abandoned their fundamental task of grappling with the economic difficulties in <Col N="665" /> putting forward the proposal to abolish P.R.  The publication of the White Paper not alone gave the lie to that allegation, but when one examines these proposals, in relation to the motion now before the House, for an advance of roughly one-third of the Estimate for the coming year, to make provision up to the end of next July, and when one also regards the measures recently introduced in this House, one readily realises that not only are the Government not disregarding their duty but are paying very keen and very effective attention to these problems.</P>
    <P>Let us, in broad outline, break down the headings of this White Paper.  The first one is &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo; and under the sub-title &ldquo;Improvement of Grasslands&rdquo;, we can see that the Government have taken steps already to implement what it is set out in the White Paper in the provision that has been made for lime and fertilisers subsidies. In the coming year, £2,415,000 is being provided, an increase of over £1,500,000 on the sum provided under the corresponding heading in last year's Estimates.  One has also to take into account the £500,000 voted last week by way of Supplementary Estimate for phosphate fertiliser.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Beef and Mutton&rdquo;, where there is reference to the necessity to increase our stocks and to enhance the quality of our stocks, we find almost £1,000,000 net increase in the provision for the eradication of bovine T.B.  The first part of the White Paper is a general preview of the position; Part II deals with agriculture and Part III deals with sea fisheries.  The Fisheries Estimates show a net increase of £156,400, of which the net increase to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is £109,000 and there is the added provision to which the Minister referred of £4,000 for fish pond culture.</P>
    <P>Under Part IV of the White Paper, forestry in general is dealt with.  In that respect we find in the current year a net increase of £30,000 for development and maintenance alone.</P>
    <P>Industry is dealt with in Part V and the ideas motivating the White Paper and the Government's action on it are set out in Part V: &ldquo;Adequate facilities <Col N="666" /> must be provided by the State for the encouragement of industrial development.&rdquo; With regard to capital: &ldquo;The Government are determined to ensure that no soundly-based industrial project will be allowed to fail or be prevented from starting solely through lack of capital.&rdquo;  In the current session, we have had Bills relating specificaly to the ideas inherent in those two statements.  We had recently a Bill to provide increased capital for Irish Shipping.  We dealt with one this morning in relation to Bord na Móna; there, the capital is being increased from £14,000,000 to £19,000,000.</P>
    <P>Provision will be made in the current session for the E.S.B., for the Industrial Credit Company, Bord Fáilte, Shannon Free Airport Development Company and An Foras Tionscal. We know that considerable expansion has been approved in connection with the steel industry in Haulbowline. A sum of £2,000,000 will be spent on that project over the next five years.  The company is shortly expected to put up specific proposals to expand the output of steel and make their industry in Haulbowline more competitive.  We have also the capital commitments which the Government have undertaken in relation to the development of the Rushbrooke Dockyard project.</P>
    <P>Under a sub-head in connection with industry, tourism is referred to.  A scheme has been announced, and provision made, for extending the loans and grants to hotels so that accommodation for tourists can be increased all over the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred yesterday to the improved landing facilities at Cobh.  In the Vote for Tourism in the coming year, there is an extra £150,000 provided, of which £100,000 will be devoted to the development of tourist resorts.</P>
    <P>All these, with the extra provision for agriculture, form the bulk of the increase in the Estimates for the coming year.  There is one other increase to which it gives me great pleasure to refer, that is, the increase in the Vote for Education.  Over the years, we have listened to many people <Col N="667" /> decrying the paucity of the provision made for Education, notwithstanding the fact that the provision was roughly higher than one-tenth of our revenue account.  This year, I am glad to say, it is increased.  Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his remarks yesterday, wrote off the increase as provision to enable teachers to eat as much as they did two or three years ago.  The fact is that the increase in salaries by no means accounts for the total increase in the Education Vote in the coming year.  Increases for educational services account for almost 25 per cent. of the total increased provision in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I should like to indicate to the House now that the moneys being provided are directly related to the White Paper for economic expansion.  There are increased grants to vocational committees amounting to £98,000 odd. There is the restoration of the cut in relation to secondary schools.  That cut was imposed in 1957 by the previous Government.  Unfortunately, it was continued by Fianna Fáil, but it has now been decided to discontinue it and that 10 per cent. will account for an extra £85,350 to secondary schools in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Last year, in the debate on the Vote on Account, mention was made of the decreased provision for the national school building programme.  In the inter-Party Government's Estimates, there was provision of £1,500,000. Provision in the current year was reduced to £1,400,000.  That naturally evoked some criticism from the Opposition.  I pointed out that that £1,400,000 was intended to represent a more realistic appraisal of the expenditure necessary on national school buildings in that year, but I found that in fact I was not quite as realistic as I thought.  Of the £1,500,000 provided in 1957-58, expenditure fell short by £300,000.  Only £1,200,000 was in fact spent.  Of the provision of £1,400,000 in the current year, it is estimated that the sum will fall short by £100,000 of what is required by the end of the financial year.  The total estimated expenditure amounts to £1,500,000. Happily, there has been a steady <Col N="668" /> increase in the number of school buildings provided in the past few years.  In 1955-56, there were 40 schools; in 1956-57, there were 50 schools; and in 1957-58 there was a slight drop.  The number in that year was 45.  In the current year, it is estimated that 70 new school buildings will have been completed.  At the moment there are 123 buildings in course of erection&mdash;the highest number ever in our history so far.</P>
    <P>With regard to vocational schools, the provision for building in last year's Estimates was £318,900.  Provision in the coming year is estimated at £400,000.  I am confident that provision will be fully accounted for.</P>
    <P>With regard to universities, we have had complaints over the years that our universities are working on a budget which adversely affects the standard of teaching.  This year, there has been a more realistic effort to meet their demands.  There is an increase in the Estimate from £670,000-odd to £953,000-odd, an increase of £283,000. The country will be happy that such an increase has been made in the provision for university education, vocational education and primary education, as well as secondary education in the coming year.</P>
    <P>All over the world we have rich countries making increased provision for education, and it would be a reflection on our foresight if we are to lag behind in any way.  I am not suggesting that the sum provided in the present year is sufficient to enable the various teaching institutions completely to fulfil the functions we would like them to do.  We will have to face up to the fact that increased provision for science will have to be made in the years ahead, and in particular, that science will have to be given more attention in the secondary schools.  It is hoped that adequate provision can be made in the coming years for science teaching.  That will depend on the availability of science teachers&mdash; science graduates from the colleges. Therefore, it has to be more or less a three-pronged approach.  First of all, to make facilities available for training teachers; secondly, adequate practical <Col N="669" /> facilities for the teaching of science in the schools; and, thirdly, encouraging science graduates to undertake teaching in the schools, particularly in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will be seen that the increased expenditure under all heads in the coming year is well justified in the national interests.  It was stated yesterday by the Minister for Finance that the net increase, when one took into account the Supplementary Estimates passed recently, amounted to £1.86 million.  Critics might well say: &ldquo;Yes, but will we not be faced in the coming year with Supplementary Estimates perhaps up to the same amount?&rdquo; But I think it is reasonable to expect, and certainly reasonable to hope, that some of the exigencies which arose during the past year and made these Supplementary Estimates necessary will not arise in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the extra provision of £1,160,000 for losses on the disposal of wheat and payments to wheat growers provided here recently, as well as subsidies on dairy products at £625,000.  Added to that is almost £1,000,000&mdash;£987,000&mdash;for increases in the remuneration of public servants, including civil servants, Guards, Army, teachers and Post Office personnel.  It is reasonable, I hope, to assume that these heavy charges or similar charges will not fall to be made in the coming year and that therefore the need for Supplementary Estimates to the same extent will not arise.  I think it is fair to judge the net increase the Minister referred to yesterday in the region of £1.86 million over last year.  It is a moderate increase having regard to the programme the Government have put before them and having regard, in particular, to the specific items in the Estimates which primarily reflect these increases.  I refer again to the increases in agriculture for lime and fertilisers, and, in industry, for Córas Tráchtála, tourism and education.</P>
    <P>I believe that the people are satisfied and will be satisfied that these increases are well justified and that they will get good value for them. Before I conclude, I must say I could not help noting an item in yesterday's <i>Cork Examiner</i> which reported a lecture <Col N="670" /> given by an eminent Professor in University College, Cork, entitled &ldquo;Decision&mdash;the Factor in Life&rdquo;.  His specific remarks relating to it could well be applied to Governments: &ldquo;Decision&mdash;the Factor in Government&rdquo;. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The purpose of decision excluded dithering and drift.  It involved the confident survey of an issue, the determined selection of a course of action, self-commitment and acceptance of the full responsibility for one's action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that expresses in language better than I could use the actions of the Government in this instance. There has been decision; there has been a move away from dithering and drift; there has been the confident survey of the issue; there has been the self-commitment and the acceptance of the responsibility for these actions. The people are glad that there has been such decision and that there has been that move away from dithering and drift.  I believe and hope confidently that the end of the next financial year will have an even better story to tell of hope and progress than those outside agencies such as O.E.E.C. were able to report.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point, does he not realise that decision is a vital element on the part of the people doing their job?  Does he not realise that the lecturer said there were three main obstacles to decision: pressure, ignorance and anxiety, and that the latter was, above all, the thing that paralysed the psychic energy required for decision?  Does the Minister not realise the condition into which the people as a whole have been brought as a result of anxiety, ignorance on the part of the Government and dithering and drift, and will he transfer the benefit of his talks on the lecture yesterday to the people who have to do the job?  Will he realise that they have to get rid of that anxiety?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the matters which are relevant to the Vote on Account proper, I should like to deal with one comment made by Deputy McQuillan, lest any silence may appear to give credence to what he said.  Deputy McQuillan referred to the development of the Avoca Copper Mines and seemed to think it was a crime against the Irish nation to put 400 or 500 people into the job of winning minerals from the soil of County Wicklow.  He seemed to think it would be better if something had been done&mdash;including coming to no decision&mdash;about the development of the mines rather than permit a Canadian group to exploit the mines in a manner that would produce wealth for this country and employment for Irish workers.</P>
      <P>The facts of the matter relating to the Avoca mines are these, and there are records in the Department of Industry and Commerce which will bear testimony to what I say.  The records could be put upon the Table of the House and they would prove every word of what I say.  When the inter-Party Government took office in 1954, decision had been come to by the previous Government that as they could not apparently dispose of the mineral deposits at Avoca, 60 of the 80 men employed there were to be dismissed, the mines were to be put on a care and maintenance basis and 20 of the 80 people retained to keep the mines from flooding.  That was the problem I inherited in the Department of Industry and Commerce, as far as the development of the copper mines was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed with the Industrial Development Authority, the Department of Industry and Commerce and a variety of other people, the possibility of getting some commercial group who had skill and resources in mining to come in here and develop the Avoca copper deposits.  The Avoca copper <Col N="672" /> deposits are not the most priceless deposits in the world.  Let nobody imagine that, because they are in Ireland, it is the best grade of copper in the world.  It is not.  The ore at Avoca is one of the lowest grade copper ores in the world.  It can be worked economically only because of the availability of new methods of processing low grade ores.  Because of the fact that copper generally is a scarce commodity, its price was high and you could get it only in some of the most troubled spots in the world.</P>
    <P>It was in these circumstances that the Government endeavoured to develop the Avoca mineral deposits.  We endeavoured to interest any and every mining group we could find to exploit the deposits in Avoca.  Groups here were consulted and the friends of Ireland overseas were consulted.  The general view was that nobody was interested in the Avoca mines.  Groups were induced to come here and look at the mines only to say they were not interested.  The nearest we ever got to making a lease of the mines was when a group in Europe said they would be willing to take a lease, provided they were not pressed to develop them. They wanted to get a lease on the mines and sit on them and not develop them in case their supply of copper ore from other parts of the world dried up because of political disputations in these parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Finally, the only group that appeared on the horizon was the Canadian group.  At that stage, any Irish group could have had the mines.  Any other group in the world could have had them if they were in before the Canadians.  Only one group wanted them and that was the group to which a lease was finally made.  A hard bargain was struck.  Not only were they required to take a licence under which they are compelled to pay a royalty, but they were required to pay back £500,000 which we spent in developing the mineral deposits in Avoca.  That was a pretty good bargain from our point of view.</P>
    <P>As a result, instead of grass, clover and weeds growing over the copper deposits at Avoca to-day, there is a fine mine there with a flotation processing <Col N="673" /> plant, the like of which has never been seen in this country before and the like of which is not to be found in our sister island of Great Britain. Between 400 and 500 Irish workers are getting decent employment there.  When you remember that is the present situation and that the inter-Party Government inherited the Avoca mines on the basis that of any 80 employed, you sacked 60 and kept 20, it was a worthwhile transformation so far as the deposits in Avoca were concerned.  We have been able to get employment for between 400 and 500 workers who never before in living memory were employed in Avoca.  That is pretty good business, so far as the inter-Party Government were concerned.  It is an enduring business and it is no mushroom business.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the Vote proper. The Minister for Education took the soft and simple course to-day of following the Minister for Finance. What he did was to string out a lot of figures.  He told us the amount of these figures.  He compared the figures this year with the figures last year.  He was doing a sum of subtraction or addition so that we could all find out by what amount the figures this year exceeded the figures last year.  There was no attempt by the Minister for Education or the Minister for Finance to indicate what effect all this figure reading would have on the main problem&mdash;the fundamental problems which confront the nation.  No effort was made to assess the effects of this Vote on Account or the Book of Estimates on the main problems which are still with us and which, so far as I can see, will remain with us, even when the moneys provided in this Vote on Account have been expended.</P>
    <P>I think our main danger to-day arises from the rather comfortable attitude adopted by members of the Government and which has apparently been injected into a number of Deputies.  Listening to Deputy Burke talking, one would imagine that the only problem is that the Utopia will be on top of him before he gets time to dress himself up and frolic when it arrives.  Deputy Burke is only afraid that the deluge of milk and honey will <Col N="674" /> strike him without giving him adequate notice that it is on the horizon at all.  One would expect from Deputy Haughey a more sober appraisal of the economic situation. He says that at present the people in Ballyfermot are 50 times better off than they were in 1956.</P>

      <P>His speech is there for the Deputy.  He can see what his speech was.  He said the people were better off than they were in 1956.  Let us examine the facts.  The White Paper was referred to here as if the mere production of a White Paper is of itself a passport to prosperity and that all you have to do is to produce a White Paper, fill it with figures, keep quoting the figures and tell everybody what the figures mean and then sit back and do nothing and imagine that the mere production of a White Paper will have a mesmerising effect on the whole economy of the country and of the citizens thereof.</P>
      <P>I want to test the White Paper.  I want to test the Minister's speech.  I want to test the enthusiasm of some Deputies who sit on the Fianna Fáil Benches against the realities of life in Ireland to-day from an economic point of view.  I do not think it is unreasonable if the test is based on the standard of productivity, unemployment, emigration and prices. These are the four vital problems that concern the lives of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the problems which are discussed around the fireside and around the kitchen table in the homes of our people all over this country. These are the problems which are vital to the people.  It is not the embroideries of government that provide a solution for the people's problems; it is not the embroideries of government that make <Col N="675" /> any impact on the lives of people in the small houses and cottages throughout the country.  For them, the test is the standard of living in their own kitchen.  Nothing else is any realistic test of the standard of living which they enjoy.</P>
    <P>Let us see what the position is from the standpoint of industrial production. Let us bring back some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies to a realisation of what the position is and how little justification there is for all the joyous cackling that has gone on during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>If you take the index of the total volume of transportable goods in 1956, you will find that the average for the year was 102.2.  This was during the Suez year when petrol and oil were in short supply.  In the supposed year of recovery, 1957, if you take the index figures for the four quarters, you will find that the average was 101.6.  There is not much justification for enthusiasm there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth will have to do an exercise himself for the rest of the figures.  The volume of production for 1956, in the field of all transportable goods, was higher than it was in 1957.  But let us go on to 1958.  This was the year of renaissance, according to the Fianna <Col N="676" /> Fáil Deputies.  If we take the figures for the first three quarters of 1958&mdash; these are the only figures so far available&mdash;we find that the average is 102.7.  Therefore, in spite of the peals of joy and the whoopee going on about recovery, the position is that in 1956, the increase was 102.2 and that after going through 1957 and three-quarters of 1958, the figure is 102.7, an increase of .5 as compared with 1956, the year of Suez, the year of restriction, the year of shortage of petrol and oil, and the year in which it was found necessary, for balance of payments reasons, to impose levies which have had a very salutary effect in rectifying the balance of payments position.  Therefore, when Fianna Fáil Deputies tell us we are now on the road to the millennium, let them have regard to these facts, because these facts expose some other facets, grim and bleak facets, of our economy.</P>
      <P>Let us take the question of unemployment.  We were told by the Minister in 1957 that his Budget was a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; Budget.  We were told during the last general election campaign that all the people had to do was vote Fianna Fáil and all the unemployed husbands would immediately be restored to employment, that the problem of unemployment would be tackled aggressively, that the problem of emigration would be dealt with in a new and vigorous fashion and that so far as prices were concerned, the Government would guarantee the continuance of the then existing subsidies and would also continue to control prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have been in office for two years.  That is not an exhaustively long or fatiguing period to wait.  Nevertheless, it is half of the Government's normal period of office and although the Government promised in 1957 that they had a plan to put larger numbers of people back into employment, the fact remains according to the statistics issued by the Taoiseach's Office, that there are still 80,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges throughout the country.  There are 80,000 people unemployed two years after the Government's promise that they would deal aggressively with unemployment, <Col N="677" /> two years after the Minister for Finance said his Budget was a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; Budget.  There is no indication in the Vote on Account or in anything that has been said by Ministers, that these 80,000 will do anything but follow the seasonal fall, that as an immediate result of the policy of the Government any serious inroads will be made on the number registered as unemployed.</P>
    <P>Look at the question of the number of people employed under this Government, apart from the number of people unemployed.  On 14th January the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was asked if he would state the total number of persons in insurable employment for certain years.  The Parliamentary Secretary furnished the information on the customary basis, namely, by ascertaining the number of social welfare stamps sold, dividing those by 52 and getting the total number of people who are regularly insured. That has been the method always adopted to ascertain the number of people in insurable employment. So long as you adopt that method in respect of all the years for which the information is supplied, it is as reliable a guide as any other.</P>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, by this process of calculation, there were 489,000 persons in insurable employment in the year ended March, 1954; in the year ended March, 1955, there were 499,000; in the year ended March, 1956, there were 501,000; in the year ended March, 1957, there were 485,000; in the year ended March, 1958, the year of renaissance, according to Fianna Fáil, there were 464,000. Therefore, you have 80,000 people registered as unemployed and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach assures us that there were 21,000 fewer persons in insurable employment in the year ended March, 1958, than there were in the year ended March, 1957, and 37,000 fewer in the year ended March, 1958, than in the year ended March, 1956.</P>
    <P>These are significant statistics.  However, this position is hardly to be wondered at because housing as a means of providing employment is a <Col N="678" /> byword.  Work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which at one time gave employment to between 5,000 and 13,000 persons, has ceased because of the deliberate action of this Government.  Forestry work has fallen in labour content.  There are fewer and fewer people employed on road work.  Rural electrification has fallen and within the next couple of years will come to an end.  This clearly indicates the reasons not only for the continued high unemployment figure but for the fall in the number of persons who are actually engaged in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>We come to emigration.  The unemployment figure of 80,000 is bad, but it would be much worse were it not for the fact that the gates have been open and that employment on a large scale is still available in Great Britain, with the result that emigration to Britain to-day is at an all-time high figure.  In fact, the problem of emigration, the denuding of the rural areas, has been the subject of adverse comment by the Hierarchy, by priests and by rural organisations and, indeed, everybody who is concerned with the well-being of the country, who surveys the rural countryside, now feels obliged, as a national duty, to refer to the exodus of people from the rural areas&mdash;not merely single members of a family are going but the key is being turned in the door and whole families are emigrating. That is particularly true of those areas which are not industrialised and in which the people have to depend for their livelihood on the classes of employment which sustain life for the people and which have not made any economic advances.</P>
    <P>The grave problem about emigration is that it is bad enough that one member of a family should have to emigrate, but when a whole family is uprooted and forced to leave the country, there is not only the loss of the family but there is a future loss to the nation which is incalculable.  If I quote the figures in the Registrar General's Report, I cannot be accused of going to a tainted source for my information. The Registrar General's Report for the June quarter of 1958 makes interesting, if melancholy, reading.  He estimated <Col N="679" /> that the mid-year population in 1958 was 2,853,000 persons.  He said that the mid-year population for 1954, the year before, was 2,885,000 persons; in other words, there was a drop between mid-June, 1957, and mid-June, 1958, of 32,000 persons.</P>

      <P>I am sorry; it should be 1957.  There was a drop between the June, 1957, figure and the June, 1958, figure of 32,000 persons.  The natural increase in population during that period, the excess of births over deaths, was 28,000, so we ought to have had 60,000 more persons in the country.  The fact that we lost 32,000 in one year, apart from the natural increase in population of 28,000, making a total of 60,000, is clear evidence of the tidal wave of emigration which is flowing from this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the excess of births over deaths, so that the net emigration in the 12 months ended June, 1958, was, therefore, 60,000: 32,000 fall in population, and 28,000 in the excess of births over deaths. These are grave and grim figures.  Is there anything in the Vote on Account or in the White Paper which offers any early solution of these problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us turn to prices.  This Government, as is so well known, promised during the last general election that they would maintain the subsidies which were then running, but when they took office, they abolished the subsidies.  They saved millions for themselves by doing that, but they broke faith with the people who voted for them in the last general election. The effect of what they did when they abolished the food subsidies, and the <Col N="680" /> effect of their subsequent action in revoking a large number of the price control Orders, has been that the cost-of-living index figure which was 135 in February, 1957, increased to 142 in November, 1957, and stands at 146 for November, 1958, and all the indications are that the mid-February figures will be higher than 146.  In the two years since they took office, the Government have permitted the cost-of-living index figure to rise from 135 to 146, an increase of 11 points within two years.  It may be more than 11 points when we see the February figure, having regard to the way in which some prices have increased recently.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question which I put down in December last, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach gave us a long list of commodities which have increased in price since February, 1957.  I shall not go into this long list, which ranges from bus travel and rents to potatoes, but it is worth knowing that according to the Parliamentary Secretary's figures, the price of butter has increased by over 15 per cent.; the price of bread has increased by over 58 per cent.; the price of household flour has increased by over 79 per cent.; and those who are fond of potatoes will be glad to hear that the price of potatoes has increased by over 96 per cent.  These prices all increased during the reign of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Tánaiste speaking at a function, recently, about what he called stability of prices.  He took some special joy in showing that we had reached stability in prices.  What kind of stability is this&mdash;stability where the price of potatoes goes up by 96 per cent., the price of flour by 79 per cent., the price of butter by 15 per cent. and the price of bread by 58 per cent.?  Anybody can have that kind of stability.  According to the Tánaiste, stability in prices has now been reached, but it is stability at the highest level of prices which this generation has ever known.  We are paying more to-day for goods than has been paid in living memory and the Tánaiste gets some kind of <Col N="681" /> Machiavellian satisfaction in saying that that is stability.</P>
    <P>Now, look at the Government's record in the light of these figures, in the light of these facts.  There are 80,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges. There is nothing in sight, as far as they are concerned, except perhaps the seasonal fall in the number of unemployed.  Sixty thousand persons emigrated last year and our population is now at its lowest level in living memory.  Prices have gone up by 11 points since February, 1957, and the price level is higher than it has ever been in living memory, while the volume of production in the field of transportable goods has increased merely by .5, over a period of nearly three years.  Does any set of circumstances more aptly justify the description that, in an economic situation which has given us these indices, we are entitled to say that economic situation is one represented by two words&mdash;frustration and stagnation? While the economies of every other country in Europe are vibrant to-day, and the economies of other countries are much better and are progressing at a greater rate than ours, here is the sorry situation in which we are.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance quote figures of what we are providing for this and for that, but it was said in such a way as to give the impression that no other countries in the world are doing this except ourselves.  Of course, other countries are doing it on a much more generous scale than we are doing it. They are doing it better than we are doing it but, apparently, we are so far away from the main stream of European traffic, European discussion and European thought, that we appear to imagine we alone are doing these things for the enrichment of our people and the attainment of prosperity.  The fact of the matter, however, is that we are being outmatched by every other free country in Western Europe in the things we are doing to-day, and the rate of progress here is much slower than it is in any other country in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about the large <Col N="682" /> sums of money that will be made available this year, it is interesting to advert to one fact that was produced as a result of a parliamentary question in this House recently.  I asked the Taoiseach what sum of money would be required to-day to buy the same quantity of goods as the 5/- old age pension bought in 1908.  In 1908, the British Government introduced what was described as an Old Age Pensions Act.  Some gentlemen, who then claimed to represent the Irish people, thought it should not apply to Ireland, that the Irish people would not want old age pensions, that their feelings would be hurt if the pension were offered to them, that it was quite all right to pay pensions to generals and judges, but it was most unedifying to ask a person who had managed to live in Ireland to the age of 70 years to accept an old age pension. However, the Act was applied to Ireland, and the first old age pension was granted at the rate of 5/- a week.</P>
    <P>Nobody ever said that that was a munificent sum then.  Nobody ever pretended that it was anything but a mere token payment of the State's approbation of a person having gone through the mill and having reached the age of 70 years.  At that time, 5/- was granted, but, down through the vicissitudes of time, the cost of living has increased and, if we did no more than maintain the purchasing power of that 5/- granted in 1908, we would require to give an old age pension to-day of 24/6 a week, without having increased the rate of the old age pension. We are paying 25/- a week now, so that between 1908 and 1959, over a period of 50 years, we have not, in fact, raised the purchasing power of the old age pension in 1908, the 5/- then granted as a pittance to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>In all the millions of pounds that are talked about in this Vote on Account, and in all the millions of pounds that will be discussed on the Budget, there will probably be no provision for dealing with unfortunate people such as these.  When one thinks of their struggle to-day, especially in this city where old people <Col N="683" /> have to live on their own, and in the small towns and rural areas where they have to live on their own, providing some kind of house for themselves and whatever kind of amenities they can get in a house, it seems nothing short of a crime against humanity that, with the cost of living as high as it is to-day, we should be discussing a Vote on Account which makes no provision for lifting the poverty standard which must be tolerated by those who are unfortunate enough to have to live on 25/- a week.</P>
    <P>I hope that between now and Budget Day, the Minister for Finance can be induced to assemble a deep concern for the welfare of those unfortunate people.  Some 165,000 of them are compelled to live whatever life they can on a maximum of 25/- per week and, when one remembers that that has only the purchasing power of 5/- in 1908, or thereabouts, the injustice of keeping that pension at its present level must be manifest to all.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently spoke at a concert in the Mansion House in Dublin, commemorating the establishment of the First Dáil and, in the course of his speech, he uttered these wise words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The obvious common-sense objective at the moment is to consolidate what we have got, and we have a lot to do before it is consolidated. We have to try and provide a livelihood for those born in this country so that so many of them will not have to emigrate.  It is a difficult task but one to which we should devote ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are wise words and one would imagine that, as a preliminary to taking these necessary steps, and devoting ourselves to these tasks, the Taoiseach would endeavour to bring about a situation in which a political and economic climate would be created for a harnessing of all the enthusiasm that is necessary to accomplish the objective which the Taoiseach says is a common-sense objective.</P>
    <P>But having uttered these wise words the Taoiseach comes back to this <Col N="684" /> House and says: &ldquo;Now, lads, let us have another row over P.R.; let us have another row over something that will divide the House and the country in two.  Let us now engage in all the disputations we like, on a matter about which nobody is concerned except myself.&rdquo;  That is the Taoiseach's method of trying to devote ourselves to the accomplishment of that noble objective, and that is the best way of consolidating our forces to make sure we achieve it.  We have wasted three months of the time of this House discussing a Bill for which nobody asked.  We spent three months of valuable time that could have been employed in finding out how we could help provide jobs for the unemployed, finding out how we could help to arrest emigration, finding out how we could enthuse employers and workers to step up the volume of productivity in order that we might help to bring a greater measure of prosperity to the country.</P>
    <P>These tasks were too prosaic for this Government.  These mundane tasks did not suit the Taoiseach. Instead, we had to dissipate our energies and scatter our enthusiasm over a worthless Bill which has introduced more friction, and more disputation into the nation's life, than any other Bill introduced during the past 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss it.  The sooner June comes and we can lay that referendum to rest, the better.  I do not want to conceal the fact that there are serious economic problems facing the country, but I blame the Government for not recognising the seriousness of the problems and for giving Deputies here a brainwashing to induce them to believe that everything in the garden is lovely.  So long as there are 80,000 unemployed and 60,000 leaving the country every year, there must be a serious situation here.  So long as the standard of productivity represented by the figures I have quoted fails to show any substantial upward surge, there must be a serious economic problem here.  To let Deputies loose, as <Col N="685" /> Deputy Burke was let loose and as Deputy Haughey broke loose, to say that the people are much better off now than in 1956 is to engage in a derisive mockery of the sufferings of the people.</P>
      <P>I blame the Government for misleading decent people into believing that Fianna Fáil could solve these problems overnight, as they misled the people at the last election to believe.  I blame the Government now for pretending to believe that the situation is well in hand, when every reliable index indicates that we have problems which are not in any other Western European country.  The Government have the largest majority of any Government here in the past 25 years. There is nothing to prevent them from doing anything they want to do with the aid of their majority.  If they have a remedy for these problems, as they said they had at the last election, then they can solve the problems.  They can get the Bills drafted by the parliamentary draftsman; they can get their majority to press them or steamroll them through this House. They can do everything now that they could do, or said they could do, in 1957.  If the Government say they are doing that, why have we the large number of unemployed and why have we the tidal wave of emigration and why such a low standard of productivity?</P>
      <P>The plain fact is that in two years nobody can point to any substantial achievement by the Government.  If there be any such achievement, let us hear of it.  Recent speeches by Ministers indicate that the two chief talking points are the refinery at Whitegate and the copper development of Wicklow.  I have no doubt they will try to claim these as their special, monopolistic achievements; but let us hear from the Government Benches what in fact the Government have done in a spectacular way in the past two years and then contrast whatever they have done with what remains in the form of economic problems to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody stands in the way of the Government applying their talents, their energies and their majority to the solution of our basic problems. <Col N="686" /> There is goodwill in this House for any such measure introduced by the Government.  Why then do the Government not implement the promises they made at the last election?  Why do they not put all the people to work as they then promised?  Why do they not stop the tidal wave of emigration?  Why do they not bring back that kind of prosperity which they formerly imagined was the inseparable characteristic of the Fianna Fáil Government in power?  The Government with all their powers and their comfortable majority have failed to redeem the promises they made to the people.  This Vote on Account is for £38,000,000.  The Estimates for this year are larger than they were last year and when we have passed the Vote for £38,000,000 and the Estimates, with all the expenditure to be provided for, I venture to say that in the absence of some clear-cut decision intended to make an impact on our fundamental problems, next year when we come to discuss the Vote on Account, we shall be discussing the very same problems.</P>
    <P>The Government have power to act: unfortunately for some reason known only to themselves they will not now implement the promises which they made at the last election. They will not now do the things they then promised to do.  We would like to know why they will not do them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the way in which Deputy Norton has treated this very important matter.  He has made the same speech as Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Lynch and Deputy McQuillan.  I had hoped he would contribute something novel and, perhaps, somewhat more constructive, but all the Deputies I have named have done nothing except try to spread alarm and despondency. Deputy Norton is the only one who has quoted figures.  The others preferred to rely on their imaginations. But when Deputy Norton quotes figures, I cannot accept them, or his conclusions.  That was clearly the case in his reference to the total output of transportable goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He quoted from the official record <Col N="687" /> that, for 1956, the average was 102.2 and for 1957, it was 101.6, but he was at least honest enough to point out that this was an average over the whole year.  When I questioned him, he quite straightforwardly informed the House that the average for the first quarter of 1957 had dropped to 94.  That, of course, is an awkward point for Deputy Norton and members of the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will permit me to interrupt when he has the figures there, would he take note of the fact that the figure for the September quarter, for the third quarter of 1958, is in fact lower than the figure for the third quarter of 1956?  That is not a very striking achievement.</P>

      <P>The index figure for the third quarter of 1958 was 99.5.  It was as high as 96.6 in our worst year, 1956.  In other words, production was higher in the September quarter of 1956 than it was in the September quarter of 1958, two years later.</P>

The very fact that he took the trouble to average out gives me every reason for suspicion.  Consequently, I am not accepting any of the conclusions which he has drawn from the figures he has given.</P>

I am not sufficiently well qualified to draw the necessary conclusions and I think Deputy Norton quite clearly is not, either.  In actual fact, there is no justification for saying that unemployment has not been reduced.  There is no justification for saying that emigration is still mounting.  The facts are, quite clearly, entirely to the contrary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, like other Deputies, has gone back to this question of the removal of the food subsidies and has again accused the Government of having promised to maintain the subsidies. I hope that Deputy Norton is simply just forgetting the facts.  I hope it is just because he has not gone back to refer to the speeches which were made at that time, but I wish he would do so.  Then he would see perfectly clearly that we were accused by him of having a policy of abolishing food subsidies.

      <P>If the Deputy would also read it, it would help.  <i>The Statist</i> then carries on, in the second paragraph, by saying that the main reason is probably the emergence of a sense of direction at the centre.</P>
      <P>It follows, in the fourth paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The year was also marked by the actual achievement of some worth-while economic projects which also contributed to the spirit of hopefulness. A few important undertakings which had long been mooted but never forthcoming took physical shape and new ideas began to break through the hard crust of official dithering and political immobility.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, <i>The Statist</i> is not an organ of Fianna Fáil propaganda, but it refers to the new spirit of optimism and it refers to the reasons for it, the &ldquo;new <Col N="692" /> dynamic&rdquo; which is now apparent in the country.</P>
    <P>Referring again to the year 1958, <i>The Statist</i> comments as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the year industrial production rose while unemployment fell&mdash;the estimate is 6 per cent. under the 1957 figure ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A 6 per cent. reduction in unemployment, while it gives no cause for complacency, shows a move in the right direction.  Never in any election speech, in spite of the statements of Deputy Norton here to-day, did we promise that we would deal with unemployment or emigration overnight.  What we said we would do was that we would grapple with the situation.</P>

        <i>The Statist</i> goes on to comment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Emigration decreased by a figure which has been variously estimated up to as much as 50 per cent. although this estimate would appear too high.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although that estimate is probably too high nevertheless, if it is anything like 50 per cent. or even if we have reduced the rate of emigration by 30 per cent. we shall have done a good year's work in 1958.</P>
      <P>It is either forgotten or not known by the Opposition that when you start a slump or are experiencing a slump, the first thing you must do is to prevent the situation from getting any worse&mdash; and that is a big job on its own.  When you have the situation stable, it is a slow enough job to start the whole economy going again.  It has taken us two years to start making progress, but if, in the second of our two years, we can show, according to a dispassionate estimate, that unemployment has been reduced by 6 per cent. and that emigration has decreased by a very considerable figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not ascertainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, why talk about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there are various indications which are fairly reliable, as Deputy Coogan knows too.  I was a member of a local authority.  I know that, in 1956, the rate of emigration from my constituency was extremely high because corporation houses were coming readily on the market.  They were being vacated by people who were getting out of the country.  Consequently, the rate of rehousing on the housing panel was high, not because new houses were being built, but because houses were becoming vacant.  That situation no longer obtains, so far as I know it, and I have no reason to think it is different elsewhere.  All the indications are that emigration <Col N="694" /> has been substantially reduced and there is no indication to the contrary.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Statist</i> also goes on to comment on the increase in imports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In general, the increase in imports reflects the continuation of recovery in industrial production which began towards the end of 1957.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There again, by the end of 1957, when we had been in power for eight or nine months, during those eight or nine months, we had recovered from a depression and were beginning to show signs of that recovery.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the House to accept my word for it.  I am giving the dispassionate report of a leading financial journal.  It comments also on the question of the external assets of the country:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The country's external resources have not been reduced.  Indeed, on the contrary, the net external holdings in the banking system rose by £12.5 million between December, 1957, and December, 1958.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, surely is something which takes some explaining by the Opposition if they are not going to accept our view that that shows a sign of financial and industrial recovery, namely, an increase in external holdings in the banking system by £12.5 million in one year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Statist</i> editorial, in its concluding paragraphs, states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However, the outlook is reasonably good.  The price situation has been fairly well stabilised and the most recent inflationary pressures have worked themselves out of the economy.  The external trading position has appeared to be developing fairly satisfactorily although it has to be admitted that the January figures are disquieting.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the 1959 January figures.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Above all, however, the country is reacting to the new sense of direction at the centre and the present mood of buoyancy and optimism is the result.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Why should there be a mood of buoyancy and optimism noted by the experts of this financial journal, if there is no reason for it?  They are hard-headed men and they do not fall for political propaganda from anybody.</P>
    <P>I do not want to regard this purely as a banking question, but the whole situation in the banking world gives a very clear indication of the way things have moved during the past year.  I would quote from the report of the Bank of Ireland which shows that cash at head office and branches, at the Central Bank in Ireland and the Bank of England and cash at call and short notice increased during the year by practically £5,000,000.  The advances to customers went down by almost £2,000,000. When things are going badly, people need money.  In actual fact, they did not need as much from the bank and they put far more in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to read a quotation from the chairman's speech at the end of a meeting of the Bank of Ireland.  He comments as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to other aspects of our balance sheet you will observe that Government and other public current accounts are greater by over £3,000,000, and an encouraging increase of over £6,000,000 is shown in deposit, current and other accounts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not show dwindling savings, <Col N="696" /> shortage of money, lack of confidence &mdash;quite the reverse.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the period a number of substantial overdrawn accounts were largely reduced or ran into credit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that important, do you think?  Of course, it is.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the statement of the annual meeting of the Provincial Bank of Ireland and the chairman's speech on that occasion.  The Chairman of the Provincial Bank of Ireland comments as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This brings me to a point where I may comment on what to me is one of the most encouraging features of 1958, the revival in the prices of Irish industrial shares after four years or more of neglect by the investors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Four years, or more, takes us back, by coincidence, to 1954:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There can be no better indication of confidence in our country than investment at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, from the chairman of a bank, surely deserves comment.  That statement was made by the Chairman of the Provincial Bank and he says that this confidence is shown by the revival in the prices of Irish industrial shares.</P>
    <P>Those are facts and figures.  I have left the comments to those who are qualified to make them.  I do not want anybody to feel that anybody&mdash;certainly, so far as I am concerned, I am not complacent&mdash;on this side of the House is complacent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are beginning to make progress.  That is where you are talking nonsense, and Deputy MacEoin too.  The facts show that emigration is down, unemployment is down and that production is up.  What more do you want?  You want to go on rotting and rotting in the condition you left and I cannot blame you for that; you had not got a sense of direction, or a policy, to get yourselves out of the slough of despond into which you had fallen.  That is clearly stated in <i>The Statist</i>, that at least we have a sense of direction, that we are grappling with the problems and that optimism and real confidence have been restored.  But that does not have an immediate effect and will not and cannot reduce the figure of unemployment from 80,000 to 50,000, to 20,000 and to nil all at once.  Anyone who even suggests that unemployment can be dealt with overnight, or even in two years, is talking nonsense and if he does not realise that, he would be better off keeping quiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in coming before this House, or going before the people at any stage, and saying that we are grappling with the situation, that we are making progress.  We are not doing it as fast as we would like to do it, but we are continually going forward and making progress.  We have nothing to be ashamed of and we have confidence in the country, although the Opposition speakers seem to have none.  We hope the spirit of optimism and confidence will spread, which will result in increased industrial investment and increased agricultural investment and lead to greater employment and a decrease in unemployment. It will also affect, and continue to affect, the rate of emigration. Emigration, to some extent, will always be with us, but we are reducing <Col N="698" /> it to the minimum.  We have done remarkably well in two years and I hope the Opposition will face facts and not try to spread alarm and despondency in the country and amongst those who propose to invest in it. That is doing a grave disservice to the country.  Let the Opposition by all means criticise us for our policy, if and when they can, but do not let them try to drag the country down with them as they did before.</P>

      <P>They had received from the Irish people a vote of confidence and a direction to do a particular job of work as quickly as possible.  They had been given an over-all majority to an extent that no Government had ever been given here in this House before, and they had received from the people, in the election held two years ago, the greatest possible direction that they were to carry out the promises they had made during the general election campaign. The particular job for which they were elected, and for which they had got this big majority, was to end unemployment and to stem emigration.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt whatever that that was the mandate given to the Government by the Irish people at that time.  It was because they had told the people they were in a position&mdash;on one condition only&mdash;to end unemployment and to stem emigration that they got that majority.  The condition that Fianna Fáil put up at that time was that they would get a clear, over-all majority and be a strong Government to do the job that had to be done and to solve the problems that faced the people.  They got that strong Government; they got the over-all majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years have passed and how have they fulfilled the promises they made two years ago and what is the <Col N="699" /> position of the country now?  It was a very favourable position for any Government to be in; they had the confidence of the people and the clearest possible limited objectives to fulfil as a Government.  In addition to that, we on this side of the House&mdash;I speak for the Fine Gael Party and I am sure with the approval of my colleague, Deputy Norton&mdash;offered our co-operation to the Government, with their clear majority.  We realised our object in opposition.  We realised, not merely from what we saw in the country, but from our own experiences as a Government for two years, that the problems that would afflict any Government were not easy of solution and required, above all, the co-operation of every section of the people, and of those in the Dáil, if there was to be any possible hope of an early solution and, therefore, I offered, on behalf of Fine Gael, and I am sure I had the approval of every section of the Opposition, to cooperate with them.  We offered the Government at that time our co-operation and goodwill, and indeed our sympathy, in the job they had facing them.</P>
    <P>We told the Government, and we told the people through the Dáil, that our paramount consideration, as an Opposition, would be to keep in mind the vital national considerations and the financial and economic problems that had to be faced and solved, if Parliament itself and Irish institutions were not to be put in jeopardy.  The Government had these favourable conditions: they had a clear majority; they had a clear direction given to them by the people; and they had an Opposition that was prepared to cooperate with them and to weigh in, so far as it was possible to do so, in finding a solution of those problems.  We felt, as I said at the time, that not merely were the Fianna Fáil Government on trial but that Parliament itself was on trial, and the effectiveness of parliamentary institutions and the working of Irish democracy would be tested and tried by the measure of success the Government's efforts met in the years that then faced them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> I think that was a favourable position for any Government to be in, but, apart from that, the previous Government which they succeeded, despite the jeers of the Minister for Health&mdash;in spite of the extraordinary speech he inflicted on the Dáil yesterday&mdash;had brought this country successfully out of one of the most difficult financial crises&mdash;and through economic conditions&mdash;that ever afflicted a Government since this State was established.  With their clear majority, with their direction from the people, and with the offer of co-operation from the Opposition in this House, the Government were presented with the position that the difficulties that had afflicted the country for the previous 18 months had been overcome, and there had been put into partial operation a policy for production designed to increase agricultural production, and designed, above all, to give incentives to Irish industry to do what was then so vitally and urgently necessary in the national interests, to increase exports.  Those were more favourable conditions than certainly any Government which I had the privilege of directing had during the six years we were in office.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the inter-Party Government in dealing with the financial and economic crises of the times solved the difficulties in the balance of payments and presented this Government and the people&mdash;we are glad we did&mdash;with a situation in which not merely was the deficit in our balance of payments wiped out, but, for the first time for many years, the country had a favourable balance in its international payments.  Were those not favourable conditions for any Government?  What has happened since in the international field?  For two years, terms of trade have been entirely in favour of this country.  During the years in which we were afflicted with the economic blizzard of the times, the terms of trade were violently against us.  Had we had the terms of trade the present Government have had in the past two years, they would have made a difference of anything from £7,000,000 to £10,000,000 per year in helping us towards a solution of the problems that confronted us.</P>
    <P>This Government have had those <Col N="701" /> favourable conditions for the past two years.  Terms of trade have remained constantly favourable.  That fact cannot be denied.  Import prices have fallen.  Export prices have been maintained at a pretty high level.  In our day, freight rates and import prices were constantly fluctuating and we had to face that condition of adversity as well as all the other difficulties and trials confronting the country.  We were fortunate in overcoming them, but, with such favourable conditions to-day, the country was entitled to be assured by the Minister yesterday that substantial progress has been made in solving whatever difficulties this Government were elected to solve&mdash;chronic unemployment, emigration and decreasing production.</P>
    <P>I listened to the last speaker and I heard him say that there was to-day a mood of buoyancy and optimism in the country.  That mood of buoyancy and optimism may be found within the pages of economic journals like <i>The Statist</i>, but it will not be found in the ordinary people outside.  Only last evening, I was told that 60 firms have either gone into liquidation or have closed down.  Business was never so bad as it is at the present moment.</P>

      <P>There has been some little progress made in industrial production and some slight progress made in reducing the number of unemployed, but there are still people hungry and there are still people on the verge of starvation.  That is the result of two years of strong Fianna Fáil Government.  What was their attitude towards our offer of co-operation? It is an established characteristic of Fianna Fáil&mdash;indeed it is their boast from their Leader right down to the humblest member of the Party&mdash;that they will not co-operate with anybody. They want to be a strong, independent Government, and a strong Party.  With nobody will they co-operate.  They sneer and jibe at Coalitions and at the co-operation that existed between the various Parties constituting the Coalition Governments here.  Their idea of co-operation is that everybody will do what they are told to do by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> I saw in this morning's paper that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of the opinion that the problems of the country require a united effort by all sections of the people in order to solve them.  But Fianna Fáil does not want the kind of co-operation we had in the inter-Party Government, co-operation from various interests and different sections all united in a common purpose for the promotion of the national good. Their idea of co-operation is to have a strong Government and a Parliament doing nothing except registering the will of that Government, having ceased to be a deliberative assembly, and the people doing precisely what Fianna Fáil tells them to do.  That is not our idea of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Had there been any substantial progress it should have been easy for the Minister, when opening this debate yesterday, to have given some indication of what had been achieved and some indication as to what hopes were for the future, instead of the dreary litany of increases and decreases in the various Estimates.  We had strong comment on the bad case the Government have to make in the speech of the Minister for Health yesterday, a speech which was at once a disgrace to the Government of which he is a member and to Parliament.</P>

      <P>The type of speech made by the Minister for Education this morning should have been the headline for all the speeches made on the Government side of the House, considering they have now been a full two years in control of the affairs of the country.  The Minister for Education made an effort to be at least constructive and he laid a foundation which would enable constructive debate to take place here. How did the Minister for Health approach the matter?  His entire speech was a diatribe against the two inter-Party Governments and an attempt to show that all the ills that afflict the country are due to what he called the evil policy and the evils that were thought up during the inter-Party Government's terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> We are accustomed to the type of speech the Minister for Health made yesterday.  It consisted of nothing but misrepresentation of fact, defamatory innuendoes of a personal character and calumny of the worst description.  The former Minister for Finance is put up by the Fianna Fáil Government as one of their principal speakers, if not the principal speaker, and, instead of dealing with the situation as it exists, instead of trying to show that the Government have made some progress in the last two years and hope to continue that progress in the years to come, he spent his time calumniating me and my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Speakers should certainly not have been disposed in a debate of this character to go over again the alleged ills of the Coalition Government, thereby drawing from us, of necessity, a reply to the false accusations made by the Minister for Health against me and my colleagues.  Those tactics ill-became the Minister for Health, the Minister responsibe for the infamous Budget of 1952, the Budget which has brought about, in my unalterable conviction, most of the financial and economic evils affecting the country to-day.  It is the Minister for Health who must bear the responsibility for them, and for him to come in here yesterday and make the allegations he made against me and my colleagues was something which disgraces not only himself but the Government of which he is a member.</P>
    <P>When we took office in 1954, we were met with a situation of no inconsiderable difficulty, caused principally by the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the incorrect diagnosis of the condition of the country in 1952.  We had a serious task to face. I do not propose at this stage to go into all the answers that can be made to the Minister for Health and his allegations yesterday.  I would merely point out that the answers will be found in Volume 127, columns 328 onwards, of the Official Report where I answered everything the Minister for Health said yesterday in so far as it was relevant up to the year 1952.  I do not propose now to follow him once <Col N="704" /> more in all the allegations he made yesterday.  I want to draw a parallel between the 1952 position under his Budget and the position in which we find ourselves now under the 1957 Budget.</P>
    <P>We took office in 1954 with a clear direction from the people.  It was admitted by the Taoiseach that we had a mandate to form an inter-Party Government, and form an inter-Party Government we did.  We found that the financial position had been distorted and the economy disrupted by reason of the financial proposals in the Budget of 1952.  That was the greatest difficulty, the biggest fence we had to jump, to try to bring about a better situation that would rectify the disruption of the economy and the distortion of the finances that were brought about by the withdrawal of the food subsidies in 1952&mdash;all brought about by reason of the wrong diagnosis of the so-called economic ills in the year 1952.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton this afternoon saved me from considerable trouble by his quotation of certain statistics, and in so far as I make the points I have to make, I shall deal with them with the minimum of statistics.  In 1954 and 1955, we set ourselves a task to try to undo the harm done by the 1952 Budget.  Unfortunately, we were met at the end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956, and then all through the year, with the conditions which brought about the financial troubles of that year, culminating in the grave dislocation that was caused not merely in this country, but in practically every country in the world by the Suez crisis.  But the Minister for Health says it was not the Suez crisis brought about the large unemployment in 1957; it was not the dislocation of trade caused by the Suez crisis in that year that was the cause, but the evil policies of the inter-Party Government. When one of the chief Ministers of the Government in existing circumstances is reduced to making such a case in order to bolster up the present condition of affairs under his Government, it is the greatest manifestation of the poverty of argument and poor case the Government have to justify the present condition of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> Deputy Norton has indicated the condition as far as employment, industrial production and the cost of living are concerned.  I want merely to corroborate his statement and approach it, perhaps, in a slightly different manner. The first assertion I want to make &mdash;and it cannot be controverted&mdash;is that the Government have not yet, and probably never will, reach the achievement that was attained by the second inter-Party Government in 1955, when in that year the number of unemployed was 38,200&mdash;the lowest figure ever achieved.  That was before Suez and the international situation brought about the conditions we had to meet. What hope have we got now from the policy of the Government, whether in the White Paper or elsewhere, or any policy or lack of policy, of ever reaching that position where we had the unemployment figure for that year at the lowest it ever was in the country, 38,200?  No scurrility or buffoonery by the Minister for Health can get over that figure.</P>
    <P>Take the position as it stands at the moment.  For February, the unemployment figure was 80,001.  There has been a decrease in unemployment&mdash; there is no doubt about that&mdash;a small decrease and a big decrease from the figure that resulted in 1957 when this country was afflicted by a petrol shortage and a shortage of every commodity that had to be imported and by the dislocation of trade caused by the Suez crisis.  That was the year in which the peak of the unemployment figure was reached.  I have given the figure for 1955.  At the end of 1955 and in 1956, international affairs complicated the economic structure of this country as well as others.  At the end of February, 1956, the unemployment figures were 70,800.  That was after I had been down in Cork making the speech the Minister for Health referred to yesterday in which I warned the country that there were financial and economic dangers ahead.</P>
    <P>Speaking from recollection, I made that speech some time in January at a time when we had warnings that conditions were worsening here, due to a crisis over which we had no control. Even then, the unemployment figures <Col N="706" /> had only risen to 70,800.  We thought it was a big figure at that time and for that reason I had to go down to Cork and at the Cork Chamber of Commerce, I warned the people that we were facing very difficult times. Two years after the Government came into office, with their strong Government and clear directive, and the figure was 80,001&mdash;10,000 more than the figure in a bad year.  In two years' time, they have not yet got down the unemployment figure to the figure of 70,000 in February, 1956, when we were facing the bad times.  After two years, that is nothing to boast about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also referred this morning to certain figures relating to employment.  I have spoken about unemployment. He gave figures about those in employment, which are also very relevant and important statistics and an indicator to consider in the context of the buoyancy of the economy and the cheerfulness of the outlook.  I shall give only a few figures, which lead to this conclusion, that while there has been a slight improvement in the past two years in the number in actual employment, the number in employment is still below our 1955 figure by over 6,000.</P>
    <P>In two years of this strong Government that had all the answers to all our economic difficulties, they have not yet got back to putting into employment the people who wanted employment, and there are 6,000 fewer in employment now than there were in the year 1955, when the inter-Party Government were in office.  The figure for the total number of persons engaged in industry producing transportable goods was 158,619 in the December quarter of 1955.  In the December quarter of 1956&mdash;that was the bad year, the year of crisis and the year of Suez&mdash;150,632 were still in employment.  In the December quarter of 1957, after the Government had come into office with their promises of immediate amelioration of unemployment and emigration, there were 151,209 in employment.  In the December quarter of 1958, just a couple of months ago, the figure was 152,489.  So that now, after two years of strong government and in a condition where <Col N="707" /> we are told by <i>The Statist</i> or somebody else there is buoyancy, optimism and cheerfulness, they have not yet got back by 6,000 those in employment in the December quarter of 1955 after one and a half years of government by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Industrial production is another indicator, and again the figures for industrial production, since the strong Government took office, are still below the figures achieved by us in 1955 when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I shall give the figures.  The volume of production of industries producing transportable goods for the September quarter of 1955 was 107.3 and for the December quarter of the same year, 1955, 113.5, so that, as I have already said and I repeat, industrial production is still below the figure achieved by us in the second inter-Party Government in 1955, after two years of strong Government and in a mood of optimism and buoyancy in the country, moryah.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to consumer prices.  The position regarding that is that while we were in office, we sweated blood to keep down the cost of living.  Every device we could possibly think of was employed to keep down the cost of living.  That was our unanimous policy in the inter-Party Government.  We never deliberately at any time increased the cost of living. It went up during that period of economic strife, stress and crisis through circumstances over which we had no control.  The terms of trade have been for two years completely in favour of the present Government, but the cost of living has gone up twice the rate it went up during our time.</P>

      <P>The Minister can disprove my assertion if he likes.  I have made it.  We did not deliberately put up the cost of living.  The cost of living went up through circumstances over which we had no control during our time because of economic conditions outside.  The terms of trade were against us.  Now the terms of trade have been in favour of this Government for two years and the cost of living ought to have come down.  It did not because it was deliberately put up because the Government withdrew the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>I do not mind the Minister interrupting.  I think we are probably at cross-purposes.  I am pointing out that we did not in either period of the inter-Party Government do anything by deliberate Government action to increase the cost of living. On the contrary, we did everything possible to keep it down.  We did everything that any Government could have done by controlling prices, subsidising foodstuffs, by exhortation and by resort to every device that human ingenuity could consider and we kept down the cost of living in the most difficult circumstances and in the most trying times.  We did so not merely for the purpose of keeping down the cost of living; we did so because we felt it was in the national interest that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wages and wages policy were discussed yesterday by Deputy McGilligan. It was quite clear in our time that if the cost of living went up any more as it had gone up by the deliberate policy of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee we were in for another round of wages increases, with consequent disruption of the economy.  It was for the purpose of <Col N="709" /> maintaining stability of prices, so far as we could do it, that we did everything possible to maintain the cost of living at as stable a level as possible and prevent it rising and certainly prevent it rising by any deliberate action of the Government.</P>
    <P>We felt it was necessary to keep wages and prices stable.  We had the example of the infamous Budget of 1952 which had effects which are still current in the economy of this country and which will be felt for very many years to come, due to the pig-headedness of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, and his wrong diagnosis of the economic conditions of the country and the future of the country at that time.</P>
    <P>At that time, we pointed out that the removal of the food subsidies was not justified.  Economists say that food subsidies are a bad thing.  The gloomy scientists say that, as a matter of principle, it is a bad thing.  In so far as there is any principle at all or science in economics, of course, it is a wrong thing from the point of view of principle, but when you are dealing with the unemployed and handling a political situation of a very difficult and explosive character, theories of economists are very far from reality and entirely divorced from the facts.  The unemployed man does not care what brought about unemployment.  All he knows is that he is out of employment and that he has to pay more for his food.  The man in employment knows that if the price of his food is increased either he goes out of employment or he must get his wages increased.</P>
    <P>No amount of economic theory will get over those human facts and it is those human facts we had regard to and not economic theories.  We kept down the cost of living because we did not want to bring about instability through further rounds of wage increases. We were successful in that.</P>
    <P>We pointed out on the 1952 Budget that the Government and the country, particularly the country, whatever about the Government, were going to make no gain because of the withdrawal of the food subsidies at that time.  We were proved to be absolutely right in every detail.  In regard to the <Col N="710" /> so-called savings by the removal of the food subsidies in the Budget of 1952, when the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, said that wages and salaries had gone beyond the cost of living, we pointed out that what was going to happen was that any savings would be swallowed up by the increase in wages and by the increase in rates consequent upon the increase in the cost of living all over the country.</P>
    <P>That is what happened.  The economy was disrupted.  The finances were disorganised.  Wages increased. Several rounds of wage increases occurred and so far from the country or the Government getting anything out of that saving in the food subsidies, taxation was increased directly or indirectly and the people had to pay more in wages and in increased rates for the so-called saving on the food subsidies.  That was a mistake, as we pointed out at the time.</P>
    <P>The same mistake was made in 1957 by the withdrawal of the food subsidies. Nothing has been gained to the economy of the country by the withdrawal of £9.4 million of food subsidies through the Budget of 1957. Nothing whatever has been gained. There has been a partial increase in wages, due to the patriotic outlook of those in receipt of salaries and wages.  The full demand they were entitled to make, consequent upon the withdrawal of the food subsidies and of the increase in the cost of living, was not pressed either by the trade unions or by the organisations representing the Civil Service, the Guards, the teachers and other sections of the community whose wages should have been increased.  But small as were the increases, they have again dislocated the economy and disrupted the finances of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan yesterday afternoon said that the rates were going up everywhere, due directly to the policy of the Government and brought into operation in the Budget of 1957. There can be no doubt that there will be further demands for increased salaries and wages.</P>
    <P>We find on the face of the Book of Estimates for this year the figure for Other Services, as distinct from Capital Services, is £101,127,575, that is, just <Col N="711" /> £1,000,000 less than the corresponding figure on the Book of Estimates for 1957-58, the Estimates that were prepared during the period when the second inter-Party Government were in office.  In other words, taking into account that £9.4 million has been saved on food subsidies, taking into account also the fact that certain items which were in the Book of Estimates in our time under the head of current expenditure, have now been transferred to Capital Services, we are entitled to say that the Book of Estimates this year, one-third of which the Minister asks for in this Vote on Account, represents an expenditure of the same amount as was in issue in the year 1957-58 when the Book of Estimates was prepared by the inter-Party Government. That means that the Government proposes to spend as much in the forthcoming year as was spent at a time when the inter-Party Government were providing £9.4 million for food subsidies and also providing money for other services that were regarded as current and not as capital.</P>
    <P>That £9.4 million is being lost to the community.  It is being swallowed somewhere.  It certainly has not been gained.  It would have been expected that if £9.4 million had been saved through food subsidies, at least some millions of pounds of that might have been available to reduce taxation, but on the figures which now appear there is not a penny farthing available to reduce taxation.  Judging by the amount of taxation that has been imposed on the people in the past 12 months, when the Budget comes to be framed, there ought to be room for manoeuvre in the Government's policy for the reduction of taxation.</P>
    <P>In the nine months ended in December of last year, the Government have taken from the pockets of the Irish people, in customs duty alone, £37,805,000, not to talk about income-tax and all the other taxes.  There is a mood of optimism and cheerfulness when 60 firms have closed down, when business was never as bad as it is and the unemployment figure is 10,000 more than it was in the year 1956 with the conditions that had to be faced then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> That is the general outline of present-day conditions.  The Minister for Education, as I said, at least did his best to make a speech justifying the Government and to give some material on which discussion could take place.  He went through the list of items on which the Government proposed to make expenditure: to assist industry and agriculture and to give further relief to education; and he went down through this White Paper that was recently produced by the Government as a so-called economic plan.  It plans to bring certain aids to industry and agriculture and to give certain incentives to private enterprise, but there is no target.  There is not a single word either in the study or in the White Paper itself as to what extent the figures for unemployment will be reduced as a result of this policy.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is required above all to bring about some improvement in industry and agriculture, to end unemployment and stem emigration, is a reduction of taxation.  I am as convinced now as I was when I was in Government that all these incentives, subsidies, and so on, are just palliatives, that the one thing that is absolutely required to bring about economic expansion and to end unemployment is a reduction of taxation.  The Minister for Finance might sneer, but the Minister for Health would almost certainly sneer at that statement, but we are entitled to point this out, that several times the inter-Party Government reduced taxation and at the same time increased social benefits.  Never at any time during the 20 years of Fianna Fáil Government have they once reduced taxation.  Their history has always been to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>Our policy was based upon expansion, the bringing about of such a condition in industry and agriculture as would improve our under-developed economy.  We realised that by reducing taxation, increased revenue would accrue.  That was the basis of the inter-Party Government policy operated in 1948-51, to decrease taxation and at the same time, increase old age pensions and other benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> There is no good in talking about optimism or buoyancy.  The only thing that can help this country is a reduction of taxation and some enlightened policy in regard to taxation. I have had some experience over the years, both in Government and in Opposition, of knowing the difficulties of reducing taxation and expenditure, but we can point to what was done in that regard between 1948-51.  We had hoped to do the same in the second period of office, if it had not been for the economic blizzard, but we did it on at least two occasions.</P>
    <P>The Government can and ought to reduce taxation.  They have tremendously increased means of taxation&mdash; customs and excise, income-tax and other taxation, direct and indirect&mdash; available to them this year.  They may throw their hat at White Papers and economic surveys, studies, and all the rest of it, unless they can reduce taxation.  It is the only way to stimulate business.  There is no incentive at the moment to business or industry to expand.  There is no incentive to produce more because the more you produce, the more profit you make, the more tax you give to the Government. That is why the people are not making the necessary effort.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate that we should work towards what is recognised so clearly in the United States by the trade unions and by the employees, that the richer the employer is, the more profits the employer makes, the better off the worker is.  That is their policy as I understand it.  Perhaps it is over-simplifying it, but apparently they have no use for poor employers. The employees can get bigger salaries and wages, have more cars, refrigerators, television sets, and so on, if the employer makes more profit.  We are stopping all private industry incentives here in this country and until you ease up from that position, you will not get any economic expansion, but if you can decrease taxation, then there will be increased expansion and increased revenue, and it will be possible again to undertake what is the second urgent task in this country&mdash;to increase the amounts payable to old age pensioners, widows and orphans, blind pensioners and those who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> I am not advocating a reduction in taxation for the purpose of putting money into the pockets of the industrialists and business men or to make rich men richer.  I am advocating that this is the only secure remedy for the present position of affairs and the only certain means by which that economic expansion, which is so absolutely essential if we are to make any economic progress, can be brought about.  If you bring that about, you will have expansion in business and I believe that what occurred in 1948 to 1951 can occur again.  By a reduction in taxation you will get even increased revenue, more revenue than was got from the higher taxation, but Fianna Fáil do not know how to decrease taxation. I am advocating that for the purpose of bringing about an expansion in industry and business and also so that we will be in a position to give what is absolutely essential at present&mdash;some alleviation of conditions for the old, the poor and the sick.</P>
    <P>The two are intertwined.  We did it in 1948 and 1951 and I am not talking now merely because I am in opposition.  We can point to what was done in 1948 and 1951 when we reduced taxation and, at the same time increased old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions and unemployment assistance. That was done then, and what was done once can be done again.  I have listened to people and read speeches of people representing industry and commerce, such as chambers of commerce and bodies of that character, talking about Government expenditure. We started a scheme for the expenditure of public moneys on capital services and in this study, this survey of economic development they clearly recognise the principle on which we acted at that time, when we started this policy of productive capital expenditure, the expenditure of public moneys on productive enterprises.  It is recognised in this study of economic development, as well as in the White Paper, that the level of public expenditure by the Government and other authorities affects economic growth and therefore stimulates employment. If you reduce capital expenditure on the kind of works that were initiated&mdash;<Col N="715" /> capital productive works&mdash;by the inter-Party Government in 1948, then you reduce employment and you increase emigration and decrease the wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>According to some people who talk about it, expenditure of itself is a bad thing.  So long as expenditure is on productive enterprises, not merely is it good but it is essential in the circumstances we find in this country.  In this economic survey which has been circulated by the Government, you find recognition of the fact that the public capital programme which was in existence when this study was made clearly shows, in relation to capital expenditure by public authorities, which include the Government, local authorities, the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, and all those other bodies that that expenditure was growing less and less each year, and unless something was done to deal with that situation, expenditure on capital development would decrease as the years went by and finally disappear.  It was to meet that situation that the suggestions made in this study and in the White Paper were brought out, inadequately, as I hope to show in a few moments.</P>
    <P>Some of these people who talk about expenditure forget that the essential thing to remember is that provided the expenditure is for productive purposes, there can be no objection to it. There is no shortage of capital in this country, I believe, for productive enterprise, and it should be remembered, too, by these people who criticise public expenditure so glibly and talk about the necessity for having loans year by year, and thereby, when each loan comes along, add to the national debt the amount which must be added each year to current expenditure to provide for the service of the debt, that if the moneys which have been provided for productive capital projects are properly spent, this expenditure will result in increased production and that production itself will be self-supporting and tend to pay to a very large extent for the increases in the charge for the service of the debt.</P>
    <P>That is overlooked but that is what happened in our time when we initiated <Col N="716" /> and carried out a programme of capital development.  What has happened at the present time under the Government's proposals is that there is a recognition of the fact that expenditure on capital projects such as building construction, transport, forestry, fisheries, fuel, power, industrial credit, industrial grants, national development and all the rest would tend to taper off, and in order to meet that situation which, if allowed to develop, would not merely not have solved unemployment but would have increased the difficulties of providing employment, these aids and savings referred to in the White Paper were devised; but the fact of the matter is that so far as an examination of this White Paper and its proposals are concerned, it would appear that the proposals are largely&mdash;perhaps it is overstating the case to say &ldquo;largely&rdquo;&mdash;are to a considerable extent illusory.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that this White Paper issued by the Government does not set itself any targets, that it is not, and most specifically does not claim to be, a plan. It calls itself a programme for economic development.  I think that when the programme is examined, it will be found that it will not result in securing any significant increase in employment.  It is significant that either the study, or the White Paper which is based upon it, does not, at any place, try to estimate to what extent the proposals in the White Paper will make any significant contribution to the ending of unemployment, the stemming of emigration, or increased production.</P>
    <P>I know, and it was pointed out to me by an economist the other night, that you may have increased production in agriculture, which is very essential and very necessary.  Indeed, it may increase the wealth of the country and that may be a very valuable thing, but you may increase production and increase wealth, without, of necessity, increasing the number of people who will be put into employment.  So while it is very desirable that the farmers should have their fertilisers at the cheapest possible rate, while they should have <Col N="717" /> lime available to them at subsidised rates, and while they should have as many incentives as possible, and every aid available to increasing agricultural production, in order to save the country from the economic difficulties which it would have run into if agriculture had not been brought to the position it was in as a result of the policy between 1948 and 1951, nevertheless, it has to be borne in mind that all that aid to agriculture, necessary as it is, essential as it must be admitted to be, may not result&mdash; unless the programme is so developed and so organised that it will increase employment&mdash;in having any real impact on the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters that will bring about employment.  In this study and in the White Paper, which is the child of the study, so to speak, we find that there are provisions made for increasing the amount available for industrial credit and for agricultural credit.  There are provisions made, too, for matters in connection with the nitrogenous fertiliser project and other matters of that kind, but the amount that is forecast, or is thought, that will be available by way of industrial and agricultural credit is certainly in my view, entirely illusory.</P>
    <P>When you take the experience of people who have availed themselves of industrial or agricultural credit in the past, and even if you say there will be an increased resort to these matters, then I think, on any reasonable view or on any possible, reasonable prospect, the amount set down in the White Paper for these will never be reached and where is the employment content in that?  If you do not get your programme so framed that it will necessarily increase employment, then all these plans and projects for subventions in the White Paper will have no effect, from the point of view of dealing with the urgent problem of unemployment.  There are £220.44 million, including a sum of £7,000,000 for the nitrogenous fertiliser project, adverted to in this White Paper.</P>
    <P>I want to point out, first of all, in reference to that matter that £220.44 million is itself an illusory figure.  It looks grand that you are going to spend <Col N="718" /> £220.44 million in the next five years and perhaps those people, whom Government speakers have referred to as being optimistic and buoyant, are suffering from a rush of blood to the head because they saw £220.44 million going to be spent in the next five years, which it was stated would produce dramatic results for the country. But, when you divide that sum by five, it is practically the average at which capital expenditure has been during the past five years, and nothing more.  That sum has only a nominal value of £220.44 million, but, of course, the value of money is falling all the time and, if the value of money continues to fall, there will of course, be less spent on capital projects, and in the formation of capital, which is so essential to provide employment, the result may very well be that the policy may be deflationary rather than stimulating to the economy.</P>
    <P>At all events, the point I want to make is if that money is to be spent, it must be spent in directions which will produce employment.  Arterial drainage may produce employment; the Local Authorities (Works) Act undoubtedly produced employment of a very valuable character, and it had the effect, not merely of giving employment, but also of assisting production. All that is swept away now.  The Land Project gave vast employment.  Not merely did it increase the productivity of the land and the fertility of the soil, enabling this country to achieve the situation it has now achieved that our agricultural exports have been doubled in volume and trebled in value since 1948, but it gave a considerable amount of direct and indirect employment.</P>
    <P>Now this plan, which is expected to bring about such a record of buoyancy and bountifulness, proposes to do away with Part B of the Land Project, which is one of the ways by which employment could be given.  Therefore, instead of providing employment by means of continuing the Land Project, or extending Part B which gave employment, and instead of continuing the Works Act, which undoubtedly gave employment, the Government now provide a certain amount of <Col N="719" /> incentives to private enterprise, and hope for the best.</P>
    <P>What guarantee have we that anybody will take up additional agricultural or industrial credits, and if they do, that additional employment will be given as a result of it?  The expenditure envisaged in this White Paper to a large extent depends on whether private individuals and private enterprises take up the money.  This is not £220,000,000 that is to be spent in any event.  A very large amount depends on outside people&mdash;whether they will take up the money or avail of the opportunities which are placed at their disposal.  Therefore, to a large extent, this White Paper, in so far as people are building their hopes upon it, merely gives a very shifty foundation upon which to build hopes.</P>
    <P>There must be decreased taxation if we are to have any hope of expansion. There must be decreased taxation which will bring expansion and through expansion, greater revenue and, through greater revenue, ease for those sections of the community which so urgently desire it and require it, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and blind pensioners, and all the afflicted sections of our community, the sick and the poor.  There must be order to end unemployment.  There must be some plan or policy which will result in work, which will result not merely in the creation of wealth and increased production, but which will result in work and projects from which work will become available.  Unless that is done, the futile efforts which have been so significant in the Government's policy during the past two years will still bring evil results to the country in the next two or three years.</P>

      <P>Coming from a constituency where Government policy is adversely affecting the population, both rural and urban, and where emigration and unemployment are rife, I think it mandatory on me to contribute to this discussion.  It is quite true to say that a number of those people who, at the present time, <Col N="720" /> are despondent about the future, are, to a big extent, the authors of their own misfortune.  In the 1957 general election, some of them rushed to the polls to record their votes for the Fianna Fáil candidates, having, of course, in the back of their minds that bright picture painted for them by the potential Taoiseach, the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>Some time previously he told a Dublin audience&mdash;and through the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i>, and through other organs the nation in general&mdash;that the Fianna Fáil Party, if returned to power, would create a little heaven here in this country.  Not only would there be no emigration and no unemployment, but we would have productive work to absorb at least 100,000 extra workers, much more than the number on the unemployment register at that time.  It is no wonder, even despite the previous broken promises of Fianna Fáil, that a number of these people were gulled, and those gullible type of people were to be found, not only in West Cork, but throughout the country.  They went along to the polls to vote for Fianna Fáil candidates, thinking that such a statement was in some way honest, and that the Fianna Fáil Party had in mind to do something to create productive employment.  How disappointed they must be to-day, two years subsequent to the Fianna Fáil Party being returned as the most stable Government ever returned in this country.  I want to protest against the dishonest tactics used by Fianna Fáil to secure the stability they enjoy to-day. Never in the history of native Government was a more dishonest document issued than that which was issued by the Tánaiste prior to the last election.  It gave false promises of security to the people of which we are now reaping the fruits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputies speak of unemployment and emigration here, these terms do not mean the same thing to all of us.  They have one meaning for people living in the more favoured parts of the country, Kildare, Dublin, Cork City, Wexford, Tipperary and such counties and another meaning in the districts represented by other Deputies, the congested districts, where there is <Col N="721" /> little industrial development and little or no hope for many people except to emigrate.  A new position at present obtains in many districts.  When young people were unemployed a number of years ago, they could always emigrate mainly to Britain or to America, where employment at reasonable rates could be obtained.  That no longer exists.  Employment in Britain is receding and Britain was the outlet for our surplus population.  People now returning on holidays say it becomes more difficult daily for Irish emigrants to get work in Britain.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, and I believe it is, is it not all the more reason that the Government should bend their energies to meet a possible situation in which emigration to Britain would be stopped?  What would we do then with our surplus population?  Previous speakers have discussed what the Government might do to help these congested districts, but we find the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which was of immense benefit to farmers and provided productive employment generally, was completely wiped out when we got the stable Government which Fianna Fáil now enjoy.  Supplementary road grants were reduced and milk prices were reduced.  The Milk Costings Commission Report has been thrown overboard.  It served Fianna Fáil well in their previous term of office from 1951 to 1954.  That was the only advantage the people got from it.  When the Government got the report, they threw it overboard; it was no longer required.</P>
    <P>It may be said we can do no better. It has been said that we are grappling with the position, doing the best we can and that the Government are more optimistic about the future than the Opposition.  In all sincerity, could the Government do no better?  Are they responsible for some of the depression which now prevails, for some of the shortage of money which we now find obtains in a number of Government Departments?</P>
    <P>When we had two by-elections in midland counties, in wheat-producing areas such as Carlow and Kilkenny, Fianna Fáil speakers assured the wheat growers that if they voted for <Col N="722" /> Fianna Fáil they would get an extra 10/- a barrel for wheat the following year.</P>

      <P>The £1 a barrel may have been mentioned by some of the more optimistic speakers like Deputy Corry, but 10/- was the sum that was certainly mentioned.  As prophesied by Fianna Fáil, the election did come about in the early part of 1957 and it was well known for some time beforehand that we were on the eve of a general election.  Many wheat growers increased the acreage in the knowledge that there would be a change of Government and in the belief that Fianna Fáil would give an extra 10/- a barrel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of this, the acreage was increased and the Exchequer now requires, through this Vote in the current financial year, £1,250,000 to offset that deficit.  I maintain that were it not for the false assurances given by Fianna Fáil to wheat growers at that general election the wheat would not be grown in sufficient quantity to warrant that Exchequer expenditure.  Compare the position then with the position now. This is March, the wheat-growing season is at hand and, in fact, is passing <Col N="723" /> by, and is there any advertisement in any paper about the price of wheat? Has the Department of Agriculture issued a statement to the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, or the other papers emphasising the price of wheat?  Certainly not.  It is a completely forgotten subject.  The Government got their fingers burned last year to the extent of £1,250,000 because of their publicity for wheat and their promises and incentives.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with this subject at some length because I feel that if the £1,250,000 were available in places like Cork, Galway or Donegal, or other places which are hard hit by unemployment, it would go a long way toward meeting their requirements. Let us see how that money was spent. Deputy Esmonde got the information from the Minister for Agriculture yesterday. Many farmers in areas like West Cork, which is not a wheat-producing area, would like to avail of that surplus wheat as a feeding stuff at a reasonable price, but they were denied that opportunity because if they did not take a six-ton lot, they got none.</P>

      <P>I want to make clear, in conformity with the ruling of the Chair, that my reason for mentioning these matters is to show that if the Government had dealt fairly with the people and had not made wanton promises to secure votes, more money would now be available and possibly there are no areas where that money could be better spent than the congested districts.  We find in the intra-censal years 1951 to 1956, the main reduction in population occurred in places like West Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Donegal and other western areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education consoled himself with the fact that there was some decrease in emigration at present. There is bound to be some decrease because most of our young people have now left the country.  They had no alternative.  It is peculiar that in a State such as ours, the Government could not devise a policy to cater for 3,000,000 people.  Other countries with <Col N="725" /> lesser resources are catering for populations twice as great, but unfortunately the Fianna Fáil Government, which has had a monopoly of Government here since 1932, apart from two short periods, of inter-Party Government could not, cannot, or will not do anything to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>The spending of money on the eradication of bovine T.B. is essential, but when one listens to the Minister for Agriculture saying that every effort must be made to eradicate this disease and that if we do not make these efforts, we shall be in danger of losing the British market for our cattle, we must remember that the Minister making these statements now is the very same person who, a few years back, declared that the British market was gone and thanked God for it.  This clearly shows the unwise policy adopted by Fianna Fáil.  To-day the main cry of Fianna Fáil is: &ldquo;For heaven's sake, save us the British market.  Get on with bovine T.B. eradiction.  Do not lose the British market.  If you do, we are gone forever.&rdquo; What a change in Fianna Fáil policy!</P>
    <P>To show that areas such as those I represent have not been fairly dealt with recently by the Government, I need quote only one small instance. I have lived for some years in the seaside village of Schull, about a mile from an island known as Long Island. Since I went to reside at Schull, I found there was no telephone installed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already mentioned that problems of unemployment and emigration have effects which are very different in areas such as I represent, like West Cork and the West of Ireland generally, from their effects in other districts.  We hope the Government will arrive at a stage when they can allocate more money for such districts to develop them and provide local employment.  It is peculiar that we should have public statements on conditions in West Cork and read statements in such papers as the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> concerning conditions in my constituency. Naturally, these conditions do exist and the circumstances of many of the people are anything but bright.  As I mentioned at the outset, there is no representative available and the representatives from that area feel, as I do, that areas such as ours are not getting their due share of public funds.  When I look at the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, much as I admire him, I cannot help thinking that he is the man who told me he could not lay out some few hundred pounds to provide a telephone in Long Island, to help 60 people, although the money was squandered here, there and everywhere else.</P>

      <P>It is typical of Fianna Fáil policy.  So far as Government expenditure generally is concerned, many people believe&mdash;and I share the opinion&mdash;that there are too many public servants.  It is the general belief of people who are thoroughly conversant with the present position, that two-thirds or 65 per cent. would be quite sufficient. No matter where one travels in the City of Dublin, one finds the city packed with civil servants of all grades and one finds them also in every nook and cranny throughout the country.  Seeing that we have such a small population, with so many unemployed and so many who cannot get the wherewithal to exist and who have to emigrate, more cognisance should be taken of the personnel of public departments and of local authority departments than is being taken by the Government.  I cannot see why there should be duplicity of services in small areas, where there is an officer from one Department representing one section and an officer from another Department representing another section, and so on.  When the people are asked to contribute taxation which is not to be usefully and gainfully employed&mdash; and it cannot be said to be usefully and gainfully employed in such circumstances&mdash;they are bound to feel reluctant and to grumble at Government policy.  I think it is my duty to refer to that matter here, as it is one which should have the immediate attention and examination of the Minister.  It has been brought up on many previous occasions.</P>
      <P>I am not advocating that any officer should lose his employment, but I am advocating that the position should be reviewed and that where vacancies of a non-productive character arise they should not be filled. There is no use in providing unproductive employment which is of no advantage to the country and of no advantage to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter which is occurring now with greater frequency than in previous years, the establishment of State and semi-State bodies and the delegating by Ministers <Col N="728" /> of their functions to such bodies.  In some cases, it may be said that these concerns are doing useful work, but so far as others are concerned, their advantages can be termed doubtful. What I protest about is that once these State bodies are set up, and once the Minister delegates functions to such bodies, it becomes impossible for me or any other representative of the people to obtain information about such bodies, or even to discuss their general position.  We are told by the Minister that it is a matter for the Board of the E.S.B., the Dairy Disposals Board, Bord na Móna or for whatever State body one seeks information about.  That is wrong and should not be countenanced.</P>
    <P>It recently happened in the case of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, that we established a new Department and, no sooner had we done so than that Minister came before the House and asked us to approve the handing over of the greater part of his powers and functions to a private board.  Surely, if the Government felt it necessary to delegate those functions to a board, there is no purpose in having a Minister for the Gaeltacht.  He is of no value and his presence is not required.  Seeing that there is so little power attached to such a position, surely that work could usefully be taken on by some other Minister, such as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Justice?</P>
    <P>Earlier to-day, in dealing with State-sponsored bodies, a Deputy referred to the granting of certain privileges to certain people.  Mention was made of licences granted to certain importers by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I regard that as a very grave and a very serious matter.  It is a well-known fact that certain importers have got concessions from the Government and these concessions are supposed to be obtained through personal or political influence.  By reason of those concessions, they are allowed to import goods which are generally restricted, or which are restricted to their competitors in business. That is a serious matter, particularly when the Minister tells the House he will not give any information <Col N="729" /> to the House as to the name of the person getting such a concession or the reasons for granting it.  I feel very strongly that if any business firm or merchant gets such a concession, Deputies here, as the representatives of the people, should get the information first and foremost as to the name and address of such a firm or individual, the reason why a special concession by way of these licences was given to such a person and the full details.</P>
    <P>We know that many private firms are being well sheltered by Fianna Fáil by protective tariffs under the guise of promoting employment here.  As a result of these tariffs, they are in a position to charge extra prices for their commodities, as competition is wiped out.  I am inclined to agree with the statement made earlier to-day by Deputy McQuillan, that the only return some of these firms give is that members of their boards act freely on boards of companies directed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We got recently a list of names of people who are doing reasonably well in Irish industry as a result of protective tariffs.  I do not grudge their doing well; business people, like any other section of the community, are entitled to make profits and are entitled to do well. What I do not like and did not like is that some of those people give their services freely to such boards to curry favour with the Government.  That does not sound well; it does not seem well and it should not happen.</P>

      <P>South-West Cork and other coastal districts are beyond the normal first-class reception area from the Athlone transmitter, which <Col N="739" /> is restricted by interference from an increasing number of broadcasting stations working in Europe.  There is no immediate solution for this problem but the next conference for the allocation of wavelengths in the European area which will probably be held within the next year or so may be able to help towards a solution.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are more or less of a general nature. I shall not deal any further with the reprehensible conduct on the part of some Government Ministers in giving preferential treatment to some of their friends.</P>
      <P>Summing up my remarks, what do we find in this Vote on Account two years after the Fianna Fáil Party came back to power and some four years subsequent to the painting of that lovely picture by the potential Taoiseach in Clery's Restaurant? That was the occasion when he announced to all and sundry, that the day for the 100,000 extra jobs was at hand, and that Fianna Fáil, when they shortly returned to power, would have £100,000,000 to implement that promise, the day when we would be able to make, as I have mentioned, a little heaven of this country, with no such thing as unemployment or emigration, provided, of course, that Fianna Fáil were returned as a stable Government.  It would not do if they were returned as a minority group, even in the smallest degree, because they do not associate with other groups.  They do not recognise them in this House and they have no regard for their co-operation and intentions; they must do the job themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil got that stable Government in no small way, due to dishonest announcements.  I do not wish to refer to that any further, but, as a result, they have a commanding majority in the House and whatever plans they make can be implemented. What benefit is there in that for the people I represent in West Cork? What benefit is it to the progress of the workers dependent on local authority employment for their living? Surely the only outcome of Fianna Fáil policy for the past two years, as the result of the change of Government, is a big reduction in the number of such people employed?  An air of despondency is apparent in <Col N="748" /> towns and villages in my constituency, greater than ever existed before. There is a feeling that there is no money available for business.  Shopkeepers are standing inside their counters and few are calling on them. Very little money is passing through the hands of the shopkeeper, and the small shopkeeper has been practically wiped out.  That is the picture in Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Castletownbere, Clonakilty and other towns to-day.  That is the picture which has been painted by such newspapers as the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> recently, two reliable journals.  It is a statement of fact. These people are naturally despondent.</P>
    <P>What is the position in the rural areas, comprised mainly of self-employed people, small farmers and others?  They thought they would get some benefit from the Milk Costings Commission, but instead they are being robbed to the extent of almost a penny a gallon in the price of milk. What have we got in the line of money to develop industries in the congested areas?  There is no sign of any help from the Government.  No industrial employment, good, bad, or indifferent, has been given in my constituency and I think the same picture could be painted of a great portion of the West of Ireland.  Surely then the people have nothing to be grateful to Fianna Fáil for.  They have nothing to be grateful for in the stability of Government which they got, and the only hope left to them is that these forthcoming elections will be unfavourable to the Fianna Fáil Party, and I mean both elections.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been in office long enough and, as a result, there is hope throughout the country that the people will get new confidence, and that we are in the immediate vicinity of a change of Government, a change to the type of Government we had from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, a Government representative of all sections of the people, of different groups, pooling their energies together to formulate a policy which will be of benefit to all sections of the people.  It is only from such a Government that we, in West Cork, got a ray of hope before. <Col N="749" /> It was only by the efforts of Deputy Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the co-operation of his colleagues in the inter-Party Government, that we succeeded in getting one industry in West Cork.  The inter-Party Government were responsible for developing the Allihies copper mine and, judging from accounts published recently, that mine may be in full production in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I do not blame any of the Deputies now sitting on the benches opposite. They have no more to do with it than any person you would see outside in Molesworth Street.  The present Government is dictatorship by the Taoiseach, and what he formulates and thinks in his mind, his Party must accede to.  That was demonstrated clearly when he said they must abolish P.R. None of them thought about that before, and the same applies to the formulation of all Government policy. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are not conversant with the position obtaining in rural Ireland, with the difficulties confronting workers, small shopkeepers, farmers and others. They are out of touch with the conditions obtaining, and they are not anxious or willing to accept good advice from some of their back benchers, who are in closer touch with conditions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That is the position in which we find ourselves to-day, and I conclude by vehemently protesting against the policy of the Government.  They are completely ignoring the dire position obtaining in most of the congested districts, and they are neglecting to provide more money for development in these areas.  They are not providing enough money to help our people and make life brighter for a greater number of them.  However, at the moment the position is at a standstill.  We cannot make any further comments until after the outcome of the two elections which face us, and possibly as a result of these elections, with a defeat in both of them for the Government, we shall have some different comments to make in this House within the next 12 months, because the Government may be composed of different people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on <Col N="750" /> Account affords the House an opportunity of surveying the general economic picture of the country, and of examining the situation in general. This Book of Estimates shows that expenditure for the current year, on both capital services and other services, totals £115.5 millions.  Last year, it was £109.9 millions and in 1957-58, during the term of office of the previous Government, £112.5 millions.  When the previous Government were spending that amount of money on capital and current services, they were criticised on the ground that they were squandering the nation's resources, and depleting the availability of capital for various capital schemes.</P>
      <P>When this Government were elected, they withdrew the subsidies on bread, flour and butter and, as a result of those reductions, saved £6.9 millions on bread and flour, and £2.5 millions on butter, making a total of £9.4 millions. Allowing for compensatory benefits, which amounted to about £2,000,000, there was a net saving of £7,000,000.  Now we find, less than two years after that money was saved, that the Estimates presented to this House are higher than they were during the term of office of the previous Government, when a total of £9.4 millions was provided for subsidising bread, flour and butter.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to ask what is the justification for this increased expenditure? What improvements have been effected and what has happened to the money saved from the subsidies. It appears to have been spent.  We find that as a result of the decision to withdraw these subsidies, the cost of essentials increased and the Government recognised that at the time, and granted an increase of 1/- a week to old age pensioners, widows and orphans and blind pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government at that time also expressed the view that other sections of the community should not ask compensation for the increased cost of living.  It was stated that if it was in the national interest to save this money, the other sections, except the very weakest, should accept it as a contribution towards the financial requirements of the State.  However, <Col N="751" /> in a few months, various claims were submitted by different categories of workers, employees of public undertakings such as C.I.E., the E.S.B. and so forth, as well as those employed by private firms.  A little later increases were granted to civil servants, the Guards, the Army and other State personnel, and the general pattern which was subsequently negotiated by representatives of trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers provided for a wage increase of 10/- a week to meet the increased cost of living, the increased cost of food, which was a result of the decision to withdraw the subsidies.</P>
    <P>Now the effect of all that is being felt by the national Exchequer.  Quite recently, the Minister had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for portion of the year in respect of remuneration for public employees, and quite rightly their interests were safeguarded by granting them an increase in wages and salaries.  Similarly, employees in public undertakings got compensation, but C.I.E. were unable to meet that commitment from their own revenue and they had to pass it on to the public who were obliged to pay increased bus fares in order to meet that increased demand.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of different local authorities, especially health authorities who, faced with the increased cost of food and the increased cost of maintenance, had to charge more.  The result is that there is not only a direct increase in the health charges from 6/- a day to 10/-, but, in addition, as a result of the increased health charges and the increased outgoings by the public health authorities, this in turn meant that rates must be increased as a result of those transferred burdens.</P>
    <P>While that is true of those categories which were catered for directly by the State, or who were in a position to negotiate and secure increased emoluments to meet the rise in the cost of living, a very large section of the community received no other benefit at all. Retired persons, persons living on pensions other than the old age pension, <Col N="752" /> the widows' and orphans' pensions and those I have mentioned, received no increase, although they had to pay more for bread, flour, butter and other commodities.  In addition, people living on fixed incomes got no increase. People who were in receipt of income from investments or from any other source which remained static, received no increase in their emoluments.  The effect of all this has been that, as a result of the Government's policy, the consumer price index for food increased between 1957 and 1958 from 109.2 to 118.6 and the consumer price index generally increased from 140 for 1957 to 146 for 1958.</P>
    <P>While that occurred in respect of direct Government action, the import price index went down from 111.9 in 1957 to 107.0 in 1958.  Some of those figures from the Economic Series are provisional and may have to be corrected later.  While that occurred, the Government paid less to our own farmers for wheat, but charged more to our own consumers for bread and flour.  For milk supplied to creameries, they paid less, while at the same time, the price charged for butter increased from 3/9 to 4/2 and subsequently to 4/4 per lb.  On two occasions, the Government either saved entirely in the case of the last withdrawal of the subsidies, or as on a previous occasion, when the subsidies were reduced.  On both occasions, the effect on the Exchequer has been completely nullified because of increased demands and increased expenditure directly by the State and indirectly by the other bodies I have mentioned. This has resulted in increased burdens, because of increased transport charges, increased health charges for hospital accommodation, increased maintenance charges in respect of those institutions and increased outlay directly on food as well as on the other items included in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having failed to implement the policy they set out to implement and having apparently realised that that policy, for which they secured a mandate at the last election, was incapable of providing a remedy, they directed the Secretary of the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the officials of other <Col N="753" /> Departments, to prepare and publish, in a White Paper entitled &ldquo;A Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo; and in the other publication &ldquo;Economic Development&rdquo;, a list of the various plans and schemes&mdash;which, in the main, were initiated by the previous Government and which they recognised had achieved satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>When considering this, it is well to see what was accomplished by it. The export figures for different years were given recently here, in reply to a parliamentary question.  For 1931, they totalled £36.3 millions.  For 1947, after 15 or 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration, they had gone up by just over £3,000,000 to £39.5 millions.  But in 1957, after two periods of the inter-Party Government, which initiated a programme of capital development, which initiated the Trade Agreement of 1948, exports were valued, for 1957, at £131,000,000.</P>
    <P>This White Paper, and the grey book, recognises the value to the economy of increased cattle numbers. It is interesting to see that, in 1931, we had 4.4 million head of cattle.  In 1947, it was down to 3.9 million and in 1957, after the policy which was initiated had borne fruit, the number had increased again to 4.5 million. In the case of sheep, again there was a drop and subsequently a rise.  The case of pigs was even more dramatic. In 1931, there were 1.2 million; in 1947, there were 456,900; and in 1957, the figure was back to 1,000,000. I quote these figures because they demonstrate what could be accomplished by an economic programme which was implemented in practice and which achieved important economic returns in respect of increased numbers of live stock, increased exports and increased trade.</P>
    <P>When that policy was being operated, it was criticised by the members of the Government, who were then in opposition.  While a change of place has probably meant a change in outlook, one doubts if the Government will be capable of implementing a policy which they previously criticised. As other Deputies have said, it is not sufficient merely to have a <Col N="754" /> policy set out in a White Paper or a grey paper or a blue paper.  One of the temptations to which a number of representatives of outside bodies have probably succumbed, having read this programme and having read the book on &ldquo;Economic Development&rdquo;, is to make speeches, as speeches have been made by presidents of federations, chairmen or presidents of chambers of commerce, all lauding that programme as though it were something new.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable that none of those people, or few of them, could be expected to be familiar with the various details of Government policy or of national policy.  When they see it presented in simple tabulated form, they welcome it as something they can read, examine and discuss.  The fact is that, with few variations, this is the programme implemented by the inter-Party Government and this is the programme that achieved substantial results.  But, however effective it was, remember it was criticised by Fianna Fáil when they were in opposition, and it was criticised by others as not having achieved the success necessary to produce a sufficient increase in employment or to reduce emigration.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health had the temerity to allege here that emigration had been reduced and conditions had improved.  Whatever figures are available, I do not think it is fair for anyone to claim as a result of those figures that there has been any worthwhile change in the pattern.  The recent Third Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee comments on the fact that the average annual number of emigrants in the last eight years, or so, has been about 40,000.  The report goes on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;These figures indicate the problems which beset this country.&rdquo;  That period includes terms in office by both Governments, the Fianna Fáil and the inter-Party.  Some few months ago, a figure was given by the British Minister of Labour in the House of Commons as to the numbers seeking employment. Between 1st January, 1958, and 31st October, 1958, 48,000 odd new employment permits were issued in Britain to Irish people seeking work <Col N="755" /> there.  The most recent indices indicate therefore that last year something around 50,000 emigrants sought employment.</P>
    <P>We come then to the figure for those unemployed.  There has been some slight reduction as compared with a couple of years ago, but, if one takes into account the increased employment as a result of the oil refinery in Cork, the Avoca mines project, the briquet-ting factories and other projects initiated by the previous Government, there is really very little change&mdash;very little change more especially when we consider the figures published in the <i>Quarterly Industrial Review</i> for December, 1958.  The figures show that for the four quarters in 1958 the average for the total numbers engaged in manufacturing industries was 142,435 as compared with 145,159 for the four quarters of 1956.  These figures prove that there has been little or no change. In fact, in respect of manufacturing industries, a few thousand fewer are employed as compared with two years ago.  Emigration has undoubtedly brought about a reduction in the numbers on the unemployment register. The small increase in the numbers employed has reduced it still further, but, in effect, what the Capital Investment Advisory Committee found to be the position is still true.  Large numbers are emigrating.  The average number of persons unemployed between 1949 and 1957 was over 60,000.</P>
    <P>As I say, the problem is there irrespective of what Government is in office, and both Governments have had the responsibility of endeavouring to provide a remedy for it.  When we examine the matter at home, we have to take into account that under existing conditions in Britain employment opportunities are fewer now than they were a couple of years ago.  The unemployment problem there has been giving more trouble in the past 12 to 18 months than it did previously and it is, therefore, more difficult probably for people from this country to secure employment there than it was previously.</P>
    <P>One of the most dangerous illusions that can be created, and it is one that <Col N="756" /> was created by the Government when in opposition and by others outside the House, is that Government action alone or Government policy can create employment.  Neither Government action nor Government policy, no matter how energetically pursued, can, of itself, create employment.  In the main, this is a private enterprise economy and, with the exception of certain State undertakings which cover certain sectors of our economy, certain categories of work or certain schemes which it is impossible for private enterprise to undertake or in relation to which private enterprise is unwilling to accept responsibility, any expansion in employment, any increase in the numbers of jobs provided depends ultimately on the creation of successful conditions for an expansion in the private sector of our economy.  There are, of course, certain exceptions.  There is the E.S.B., the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus and so forth. Leaving all these aside, any increase in employment depends on the successful expansion of private enterprise. With the exception of certain State schemes and local authority schemes in relation to housing and drainage, or other public undertakings, increased employment depends on an expansion in private enterprise, industrially as well as agriculturally.</P>
    <P>One of the essential prerequisites of improved economic conditions is stability.  Stability can be created by the assurance of guaranteed prices and by the assurance that economic conditions will remain unchanged, thereby ensuring a market for the goods or commodities produced or manufactured. A significant fact in that regard is to be found in agriculture. Leaving aside the question as to whether or not the price is sufficient, the fact is that because of guaranteed prices for milk and wheat, production increased.</P>
    <P>So far as general stability in prices is concerned, the Government can do only a certain amount and can only create certain conditions by the application of a sound policy.  One of the things which has caused a good deal <Col N="757" /> of dislocation has been the rapid change on various occasions in the banks' approach to the question of credit.  For two years practically, we have had a restrictive and conservative policy.  Four or five years ago, the same policy developed.  After a time, credit was made more freely available, but, as I say, within the past 12 or 18 months or two years, restrictions were operating again.  Now we have the announcement that credit is freely available again.  While it is desired that adequate credit should be available, these dramatic changes, and these repeated alterations between a restrictive policy and a policy of easy credit, create difficult situations.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which they created before was increased imports. It is quite obvious that while it is not always possible to ensure that money will be spent in the way in which it is most productive, or most desirable, on projects which will be approved, nevertheless, the imports for the month of January showed a substantial increase in the trade figures. While it is admitted that a good deal of this credit is being granted for specific purposes such as the increased use of fertilisers or the purchase of foundation stock for increasing our live stock, in respect of cattle, nevertheless one of the results of that policy will be an increase in the import of non-essential or less essential commodities.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important that the banks, in consultation with the Central Bank and the Government, either through the Department of Finance or whatever other Departments are appropriate, should endeavour to secure a greater measure of stability, a greater degree of uniformity in the granting of credit, rather than, on the one hand imposing severe restrictions beyond what is requisite, and on the other hand, the easy granting of credit, in many cases resulting in the importation of goods and the expenditure of money on commodities that are either non-essential or less essential.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk by this Government in the past on the need for spending money on productive work.  This White Paper and the talk of economic development indicate <Col N="758" /> their recognition that the programme which was being carried out by the inter-Party Government was sound.  If it is proposed to concentrate on worthwhile projects in the future it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>One of the items of heavy Government expenditure which is less productive&mdash;which in fact is non-productive &mdash;is large expenditure on roads.  While it is necessary that we should have reasonably good road facilities, expenditure on roads is unproductive and, for the size of the country, too much money is being spent.  With the rapid development of machinery and heavy equipment in the last ten or 12 years, the employment content in road-making is far less than it was, so, from any angle, there is no compensatory economic advantage in heavy road expenditure. It does not provide employment commensurate with the investment because of the increased use of machinery.  While it is essential to have reasonably good roads it does not directly, but only remotely, give aid to production.</P>
    <P>I should prefer to see increased expenditure on land reclamation or on drainage.  In that connection one of the worthwhile schemes which was stopped by the Government was the work proceeding under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not deny&mdash;I do not think anyone on either side of the House would deny&mdash;that some of the money on some of those schemes may have been spent unwisely.  In any scheme which involves public expenditure, some money is bound, in the nature of things&mdash;I do not mean that money was squandered by anyone&mdash;to be wasted because public expenditure is often more wasteful than expenditure by private enterprise or by individuals; but compared with expenditure on roads, money spent on drainage either on arterial drainage or schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, acts as an incentive to production and is an essential requirement for increased production from the land.</P>
    <P>One criticism that is sometimes made is that expenditure on the Dáil, on missions abroad, and so on, should be curtailed.  I have no doubt it would be possible to work with a <Col N="759" /> somewhat smaller Dáil, just as it would be possible to arrange in some cases for less expensive missions abroad, but it is wrong for anyone to create the impression that if we save a few thousand pounds on either somewhat fewer Deputies, or somewhat fewer missions abroad, that would solve our problems.  In fact, I often think that those who make these suggestions are really covering up for their lack of a positive constructive programme, or a positive constructive suggestion, to deal with the economic difficulties of the country.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, taking it by and large, there could be some reduction in our expenditure under those headings, but compared with the total national expenditure it is infinitesimal and would mean that, under no heading, would sufficient money be made available for any worthwhile scheme, and merely to offer these suggestions as they are offered sometimes by people who either have nothing better to suggest or who have not thought sufficiently about them, is wrong.  Deputies on both sides of the House recognise that some saving might be made, but these suggestions will not solve, and do not provide a remedy for, our various problems. No one could imagine that any such reduction or changes could help in the solving of our problems.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government, having failed, as I believe, in respect of reducing expenditure, and despite the food subsidies, and the temporary saving effected by their abolition, merely had the effect of bringing about a further increase in the cost of living and once again generated demands for increased wages and salaries.  The Government have now abandoned their own policy and, as a result of the exertions of the Secretary of the Department of Finance and other officials in collaboration with him, they have catalogued the various schemes which were either in operation, or initiated by the previous Government, and they are now published and adopted as this Government's policy.  It is said that imitation is the most sincere form of <Col N="760" /> flattery and, while we may be impressed by the Government's conversion to our policy, we doubt their capacity and ability to work a policy which they previously condemned.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong to imagine that any Government can, by itself, solve these problems, but what is wrong is that this Government, when they were in opposition, created the illusion that if there was a change of Government, the various problems and difficulties would be surmounted.  They claimed that all that was necessary was a change of Government and that action would follow.</P>
    <P>In the Budget of 1957, the Government provided a sum of £250,000 for market research and, after some time had elapsed, a committee was set up to inquire into it.  I understand that that committee has furnished two reports, but so far these reports have not been published.  It is difficult to understand the delay in publishing them, as the Government expressed so much concern about market research and the need for guidance for producers. It is important that the reports should be published quickly, and it would be quite wrong to create the same lack of confidence in this Marketing Committee as the Government were responsible for creating in respect of the Milk Costings Commission. I hope that these reports and this committee will not suffer the same fate as the Milk Costings Commission.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there is no confidence in the Government.  The people have no belief in their capacity to deal with, and solve, the problems which confront the country, and one of the reasons for the lack of confidence is that, in the past, we had too much politics and too little statesmanship, plenty of impressive talk, and little action to remedy the economic problems. If recent events indicate anything, they indicate that political considerations are still dominant and that, instead of concerted Government policy being implemented by people capable of understanding requirements, capable of implementing a policy they believe in, this Government, as an <Col N="761" /> excuse for their own failure have merely set out the various schemes that were initiated by the previous Government and hope, because that policy found general satisfaction throughout the country, it will solve the difficulties.</P>
    <P>It may be, if that policy is implemented energetically, if it is implemented in the spirit in which it was initially undertaken, that all sections of the community and all sections in this House combining can secure the desired results from its being carried out in a constructive fashion, and consistently applied over a period of years.  One of the deterrents to improved economic conditions is the sharp fluctuation, whether in economic conditions, in terms of trade, supply, or in market conditions.  This programme recognises that the policy which was being operated was a realistic one, that it was based on the knowledge that improved trade could come only from increased production, that, in modern conditions, we had to produce and sell abroad, and all the nonsense talked in the past about economic self-sufficiency has been proved, by both events and time, to be clearly an illusion and that, in fact, the only policy is one that will develop bilateral and multilateral trading on an increased scale.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to mention the matter referred to yesterday in a parliamentary question&mdash;the fact that the Government have decided not to acquire an atomic reactor.  I believe it is a mistake in present circumstances, when we have rapid developments taking place in scientific matters, when so many of our trained personnel, scientists, engineers and others, are looking for employment both here and abroad, that they should not have adequate opportunities of studying and working in the sphere of atomic energy.  It is undoubtedly true that very substantial changes and developments are taking place in that regard, but the fact that these changes are taking place is no reason why we should isolate ourselves from the opportunities presented by the offer of this reactor.</P>
    <P>These changes will continue to take <Col N="762" /> place and the fact that they will take place is all the more reason why we should afford our engineers and scientists an opportunity of gaining the experience, knowledge and technical know-how which is essential in modern conditions for progress.  For that reason, I hope the Government will reconsider that decision, and, while cost may be an influence operating as a deterrent, its acquisition at the present time, as compared with expenditure in other directions, could be a worthwhile investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate, since the Minister introduced the Vote on Account yesterday, I must say I have been depressed by the number of speakers on the opposite side who still seem to believe that the return to power of Fianna Fáil in 1957 was due to promises made in the election of that year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present.</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I was amazed at the number of people on the opposite side who contributed to this debate as if they still believed that the principal reason for the return of Fianna Fáil to power as a Government, in 1957, was promises made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party during the general election in that year.  If they would take my view, junior as I am in this House, they would realise that that argument is completely played out.  I think that neither side of the House can make a point as regards the breaking of promises, whether well-meaning or ill-meaning. I remember, during a previous election in my constituency, the people were asked to vote Fine Gael for better times, and I think that slogan boomeranged on them during the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that many promises have been made by Fianna Fáil speakers which, in the course of time, were not possible of fulfilment, but I think we should at least make it clear to the intelligence of the people of the country&mdash;and they realise this&mdash; that they were not completely swayed <Col N="763" /> by promises from any platform or any Party, and that is not the fundamental reason why changes of Government took place at one time or another.  If you are seeking a reason why people voted Fianna Fáil in 1957, you must look for something besides promises. I think there is little doubt that the reason was that they had completely lost whatever confidence they had in the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy said earlier this afternoon that it was a pity the inter-Party policy and programme were interrupted in 1957.  It is a fair question to ask: &ldquo;Who interrupted it?&rdquo; It was the Taoiseach of the time who went to the people and it was the people who decided they had enough of that form of Government.  The charge should not be laid at the door of Fianna Fáil, that it was they and they only who changed the policy of the inter-Party Government at that time.  It was the people who changed it.</P>
    <P>I remember also that in the winter of 1956, in my own constituency, there was a spirit of despondency and despair which I do not think was ever there before that time.  That despondency was general throughout the country and, as a Corkman, I think it must have been general when it came as far as Cork, because it is not in the nature of our people there to be despondent before others.  I remember people selling houses, whole families going away together, as if there were no future in this country for them.  I also know that there is a complete change of tune there now. Everyone in the House knows the reason for that.  I do not claim that the Fianna Fáil Party or this Government are responsible for everything, but there is an air of confidence abroad amongst the business community which was not there two years ago.</P>
    <P>I did not think that the condition of affairs when Fianna Fáil came into office could be changed in two years. When they came in, the cupboard was bare; there is no doubt about that. Whatever Deputies opposite may say about millions having been left to <Col N="764" /> Fianna Fáil, that was not the case at all.  The cupboard was bare, and very bare.  Two years is a short period in which to rectify everything, but I say there has been a change of mentality, a change for the better, in those two years.  The biggest problems we have to face, those of emigration and unemployment, are peculiar to no Government and they have been there, whatever Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying that we should, all of us, recast our whole viewpoint on the problem of emigration.  It always seems strange to me, as a city man, that a farm labourer in an agricultural country should be expected to work for a mere pittance.  His hours are much longer than those of his colleague in the city, his knowledge of his work has to be at least as detailed and he is a most important unit in the economy of the country.  He has to be a good farmer and a good &ldquo;vet&rdquo;; he has to get up in the middle of the night, if a cow is calving.  He is called out at all times, with few holidays, if any&mdash;and with all that he gets a miserable pittance as remuneration. What would happen if that man were fortunate enough to be able to send his daughter to a city to get a business education?  After two or three years, she could get into an insurance office, and earn five or six times, certainly three or four times, as much as her father earned.  In an agricultural country, that is an extraordinary phenomenon&mdash;that a girl in an insurance office could earn three times as much as a man engaged in our primary industry.</P>
    <P>That position has been rectified to some extent and the scales are more evenly weighted now, but until such time as the farm labourer is as well off, or thinks he is, as his colleague in the city, there will be people fleeing from West Cork and the western seaboard, to wherever they think life will be easier.  If one wants to know the reason for that, one will find that one of the reasons is education.  When a man is uneducated and unfitted for anything else, he will stay where he is; but if he is given facilities to educate himself and his children, he <Col N="765" /> will not be satisfied to live in conditions which he would not have to suffer anywhere else in the country, or for that matter anywhere else in the world.  We have to face the fact that we are no longer an isolated island on the coast of Europe, cut off, so to speak.  When I was a small boy, it took a worker as long to go down to Haulbowline to work for the British in the naval dockyard there as it takes now for a worker to go to Dagenham or places of that sort.  The immediate attraction is the high wages.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I do not think the time will ever come when we will be able to contain all our population.  That is a viewpoint I am sorry I have to express, as naturally no one likes to see any people going away just because they cannot get decent living conditions at home. However, I think there is a section of our young people who will always go, not because of necessity, but because they feel they can better themselves, materially and otherwise, away from this country.  Therefore, if we want to address ourselves to that problem of keeping people at home, those in responsible positions should put before the people, at every possible opportunity, the advantages of working here at home.  The manifold advantages may not be obvious materially, nevertheless, the advantages of living here are that we have a very decent standard of living and there is a future, if we can get the people to realise how they can work for a decent economic future.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of standing up, for one reason or another, and decrying everything every Party and every Government do, it behoves us to speak with words of encouragement to the people and to assure them that, while they might be lured away by the bright lights of other countries and might be a little better off, it is nothing but tinsel in the end compared with the fundamental values they have at home.  In that way, we would do something to keep our people at home.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government came in under difficult conditions.  They have been two years in office.  I can speak <Col N="766" /> for my own constituency and say that, in that time, a completely different outlook has been created from that which was there.  Any businessman could regard the stock market of any country as a barometer of a kind for certain sections.  That barometer has risen many points in the past two years.  That is an indication of confidence. The White Paper has been received by employers' associations, commercial associations and workers' associations and it has been welcomed. I think there is a future for the country.  If the people at the other side ever expect to become a Government, they will have to realise that it is the policy that matters.  The people will never be satisfied just by an attack on Fianna Fáil; and those opposite should not consider that as sufficient to return them to this side of the House.  They will have to do something more constructive. They will have to put before the people a policy which is in some way better than the policy Fianna Fáil have put before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the speeches from the other side of the House were as reasonable, generally speaking, as the speech we have just heard from Deputy Healy, I think Deputy Healy would achieve the goal he would like to see achieved here.  In other words, there would be a reasonable appraisal of the problems which arise out of the document we are discussing here to-day, Deputies would come in to discuss the problems objectively, to give honour where honour is due and credit where credit is due.  Deputy Healy made an effort to do that&mdash; perhaps half-heartedly; nevertheless it was a good sign when he said that the conditions at the moment operating in his constituency&mdash;which is my constituency also&mdash;are not due entirely to the action of one Government or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is quite true.  Some of the prosperity which is in Cork at the moment is due to certain happenings during the time of the inter-Party Government. My attitude is largely the same as Deputy Healy's.  It would be an excellent thing if we found that the majority of Deputies, on both <Col N="767" /> sides of the House, were ready to look upon things in the way in which the Minister for Education did, in a reasonably objective speech, in which he referred to the Report of O.E.E.C. on Ireland for 1958.  There was reference in it to positive advances made here during 1958.  If we were to look on things like that as part of a pattern which started back in 1922, when we won our freedom, if we were to look on 1958 simply as the culmination of the united efforts of all Parties and successive Governments, I think we would get much further in sending the message to which Deputy Healy referred, a message of confidence to the country.  We would not be perennially depressing and inflating the people of the country, depending on which side of the House we sit, by having inevitable references to emigration and unemployment and all the distressing aspects which are inseparable from the life of every nation.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I was horrified at the manner in which this debate was initiated by the Minister for Health. He set a standard which was as low as it could be and it has been continued persistently throughout this debate by members of the Government Party.  I deplore it and I am sorry it should be so.  Any weakness in human nature is appealed to by that sort of thing and possibly it begets speeches of a similar type from other parts of the House.  It is wrong&mdash;and it certainly does not encourage the spirit of confidence which the country badly needs&mdash;for a Minister to indicate that, since 1957, everything has gone right and that it has gone right, not as part of a pattern, but simply and solely because the collection of Parties forming the previous Government was driven out of office and another Party came into office.</P>
    <P>That is the spirit that nullifies any effort to make a constructive debate out of a discussion such as this.  It would be an excellent thing if we could stand up here and reflect that we have more wealth at our disposal now, and that each year as the years go by we have more houses, better land, land in better heart, and more reclaimed land; that we have improved <Col N="768" /> roads, more ships and more exploration of mineral resources; that we have an oil refinery and various things constituting an annual accretion of wealth here.  People like the Minister for Health should refrain from making political capital of any little bit of prosperity that happens to visit this nation when his Party are in power.  It would make for a higher standard of debate and a greater feeling of confidence among the people generally.  We have been told that emigration has stopped or is showing signs of stopping since Fianna Fáil came into power.  I am glad, as Deputies opposite are glad, that there has been some improvement in that respect and I trust it will continue. I should be glad if it continued and I would even be ready to listen to Deputies opposite claiming that it was because they were in power that emigration was stopping.  But I should like Ministers to make up their minds as to whether emigration is stopping or decreasing or not.  The Ministers show a deplorable lack of unanimity on this point.  I heard Ministers say to-day and yesterday that emigration was decreasing, but&mdash; and Deputy Healy has seen this document also&mdash;I have a letter which was sent to Cork Corporation on 31st January, 1959, by the Minister for Local Government, rebuking the corporation for taking an optimistic outlook that emigration would decrease in the next five years.</P>
    <P>In planning for their housing needs, Cork Corporation did take the view that there would be fewer vacancies in existing houses, due to emigration, but the Minister wrote down and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How dare you take that view; I do not take that view.&rdquo;  I should like to quote a little bit of the letter in which he refers to that.  It was a reply to a suggestion from the housing staff officer of Cork Corporation that we will want more houses because there will be fewer vacancies due to emigration. The Minister in his reply says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the growth of families and other contingencies these may reasonably be expected to be compensated for in full by deaths, family dispersals, emigration from <Col N="769" /> the city and rehousing by private enterprise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be noted in this context that the population of Cork City fell by approximately 3½ per cent. in the intra-censal period 1951-56 and no grounds are advanced by the staff officer in support of his statement that it is doubtful if these vacancies will occur at the same rate as in recent years due to emigration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A simple paraphrase of that is that the Minister for Local Government is convinced that there will be no decrease in emigration.  I think Ministers should resolve that among themselves before they come into the House and take up a certain attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education dealt with tourism, as did other speakers. We are asked at the moment to give £200,000 on that Vote.  Tourism is an excellent thing, and we should encourage it as much as possible, but I doubt if we are spending our money in the wisest way.  Yesterday or to-day, I heard some speaker refer to the fact that somebody under the aegis of some tourist board spent the taxpayers' money last Autumn in feting Miss Maxwell, an American columnist, and that they got very bad value for it. There is a modern approach generally by tourist bodies to this problem of attracting tourists, but I think they are inclined to go a little too far.  Another grouse I have is that no effort appears to be made to follow up the old maxim addressed to the people of this country: &ldquo;See Ireland first.&rdquo;  In any Irish Sunday newspaper you take up, you find Aer Línte or Aer Lingus doing their best to entice every citizen to go outside the country for holidays and spend money abroad.  At least a similar effort should be made to get people to spend holidays at home at the various beautiful resorts we have. It is understandable that people like to leave the country now and again during their lifetime, but they should first be encouraged to see their own country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education also told us about money made available to Cork Harbour Commissioners by <Col N="770" /> the Government.  This also underlines what I spoke about already, that matters like the welfare of Cork harbour are not isolated instances, stemming from the fact that this or that Government are in power.  The Minister said this Government had made available to Cork harbour certain financial facilities which will assist the harbour commissioners in the future.  I want to mention&mdash;not in any competitive spirit but rather to underline the gradual process by which Cork harbour and the country generally can achieve prosperity&mdash;that at the time of the inter-Party Government, a large sum was made available for Cork harbour.  As a result, amenities there have been improved.  It is good to see that the inter-Party Government at one stage made money available and that the Fianna Fáil Government are now doing so, but I should hate to feel that anybody would get up on the other side of the House and try to claim that any increased prosperity in Cork harbour, as a result of increased amenities, stems only from the Vote which has been made in respect of Cork harbour on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is good that we are asked for some increases in regard to education. The present Minister, like his predecessor, seems to have taken an active approach to many of the problems.  I invariably approach the Vote for the Department of Education with some misgivings.  Undoubtedly successive Ministers and their advisers, sincerely enthusiastic in their policy, have spent too much on the Irish language.  I do not suggest for one moment that money expended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not intend to deal with details; I simply want to mention the matter on a broad basis.  Having said what I did say, I should like to be allowed to qualify it.  My belief is that had the money spent in the past been spent more wisely, we would <Col N="771" /> not to-day be in the position in which the average young Irish man and woman has merely learned the language for a specific purpose; not only would they have learned it but they would love it.  It is only natural that Irishmen and women should be attracted to their own language.  The money spent on trying to popularise Irish is largely wasted because the element of compulsion in examinations like the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates nullifies any good that is done.  Before a student will get a certificate, he or she must pass in Irish.  That has caused a reaction against the language.</P>

That would have called forth a spirit here which would have had important repercussions on the country as a whole. Naturally, the country will be unhappy, knowing the Minister is imposing this large levy this year.  It must not be forgotten that, in addition to this levy, there is all the other taxation passed on by the Minister to local bodies in connection with Health Acts and so forth.  Not alone will the taxpayers have to pay more, but the ratepayers will have to pay more also.  That does not make for the confidence about which the Minister spoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>After this placid passage between Corkmen, one must be careful, in view of the perhaps belated encouragement from both sides of the House, to be constructive rather than destructive.  Destructive criticism, destruction of any kind, has never been the particular prerogative of my Party. One cannot help observing that when members of the Fianna Fáil Party are in Government, they clamour for constructive criticism; they clamour for a reasoned approach; they clamour for recasting of views on unemployment and emigration.  But, when they are in opposition on this side of the House, the ills of emigration, the ills of unemployment and whatever other national ills appear to be existent, are all solemnly attributed to the ineptitude of the Government they oppose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> Now, they cannot have it both ways. There must be some degree of consistency. If people look for reasonableness when they are on one side of the House, it must then be regarded as reasonable to look for the same attitude when they are in opposition. With regard to constructive criticism, Deputy Sherwin put his finger on the matter last night when he said: &ldquo;I may know what to do in a given set of circumstances, but you are being paid to do what you said you would do and what you said you knew how to do. Accordingly, why should I have to give you a blueprint for something in which you have failed and in respect of which you solemnly promised results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One cannot help approaching this Vote on Account year after year with a certain feeling of futility and dismay. It seems to be part and parcel of the preparation of this Vote on Account that it must show an increase year by year.  I do not object to increases <i>qua</i> increases, if those increases will confer benefits upon the community as a whole and if they will result in national advancement or a resurgence in the economic well-being of the people.  I do not believe for one moment that there is anything new in this Vote on Account&mdash;I stress &ldquo;new&rdquo;&mdash;which will have any of these effects.</P>
    <P>One welcomes the continuation and intensification of the bovine T.B. eradication scheme.  I believe that is the most important national work at the moment and the more intensively it is pursued, the better it will be for us in the shortest possible time.  Live stock, and live-stock products, have always been the mainstay of this country. Curiously enough, in spite of efforts to destroy it, the live-stock industry has survived to become the subject of praise on the part of its erstwhile oppressors.  In 1931, there was a report issued by the League of Nations; it was a review of the world situation following the depression of 1929&mdash;a depression that was described in an Encyclical at the time as one of the worst disasters that had hit the world since the Flood, and it described the survival of Europe generally and, in particular, of Denmark and Ireland in relation to the depression.  It attributed <Col N="774" /> that survival to the fact that live stock and live-stock products were the mainstay of the economy of each country.</P>
    <P>Year after year, pictures of progress are painted.  When we come to look at progress, as we know it, and adverting particularly to what is our mainstay, live stock and live stock produce, and their export, we must have regard to the very compelling figures and the equally compelling arguments we have for the figures and the deductions to be drawn from them.</P>
    <P>By 1931 and, mind you, that was the year in which this report to which I have referred was written about Ireland, we had survived ten very difficult years, years of formation, years of building, years of sacrifice, years of compromise in the interests of peace. In that year, our exports totalled £36.3 million.  Of course, dealing with figures and particularly figures of money, one must relate them to their value at the particular time.  The Government Party came into power in 1932 and it is sufficient to say that I think&mdash;it must be certain&mdash;that they persuaded the people at that time that theirs was the policy, theirs was the plan, from which prosperity would come, and it would come only from that source.</P>
    <P>We come now to 1947.  Admittedly, in the intervening years, we had the war which possibly interfered with our economic programme, but nevertheless, as the war developed, one would have expected&mdash;if our machinery of Government were directed towards agricultural products and agriculture generally, and if it were properly geared to the benefits to be derived from war-time prices which prevailed not only during the war but after the war&mdash;a huge increase in 1947 over the figure of £36.3 million at which it stood in 1931.</P>
    <P>What is the fact?  The fact is that, in 1947, the value of our exports stood at £39.5 million, a mere increase of £3,000,000.  If we wanted to boast and claim credit&mdash;I do not believe it is anything to boast about or that any substantial credit is to be claimed for it&mdash;the much derided Coalition Government or inter-Party Government then&mdash;it depends on your point of <Col N="775" /> view which you call it&mdash;came into power.  It has been adequately described in the course of speeches not alone on this Vote but over the past few years.  The advantages of that Government and, of course, equally the disadvantages, have been adequately described, but, nevertheless, all the policies that are in operation at the moment were initiated by that Government.  The inter-Party Government did not come together for the purpose of getting power or for the allocation of offices in Government. They did not come into power as a result of a single promise made in 1947 or during the course of the election in 1948.  I should describe that Government as a body of men who, at that time, had regard to the general economic circumstances prevailing, and who had regard to the very serious likelihood that no improvement could be expected from the Government then in power.  Fianna Fáil were stagnant, they were bereft of ideas and they had no real initiative to proceed with the job in hand.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party group came together, pooled their common resources, abandoned their differences of detail and set to work on a plan for the nation's betterment.  That plan has been in operation for 10 years in spite of two very serious interruptions and, in 1957, the year in which the second Coalition lead by Deputy Costello went out of office, the value of our exports stood at £131,000,000.  That is a fact which cannot be denied and I have no hesitation in attributing it to the bold plan and policy of the inter-Party Government directed towards the working of the land and the produce of the land.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government were in office in 1952 and they sought, by deliberate act, to withdraw portion of the food subsidies.  They increased the cost of living by their deliberate act.  It is true, as was suggested here, that they won two out of three by-elections shortly after that Budget, and one can, of course, except that because the impact of something is never really felt for some little time, and it was not felt at that time because there was a very rapid administrative effort to offset <Col N="776" /> whatever impact there might have been.  I remember well taking part as a candidate in one of the by-elections in my present constituency, and I could not help being suitably impressed by the rapidity with which the Department of Social Welfare issued the new pension books, the new children's allowances book, and the other vouchers covering the little benefits that were given to offset the impact, as it were, of the Budget of 1957, so that they had reached the hands of the recipients long before they voted in that election.  I suppose it is well to admit that would appear to be the political game.</P>
    <P>Now we move along to when that Government were put out of power in 1954.  The story started to go against them before that and it was because the impact of the rise in the cost of living, as a result of the deliberate action of that Government, was making itself felt more and more strongly, as time went on, that it went against them.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the condition that arose in 1956, during the last administration of Deputy J.A. Costello, was brought about by ineptitude, by lack of planning on the part of his colleagues at that time.  Anybody who says that is either suppressing vital facts or telling falsehoods, which might be described as white, seeing they are political, but I do not think that a man of the experience and political maturity which one would expect to reside in the person of the Minister for Health should come into the House, as he did yesterday evening, and deliver an all-time low.  I think that kind of thing is bad.  That kind of thing in itself is something that destroys public confidence in public men and public institutions, but then, I think, one might dismiss the Minister for Health with the words of Lord Macauley, applied to a well-known Anglo-Irish poet, that strict veracity was never one of his virtues.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this Vote on Account, I am not interested in millions of pounds as such.  I am interested in the simple arithmetic of pounds, shillings and pence, as if affects the homes of the people in the constituency which I represent.  We have no rich <Col N="777" /> people there.  We are more or less all in the same situation.  There may be some percentage much better off than others, but, by and large, we are a constituency of small farmers, whose incomes are supplemented by migratory labour in England and remittances from America, or by finding some local, seasonal work, provided by the Special Employment Schemes Office, or by the local authority.  That is the kind of pattern there and it is not a pattern which is in any way new to many members here.  It is the pattern of rural Ireland particularly in the maritime constituencies, and what I am concerned about is that this Vote on Account does not appear to me, at any rate, to have either in its implied policy, or its stated application, any relief for those people.</P>
    <P>It is true we have increased the salaries and the wages of other sections of the community.  We have given certain benefit to old age pensioners&mdash;a shilling a week to offset this increase, which, by the way, is an increase that cannot be regarded in the ordinary country household as unsubstantial and insignificant, and one not likely to make a severe impact upon the family economy.  From 1948 to 1951, the price of bread was 6½d. for a 2 lb. loaf.  In 1954, as a result of the 1952 Budget, the price went up to 9d. and, as a result of the complete withdrawal of food subsidies in 1957, it now stands at 1/1½d.  Flour, which was 2/8 a stone from 1948 to 1951 went up to 4/5 in 1952 as a result of the Budget of that year, and now stands at 7/8 a stone. As a result of the withdrawal of the subsidies in the 1957 Budget, sugar has gone up from 4d. to 7½d. a lb., and butter has gone up from 2/10 to 4/4 a lb.  That is the kind of thing that means something to me and means something to the people I represent.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is being given through this Vote on Account expressly and/or impliedly to the people who have to sustain themselves on small uneconomic holdings and supplement their incomes in the ways I have mentioned.  In connection with those supplementary earnings, I want to say this&mdash;and I think it is the experience of anybody who knows anything about migration&mdash;that the good earnings in England are not as good as <Col N="778" /> they were and, in fact, jobs there are not as easy to get as they were.  It is all very well to talk about emigration, but I share the view of Deputy Dillon. I regard emigration, up to a point, as a good thing, as a safety valve up to a point, but, when it becomes something which is almost a stampede, and over which you appear to have no control, as a result of despondency and despair generally, that is a serious matter.  If all these migrants have to come back here, what are we to do?  What can we do for them?</P>
    <P>Arguments have been put forward about how bouyant our economy is and that there is a spirit of optimism abroad.  All these quotations come from <i>The Statist</i> and editorials in various financial journals, from reports of O.E.E.C., but go to the North Wall, go to Dún Laoghaire, go to any of the railway stations in the West or South of Ireland, go into any business house in any Irish country town to-day and ask what they think of the buoyancy and this spirit of optimism that O.E.E.C., and some economic charters of freedom, purport to represent us as enjoying at present.  Those are the people to ask.</P>
    <P>Lord Rank made a most significant observation at a recent meeting in Limerick.  In addition to having bevies of beauties, he also makes flour, and he says that the abolition of the food subsidies here is reflected in this way, that for every ten sacks of flour sold before the abolition of the food subsidies, only seven sacks are sold now.  This is the man who makes the flour, this is the man who sells the flour; this is the man who would be expected to know something about it. From that follow two certain deductions: either there are fewer people in the country eating flour, or the people in it are eating less flour.  I am sure that will be perfectly intelligible to Deputy Kitt.</P>

      <P>There have been speeches about reductions in emigration, but the Taoiseach, in a reply yesterday, said there were no figures on which one can rely.  Yet the Minister for Finance said recently that emigration had been cut by half.  Where did he get the figures on which he based that 50 per cent. cut?  With regard to unemployment, there is one real figure in existence, that is, that there are 37,000 people fewer in insurable employment than there were when Deputy <Col N="780" /> Costello's Government left office, and that is the test.</P>
      <P>It has been denied that any promises were made about food subsidies or the cost of living.  I do not have to accept that&mdash;I heard them being made.  I do not have to assert again that they were false, but I do think it is high time we fulfilled the ambition, the urge and the zeal that brought every one of us here, namely, to make contributions by advice, argument, and counsel, and thereby discharge what must be regarded as our common duty to our fellow men.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The particulars requested at (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question are given in the following statement for 1st June, 1955.  The classification scheme for size of holding adopted in the compilation of agricultural statistics groups together all holdings of 15-30 acres and hence it is not possible to provide the figures requested at (c) of the question.  Particulars of the numbers of holdings over 15 acres and over 30 acres have been entered in the statement.</P>
      <P>Reliable county estimates for the years 1956 and 1957 are not available because of the reduction in the coverage of the agricultural enumeration in those years while the county estimates for 1958 have not yet been compiled. Estimated totals for the State as a whole for 1956 and 1957 are given for permanent male agricultural labourers and for agricultural tractors together with a provisional estimate of the number of permanent male agricultural labourers in June, 1958.</P>

      <P>The data assembled <Col N="743" /> for the purpose of the computation of the Consumer Price Index, on the level of rents (including rates) of occupied rented dwellings owned by local authorities are not obtained in a form which would make it possible to classify the dwellings in each county into different groups based on the level of rents paid.  For each county and county borough (as well as for Dún Laoghaire Borough) it is, however, possible to give the number of rented dwellings and the average weekly rent (including rates) as returned for the compilation of the Consumer Price Index at mid-November, 1958.  This information is provided in the following statement in which the returns for dwellings owned by all local authorities within each county have been combined. In a few cases returns were not received for certain authorities and the figures in the statement do not, in all cases, represent the total number of local authority dwellings in the area.</P>
      <P>DATA on number of occupied rented dwellings owned by local authorities in each County, County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough together with the average weekly rent (including rates) of such dwellings in each area used in the compilation of the Consumer Price Index at mid-November, 1958.</P>
