    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has seen the statement of Mr. John Conroy, General President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, that a need existed for a top-level independent conciliation officer who would be empowered when normal channels of negotiation and conciliation failed to step into the breach before the die was cast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Every proposal for the amendment of the Industrial Relations Acts which may be put forward, and particularly proposals which have secured the agreement of all the parties concerned with the powers and functions of the Labour Court, will, of course, receive the most careful consideration of the Government.</P>
      <P>It is, however, the Government's view that the normal and proper procedure for the settlement of trade disputes should begin with direct negotiation between the parties, to be followed, if the direct negotiation should prove to be unsuccessful, by recourse to the services provided by the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institution of any system of appeals from the formal recommendations of the Labour Court would, in <Col N="626" /> the Government's opinion, be very undesirable and would defeat its own purpose.  If the recommendations of the Labour Court were to be made, or should in practice generally tend to be regarded as, the starting point instead of the final stage of negotiation in trade disputes, the value and usefulness of the Court would be seriously impaired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the failure of the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to provide any net increase in the volume of whole-time employment, it is the intention of the Government to introduce proposals for employment expansion; and, if so, if it is intended to publish proposals this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption upon which the Deputy's Question is based is not correct.  On the contrary, the Government are satisfied that their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, published a year ago, has already had an important beneficial effect on the economy and on employment which, since the beginning of 1959, has shown a marked upward trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give us figures to demonstrate the proof of what he has said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if I am asked for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Taoiseach think that in the context of the question such figures might, with propriety, be made available now, in view of the fact that the last figures supplied by the Taoiseach in this context spoke of a decrease of 40,000 persons in employment as compared with two or three years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not with two or three years ago.  As the Deputy well knows, in the last six months of 1956 and the first quarter of 1957 the decline in employment in this country was around 50,000.  It is that fact <Col N="627" /> which the Deputy, I think, should bear in mind when he makes comment on what has happened over the last three years because it was that nine months period in the past three years which was entirely responsible for that situation. At any rate, Deputy Desmond's question relates solely to the consequences of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published a year ago, and my reply relates to the effect of that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not want to give any figures at the moment to sustain the view he has expressed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot at the moment but, if I am asked for them, I shall give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach refutes the allegation that there has been no increase in employment, surely this is the occasion on which he should give evidence to show there has been an increase, if there has been an increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assert, and I can produce figures to support my assertion, that there has been a substantial increase in employment in the course of the present year following upon the publication of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in 1958, as compared with 1957, there was a drop of 50,000 in the numbers in employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach not tell me there were 501,000 in full employment in this country in 1957?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the Minister for <Col N="628" /> Finance of the Six Counties has stated that the social welfare subsidies payable by the British Government in the Six Counties amount to £10 million and that the agricultural subsidies amount to £25 million; and whether he was aware of the magnitude of the subsidies payable by the British Government in the Six Counties when he made the statement at the debate of the Oxford Union on 15th October regarding an arrangement to ensure that on reunification there would be no reduction in social benefits now enjoyed in the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the recent agreement signed at Stockholm and the unlikely resumption of the Paris talks concerning the introduction of a Free Trade area, he is in a position to say what further action will be taken to associate this country with the proposed new arrangement agreed at Stockholm; and if any action will be taken to safeguard our trading interests arising out of these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government's view is that association with the European Free Trade Association would not be likely to confer any advantages on this country that would be commensurate with the obligations which we would be required to undertake.  The text of the Convention will be carefully studied, with particular reference to its possible effects on our trading interests.</P>
      <P>The Government have under active consideration our foreign trading relations generally.  As the House is aware, negotiations are in progress with Britain, our most important trading associate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to say whether, in view of the fact that the Paris negotiations are not likely to resume, any action will be taken to associate this country with the new trading arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my reply deals with the point of that supplementary question also.  The text of the agreement signed in Stockholm last week is being studied so that full understanding of its significance will be achieved.  Certainly the conclusions reached so far are that there would be little advantage to this country in participating in the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it follow from that that this country will be excluded from either of the proposed trading arrangements that have come into being, either the Six or the Outer Seven?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of exclusion.  It is a question of whether we would wish to join.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take questions No. 7 and No. 8 together and to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the quantity, value and average f.o.b. price of barley exported in each of the months August, September and October, 1959.  It is not the practice of the Central Statistics Office to reveal the names of individual importers or exporters.</P>
      <P>The arrangement made with the four Associations engaged in the grain and feeding stuffs trades, is that licences for the import of coarse grains (other than oats) will be granted against barley exported on a ton for ton basis only and that the quantity of maize to be imported will not exceed 40,000 tons during the cereal year.</P>
      <P>Licences for the importation of maize against barley exports, under this arrangement, were not granted during the months August to October. Accordingly, no maize was imported during these months under the arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This small building, which was built as a fever hospital but was not in use for hospital purposes when it was decided to take it over to accommodate 20 tuberculosis patients in 1949, is not now required for fever hospital, sanatorium or district hospital purposes.</P>
      <P>The only other purpose for which it could be used is the accommodation of persons normally accommodated in County Homes.  In fact, I have such a proposal from the South Cork Board of Assistance before me at present.</P>
      <P>I would be reluctant for several reasons to approve this proposal.</P>
      <P>In the first place, there is less case nowadays for adding to our County Home population than there was formerly, when social welfare benefits were less generous and when there was no Disability Allowance, payable under the Health code, for which many persons who formerly had no alternative to entering such Homes are now eligible.</P>
      <P>Secondly, modern thought favours the care of old people whenever possible in their own homes, among familar surroundings, rather than in institutions which remain institutional in character no matter how well they are conducted.</P>

However, in relation to the other matter, I can only deal with persons who are unequivocal in their statements.  I have been told that there is no ban.  That is what the Irish Medical Association say now.  Every member of the profession knows, however, that a ban is intended whenever what has been described as an &ldquo;important notice&rdquo; appears in the Irish Medical Association's Journal.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the number of occasions on which diplomatic immunity has been claimed on behalf of the son of the Irish Ambassador to the United States and the nature of the charges, if any, which were waived in each case.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy on 25th November, the traditional rule regarding diplomatic immunity is that heads of diplomatic missions and their families forming part of their households are immune from criminal and civil proceedings in the State to which they are accredited. In the case to which the Deputy refers this rule was automatically applied by the authorities concerned.  The latter part of the question does not therefore arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I put on the Order Paper surely arises&mdash;the <Col N="648" /> number of occasions on which diplomatic immunity was claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On how many occasions was diplomatic immunity automatically applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On several occasions, when the Deputy put down this question, he talked about &ldquo;claiming&rdquo;.  I explained to him on the last occasion &mdash;and the Deputy and all Deputies interested in this case should do their best to understand it&mdash;that immunity was not claimed.  Immunity is not claimed in such cases because it is automatically granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody appreciates that this is a very distressing case but the country's reputation is suffering because of it.  It has been alleged that diplomatic immunity has been applied on more than one occasion in respect of this person.  If this person has created a position in which diplomatic immunity had to be claimed for him on more than one occasion, surely some action should have been taken by the head of the Ambassadorial Mission concerned?  Furthermore if he has put himself in this position on more than one occasion, has he not created an embarrassing position both for the Irish Government and for the American Government and would it not be wise, in all the circumstances, for the Government to recall the Ambassador concerned before the American Government find themselves forced to do it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply <Col N="649" /> to the Deputy.  The Deputy is aware that the young Irishman in question has returned to Ireland and that should satisfy everybody.  I may explain there are all sorts of very minor offences, small breaches of the law that the ordinary individual is prone to commit, parking offences, and so on, in which diplomatic immunity is applied.  As I have told the Deputy, as far as the Government is concerned we did not claim diplomatic immunity in this case.  It is applied automatically in such cases.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not tell the House that our Ambassador to the United States is a fine public servant with a great record of public service?

    <P>The course consists of lectures and <Col N="650" /> instruction in matters of interest to police, and among the subjects covered are the Administration and Organisation of a Police Force, Committee and Conference Work, Public Speaking, Leadership, Prevention of Offences and Road Safety and Accident Prevention.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> On 18th November, I gave a detailed reply to a number of Questions that were asked about crimes of violence in Dublin, where the crime problem is most serious.  I mentioned the steps that had been and were being taken to improve the position.  As I said then, if these measures do not bring about the improvement that I hope for, I shall consider what further steps can be taken.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Courts will award penalties appropriate to the offences referred to by the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. P.J. Burke</b> asked the Minister for Justice whether in view of the recent increase in the number of crimes of violence in and around the city of Dublin, he will provide for doubling the patrols on all beats within the city and county areas which at present are patrolled by single Gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he is aware that in the circumstances that now have developed single Garda patrols in certain areas are inadequate, and whether, if the suggestion in the question is not acceptable, some other precautions will be taken to ensure that adequate reinforcements are at hand for a Garda involved in a threat in the course of his duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware patrol cars are in attendance almost within a few minutes of the 999 signal and if people would avail of that to a greater extent, especially citizens who have telephones, I have no doubt it would be of considerable help and of considerable value to the police force.  As I said at the end of the reply to the question, in certain conditions or in a locality where circumstances make it necessary, the police are prepared to consider the suggestion made by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it this scheme was introduced by me because of my appreciation of the difficulties that arose in that area, because of the British refusal to take <Col N="654" /> what is described as &ldquo;green-tag&rdquo; cattle having passed two scheme tests within the Clearance Area.  The Minister appreciated that position so fully that he approached and received the authority of the Minister for Finance to take up, on a compensation basis, any of those &ldquo;green-tag&rdquo; cattle failing the 14 day tests on which the British insisted.  Appreciating all these facts and having provided this scheme as I did, I surely appreciate the need for providing an alternative.  However, that alternative can be provided only after I have had full discussions with all the interested parties.  Some of these discussions have already taken place; some more are immediately pending.  I have told the Deputy, and it is not just for the purpose of being smart, that this alternative scheme will be introduced as soon as possible and I would say that should be inside a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No good purpose would be served by discussing what the abuses are and who are engaging in them.

      <P>Will the Minister have regard to the damage which is being caused to the eradication programme by this long dispute?  I do not wish to embarrass the Minister but would he consider any other steps he could initiate to end it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I have been taking the initiative in this matter for the last two years and I cannot think of any other step I can take to bring this dispute to a conclusion. The last effort which I made was made with the full approval of the Government and on that occasion I went as far as any reasonably fairminded person could expect me to go. It is not possible to discuss the details of a matter of this kind at Question Time but if the Deputy or any other Deputy wishes, I shall let him have the correspondence between the Veterinary Medical Association, the Veterinary Officers' Association and the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister consider making a summary of the situation in a White Paper, first of all, and then any Deputy who wishes to go into the details of the matter could ask for full details?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My view of that is that people are often suspicious of summaries. I would prefer to issue the letters and correspondence even if they would be more tedious to go through. They would not be suspect in the same way that a summary would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that owing to the embargo on imports of oats and seeds during the present year, there is a grave danger that the price of seed oats and seed barley will go sky high?  Will he take steps to ensure that there will be a plentiful supply of seeds and that the merchants will get only a reasonable profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that there is no control over the price of seeds and surely I can tell him that this, of all years, is one in which you could not justify the importation of seed oats and seed barley except to a very limited extent.  I suppose we have never had a better grain crop than we had this year.  I quite understand the view of the Deputy coming, as he does, from West Cork, but he should remember that there are other areas in which seed oats and seed barley are grown extensively.  Farmers in these areas would take a poor view, and would be entitled to do so, if a close eye was not kept on imports.</P>

      <P>The Kilkenny county manager was requested on the 30th October, 1959, to prepare for Kilkenny Corporation a housing programme which, in scope and order of priority, would accord with their statutory housing responsibilities.  A decision on the borough council's request that I should receive a deputation of their members to discuss the housing position in the borough has been deferred until the manager's report has been submitted to and considered by the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Kilkenny Corporation wish to build houses for newly-weds, persons desirous of getting married and other non-priority groups and at the same time, to take no positive steps to secure the rehousing of families living in condemned houses and overcrowded conditions.  A survey by the county medical officer of health early in 1959 established that 128 families were living in unfit houses in the borough, including 99 families in dwellings which were incapable of being repaired.  Before he would agree to the corporation's proposal to build 48 further houses in Walkin Street the Minister requested evidence that the building of the houses would result in the re-housing of an equal number of <Col N="665" /> families living in unfit dwellings.  It is on that very point that I am trying to get the manager and the council to agree.  When that has been done, certainly they will get every co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Information is not available in the form requested by the Deputy.  Tenders for local authority housing schemes are normally analysed on the basis of the cost per square foot of building.  The average cost per square foot represented by the tender approved on 20th November, 1959, for the housing scheme at Careys Road, Limerick, was 35/9 excluding development charges.  The corresponding figures in the case of the tenders for the same scheme which Limerick Corporation had proposed to accept in July and November, 1958, were 37/1 and 37/respectively.</P>

The tender submitted in November, 1959, for the same scheme, with the same size of house, had been reduced to £129,470, or 37/- per square foot, and the tender eventually received, accepted, and sanctioned by my Department in November, 1959, for the revised type of house was £120,789, or 35/9 per square foot.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the roads in question are not public roads, the county council have no statutory authority to incur expenditure on their upkeep. Having regard to the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1953, I do not consider that the introduction of further legislation is warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if Galway County Council declare such roads, as are envisaged in this Question, public roads, can they under existing legislation maintain them on the lines I have incorporated in the Question, and which I originally proposed at a meeting of Galway County Council, that is, that we, the County Council, would supply the material free provided the people living along these roads spread it under county council's supervision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I might explain that incidentally the resolution in question, apparently passed by Galway County Council, was not forwarded and was withheld pending some further information that those sponsoring the resolution wished to obtain, so that I have not have had before me anything other than this Question and what is incorporated in it.  In so far as the Supplementary Question the Deputy has asked is concerned, the question of the expenditure of Road Fund moneys is naturally tied, in the sense that only on public roads, so declared by the <Col N="668" /> local authority, may these moneys be spent.</P>
      <P>The question whether, if the council take over certain roads, we in the Department would agree to allow moneys to be spent on the conditions outlined by the Deputy is, I should say in the circumstances, somewhat hypothetical and rather difficult to deal with at the moment.  I would like to comment on the general idea that where the people concerned are prepared to do something for themselves, and if it is possible within the framework of our general laws and the pattern of those laws, every encouragement should, and indeed, will be given to them as far as I can give it.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the Act&rdquo; means the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952 (No. 24 of 1952), as amended by section 9 of the Finance Act, 1955 (No. 13 of 1955) and section 20 of the Finance Act, 1958 (No. 25 of 1958); <Col N="682" /> any reference to a vehicle shall be construed as including a reference to a vehicle and another vehicle or an attachment which, in accordance with subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 of Part II of the Schedule to the Act, are, for the purposes of Part I of that Schedule, to be deemed to form and be a single vehicle.</P>
    <P>(2)  THAT for the purposes of the Act, the weight unladen of a vehicle shall, on and after the 1st day of January, 1960, and notwithstanding section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933 (No. 11 of 1933), be taken to be the weight of the vehicle inclusive of all additions, but exclusive of the weight of water, fuel or accumulators (other than boilers) used for the purpose of propulsion and of loose tools or loose equipment.</P>
    <P>(3)  THAT for the purposes of paragraph (2) of this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  each of the following shall, with respect to a vehicle, be an addition:</P>
    <P>(i)  a body,</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(ii)  a part,</P>
    <P>(iii)  a fitting,</P>
    <P>(iv)  a receptacle,</P>
    <P>(b)  in a case in which there is one addition only, the reference to all additions shall be construed as a reference to that addition,</P>
    <P>(c)  in a case in which, there being two additions (and not more), on no occasion are both of them used, the reference to all additions shall be construed as a reference to the heavier only of the additions or, where they are of equal weight, to one of them only,</P>
    <P>(d)  in a case in which, there being three or more additions, on no occasion are <Col N="683" /> all of them used, the reference to all additions shall be construed as a reference to the heaviest combination of the additions which is used on any occasion.</P>
    <P>(4)  THAT in a case coming within subparagraph (d) of paragraph (3) of this Resolution, where one only of the additions is used on a particular occasion, &ldquo;combination of the additions&rdquo; in that subparagraph shall, in relation to that occasion, be taken as referring to that addition.</P>
    <P>(5)  (a)  THAT anything placed on a vehicle for the purpose of the conveyance of goods or burden of any other description shall, subject to the next subparagraph, be a receptacle for the purposes of the provisions contained in the foregoing paragraphs of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(b)  THAT anything so placed is excepted from the foregoing subparagraph if in relation to no journey are goods or burden of any other description both loaded into and unloaded from it without its being removed from the vehicle.</P>
    <P>(6)  THAT in proceedings for recovery of a penalty under section 2 of the Act, the onus of proving that anything comes within the exception specified in paragraph (5) of this Resolution shall lie on the defendant.</P>
    <P>(7)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the substantive part of this motion, I shall first say a few words about the urgency of the <Col N="684" /> matter.  Goods vehicles are assessed for motor taxation on the basis of unladen weight.  During the last year different decisions were given in District Courts on the import of the statutes on the subject and consequently licensing authorities will find themselves in an impossible position in dealing with applications for licences for goods vehicles for 1960 if the issue is not settled decisively before the first of January.  The financial resolution before the House therefore provides a new definition of unladen weight, and is intended to come into force on 1st January, 1960, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  Its efficacy will, of course, be subject to the Resolution being agreed to by a Committee of the whole House on Report Stage within 10 sitting days and subject to the necessary Bill getting a Second Reading within 20 sitting days.</P>
    <P>I should say that it was hoped to have a case stated for decision by the High Court this year, but certain technical difficulties prevented this being done in the current year, and so legislation is the only way to deal with the problem.  The new definition will apply as from 1st January next and will not affect any cases that arose during the current year, which fall to be determined by the Courts in the usual way on the basis of the existing law.  It was not until very recently that it became clear that a case could not be brought before the High Court this year, and this explains why it is necessary to introduce the proposal at so late a date in the year.</P>
    <P>So much for what I may call the &ldquo;time&rdquo; element in the proposal.  As to its substance, while the main intention was to secure a suitable definition to give effect to what had been regarded as the correct interpretation of the existing law up to recently, the complexity of the subject necessitated a new approach and the framing of what is undoubtedly a new formula.  I shall deal with this point in more detail later.  Here I may say that not alone was the opportunity taken to deal with particular points that arose in Court cases, but also with other questions raised in recent years about the present definition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The existing definition of unladen weight for motor tax purposes is to be found in Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  Subsection (2) of that section is now obsolete at least so far as motor taxation is concerned.  It relates to a vehicle exceeding 7¼ tons unladen weight and fitted with a superstructure designed and constructed for a special purpose other than the carrying of passengers or goods.  Any such vehicles now in use would not be taxed as goods vehicles on the basis of unladen weight.  Accordingly that part of the definition is being dropped.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the section is the really effective part.  It provides that the weight unladen shall be the weight of the vehicle including the body and all parts which are necessary to or ordinarily used with the vehicle when working on a road.  Certain small items, such as loose tools and loose equipment, are excluded.</P>
    <P>The phrases &ldquo;body&rdquo; and &ldquo;part&rdquo; are incapable of satisfactory definition because vehicles, of which there are over 278,000 registered in the State, vary so much in design and construction. It could well be argued that what is a body in one case is an integral feature of the vehicle in another case and in still another case is a &ldquo;part&rdquo;.  Again, arguments could be advanced for the proposition that certain items come within the term &ldquo;body&rdquo; or the term &ldquo;part&rdquo;, while contrary arguments could be advanced to the effect that such items do not fall within either of those terms.  The new definition proposes that all &ldquo;additions&rdquo;&mdash;bodies, parts, fittings and receptacles (two new terms designed to cover anything not captured by &ldquo;body&rdquo; or &ldquo;part&rdquo;)&mdash;shall <i>prima facie</i> be included in the unladen weight.  It does not matter what the item is called in a particular vehicle; the omnibus nature of paragraph (2) of the Resolution should cover them.  The items previously specifically excluded, such as loose tools or loose equipment, are still excluded.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty arose with the phrase in Section 18 which qualified &ldquo;all parts&rdquo;, viz., &ldquo;necessary to or ordinarily used with the vehicle when <Col N="686" /> working on a road&rdquo;.  I need hardly say that this could be the subject of much argument in individual cases.  It was affected by the provisions of section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, a later statute which provided that duty becomes payable at a higher rate where a vehicle is used in a condition or manner which would attract the higher rate if the vehicle were used solely in that condition or manner.  Thus, if a lorry is taxed on the basis of 5 tons unladen weight and is on any occasion used at 5½ tons, duty becomes payable (for the licensing period) at the 5½ tons rate. This could be regarded as overriding the qualification about ordinary use in Section 18 of the 1933 Act.  In the new definition it is proposed to follow the principle set out in the 1952 Act, but to make it certain that it will operate equitably.  Accordingly, if a lorry owner has a number of attachments which he may use, not all at one time, for different types of haulage, he will be taxed only on the heaviest item (or combination of items) that he uses at any particular time.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of &ldquo;receptacles&rdquo;.  As in other aspects of this whole problem, there is great variety both as to type and method of attachment of what are commonly called containers.  There is the genuine container, which is loaded and placed on the vehicle and later removed in the same condition.  These could be claimed to form part of the load rather than of the carrying potential of the vehicle, although indeed they could also be claimed to add considerably to its carrying capacity.  Then there are somewhat related contrivances which are attached firmly to the vehicle and always left on it, being virtually part of the &ldquo;body&rdquo;.  In between there is a great variety&mdash;containers which are detachable but rarely detached, containers which are used for a particular type of load for considerable periods and then temporarily replaced by others and so on.  Again it has been necessary to adopt the rule that all receptacles <i>prima facie</i> rank for taxation purposes.  An exception is made, however, in favour of those which could be regarded as more in the nature of a load than in the nature of <Col N="687" /> the conveying capacity of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get a line of division which, while being fair, will not encourage wholesale evasion.  The criterion adopted is, I think, a fair one. If for any particular journey during a licensing period goods are both loaded into and unloaded from the receptacle while it is on the vehicle, then the weight of the container must be included.  Otherwise it is excluded: that is, if it is used as a genuine container on all journeys.  This follows logically the general line adopted, which I mentioned already.  As the use of containers is very much a matter within the knowledge of the vehicle owner, a provision regarding burden of proof is necessary and is included in paragraph (6) of the Resolution.</P>
    <P>One might well ask why steps have not been taken to deal with this matter before now.  Many lorry owners are paying tax on the basis which the Resolution sets out.  Others are not and due to difficulties of enforcement it has been difficult to deal with them. I should explain that the problem as it now poses itself did not exist at the time the 1952 Act was passed.  Since then there have been two developments. There has been a great increase in the variety of vehicles and the variety of devices used with them. Furthermore, the 1952 Act increased very substantially the rates of duty on the heavy lorries and it is very much in the interests of the heavy lorry operators to reduce the figure of unladen weight for tax purposes. Indeed, it is the heavy lorries which will be chiefly affected by the proposal. The attachments used on the smaller vehicles naturally are light and the extra duty, if any, involved at those rates is also light.  In the case of the heavier vehicles, attachments can be heavy and, the rates being high, the extra duty could be substantial.  In no case, however, would it be more than a small fraction of the cost of operating a lorry.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have to convince the House that the contribution made by these heavy vehicles to the cost of road construction and maintenance must bear some relation to the <Col N="688" /> demands they make on the road system.  Every addition to their carrying capacity means greater loads and greater impact on the roads.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the new definition merely reflects what has been the interpretation given to the existing law by licensing authorities and generally accepted until recently.  If it does involve extra duty in some cases, then it is because some owners have availed of any weakness there is in the definition, and they can scarcely cavil at being brought into line.</P>
    <P>The Government have given special consideration to the case of licensed hauliers.  They are doubly affected by unladen weight, in that the unladen weight for motor tax purposes is the criterion by which their weights are checked for the purposes of road transport licensing.  It is considered that, as the new definition involves the reckoning of certain items which at least some of them felt free to use in addition to the items weighed for tax purposes, some increase should be given in standard lorry weights to ameliorate any hardship in that respect that may be caused by this Resolution.  The Minister for Transport and Power is introducing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I should add that it is intended that the Bill to implement this Resolution will contain, not merely the new definition of unladen weight, but also some provisions to facilitate the enforcement of the law.  I have already mentioned that there are difficulties at present in that respect.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to the House for a very long statement on what is a relatively small measure.  However, the Resolution is a complex document, introduced at necessarily short notice because of the procedure associated with Financial Resolutions and the urgency of the occasion, and I felt I should explain matters as fully as possible.  Here I should say that, while the document appears at first sight to be very involved, it will be realised on consideration that the draftsman had a very difficult job to do and did it well.  A financial provision must be <Col N="689" /> carefully drafted because it is strictly construed and because loopholes can be both expensive and inequitable.  A Resolution that deals with so many types of vehicle and attachment is doubly difficult.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Resolution to the House and trust that if there are any other points on which explanations are required I shall be able to provide the necessary answers.</P>

      <P>I shall just give the House the types of addition envisaged. Possibly there are others that may come along and that we have not even mentioned but this is the type of addition that comes under the Resolution&mdash;sideboards, tailboards, creels, larger cattle containers, containers for oil and other goods.  Those for the moment would be examples of the additions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way: any kind of thing normally used on a truck whether it is one-tier, two-tier or three-tier&mdash;if there are such things.  I have not yet seen three tiers but they may be coming&mdash;if it is a kind of thing normally or usually used and heavier than any other creel, receptacle, crib or attachment used, then the heavier ones are the ones that will be weighed for tax purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister what he has just said in relation to the Resolution before the House is not said in the terms of the Resolution.  The Resolution is quite clear and according to subsection (5) it is not a question of anything that is normally used with a lorry.  If it is used once and only once then it is caught by this Resolution. The Resolution, according to the Minister's own estimate, will add £50,000 to £100,000 as an additional burden and charge on the transport of the country.  That is something we certainly cannot afford in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>I find it impossible to visualise clearly what is intended, and apart from what is intended, what is construed under this Resolution.  May I put the more extreme case?  This year was a bad year for drought. Many farmers had to draw water.  If they put loose barrels on a lorry and took those barrels down to the nearest pump and put a hosepipe from the pump into the lorry and into the barrels and filled the barrels at the pump and then brought the barrels back and emptied them with another pipe, say a gravity pipe, into a tank in the farmyard, under sub-paragraph (5) of this Resolution, those emptied barrels must be added because they have been used once with the vehicle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave the Deputy to continue because I do not like this idea of drawing out a point and then making speeches after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect of subsection (5) (b) &ldquo;...if in relation to no journey are goods or burden of any other description both loaded into and unloaded from it without its being removed from the vehicle.&rdquo;  The water is loaded in; that is the goods. The barrels are not taken off the lorry but the barrels are emptied.  The water is excluded but the barrels under subsection (5) as drafted here in this Resolution must be added to the weight.</P>
      <P>Take another case.  A man has a lorry and uses that lorry in the ordinary way, say for 11 months of the year, for ordinary carrying purposes for his own goods.  In one month of the year, perhaps on two runs, he goes to the bog to bring home his turf and he puts up at the side of the lorry, not completely fitted creels or &ldquo;cribs&rdquo; as I understand they are called in some parts of the country, but puts up loose attachments which one might describe as a few planks on the sides to keep the turf in.  The turf is loaded in while those planks are in position.  The turf is then unloaded while they are still there and even though the man only uses this contrivance perhaps twice in the year he must have the weight calculated for tax purposes by reference to those attachments that are there.</P>
      <P>I have a sort of suspicion that part of the idea of the Resolution is also to provide a hidden drive to induce people to go to C.I.E., to help C.I.E. in an oblique way.  I do not know whether that is true or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take another question, I cannot understand for example whether a spare wheel, which at present does not have to be weighed, will be regarded as loose equipment or is it a fitting?  It is usually fitted on to the lorry.  I am <Col N="692" /> not prepared to put any definition on that.  The whole purpose of this Resolution is to ensure that people who, maybe, once or twice or three times in the year use their lorry for a particular purpose will have to pay the higher rate of tax for the entire year. That is the purpose of the Resolution without question.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister's view that the motion is drafted in the way he indicated unless its purpose is the ridiculous one of catching in loose things that are put in it from time to time.  Let us take a receptacle.  We all know that very often a box of sorts is utilised for carrying tools, for the County Council, for example, out to the bog or to a distant road.  The tools are loaded into the box and, if there are many tools, they are taken out before the box is lifted because otherwise the box would be too heavy to lift. Under Section 5 of this Resolution, as drafted, that box also would have to be weighed and the person concerned, if he were hauled up at any time in the year, would be put on his proof that at no time during the course of the year had he carried a fitting, a receptacle or a part that had not been weighed at the time concerned.</P>
    <P>May I point out, also, in relation to the definition of &ldquo;part&rdquo; in paragraph 3, that as far as I can understand the Road Traffic Act, 1933, Section 18, it was to be a part of the body at that stage, but now, under the new Resolution, it is a body or a part of a vehicle? It is not a part of a body; it is a part of a vehicle.  Is not a part of a vehicle one of the spare parts, for example, and is there not, therefore, a contradiction automatically there between that phraseology and the &ldquo;loose tools and equipment&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Bill is intended to follow the exact wording of this Resolution or not; that is a matter for another day; but it does seem to me that, as this Resolution is framed, it will add another £100,000 perhaps to the transport charge which the economy cannot bear at the present time and, in addition to that, this Resolution will mean that all sort of things will be added to the weight which should not under any circumstances <Col N="693" /> be added and that things which might, perhaps, be fairly added if they were used normally will be added even though they are used only once or twice in the twelve months. For that reason I do not think the House should accept the Motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This looks like emergency legislation.  Apparently, the position is that different local authorities and different district justices are taking different views as to the interpretation of Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933 and we are in the position now in which no one appears to know what the law really is in the light of these decisions by local authorities and district justices. Apparently, it was desired that the High Court be asked to pronounce on the law.  I think it would have been better if we could have managed to get the High Court to pronounce upon the law.  I cannot understand why it could not have been possible to get some High Court Judge to devote one weekend out of the many that have passed in order to decide what is the law in respect to this matter and thus have it clarified because even when this Bill is passed there will probably be conflicting definitions by district justices as to its meaning and it may be necessary to get a High Court decision to clarify what is now intended to bring about clarification in the existing muddled condition of the law.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I do not like the State stepping in to determine what is the law when cases are at present pending hearing by the High Court.  It would have been better if we could have utilised the High Court procedure, which would have settled existing difficulties in a way which, perhaps, could be more permanent than what we are doing now in an effort to secure clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt that there is a good deal of wangling in connection with the registration of lorries.  It is well known to anyone who keeps his eyes and ears open that a fair amount of manipulation goes on.  I have been told of cases where a person gets a vehicle registered with one type of <Col N="694" /> body and, as soon as the fee is paid and he gets back to his place of business, the light weight vehicle is removed and a heavy weight vehicle is put on.  Everything goes well for twelve months and the light weight vehicle is put on again for the purpose of registration, after which the heavy weight vehicle is put on again.  It is right to stop abuses of that kind.</P>
    <P>In respect of the very heavy lorry, I am strongly in favour of it but I am just wondering how long we can afford to keep these eight wheel trucks on the road having regard to the cost of road maintenance today.  The Kildare Urban Council made an excellent job of repairing and widening the road from Blackchurch to Naas.  As a result of their efforts, the road is a first-class road comparable with any road in the world, including the famous Continental autobahns, but one day a heavy lorry travelled along the road from Blackchurch to Naas and made a depression with two wheels on the road for the entire distance.  That happened months ago and the two wheel marks are still to be seen in varying degrees of depth between Blackchurch and Naas.  No doubt, Deputy Sweetman has observed them from time to time.  They are clearly visible in the day time.</P>
    <P>Lorries of that kind on the road can be very expensive to the local ratepayers who have to provide to some extent for the maintenance of the roads and they are quite a burden on the motorcar taxpaying community, who use much lighter vehicles.</P>
    <P>If we can be satisfied that there have been abuses and manipulation of the road transport legislation, the House is justified in taking steps to correct the abuses and to seal off any financial haemorrhages which are causing loss of revenue to the State but I do think that the Minister ought not to tidy up this legislation in such a way as to make it utterly inflexible and incapable of meeting an emergency which everybody would desire to meet and which would be met in any case but only by somebody recognising that he was breaking the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> This is a very technical Resolution. I should like the Minister to tell us what is the meaning of paragraph 5 (b) in relation to paragraph 5 (a).  Paragraph 5 (a) would appear to bear out what Deputy Sweetman has said.  It reads: &ldquo;That anything placed on a vehicle for the purpose of the conveyance of goods or burden of any other description shall, subject to the next sub-paragraph, be a receptacle for the purposes of the provisions contained in the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution.&rdquo; If you put a barrel in your lorry, that is, a receptacle, the next sub-paragraph reads: &ldquo;That anything so placed is excepted from the foregoing subparagraph if in relation to no journey are goods or burden of any other description both loaded into and unloaded from it without its being removed from the vehicle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that you can take that barrel off, empty the water and put the barrel back again, or does it mean that you can siphon the water out of the barrel and that the barrel in such circumstances will not be a container for the purpose of this amendment?  It is absurd that because mankind is visited with an unwelcome drought that you would break the law by taking out a lorry to get the water elsewhere that will not come where the water is needed. I should like the Minister to tell us that cases of that kind are not covered by this measure, that the accidental use of receptacles once or twice a year for a purpose of that kind would not mean that the owner of the lorry would be burdened with the additional cost as if these containers had been used permanently for the transport of goods or other burden on his vehicle.  The Minister ought to clarify that in the Resolution or in the Bill, whichever way it is necessary to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear in my own mind that I am right in believing that the case referred to by Deputy Norton of the eightwheeled lorry which sank in the ground on the road in County Kildare <Col N="696" /> is not affected by this Resolution at all, that that is simply a question of loads on lorries of excessive weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was not the load that was weight in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not affected by this at all.  So far as I know the fraudulent practice referred to by Deputy Norton is not affected by this Resolution.  It is under the existing law fraud to move a lorry to the place of weighing with one body on it, and, having got it weighed and taxed, to take the lorry home, take that body off and put a different body on it.  That is fraud and if it is detected you are liable to prosecution.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, the only area in which ambiguity exists is where you have a lorry which you ordinarily operate with sideboards but on occasion your load is of a character that requires cribs and you put on cribs to contain the load.  Are those cribs to be weighed with the lorry or are the sideboards normally used the appropriate fitting for the lorry when it is brought to the point of weighing under the jurisdiction of the local authority?  So far as I know&mdash;and Deputy Booth ought to intervene in this debate, because he is familiar with this business, and tell us what his impression of this Resolution is&mdash; most of the lorry assemblers in this country try to assemble their lorries as near as is practicable to the maximum weight permitted within a certain tax schedule.  Those lorries are all on the road and there are hundreds of them.  What we do by this Resolution is to levy on the owners of these lorries anything from £50,000 to £100,000 per annum.  I want to know does this House think that is a desirable thing to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that these lorries of immense capacity which are too heavy for any normal road, however excellently constructed, ought to be virtually taxed out of existence.  If we were to establish a system of autobahns capable of carrying these gargantuan lorries heavily laden, the cost would be appalling and the occurrence of these immensely <Col N="697" /> heavily laden lorries is of so rare a character that we would not be justified in constructing our roads to cater for them.  However, that is an entirely different problem from the one envisaged here.  We are employing a ten-ton hammer to crush a thrush's egg.  This Resolution reeks of the excessive zeal of those who are trying to do by Resolution of this House what would much more appropriately be done by the ordinary procedure of the courts of law which are there for the purpose of interpreting our legislation rationally.  As I understand, the function of the courts it is to ask not what Dáil Éireann intended to do but what is a rational interpretation of what Dáil Éireann has actually done.</P>
    <P>I think you will get, on the foot of this so-called clarifying Resolution, a new crop of anomalies such as Deputy Sweetman has referred to.  I do not believe anybody in Dáil Éireann to-day intends that if in a year or two you put six barrels on a lorry, fill them with water, bring them to the field, siphon the water out of the barrels because the barrels containing the water are too heavy to lift down, if those six barrels lift your lorry two or three stone above the maximum weight appropriate to your tax disc, you are to be fined and required to pay increased tax on that lorry because once you drew six barrels of water out to your cattle in the field.  I do not believe anybody means that but I believe that, on the strict interpretation of this Resolution by the courts, that meaning must be attached to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have a sense of grievance because we ask him questions to try to clarify certain matters, and he feels we are trying to hang speeches on that.  The Minister should have no sense of grievance if we ask him what is the approximate yield of this Resolution.  It is a perfectly normal thing to do and on the occasion of a Financial Resolution it is the ordinary procedure to have that estimate. The Minister is not the Minister for Finance and it is not customary for him to introduce a Resolution of this kind but he is not being trapped <Col N="698" /> or unfairly treated in being asked what this is likely to produce and if we dwell on the fact that it is certain that this will represent an additional charge of £50,000 to £100,000 he is not being trapped into an indiscreet revelation; that is an integral part of what the original statement ought to contain.</P>
    <P>You cannot escape from the fact that existing lorry owners will have to pay £50,000 to £100,000 more than they have paid heretofore and that the bulk of these lorries&mdash;I do not say all of them&mdash;are being operated by relatively small enterprises up and down the country.  I think of all the wholesale grocers, all the mineral water distributors, all the bottlers and all the other categories of people who give employment in every town in Ireland.  When you get up to what we call the 5 to 7-ton lorry, if the addition of cribs raises that lorry into a higher category of tax rate, the additional burden on small business in rural Ireland is very formidable.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems to forget that when you put on an additional charge, somebody has to pay for it.  All I am asking the people here to do is to stop and ask themselves what the consequences of this is going to be. I have seen too many small businesses in rural Ireland pushed over the edge because this little extra charge and that little extra charge have been added on and the owner wakes up, perhaps two or three years too late, to find that he is insolvent.</P>
    <P>I know of instances where a small business man acquired one or two lorries and struggled along with them, only to find at the end of four or five years that the lorries were worn out and he had no funds to replace them.  He had been living on the proceeds of the capital sale of the lorries.  That arises from the accumulation of small charges which are turning his business into an uneconomic proposition.  I want to associate myself with the suggestion of Deputy Norton and I say that the proper way to deal with the situation is to ask the Chief Justice to make a Judge available to deal with the cases stated that await determination and, in the light of that judgment, the Minister <Col N="699" /> can come in here and say that he wants to put on an additional tax on certain categories of lorries and we can then examine that proposal in our minds.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputy Booth, whom I know to be intimately versed in this matter of the assembly and erection of lorries: does he understand the full implications of this Order and what the results are going to be?  I certainly do not but I am prepared to prophesy two things&mdash;firstly, that out of this Order there is going to be as luxuriant a crop of anomalies as the Minister believes himself to be afflicted with at present and, secondly, that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of small businesses giving employment in rural Ireland, and who are operating one, two or three lorries and who honestly believe that the addition of cribs, or creels as Deputy Sweetman calls them, do not constitute an increase in weight on which additional tax could be charged.  The proposed charge will constitute a substantial sum to be borne by the man who has three lorries.  It will amount to £50 a year.  I warn Deputies that there are many businesses in rural Ireland which have not a margin sufficient to enable them to bear such an additional charge.</P>
    <P>We are at present in the process of introducing the system of P.A.Y.E. That will put a fairly substantial charge on the kind of business I am thinking of which provides employment for from 5 to 50 people.  This proposal will put another little burden on them and you can keep at this kind of thing until you reach the point of putting such businesses out of existence.  What appals me is to see the number of these businesses that are going out of existence with a consequent loss of employment.  I have seen in the town in which I live, in the last 20 years, three businesses closed up, putting out of employment about 70 people.  In each case it was a result of the imposition of small charges which they were not in a position to bear.</P>
    <P>I admit that if these businesses had been in the position of being able to <Col N="700" /> call in the services of efficiency experts they might have been able to scrape together enough to pay the additional charges but they were not so circumstanced. They would not be where they were, in the middle of rural Ireland, if they were engaged in that kind of enterprise.  It was much more important to me that they were able to provide a decent livelihood for some of my neighbours and that now that livelihood is no longer available to them.  I do not say that the whole responsibility rests on this House but the imposition of charges of this kind helps them on the way out.  Let the High Court deal with the cases stated and in the light of that decision let us then consider what action is appropriate but let us walk warily before we impose on a small business in rural Ireland substantial additional charges in respect of equipment they already have which they cannot afford to replace, charges which they are not in a position to pay without serious consequences to themselves ultimately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Dillon flatters me when he takes me to be an expert in weighing and taxation matters but I think that this Resolution is being made to appear more difficult than it really is.  I think you can always try to loosen out little phrases here and there in a matter of this kind.  It appears to me that this is purely an effort to deal with the situation where a man taxes a vehicle with a certain type of body and subsequently replaces that body with another or modifies it so as to change the weight substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the ordinary commercial vehicle the basic thing is a flat platform body behind the cab.  In most cases there are spaces left in that framework in which it is possible to put pillars; sideboards can then be added to build up a body.  A reasonably handy man can devise creels or cribs which can be put on to the framework of the lorry and it appears to me that very few people would have a crib or a creel on a lorry unless they propose to use that lorry fairly substantially.  You could always say that if a man uses a creel or a crib once or twice a year, it is unjust to tax him on that.  However, anyone <Col N="701" /> who provides himself with a creel or a crib will use it much more frequently than once or twice a year.  He will use it each year throughout the turf production season or the beet campaign, when shifting either turf or beet.  If he is using it substantially during those periods it is not unreasonable to say his lorry should be taxed on this basis.</P>
    <P>I do not regard this at all as additional taxation in the normal sense of those words.  I regard this as an attempt to deal with two points&mdash;first of all, the manifest confusion between local authorities as to how the law should be interpreted and, secondly, the unfortunate fact that some people are playing ducks and drakes with the regulations.  This is an effort to try to make it at least more difficult, if not impossible, to continue to do that. When reference is made to items such as a receptacle, to my mind that could not be held to include a barrel or two barrels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am trying to be reasonable on this.  Possibly my position on one side of the House prejudices me to some extent.  At the same time, I am trying to be as dispassionate and reasonable as I can.  I cannot imagine anybody would say if a barrel is a receptacle, then a small water can would be a receptacle&mdash; almost anything would be a receptacle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that, but at the same time unless you had the full Bill here before the House on this occasion you could scarcely have done better than the Minister has done.  Surely the point at issue now is that the courts are not prepared or are <Col N="702" /> unable to give an interpretation before the 1st January?  On the 1st January a large number of vehicles will have to be taxed.  This is an effort to make sure they are taxed uniformly and not on a variable scale.  I cannot see that it would be possible for the Minister for Local Government to influence the Chief Justice to have a judge detailed to deal with a certain case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Chief Justice would take kindly to such a suggestion.  Everybody always feels it would be very much to be desired if their case could be decided now or very shortly, so long as they are ready.  Obviously the Minister is ready and everybody else is ready but the courts have not got around to doing it.  To meet that point something had to be done; otherwise there would have been chaos on the 1st January.</P>
      <P>This Financial Resolution is sufficiently clear in itself to deal with the immediate problems arising on the 1st January and I feel that any further elucidation of the matters set out in paragraph 3 could well wait until the Bill is before the House.  But I would assume&mdash;and I hope the Minister will inform me I am right&mdash;that the items that are set out as those to be regarded as an addition would be a body, a part&mdash;I would assume an integral part of the vehicle&mdash;a fitting. The interpretation of a fitting I would much prefer to leave to the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But at the same time, if there is further discussion as to the meaning of this, it can be debated more satisfactorily on the Bill rather than on the Financial Resolution.  I would say that a receptacle clearly is something which is an integral part of the vehicle such as a large water tank or a large liquid tank like a petrol tank or a milk conveyor.</P>

      <P>It depends on whether you are arguing down to the point of absurdity, which I think Deputy Norton is.  You may have a raincoat with a pocket in which you place a parcel to be delivered to somebody. Will Deputy Norton say that this coat must be placed on the lorry before you take it to the taxation authority on the 1st January, Deputy Norton knowing that on the 15th March he is proposing to use that vehicle and the pocket for the conveyance of the parcel to somebody a few miles away? That is reducing the whole thing to absurdity.  That is what Deputy Norton is doing and I am not prepared to argue with him on that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am not.  There is no clarification at all on (5) (a) or (5) (b). Take the ordinary meaning of a receptacle on a lorry as something into which you put something on a lorry. You cannot carry liquid except in a <Col N="704" /> receptacle.  You cannot throw it on the floor.  You have to have a receptacle for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It does admit of a reasonable interpretation.  Anything in writing can be wangled around to some extent if you wish to do so; otherwise lawyers would be out of business.  But a taxation authority will not be in the same mood as Deputy Norton is at the moment.  I believe it is quite sufficiently clear to ensure that so far as possible, human nature being what it is, that there shall be a uniform rate of taxation for people who are prepared to make proper declarations of the form of body which they use.</P>
      <P>At this stage, the Courts are not in a position to give an interpretation, and will not be in such a position, before the 1st January.  The alternative is to let them go on, let the confusion be continued, which I think is an intolerable situation, to such an extent that people who have taxed their vehicles will have to be subsequently chased for more taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anyone pays taxation on foot of this Financial Resolution I think they will do it with a clear mind as to what exactly is involved.  I do not think anybody will be taxed excessively but I think that people who have taken advantage of previous legislation will find that their game is over.  For those <Col N="705" /> people I have no sympathy whatever. I do not think it is hard.  Deputy Norton is unduly worried about the danger of anybody being overtaxed. That is a figment of his imagination which I think he should now forget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect to Deputy Booth, I think his contribution was adequate justification for the remarks of Deputy Dillon. Deputy Booth started by saying he thought he knew what this Resolution meant and as I followed him, in any event, he finished his contribution by agreeing that the Resolution meant something other than appeared in black and white in Section 5 (b). According to Deputy Booth, while Section 5 (b) says something it is simply a figment of Deputy Norton's imagination to think for a moment that Section 5 (b) means what it says, and that such a thing as a barrel for holding water could not be taken as meaning a receptacle.  It seems to me that Deputy Dillon is quite right when he points out the fact that under this Resolution, if it is accepted by the House, it is just going to be as difficult wth regard to interpretation as the provisions that exist at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Norton and other Deputies who have spoken in adopting the attitude that the Government are entitled and, in fact, have a duty to block gaps that exist, but they are going a bit further in this Resolution which, to take the Minister's figure, is imposing £100,000 on the taxpayers of this country.  That taxation, or a great part of it in any event, will be collected from people who have lorries and vehicles of one sort or another on the road, which they purchased in a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> manner, and which they have heretofore taxed in a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> manner.  But, by virtue of Section 5 (b) of this Resolution, if it means what it says, contrary to what Deputy Booth believes, the owners of those vehicles are now to have to contribute anything up to another £100,000 a year in taxation.  I do not <Col N="706" /> think that is dealing fairly with a person who has bought his lorry, and has it on the road under the Code of Financial Resolutions and Road Traffic Acts as existing at present.</P>
    <P>I think this is a most extraordinary measure and a most extraordinary attitude of the Government, where the Minister tells us that certain decisions have been given in the District Court, that it is not possible to get those decided, presumably on case stated, in the High Court before next month and that, on that account, he is bringing in this Resolution to forestall&mdash; because that is what it amounts to&mdash; the decision that the High Court may give.  It is tantamount to telling us in this House that if the High Court is to decide to uphold decisions given by District Justices, the Government in any event would amend the law and that consequently it does not matter a hoot what the High Court decides.</P>
    <P>Viewing it in that light, I must say that I disagree with Deputy Norton and Deputy Dillon as to the value of postponing consideration of this matter until there has been a decision by the High Court.  I think it would be much better that we should be able to discuss it in the atmosphere of a legal question, having been settled firmly by a decision of the High Court, and that the Minister should then come along and say to us that, because of the fact that the Courts of Justice had interpreted the law in a manner which the Government did not intend, he wanted to alter the law.  But, what the Minister is, in fact, doing is telling us that he is going to alter the law and that it does not matter a hoot what the High Court Judges decide about this.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this Resolution which I think has not been sufficiently mentioned.  I want to protest against Section 6 of the Resolution.  I do not know what there is by way of precedent for Section 6 which provides that in the event of proceedings for recovery of a penalty under Section 2 of the Finance Act, the onus will be on the defendant of proving that he comes within the exception specified in Section 5 (b) of this Resolution.  In this House and <Col N="707" /> elsewhere I have previously protested about this.  I am aware that there is legislation which crops up every now and again which throws the onus on the person charged with an offence to prove he comes within an exception and that, if he comes within the exception, he is entitled to be acquitted or to get a dismiss, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I think legislation of that type, which is now being incorporated in Section 6 of this Resolution, runs entirely counter to the fundamental principles of justice which we have operated for some time past.  I am quite well aware, and I do not need to be reminded of the fact, that when one talks about a person being innocent until he is proved guilty one talks normally of questions of criminal charges, but remember, summonses under the various Revenue Acts, or Road Traffic Acts for that matter, are not entirely civil proceedings.  They are in the nature of quasi-criminal proceedings and it seems to me that a defendant in those cases should be entitled to be regarded by the Courts as being innocent unless the State can prove he is guilty.  Now we have the State coming in under Section 6 for this particular offence and saying: &ldquo;You are guilty unless you can prove you are innocent.  All that is necessary is that a Garda, anywhere in the country, should make an allegation against you and, unless you can disprove that, you are liable to be convicted, with all the heavy revenue penalty that is involved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the penalty referred to in this Resolution is treble the duty on the particular vehicle involved.  We have the position that if a Guard alleges against the owner of any vehicle that he has used his lorry, and used a receptacle on his lorry any time in the course of the twelve months in a manner which does not bring him within the exception contained in Section 5 (b), then the unfortunate man who is accused of that is put into the position of going into Court to try to satisfy the Court that he is innocent of the allegation made.  All he can do is give his word in court.  Will that be enough?</P>
    <P>Surely the district justice will be in <Col N="708" /> the position of having to make up his mind on the allegation by the Garda authorities, on the one hand, and the word of the defendant on the other. Possibly no other proof will be before him.  Will a district justice be entitled to say that, because the defendant tells the court that he has not contravened this Financial Resolution, that is sufficient evidence for him to dismiss the allegation?  Will a district justice be in a position to say that the defendant has, in the circumstances, discharged the onus that rests on him under Section 6 of this Resolution?  I do not think he will.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is putting defendants who are brought to court under Section 2 of the Act into an impossible position.  I do not think that is right.  I think this House should object and protest at every opportunity against this whittling down of the rights of the people as against the State.  It is significant that this is definitely in point, as between individuals, on the one hand, and the State on the other, because it is a question of the imposition of a revenue penalty&mdash;I am speaking now from recollection&mdash;of treble the amount of the duty involved.  It would be only ordinary fairplay, and certainly in accordance with our concepts of justice and the principles we have been operating up to this, that in such a case, as in most other cases, if an allegation is made that an offence has been committed, the onus of proving that the allegation is correct and that the offence has been committed rests on the State.  We are now reversing the procedure; the onus of proving innocence will, under this, rest on the person accused of the offence.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Booth may seek to interpret Section 5 (b) in a reasonable manner, the wording of Section 5 (a) and Section 5 (b) is definite and positive.  There does not seem to be any question of being able to modify them by Deputy Booth's sweet reasoning. If the two subsections mean what they say, then Deputy Booth is quite wrong in suggesting to Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman that the fears expressed by them are unfounded.  I believe they are well founded and they <Col N="709" /> are based on the wording of the Resolution which the Minister himself has introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two statements which have been repeated by some speakers.  Since they are based on an entirely wrong concept of what is involved, and lest they should be repeated again, I think it is better for me to intervene now to prevent such repetition and, through it, a possible growing belief that such interpretations are correct.  I explained the position in my speech.  I said that the new definition&mdash;that is the definition in this Financial Resolution&mdash;merely reflects what has been the interpretation given to the existing law by licensing authorities and generally accepted until quite recently.  It was not the subject of court proceedings until as recently as 1958.  In that particular case the court held with the interpretation which had obtained and been operated until then, the interpretation which we merely reiterate in this Financial Resolution.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the other misconception. A number of speakers have stated that in future we will impose an additional £50,000 to £100,000 new taxation on lorry owners.  The fact of the matter is that unless we get this Resolution accepted by the House, together with the subsequent Bill embodying similar provisions, the State is in danger of losing £50,000 to £100,000 to which it is lawfully entitled and which it has been getting in the past under the interpretation which was not questioned until 1958.  It is not a question of adding new taxation. It is merely a question of safeguarding the taxation that should really be coming to our Road Fund.  We are safeguarding what we have.  We are adding nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked: Why not wait for the court's decision?  I think every Deputy will agree that if there is delay &mdash;at this stage awaiting the decision of a higher court would constitute a delay &mdash;the State will lose taxation to which it is entitled.  Surely, then, there is nothing whatever wrong in our coming in here in order to prevent that gap occurring and to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in so far as our tax intake in this <Col N="710" /> regard is concerned.  That is what I am asking the House to do.  There is no question of adding an additional burden of £50,000 or £100,000.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the question of receptacles.  Possibly I am asking for trouble in referring to the matter, but it has been referred to by several speakers on both sides.  Deputy Booth struck the right note, a note that was not struck by any of the other speakers.  He held that in approaching the clause referring to &ldquo;receptacle&rdquo; it is only reasonable and fair that the clause should be read reasonably and not unreasonably.</P>

If the six barrels were lighter than the sideboards and tailboard then, even on Deputy Sweetman's view, he would not be contravening the law, if he were taxed on the weight of the lorry plus the sideboards rather than on the weight of the lorry plus the barrels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I was coming to.  I was about to say that the Deputies had already reduced it to an absurdity and if you wish to make the absurdity more pointed in the manner in which this Resolution is being treated, suppose the lorry was being used for carrying potatoes in sacks.  The sacks might not be taken off.  If we want to be absurd in our approach to this and if we are so foolish, we can fill the sacks when they are on the lorry and empty the sacks before taking them off.  We might then go to the weighbridge and have the sacks weighed with the truck in order to pay our just tax.  That is about as sensible as the approach made to this Resolution.  If the barrels, whether six, four, two or even one, are to be used&mdash; and it is not necessary to use sideboards with one or two barrels&mdash;then I think from my knowledge of the weight of sideboards and barrels that the truck would be covered and that even the most prickly conscience would not be disturbed by feeling that the taxed weight had been exceeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not allege it was not in the Resolution.  I asked the Minister to say what was the position about the man with the barrels of water in his lorry and I understood that, in fact, he would not be contravening the law.  Now, I understand that is because he has tailboards or sideboards on the lorry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that at all.  What I said was that if he is as conscientious a person as is described he need not have on his tailboards or sideboards when carrying the barrels and therefore his lorry weight need not exceed that which was stated.  The approach to the matter has not been a reasonable one.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins went to town, as it were, on the question of placing the onus of proof in connection with Section 6 on the defendant so to speak, to prove his innocence and he says that this is departing from our natural tradition.  He almost makes the House believe that nothing like this ever happened before.  I am sure that nobody, least of all myself, would need to be called on to point out to Deputy O'Higgins as a legal man, the various precedents that can be quoted to refute his allegations.  One of these, which is rather appropriate in a case such as this, is in Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1920.  I am sure all the legal books that Deputy O'Higgins must have read both from choice and necessity have other similar phrases and similar sections in various statutes.  The whole case has been built up as if this was something ungodly and unholy that had never been done before.  That is entirely without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not seeking extra taxation. We want to maintain the situation in which we shall not lose £50,000 or £100,000 in taxation which I feel the Road Fund is legitimately entitled to <Col N="713" /> and which, I need not add, that Fund really needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested this Resolution was not being approached reasonably.  I want to say categorically that it is not a reasonable Resolution.  If it were a reasonable and proper Resolution, none of this discussion would be needed to-day.  The Minister could have dealt quite simply with the matter in relation to Section 5 by making it clear that the section was to cover any things placed on a vehicle which were normally, or usually or constantly&mdash;or some word like that&mdash; used with the vehicle.  Instead, he deliberately brought in a Resolution to cover the case where this thing was used only once in the whole tax year. That is not a reasonable approach. The Minister has made it clear beyond question now that if something is placed in a vehicle and things are loaded into it and unloaded out of it, whatever it is&mdash;water barrels or anything else&mdash;that puts the lorry on a higher rate of tax unless you adopt the device of taking off the tailboard or sideboards.  That is a most improper method by which to come to the House with a Financial Resolution. What I have said is just what the Minister said a minute ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most improper to ask the House to legislate on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will recollect that just when he had finished his speech I asked him to clarify &ldquo;receptacle&rdquo; in relation to the water-barrel argument of Deputy Sweetman.  That was done for the purpose of avoiding all the subsequent speeches on the receptacle which arose because nobody knew what was in the Minister's mind and in fact most people found it difficult to interpret Section 5 (a) and (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) is clear enough and (b) seems to me to be a rather infirm way, from a drafting point of view, of explaining the manner in which (a) can be construed. <Col N="714" /> In any case the position is now clear.  It is clear that water barrels placed on a vehicle, which is loaded up to its full weight for taxation purposes, represent an addition to the weight and unless we take off something else the water barrels can bring you overweight.</P>
    <P>I use the water-barrel argument as indicating a case where a man might in very special circumstances desire to use his lorry for a purpose for which no other vehicle could, in fact, be used.  I do not mind if you say that the barrel contains water.  It takes him over the authorised limit but I think you would be much better if you permitted him to use the lorry frankly for conveying water in exceptional circumstances provided he got permission to do so from the local Garda Sergeant or Superintendent. One does not run out of water suddenly and if an emergency arose I would prefer to say to the man frankly: &ldquo;If you do that, you are breaking the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You could say that, because it is an exceptional circumstance or an emergency, you would provide a remedy and allow him temporarily to break the law or absolve him from breaking the law by getting him permission from a local Garda officer. That would mean that the person could not dodge in any circumstances. If he put on the barrel and pleaded that it was for hauling water, well and good, he was breaking the law unless he could produce evidence from the local Garda to the effect that the barrel was really being used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has clarified the thing in a way which I do not think indicates legislative tidiness.  It now means you can put on the barrel and take off the sideboards without breaking the law.  If you leave the vehicle as it is and put on the barrel, then you break the law.  Nobody wants to make a man break the law merely because he uses a barrel one or two days in a period of twelve months when, in fact, by drafting the Resolution in a different way you could get the desired effect. <Col N="715" /> So far as closing the financial gap is concerned, I am strongly in favour of it.  I made that perfectly clear.  I am only wondering whether, if the Parliamentary Draftsman has another look at this in the light of the discussion, he could not get something better which would avoid having to tailor the lorry any time the man wants to use it for a special purpose, perhaps once in twelve months. Human ingenuity is at a low ebb if we cannot do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the gauge by which it is to be measured, I agree that it is at a low ebb but I am not prepared to agree that it is a fair way to put the case and to arrive at that conclusion.  The Deputy says that he was asking questions before this debate took place in order to find out what was in the Minister's mind.  It is very strange that the one thing that could possibly be picked on, that was not in the Minister's mind and had no place in the Minister's mind, is this thing about barrels taking water occasionally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the taxing statutes as a whole, they are, as I think Deputy Sweetman and other legal gentlemen in the House will agree, construed very strictly against the State.  Is not that an accepted situation?  That being so, does anyone seriously contend that, in the case of a drought or some such emergency, if a person who requires water has to <Col N="716" /> bring it by barrel or any other available container, on an emergency occasion, any Garda will bring that person into court and get a conviction against him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take Deputy Sweetman's suggested alternative in so far as clause 5 would be concerned. He mentioned the phrase, &ldquo;anything placed on or normally used, constantly, usually, used on a vehicle&rdquo;.  Those are exactly the type of words that have given rise to all the trouble we are now trying to remedy and redefine and Deputy Sweetman must know that. It is not a situation that is easily resolved.</P>
      <P>If we want to read it reasonably and approach it in that manner and in the light of the manner in which taxing statutes are construed strictly against the State, then the likelihood of any of these cases being brought to court is most distant and that such a case would succeed in court is beyond even Deputy Norton's imagination.</P>

Once a month, he places his horse box on the lorry.  Up to this that was not taken in the weight of the lorry.  What is the position now?  Will the person have to weigh the horse box with the lorry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the man and the horse, I presume.  If he was not taxed in the past, he should have been taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not been taxed in the past.  The horse box has been put on the lorry, with no tax.  He has a merchandise licence.  If, in future, the unladen weight is increased and if he is applying to the Department, he <Col N="717" /> will not be allowed to get a merchandise licence for the lorry at the new weight.  He is only entitled to a merchandise licence at a particular weight. If he now has to weigh the horse box on the lorry, his unladen weight will be increased and he will not be entitled to a merchandise licence even if he uses the horse box only for his own use and not for hire.  This man is a licensed haulier earning his livelihood by this lorry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put it this way; he is a licensed haulier and is paid for carting the horse.  That may be only once, when there is a race meeting convenient to him.  At other times he is drawing pigs, beet or anything else.  He removes the horse box completely, and has a normal lorry.  If in future, that horse box is to be taken as part of the unladen weight, he will not be able to get a licence for his present lorry.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this Bill before the adjournment last week I was referring to the position of the six day licensee.  Under the Bill if it becomes law as it stands, the six day licensee will have to face intensive competition and is also likely to lose the customers he has at present because of the extension of the Sunday opening. The Taoiseach, when he spoke in this debate, told us that the Minister would bring in proposals.  I can only hope that these proposals will be helpful. We have been told that uniformity is one of the great principles of the Bill and there should be uniformity as between six and seven day licences.</P>
      <P>I also referred last week to week-day closing and to Sunday opening in the early afternoon.  What I said was misquoted in one of the daily newspapers but I was accurately recorded in the reports of this House.  My conviction was that one and a half hours were ample time in the afternoon and that the opening hours should be from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. I have not been approached by anybody in connection with this Bill but during the week-end I made it my business to talk to people who are consumers in a moderate way. They were all of the conviction that the present hours of week-day opening were quite sufficient.  I thought myself that 11 p.m. should have been the latest time for opening on week-days.  I make that comment now, in the hope that when amendments are being brought into the Bill they will be amendments to meet that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency in modern life for entertainment and amusement to be <Col N="722" /> prolonged late into the night.  If we pass a Bill for later opening of licensed premises, we shall add considerably to that tendency.  Efficiency is injured and impaired by late hours and it would be a bad thing for us in this country if we were to extend that tendency which is already so marked.  From my own knowledge I am aware that there is gross abuse of the licensing laws in the case of dances in licensed premises and in clubs where there is a licence for the sale of drink.  I do not know how the Minister can effect control over these places but it is a matter which we should look into now.  It is a difficult matter but there must be some way of preventing abuses of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he was speaking, talked about getting public opinion behind this Bill.  I think that the traders themselves should be of one mind on this matter and that, in their own interest, they should pursue a uniform policy.  Anybody wanting a drink in this country under the existing laws can get it at the present time in a great many places.  I hope that that will not be the case in future and if we could get the traders themselves into that frame of mind it would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>Another way would be to prove to the country that there is realism behind this Bill and, to do that, it should be left to a free vote of the House.  I must express my profound disapproval that in a matter of this kind, affecting our social life, we should put on the Party Whips.  In many places to-day politicians are looked upon as one of the evils of modern life.  I should not like that we should deserve such an appellation in this country but, when men are forced to go into the Lobbies and vote against their own judgment and their own convictions, we cannot help it if we get that description from the people.  In a case like this, if we are at all sincere about it, the matter should be left to a free vote of the House.  What is the Government afraid of?  During this long discussion there has been almost perfect unanimity about the main principles of the Bill and any amendments put forward can only concern the details of the Bill. If the measure is defeated I do not <Col N="723" /> see why it should make any difference to the Government.  Such a defeat should not bring about a general election or the downfall of the Government. We should be generous enough to make that gesture in this instance and leave this Bill to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>Any Bill introduced in this House on the subject of licensing legislation in my experience, extending over thirty years in the House, has produced very deep cleavages of opinion, has shown marked divergencies of view and sometimes has produced pretty contentious legislation. I remember in 1926 or 1927 the Intoxicating Liquor Bill produced quite considerable demonstrations of anger and heat both inside and outside the House.  With the effluxion of time, the battle has become less strenuous but even the discussion on this Bill has revealed certain definite cleavages of opinion as to the best method of tackling the problem.  That there is a problem to be tackled I do not think anybody will question.  Our legislation in some respects is out of date. The circumstances of our times have changed rapidly with the result that some aspects of our social legislation are not only outdated but indeed do violence to intelligent thinking as to what should constitute intelligent licensing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>bona fide</i> trade is an outstanding example of that.  It originated in the days when there were no motor cars and no bicycles.  It assumed a weary traveller on foot, or on some horse not renowned for speed, passing through the country in the course of his business and stopping at a wayside inn to have a drink.  But even then the underlying law said he was to be in the course of his travels and moving on.  But of course in recent years with the advent of the motor car and the motor cycle the problem of the <i>bona fide</i> trade has undergone a complete change.  Nowadays people decide where is the nearest <i>bona fide</i> house.  They can usually get to one within three or five minutes in fast cars which are used at night on relatively clear roads.  They do not intend to go <Col N="724" /> on but deliberately intend to go there, have a drink and, unlike the wayfarer of old, they have no other business. When they have consumed sufficient or when closing time arrives they just reverse the car and go back to the spot from which they started.</P>
    <P>In fact, the <i>bona fide</i> trade is carried on for those who have the privilege of spending a late night provided they live either three or five miles from the public house which they select for their custom on that occasion.  <i>Bona fide</i> trade and the use of the term has no meaning in connection with the houses undertaking that kind of business. As I said, these houses are now used for the venturesome and the thirsty, in order to quench their thirst in the speediest possible time and they have no significance either in our social life or licensing regulations.  I do not blame the people who run these houses. By and large, they are an estimable collection of people, and I have no complaint whatever about them.  I think they have a pretty tough job trying to handle people, many of whom arrive at these places having given some of their custom elsewhere before they arrive.  I imagine it is just that curious cupidity in human beings that induces many people to go to those places late at night when, on reflection next morning, they would probably decide it would have been much better if they had gone home and not gone for this near midnight drive to the local <i>bona fide</i> house.</P>
    <P>The owners of these houses cannot in any way be reprimanded for the business they have carried on.  It has been a legal business.  So far as one can see, the houses have been kept in very good condition.  In fact, very substantial sums of money have been spent in improving the amenities in these houses in order to make them more attractive to those who are likely to be customers.  Therefore, if we are thinking of abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> business, it ought not to be done merely because a feeling of derogation has enveloped the owners.  The case for the abolition is not because of the status of the owners, which I think is unquestioned and is high, but because the type of trade carried on no longer has any real meaning, especially in <Col N="725" /> relation to the circumstances under which that type of trade was originally devised.  Therefore, I think that there would be general agreement with the viewpoint that in the circumstances of today there is no longer need to maintain this <i>bona fide</i> trade or the special privileges associated with it.  I think that the problem can be dealt with otherwise and the Bill does that in a certain manner, to which I shall make reference later.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Sunday opening. I am rather afraid that there was a lot of loose thinking when the hours of Sunday opening, 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 in the winter and 5 to 9 in the summer, were decided on.  Dublin city is one example.  It is undesirable that you should have licensed premises open while religious services are in progress. That ought to be avoided if at all possible.  But, if you open public houses in Dublin, or in the country for that matter, from 1 to 3 o'clock, there is a fair chance, a pretty good chance, that a number of folk will go into these public houses at 1 o'clock and not come out until 3 o'clock.  I think that is a fair assumption.</P>
    <P>Is that a thought that appeals to the members of this House?  Is that something that is desirable, or something we ought to combat?  After all, the desire of a man who goes into a public house, to spend the hours between 1 and 3 o'clock in it on a Sunday, should be surely to get his lunch but, if he goes into the public house because the argument there is attractive, the beverage is attractive and the company magnetic, what happens his wife and children?  His lunch has to be kept for him.  If he does not come in until 3.30 p.m. it is destroyed, and his wife and children are frustrated in what they intended to do on Sunday evening.  If he has spent two hours in a public house and then eats his dinner, that gentleman's inclination is to go to bed for the evening and not take out his wife and children. I say that that is a fair probability and I ask is that something to be encouraged?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Sunday opening hours, which are calculated to play so much havoc with the domestic arrangements of the <Col N="726" /> family, are something we ought not to encourage in this House and, if I have to choose between giving a man facilities for drinking between 1 and 3 o'clock on a Sunday, and trying to help his wife and children to get their meal over so that the domestic arrangements may run to a reasonable schedule, I am on the side of the wife and children because I do not think the man who spends two hours in a public house on a Sunday is the best person to do the reasoning.  I think the wife who wants him home for lunch about 1.30 p.m. is nearer the target of intelligence than the fellow who stays in a public house from 1.30 p.m. until 2 p.m., and forgets how to count after 2 o'clock.  Therefore, I think what we ought to do is shorten the opening hours on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I think that an opening of one hour on Sunday from 12.30 to 1.30 p.m. is enough.  Sunday is not the last day of the human race.  The man who wants a drink on Sunday has had an opportunity of drinking until 10.30 p.m. on Saturday night, and again has the opportunity for drinking on Sunday evening, and for the whole of the following week.  I think an hour's opening is sufficient, though I do not believe I would object violently if it were extended from 12.30 to 2 p.m., though I prefer 12.30 to 1.30 p.m. as calculated to get a husband home to his lunch in good time to take his wife and children out, or to participate in the normal routine of an Irish family on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The proposed evening hours are from 5 to 8 p.m. in the winter, and from 5 to 9 p.m. in the summer.  That means that in winter time you will have a five hours' opening for drinking on Sundays and in the summer time six hours' opening.  Remember this is the day when the ordinary man is free and he has these six hours to drink, or five as the case may be, and it is the time of the week when he has some money in his pocket.  Does the House think it desirable to provide six hours' drinking facilities on a Sunday for a person who has some money, which will disappear very quickly, if the opportunity is provided over the week-end festivity?  He has <Col N="727" /> longer for drinking on a Sunday than he has on a weekday because on weekdays he will be working until 6 o'clock; he will get home between 6.30 and 7 p.m., have a meal, and from 7.30 to 10 o'clock is free to do his drinking.  On Sunday, with no work to do and no restraint on him to earn his living, he will have five or six hours' drinking if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>I think the Sunday opening hours from 5 to 9 p.m. are bad because if a person travels some distance to have a drink between 1.30 and 3 o'clock he may leave the public house about ten past three, join in a discussion outside, waste the time until 4 o'clock, and then say that it is not worth while going home and having to come back again for the night session.  Very likely he will hang about, discussing any matter that passes the time until 5 o'clock, and he is likely to go back again for the night session from 5 to 8, or from 5 to 9 o'clock.</P>
    <P>Imagine the impact on a household when the husband and breadwinner is being afforded these facilities while the wife and children know he is free only on Sunday to share their company and take them away for some little relaxation.  I think therefore it is a mistake to have opening from 1 to 3 o'clock.  The most I would argue for is an hour from 12.30 to 1.30, perhaps to 2 o'clock, though I would prefer 12.30 to 1.30 p.m.  I say that the three or four hours' drinking sessions on Sunday evenings cannot be defended, unless it is claimed that the wife and children of the fellow who has a few pounds or a few shillings at the week-end do not count.  To contemplate Sunday opening of five to six hours in 1959 is against all prudence and all modern thought. The Minister should examine this matter again.</P>
    <P>I should like to cater for the fellow who travels to a football match which finishes at 5 o'clock, so that he might get a drink before he goes home, but frankly I would give him a short session to make sure he does go home.  Apart from that, I think it would be good enough if you did not <Col N="728" /> open the public house until 8 o'clock on Sunday evening, until perhaps 9.30 or 10 o'clock at the very most.  Five o'clock to 9 o'clock is far too long and I think the Minister should reexamine this question.  We are providing facilities which are not wanted and for which there is no real demand.</P>
    <P>On the question of Sunday opening, I have always felt that the man in the country had as much right to certain facilities under the licensing code as the man in Dublin.  Up to now the man in the country has been treated as a second-class citizen and, though this Bill provides some remedies, I think the remedies are far too liberal. Nevertheless, I do believe that the man in the country is entitled to Sunday opening but with hours in which prudence is much more evident than in the hours suggested by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The present position regarding Sunday opening in rural areas is, of course, a vicious business.  I know that in my own constituency on a Sunday people walk or cycle three or five miles to the next stop, to get a drink where they are <i>bona fide</i>, and on their way they pass people from the next town coming to the one they have left in order to get a drink.  Does anybody know anything more crazy than that?  The present position is absurd. I believe there should be Sunday opening in the country so that the man in the country will be treated equally and in no way more unfairly than the man who lives in one of the four boroughs which have Sunday facilities.</P>
    <P>I turn now to week-day opening. The present opening hours are from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in winter and from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. in summer. This Bill proposes to have winter opening from 10.30 a.m. to 11 p.m. and from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. in summer.  I should like to know who is asking for these opening hours.  I live in this city.  I move around the country to a very considerable extent. I have never been asked by anybody to sympathise with him on the injustice of the present opening and closing hours.  I know of nobody who has demanded these proposed new hours. <Col N="729" /> I see statements in the Press from the trade unions opposing it.  I get circular letters from the licensed traders saying they are opposed to it.  I know of nobody who wants to have a publichouse open until 11.30 p.m. in order to satisfy his appalling thirst.</P>
    <P>Has any responsible body asked for this opening until 10.30 and 11.30 p.m.?  If so, they ought to be identified.  I have met no single person who has asked for this late opening. I do not know of any organisation which has asked for it.  If people have asked for it, then they ought to be pushed out into the open so that the public may know who it is that asks for an opening until 11.30 p.m.  I know this is a recommendation of the Commission.  I think the Commission did not know what they were doing when they suggested an opening until 11.30 p.m.  In this city, transport closes down round about 11 o'clock at night.  It is proposed in this to keep publichouses open until 11.30 p.m.  I do not know what purpose will be served except that everybody will consume the maximum amount of liquor. Is it seriously suggested that anybody in this city or in the rural areas cannot have his normal liquor needs satisfied by 10.30 p.m. or 10 p.m. at night?</P>
    <P>The only argument in its favour that I have heard is the suggestion that late opening will attract tourists.  Anybody who offers that argument is presuming on the stupidity of those to whom he advances it.  Has anybody ever set out for a holiday abroad and, before departing, looked up the licensing laws of the country he proposed to visit to find out until what hour he could drink at night?  The argument is absurd. People do not visit a country for the purpose of drinking or for the purpose of being able to stay in a licensed premises as late as they like at night. Other considerations influence the tourist.  So far as the tourist is concerned, he will enjoy his holiday better if he consumes whatever he needs about 10 p.m. and retires early so that he can resume his spirituous activities the following morning, if he feels so inclined.</P>
    <P>I know of no case to support an 11.30 p.m. closing.  If there is any case <Col N="730" /> it is a case perhaps for a slightly later closing hour in certain rural areas where men work on the bogs so long as daylight lasts.  Very often they are a long distance in from the main road and, if they have been saving turf up to 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock on a summer's evening, it is not unreasonable that they should get a drink at 10.30, 10.45 or even 11 o'clock.  Where, however, people live in areas surrounded by publichouses I see no case whatever for an extension of the opening hours.  Any increase in the hours will only make serious inroads on the normal family routine.  It is not desirable that people should leave publichouses at half-eleven at night.  That will not promote domestic happiness.  It is not desirable that such people should be turned out into the street at 11.30 at night to make their way home any way they can, particularly in a city like this where the night traffic is not at times of the most edifying character.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister ought to have second thoughts about late week-day opening.  I see no reason for it in the city or in the larger towns.  The only argument I can find in its favour is in the case of the man who works late on the bog and who might naturally like a drink before he retires.  He is the only person who excites my sympathy in this matter.  The man who finishes work at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock can get a drink until 10 o'clock; there is no case whatever for him.</P>
    <P>I regard this Bill as similar in character to the curate's egg&mdash;good in parts, and bad in parts.  It is good in so far as it eliminates the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  It is good from the standpoint that it brings urban and rural areas into alignment.  It is bad from the point of view of Sunday opening hours, which are far too generous and are unwanted by the prudent.  There is no case for later opening on week nights. The Bill should be substantially amended.  Because of the virtue in portions of the Bill, I propose to vote for it, with the reservation that I shall vote for amendments on the Committee Stage which underline my outlook.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this very important piece of legislation.  When the Bill was <Col N="731" /> first introduced I shuddered at the thought of thousands of publichouses in the city of Dublin open until 11.30 p.m.  I had a vision of hundreds of men who would normally have left these places at 10.30 p.m., comparatively sober, staggering home at midnight with disastrous consequences for themselves and their families.  On more mature consideration, however, and having listened to the various arguments put forward on both sides of the House, I now see that my fears were more or less groundless.  To my mind, the inveterate drunkard will remain a drunkard irrespective of whether publichouses close at 10 p.m., or not at all.  Equally, the temperate man, the moderate drinker, will remain moderate and temperate no matter how late publichouses remain open.  I would not suggest that we should leave them open all night.  There are men, not particularly fond of drinking, who sometimes find it difficult to leave congenial company. For them, a closing hour is very essential.</P>
      <P>Although I am a Pioneer, I am acquainted with the inside of a good many bars and lounges in the city.  It is obvious that a new type of drinker is evolving.  The modern publican is not solely concerned with dispensing drink.  He is looking more to the comfort of his customers.  He is providing brightly lit and attractive surroundings in which men and women can gather and spend a pleasant hour, or two.  In his travels through Ireland, H.V. Morton found the Irish pub little more than a squalid drinking shop.  We are getting away from that now and, in Dublin anyway, we are approaching nearer what, to my mind, is the ideal set by the traditional English country inn, where drinking is not a vice but a pleasant social activity, the effects of which are anything but evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can discount the criticism that every Irishman who drinks is a drunkard.  If we were to take the figures, I am sure we would find that an Irishman is as temperate as any man in the world.  The Bill has been criticised on the grounds that there is no public demand for extended hours. I think such a criticism is hardly valid. <Col N="732" /> A Government which decides to await public clamour before introducing legislation would very quickly find itself in difficulties.  I believe it is the duty of a Government to recognise the country's needs so that it can meet those needs.  If there are anomalies in existing laws it is surely the Government's business to rectify that.  The anomaly with which we are concerned and which is the source of evil and scandal is the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  That is recognised by all responsible persons and the Bill seeks to abolish that with the least possible hardship to all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one point in the Bill which could cause great concern to the Church authorities&mdash;the Sunday closing hour.  I do not think that hour should be fixed at 9 p.m.  I think that 8 o'clock is the usual hour for Church ceremonies to commence and the State should be prepared to give the small concession involved to the religion which the majority profess.  It is impossible to get complete agreement on a measure such as this because of customs and prejudices which have been built up.  To my mind such agreement would be impossible but the hours of trading mentioned in the Bill are at least worth a trial.  If it is found that they are a cause of scandal or open to abuse, they can be changed.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of the Bill&mdash;and it cannot be too often stressed&mdash;is that it replaces a law which had been treated with utter contempt and I think there is hope that this new legislation will have the full weight of public opinion behind it.  It is essential that the public recognise the necessity for rigid enforcement of the law envisaged in the Bill and only in this way will the Bill bestow any benefits, social or moral.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am supporting the Bill I feel obliged to give some reasons for doing so.  For some years past the Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte have expended vast sums of money to attract visitors to this country and they have done a very fine job.  Take the case of any member of the House who finds himself obliged to entertain some of those <Col N="733" /> visitors.  For an evening, possibly, he suggests the Abbey Theatre and, after a couple of hours of pleasant entertainment, they come out at 10.20 or 10.30 p.m.  Someone suggests &ldquo;a bite to eat&rdquo; and it is not always convenient to bring such visitors home with us.  It may be inconvenient and we decide to go to one of our very fine restaurants for a meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They close very early also, except in a few cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a fair experience of both licensed premises and restaurants, I can assure the Deputy. At 10.30 or later, while visitors may have the best of our food they cannot have a bottle of wine.  The licensed premises are shut.  Surely no one will suggest&mdash;although Deputy Norton has so stated&mdash;that when we go abroad as tourists or visitors to the Continent or elsewhere we retire at 11 o'clock?</P>
      <P>I approached the Minister for an extension of hours during 1957 as Chairman of the Tostal Committee at the request of many owners of those restaurants and I was advised of this legislation.  Despite the point that the additional hours may bring about greater consumption of liquor or affect the particular individual to whom Deputy Norton referred at great length, I do not believe that if a person does not want to take more drink than he should take, the fact that the premises are open will have any effect on him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton makes the case for those outside the Four Courts; I intend to confine my remarks to Dublin but I have a vast knowledge of rural Ireland and every county in it.  On a Sunday night not very long ago I remember going down a dark street&mdash;it would suffice for a blackout during the war years&mdash;and entering a licensed premises.  There were so many people there that I wondered if there was anyone who could not get a drink.  Admittedly, they were transgressing the law but we must also remember that some of them, when lucky enough to get in may be afraid to come out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that from 12.30 to 1.30 or 2 o'clock on <Col N="734" /> Sundays would be more advantageous from the domestic point of view.  I disagree with Deputy Cummins that religious services take place at 8 o'clock.  So far as I know they take place in this diocese at 7.30 and I believe that is also the hour in most other places in order to allow cinemas and other entertainments to carry on. I think the same thing applies in the country except that in a few places film shows are delayed until 9 o'clock. The abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade has been approved, not merely because of those who come and go but also because of the selling of liquor for consumption off the premises at the latest hour.  If there is a complaint regarding the 11.30 closing I can see it only from the point of view of those engaged in the licensed trade, the assistant who has to find his way home at that late hour, but I hope, relying on the efficiency of C.I.E., that some arrangement will be made to get over that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think it is many years overdue and I firmly believe that were it not for the tact and discretion exercised by the Gardaí regarding breaches of the licensing laws, instead of giving increases to the judges we would have to increase the number of judges.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate but, as so much has been said and so many views have been expressed, it would appear that it is incumbent upon those of us who have responsibility to express our views on what is clearly a very controversial and difficult subject.  May I, at the outset, say that, notwithstanding all the comments that have been made about the Commission, they are to be thanked for a very good job?  They presented a Report which clearly showed that they gave the matter considerable attention and that their recommendations were based on the evidence submitted to them.  Whether we agree with the recommendations or not is a question which does not arise.  We must thank the Commission, and I do thank them for their energy and for the excellence of the Report.  I do not <Col N="735" /> agree with many of their conclusions but that is their business and I am entitled, as well as everybody else, to my opinion.</P>
      <P>There is one comment I should like to make in reference to the Commission. Everybody who was in favour of extending the licensed hours&mdash; traders and others&mdash;was represented before the Commission by counsel and solicitor.  The ordinary people who have no great interest in the matter other than the common good, such as the Total Abstinence Society and others, were not represented by counsel or other legal advisers.  Therefore, the evidence was weighted in favour of the interested persons and the Commission, therefore, were biassed by the weight of evidence given by the vocal interests on whose behalf evidence was submitted.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Corry say here that the Pioneers' representatives signed the Majority Report as if their signatures committed all the Pioneers and as if it was something to be sneered at.  I do not think that was a reasonable line to take.  I presume that the Pioneers' representatives on the Commission came to a decision, as they said, on the evidence before them.  Whether you agree or disagree with their view, is an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how good the Commission were, the responsibility for what we are doing to-day is not theirs.  It is that of the Government and the Dáil. The Government are primarily responsible for the proposals now before the House and it is they who are taking the responsibility.  The Taoiseach has gone as far as to say that he proposes to keep on the Whips. Therefore, they are adopting the proposals as Government proposals and putting their reputation and the Parliamentary life of the Government at stake.  The Government are making this a matter of confidence once they put on the Whips although members on every side of the House know that this is a Bill which should not be subject to the Whips and in respect of which every Deputy should decide the matter according to his conscience and the wishes of his constituents in so far as they are in keeping <Col N="736" /> with the moral law and do not violate his conscience.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, open my remarks by appealing to the Government&mdash;and I do not often appeal to them&mdash;to reconsider this matter of the Whips very positively.  I ask them to approach the matter in an open, reasonable way, accepting, as I do, that each side of the House wants to do what is best for every section of the community, the licensed trade, the public, who are consumers or customers.  I was often a customer myself and know all about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are Deputies on the other side of the House who, I believe, if there was a free vote, would vote differently from the way the Government ask them to vote.  I am perfectly satisfied that that is the case.  The Minister may decide to have a free vote.  If he does, he will be going a long distance towards getting something in this House which could result in there being respect for the law and in enforcement of the law, something I am afraid we would not otherwise get.</P>
      <P>It has been well said that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, as we know it, has been abused.  I subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Norton a moment ago that the <i>bona fide</i> trade is no longer what it was intended to be.  When the <i>bona fide</i> trade was established, the law was that a traveller could stop at a public house and not only seek but demand entrance and get a meal, if he so needed, as well as a drink because he was legitimately going to and coming from some place of business.  It still obtains in some places that a meal can be had at these inns or other places that keep open to cater for this trade but everybody knows that there are many people who travel that far and no further.  That, of course, is non-observance of the law.  I do not know if the man on the door still asks the person who seeks admission: &ldquo;Where are you going; where are you coming from; or where did you sleep last night?&rdquo;  Apparently all he is asked is: &ldquo;How far have you come?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather difficult matter to deal with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  It appears that everybody on the Commission was in favour of its abolition but I fear that its complete abolition will <Col N="738" /> beget other abuses.  I do not know how it will be dealt with and I am not in a position to make a recommendation on it.</P>
    <P>On the question of hours, with which Deputy Norton properly dealt, the hours proposed in the Bill are unreasonable, but the Government have signified their intention to be reasonable in accepting amendments on this question.  There is no doubt that the proposed period at midday on Sunday is far too long.  In my opinion, the old custom of Sunday closing in the rural areas should be observed.  I do not think we should open either on Sunday or on St. Patrick's Day.  I am satisfied it is not in the best interests of the country to do so.  Who are the people who want it?  Deputy Corry told us he required it because he wished to hold a meeting in a room upstairs in a public house.  I do not think that is a valid reason why there should be Sunday opening.  Anyhow there is that tradition of Sunday closing.  Many people have expressed the view that it should not be departed from except for very grave causes and I do not think sufficiently grave causes exist to permit general Sunday opening to take place between the hours proposed.  On the Committee Stage I shall have something to say on that.</P>
    <P>When I was a youngster and in middle age and fairly well on to the present day, any unnecessary servile work on Sunday that extended over two hours was a grave matter.  There is not a country Deputy listening to me who does not know well that unless the weather is bad the saving of a crop on Sunday should not be undertaken. We got permission, if the weather was very bad, to work for two or three hours on Sunday.  Yet in this Bill we are legislating to put the shopkeeper, his wife and family and his employees to work for six or seven hours on Sunday. After two hours, it was considered a grave matter but it will not be a grave matter for the licensing trade to work for seven hours.  We are going to change the moral code by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can discuss the merits or demerits of the various poteen makers' activities. However, legislation will not make that right because it is a very serious menace.  Who made it or how it was glorified in song or in story does not make the position any better.</P>
      <P>The Government should carefully reconsider the whole question of Sunday opening.  I agree with Deputy Norton that if Sunday opening must take place, the midday opening should be only for one hour so that a man can go home to his wife and family. If the Sunday opening takes place from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m., it will be 3.30 p.m. before they are out.  They will stand outside for a while instead of going home.  The next opening is at 5 p.m.; an hour and a half will not be long slipping by and people may get in to warm themselves in between and there will be breaches of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we must have Sunday opening&mdash; and I am only accepting this as the lesser of two evils&mdash;it should be from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. and from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m.  There is a difficulty about sports fixtures such as football matches, and so on.  I suggest that in those cases the publican should make an application to the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána to obtain an exemption order so that he can open for the event.  Instead of the publican being put to the trouble of going into court, this simple procedure could be adopted and in that way you would cater for the needs of the people. <Col N="740" /> I am satisfied that if this Bill is passed the six-day licensed trader will be extinguished.  If there is Sunday opening and he may not open on Sunday at any time, he is put completely through the ropes.  I suggest that as there are only over 1,000 of them all over the country&mdash;we got the returns of various counties to-day&mdash;the Government should give the six-day publicans the same facilities as the seven-day licensees on paying the additional licence fee or perhaps more if you like.  On payment of the additional fee they would have the same facilities as everyone else and then the law of supply and demand would extinguish those who did not look after their business.  They would fade out. If the six day licence man improves his place of business and if the other man continues to carry on business in an undecorated and unvarnished place he will go under.</P>
    <P>On the question of measures and the stamping of bottles, I think that the proposal to have them unstamped is unreasonable.  It means that anybody who wants to sell short measure can use smaller bottles.  It is bad enough to have to pay the price that has to be paid at the moment without getting less for what is paid. There should be no change in the law in that respect.</P>
    <P>Whether Sunday opening comes or not, I think that Deputies should have read the debate that took place when the Bill for closing on St. Patrick's Day was going through the House.  If they did so, they would vote for the retention of the present position as regards St. Patrick's Day, Good Friday and Christmas Day.  It may be argued that it is a reflection on us that we have to be restricted on that day more than on any other, but everybody knows that some people, when they get a few drinks, are such that their patriotism will outweigh their discretion and they become very vocal.  It is just as well to leave the thing as it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cummins said if we are not satisfied with the operation of these proposals we can alter the law. Everybody knows how hard is to do that and we can all see how difficult it is to alter the law at the present <Col N="741" /> time.  The Government should carefully reconsider this whole matter, keeping in mind the views expressed by very important people in this country, of all shades of opinion, on this question.  If the Government insist on putting on the Whips and forcing this matter through as a Government measure they will be doing something that will react upon them and upon the country.  They should carefully reconsider the matter and then let each Deputy stand upon his own responsibilities so that no Deputy will be in a position to say: &ldquo;My Party decided to do so and so.  I could not vote against the Government, I could not let my Party down&rdquo;.  Neither should any Opposition Deputy be in the position to say that he had to obey the Party Whip.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that I cannot see how Deputy Norton, having said so much against the Bill, can now propose to vote for it.  He was trenchant and clear in showing up its faults and failings and then he says that he is going to vote for it, reserving the right in committee to vote against certain aspects of it although he knows that it is doubtful, once the principle of the Bill is accepted, if the Chair will allow him to move certain amendments.  Remember that the principle of the Bill is two-fold&mdash;the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade and the opening of public houses on Sunday.  These are the two main principles of the Bill and I doubt if it would be in order, once the Second Reading is passed, to change the principles.  You are going to come up against a very difficult position in that regard.  It will be quite relevant for the Minister to say: &ldquo;These are the principles of the Bill and you voted for them.  Why are you now voting against them?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last three weeks I have listened to the debate on this Bill; what I missed of it I have read in the reports.  I start off by appealing to the Minister and the Taoiseach to have a free vote on this Bill.  There are many good things in it against which I would find it very hard to vote.  There are some other things in it against which I must vote and therefore I appeal for a free vote. <Col N="742" /> There is nothing political in the Bill in any way and it will win no votes for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other Party, no matter what the final decision is.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate of the last three weeks, one would imagine that the man who took a drink was a criminal.  I do not think so at all.  To listen to some Deputies who do not come from rural Ireland one would imagine that everybody in rural Ireland wants to disobey the law. Such is the view of Deputy Larkin of the Labour Party but such is not the case.  One would imagine from him that if you go down O'Connell St. at eleven or twelve o'clock at night you will find everybody lying by the wayside blind drunk.  I have gone through the city streets at that time and I have not seen that.  One would imagine that if one went down the streets of Galway the same thing would apply.  Such is not the case at all.  A foreigner in the public gallery listening to Deputies might be inclined to think we are a crowd of cannibals. Such is not the case at all.  So far as our people are concerned, both in the rural areas and in the cities, they have no cannibalistic impulses at all. Therefore, I would ask Deputies to lift the debate on this Bill above that low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister to have a free vote on this Bill and I do so for many reasons.  I think the Fianna Fáil Deputies are the greatest hypocrites the world ever produced.  They all have congratulated the Minister on bringing in a Bill which we all know was necessary. The Minister brought in the Bill as a result of a report of a commission which was set up.  May I pay tribute to that commission?  They did good work and they submitted their report. Everybody knew a change in the licensing laws was necessary.  Was there ever a time when a Guard did his duty but some Deputy, no matter on what side of the House he was, went to the Minister for Justice of the time and asked him not to take any heed of the report of the Guards in that area?  Did not every single one of you do that?  Because <Col N="743" /> the guard or the sergeant in the area did his duty, not alone did Deputies want to get the thing quashed but they wanted to get him changed to Belmullet or some place where he would never be heard of again.  Is that not the truth?</P>
    <P>I am a person who takes a drink. I am not one of those who, like Deputy Doherty, want to legalise the making of poteen.  I am not one of those who would congratulate the Minister on bringing in a Bill we all know had to be brought in.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies did so, but they want amendments. However, the Taoiseach says &ldquo;This is the Bill; take it or leave it.&rdquo; That is the reason I am voting against it.  I want certain amendments.  Some Deputies may think little of Deputy Corry but I think a good deal of him. People in the rural areas are entitled to as much, if not more, than people in the cities.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Killilea will agree with me that the Sunday opening hours in the Bill of 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. are ridiculous.  Last Mass is generally over at 12.15 p.m., or 12.30 p.m. at the latest, except when the celebrant is an old Parish Priest who preaches a long sermon.  Why keep the people waiting around until 1 o'clock?  I am voting against this Bill because the opening hour on Sunday is too late.  Instead of the hours from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., I am proposing an amendment that the hours should be from 12.30 to 2 p.m. I think one and a half hours would be good enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killilea will bear me out that the people of North Galway are hardworking and honest.  After a hard week's work these people are entitled to their pint of stout.  I agreed with Deputy Corry on that point long ago when no one would listen to him but, instead of from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., the opening hours should be 12.30 to 2 o'clock.  That is long enough though probably many people would like a few extra pints.  If those were the hours, they would leave the public houses and get home to their wives and families in good time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that we must take this Bill as it is, but I shall vote against it because the Sunday <Col N="744" /> opening hours are 1 to 3 o'clock instead of 12.30 to 2 o'clock.  With regard to Sunday evening opening, everybody knows that the proposed hours, 5 to 9 o'clock, are ridiculous. Why should there be such lengthy hours on Sunday evening?  The people who turn up at 7, 8 or 9 o'clock on Sunday evening are not people who want a drink.  They are the youth of the country on their way to dances and, in my view, they are people who should not get a drink at all.  At their age they should not be taking drink.  Where there are football matches of one kind or another, the publicans can always get exemption orders.  The proposed hours are too long; I would suggest that one hour would be enough, from 6 to 7 o'clock.</P>
    <P>My third reason for voting against the Bill concerns weekday opening.  It is proposed that public houses remain open until 11.30 p.m., but it will be 11.45 before publicans get customers out of their premises.  The Government have been talking about increased production by workers and farmers, but everybody must realise that the farmer or worker who is put out of a public house at 11.30 p.m. is not so fit for a hard day's work next morning.  The present closing hour of 10.30 p.m. is late enough.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about conditions in the city and I am sorry that Deputy Larkin is not present.  I listened to him last week; I imagine that transport facilities in the city would stop at 11.30 p.m.  That is the hour when it is proposed that city workers be put out on the streets by the publicans.  The reason they are put out is because they have no more money to spend.  It happened to others as well as to me, and I think that 10.30 p.m. should be the extreme limit.</P>
    <P>I do not usually indulge in long speeches; I try to relate the facts as closely as I can.  I again appeal to the Minister, if there is any use, to have a free vote on these issues.  I would like to join with Deputy Kitt on behalf of six-day licensed houses.  They are shops in which groceries, twigs, brushes, salt, sugar and tea are sold, and if they are deprived of Sunday opening they will lose their trade to <Col N="745" /> local business rivals.  It is all right for the Taoiseach to say that if two seven-day licences were extinguished one would be added.  I think that is what he said though I did not read his speech carefully.  The House knows that cannot be done.  The seven-day licensed premises are on the right side as far as this Bill is concerned and there is no hope that any of them will surrender their licences.  The result of this will be that the customer of the six-day licensee will go elsewhere with his custom and the six-day licensee will go out of business.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to give the same advantage to the six-day licensee as is being given to the seven-day licensee in this measure.  There are not many such licence holders and, because their number is small, the problem ought not to be incapable of solution.</P>
    <P>I have given the reasons why I shall vote against this Bill.  I believe the hours proposed for Sunday opening are ridiculous.  The hours should be 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. and not 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.  I believe that opening from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Sundays is ridiculous.  Why stay open until 9 o'clock?  Why start at 5 o'clock? Our people are not so fond of drink as all that.  I would give one hour&mdash; 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.  That should be enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House embodies three new principles as compared with previous legislation of a similar character.  The <i>bona fide</i> trade is to be abolished.  The hours are extended and the Sunday opening is changed.  So far I have not heard anyone complain because of the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  Everybody is in agreement on its abolition. For many years there has been no such thing as a <i>bona fide</i> trade and 97 per cent. of the drinking done after 10.30 p.m. in summer was illegal.  People travelled long distances for one purpose, and one purpose only; their only object was to secure drink.  That was illegal, and so they were not <i>bona fide</i> at all.  We shall not be doing any injustice to anyone in abolishing the so-called <i>bona fide</i> trade. Ninety-eight per cent. of the drinking <Col N="746" /> done after closing time was illegal anyway.  We shall have no regrets on the score of abolition.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to extend the hours on week-days.  I do not think he is wise.  There is no necessity for the extension from 10.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. in summer time.  I do not believe there is any demand for such an extension from the licensed trade nor do I believe there is any demand for such an extension from those who want drink.  There will be very serious opposition to the proposed extension from the rest of the community who appreciate that such an extension is bound to do damage.  Licensing laws are enacted for the general welfare of the community as a whole and not for the purpose of serving the limited number who need drink.  It is a pity that, almost on the verge of 1960, we should need licensing laws or restrictions on the sale of drink. Perhaps we are not yet sufficiently mature to be able to restrict ourselves and not abuse the use of intoxicating liquor.  I believe that 25 years from now the Dáil will be legislating to repeal all licensing laws because the people will then be sufficiently mature and have sufficient self-discipline not to abuse the use of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that the strength of the Garda throughout the country is growing smaller every day.  Villages where one had four Gardaí five or seven years ago are now manned by one Garda, tottering around waiting for his number to come up.  The Minister says this legislation will be severely administered.  There are no penalties of any kind mentioned in this Bill.  If the Minister believes that, with a decreasing police force, he will be able to enforce this legislation, he is making a big mistake.  I believe penalties which would command respect should have been incorporated in this measure.  At the moment nobody cares two hoots if he is fined 2/6d., 5/- or 10/-; he does not feel he has broken any law, moral or of any other type.  That will continue until such time as the Minister takes his courage in his hands.  I have not heard one Deputy suggest that the existing penalties should be made more severe, either on the licensee or <Col N="747" /> on the person found drinking on his premises after hours.  The licensee is not always to blame when people are found drinking after legal closing hours.</P>
    <P>The public who demand from the publican to be allowed to remain on his premises after closing hours are the people who break the law and are responsible for the non-enforcement of law as it stands.  I suggest to the Minister, especially in regard to Sunday opening if such opening is to become a fact, that he should provide severe penalties for breaches of the law, and that he should provide them in this Bill before it becomes an Act. Otherwise, this measure will meet the same fate as its predecessor.  Why are the present laws not in operation or why are they being ignored?  It is because the penalties do not deter anyone.  That is why the laws are ignored or brought into disrepute.  You cannot have licensing laws without severe penalties.  Such penalties would injure nobody but would act as a deterrent to prevent the public remaining on premises after hours and prevent the owners from allowing them to remain.  It would give an added incentive to both parties to ensure that the law as passed by the Dáil and Seanad would be respected.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any demand for week-day opening up to 11.30 p.m. I think it is too late. I agree with other Deputies that the present closing hour is late enough.  I do not know what the Minister will finally do. Workers and farmers, with a day's work to do, must get up about 7 o'clock or before 8 in the morning and they should be on the way home before that morning.  If the public houses are open until 11.30 the men will not be in bed until the new day when they must work again.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>It seems inevitable that we are to have Sunday opening.  More is the pity. I wonder if there is much demand for it?  Everybody knows there have been abuses of the law on Sundays.  It is the recognised thing for publicans to have a great many people on their premises illegally.  This measure is brought in to make it legal.  I should imagine that the public demand is possibly from <Col N="748" /> one per cent or two per cent of the population and all the legislation and all the cost is being undertaken to restrict that one or two per cent from getting too much alcohol.  The cost will be colossal.</P>
    <P>If there is to be Sunday opening from 1 to 3 p.m., I believe it is too long and that the closing hour is too late.  One hour should be quite sufficient. The four hours proposed for the evening are also too long.  There has been much talk about giving the country uniformity with the city but the city did not have so many open hours on Sundays up to this.  I wonder if the Minister is wise in this proposal.  He is setting out to chart new waters in proposing to leave so many hours of opening so that a small section of the community may frequent licensed premises and indulge in strong drink on Sundays. That brings me back to emphasise again that without prescribing penalties in this Bill, it is a waste of time passing it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to only one other matter, the six-day licensed premises. Those, like the Minister, who live in cities have no idea of the type of trading done in the country.  It would be hard to find, outside the larger cities and towns, any house selling intoxicating liquor not also selling other goods.  That must be kept in mind. The majority, 97 per cent. of them, do mixed trading.  One thing I can see growing from this&mdash;and I remember making the same remarks on the 1952 Bill&mdash;is that you will have Sunday trade.  People will not come into the towns on weekdays to buy goods; they will be too busy but they will come in on Sunday and buy groceries and clothes and other things they should have bought during the week. That would be bad.</P>
    <P>If the people can get these goods in a seven-day licensed house that will certainly injure a six-day licensed house.  Something is being given to the seven-day house in this Bill that they have never had before.  If people start dealing for groceries and clothes and other things in a seven-day licensed house they will continue to do so.  It would be a pity to see Sunday trading start.  I do not know if it is there <Col N="749" /> already.  I am told butchers' shops can be seen open in the West of Ireland on Sundays.  I do not know if that is a fact; I have never seen them. If that went on to any great extent drapers' shops would open next.  They would have to do so to preserve their livelihood.  That is something that should be carefully considered before the Bill is passed.  Sunday opening is something that we know nothing about in this country and only time will tell whether we are doing injury or not.</P>
    <P>I believe licensed premises should open on St. Patrick's Day.  I see no reason why they should not.  In the diocese of Ferns the shops all close on holydays, including licensed premises, and I have never heard of any abuse on those days when men were not working, whether rural or town labourers.  Those days are observed as Sundays and there has never been any noticeable abuse.  Many people can get drink in hotels, clubs or at race courses on St. Patrick's Day and the complaint has been made by the people who cannot afford to travel to any of those places that they could not get a drink or two on that day.</P>
    <P>I hope that before the Bill leaves the House more consideration will be given to Sunday opening hours so that they may be curtailed and not amount to the six hours or whatever hours are at present in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The extension of the total number of hours of opening in the week is considerable.  If the Minister calculates an hour on every evening of the week and so many hours on Sundays, he will appreciate what the difficulties could be.  I shall conclude by saying that if penalties are not provided as a deterrent to all and sundry, I am afraid this Bill will not serve the purpose the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief observations on the proposed change in the licensing law but, before doing so, I wish to express regret at the remarks made by Deputy Corry in relation to the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  No man is a Pioneer against his will.  I do not want to preach.  Even though I am <Col N="750" /> a member of that Association and have never taken a drink in my life, I am not a killjoy.  The observations made by Deputy Corry are regrettable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced this Bill because the law in relation to licensing has been a failure and a farce.  At present, any man who wants a drink, as long as he has money, will get drink and the more money he has the more drink he will get.  He can join a club or he can travel far and wide and get it or he can bring it home.  The law as it stands merely closes the front door and opens the back door.  There is hardly a man in this House who will not agree with me.  If I had my way, I would abolish all laws in relation to the sale of drink and after about 12 or 18 months the question would settle itself.  Those who now want drink would get fed up because drink is sweet only after hours.  The Irish like to break the law and to be against the law.  Drink is like the forbidden fruit.  If there were a 12 months' trial of complete abolition of the laws in relation to drinking, the problem would settle itself and gardaí who are now engaged on licence duty could be more usefully employed attending to vandalism of which, unfortunately, there is too much today and in respect of which there is great need for gardaí.</P>
      <P>Any publican will tell you that when they get certain opening hours on Sundays the customers walk out when the door is opened.  I refer to those who come in before the front door is opened.  These people get greater pleasure out of being in when the front door is closed.  If the publican was not prepared to allow them in on the seven days of the week he could close permanently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that there is need for some alteration in the existing hours but I would not agree with hours that would clash with the hours of religious services or with the housewife's arrangements.  The housewife is worthy of consideration in this matter also.  Tourist centres are entitled to consideration especially in <Col N="751" /> regard to opening on Sunday evening. Young people can go to dances and the older people are entitled to have a drink. As a pioneer, I am not a killjoy.  There should be concessions in tourist areas.  The Minister for Transport and Power, at a recent dinner, stressed the importance of catering for visitors at tourist centres and meeting their needs.  The hours provided in the Bill will curtail the hours at present allowed in tourist centres.</P>
    <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Carty when he says that the &ldquo;sing-song&rdquo; at tourist centre&mdash;he was referring to Salthill, Galway, which is one of the major tourist centres&mdash;was the highlight.  I completely agree with him.  I have been in hotels, which were properly conducted. There was no drunkenness. There was a good spirit, not the spirit that comes out of the bottle.  What are tourists to do in bad weather? They are entitled to consideration. They should be able to have a drink.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the law in relation to young people enforced.  I am referring to underage brats&mdash;that is the only way in which I can describe them-being supplied with drink.  It is time that the law in that respect was tightened up.  It is disgusting to see mere boys staggering out of pubs and such places.  I do not like the looseness in enforcement of the licensing law in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to please as many people as possible by this Bill. He will not succeed in pleasing everybody because he will step on the toes of many people by this Bill or by any other Bill that he might introduce.  The Minister has my sympathy in regard to this matter because he would require one Bill for Dublin and another Bill for the country.  By this Bill he will find himself in the position of being back where he started.</P>
    <P>I must express my disappointment at the Taoiseach's views in relation to six-day licences.  This Bill will be the swansong of many six-day licence holders and they will be forced into the position that they will have to break the law or go out of business completely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> As I have said, the Minister should try lifting the laws for, say, a period of 12 months and, by a system of trial and error, he will arrive at the stage where the problem will settle itself. The Minister has my sympathy in regard to this amendment of the law. As many of his own supporters have said, this Bill will require amendment in the light of experience gained within a certain period.</P>
    <P>There is a certain rule by which, when the House adjourns, even if it is at 11 p.m., Deputies have another half hour or perhaps three-quarters of an hour in which they can go into the bar.  The same rule should operate in regard to workers in the country who work late, and some of them work very late.  What Deputies are not prepared to apply to themselves in the House should not be applied in the country.  We should allow a little extra time for those workers in the summer time.</P>
    <P>At the danger of repeating myself, I say that this proposed amendment of the licensing laws will affect the tourist centres because there is the right to keep open till 12 o'clock at the moment.  The hotels there are properly conducted and I have not seen any drunkenness.  We should bear in mind when we talk so much about tourism that the effect of this measure will be to close these hotels half an hour earlier.  Let us not amend the law and make the situation any tighter than it has been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to bring in this Bill.  In doing so he is only acting on the judgment of the commission appointed by this House to inquire into the licensing laws.  While I intend to support the Bill I, like other Deputies, reserve the right to vote for or against certain amendments which may be brought in in respect of later hours, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from rural Ireland and if we are honest with ourselves, or with the people who sent us here, we must recognise the fact that in rural Ireland over the years 40 per cent of the rural population has had to break the licensing laws in order to get one drink. <Col N="753" /> They need not be heavy drinkers.  The people who go to Mass at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. on Sunday and who may reside three or four miles away from their church will usually go in for a drink with their neighbours and then go back home for lunch.  They will not see that house till the following Sunday or until a fair day or market day.</P>
    <P>I am shocked to hear Deputies speak about drunkenness.  There is no drunkenness in rural Ireland and, if the Minister had the courage to permit public houses to open for 24 hours a day, I believe there would be less drunkenness elsewhere, because no sane or sensible person will take more drink than he can afford to buy.  The average worker or small farmer going to a market or to church will take a drink or two and then go home.  You will not see him in the public house again for a week or a fortnight.  However, the laws that have been framed by this House prior to the introduction of this Bill enabled the wealthy classes in this country to drink from Monday morning until the following Monday morning and in doing so they break no law.  The agricultural labourer or the small farmer, who has been saving his hay, cutting his turf or saving his harvest and working late hours at night-time in his fields, has to break the law to get a drink.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue as far as rural Ireland is concerned.  I support the Minister in his efforts to make rural Ireland uniform with Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and all other places where people are not producing from the land and working long hours, as the rural people have to work.  Under this Bill they will be entitled to have a drink on Monday night or Sunday night.  I may not agree thoroughly with the Bill as it is actually before us.  I would want to be very clear that the hours of the Sunday morning opening would not clash with any church service.  I would also want to be clear that where in any town you have Gaelic or soccer matches or any other games, the hours of opening would not be too late, that is, as regards the first opening, say 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. as the case may be, so that the people attending those matches would not have to break the law to obtain <Col N="754" /> a drink before they go home to do their usual evening work on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the city dweller to speak about Sunday opening, about the hours being too long or too short. They forget the average rural person has to work on Sunday morning and Sunday evening.  It does not matter what time you leave the houses open; these people still have to do their work.</P>
    <P>When the licensing laws were first framed the <i>bona fide</i> trade was different from what it is today.  Those laws were meant for a time when a three-mile journey was a long journey on a side car.  By modern modes of conveyance, a three-mile journey takes only three minutes at the rate of travel of the vast majority of motor cars. It is wrong to see people who are living three miles outside any rural town coming into that town to enjoy a drink on a Sunday evening and to see the people who live in that town going out to the rural public houses beyond the three-mile limit to obtain a drink. That should not happen and that is what is happening under present legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important that rural dwellers should enjoy the same facilities in regard to drink as city dwellers.  I do not believe it will cause any more drunkenness because the man who drinks beyond his pocket will do so regardless of the laws that are in force. If the Minister provides for an opening hour of 12 o'clock or 12.30 on a Sunday morning I would have an objection if I thought it would keep some person from his Sunday service. However, I do not believe we would keep any good living person from carrying out his duty on a Sunday. The type of person who would go to a public house instead of attending to his religious duties would probably not be inclined to go to church at all. I do not believe that in supporting the Minister I am catering for that type of person.  I am catering for the average hardworking farmer who is compelled by the present state of affairs to break the law on Sunday whether after Mass or on Sunday evening. Under our present law he cannot enjoy a drink unless he is outside the three mile limit.  I am supporting the Bill <Col N="755" /> because I believe it will help those people.</P>
    <P>I would make an appeal to the Minister on one point.  In rural Ireland there are a number of people who hold six-day licences.  Under the present law the six-day licensee may be at a small disadvantage in that he cannot cater for the <i>bona fide</i> traffic but this new Bill will place him in a much worse position.  His neighbours at each side of him who may have seven day licences will be able to open their doors and sell over and above board but the six-day licensee will have to cloak his trade, if he can get anyone to go in. I do not believe that he will get anybody to go in because no one will chance breaking the law if he can get a drink in the open.  I appeal to the Minister to put the six-day licensee on the same level as the seven day man.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the different fees are but if the Minister feels that the State would be at a loss as far as the licence duty is concerned he should give the six-day licensee the option of paying the difference.  Give him a chance to open his doors during the same hours as the seven day man.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies speak here making a case for particular areas and at the same time condemning the Bill. I have heard Deputies suggest that the hours for tourist centres should be extended. I believe that the Minister must cater for the whole country.  You cannot have a licensing Bill for the tourist centres and not for the towns and districts leading to those centres.  We would then be in the same fix as we find ourselves in at the present time. The Minister has faced the situation in such a way that I feel more or less sorry for him.  It does not matter what Bill is brought into this House to deal with the licensing laws because you will always have opposition to it.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy on my left advocate a free vote in the House and I agreed with him 100 per cent.  I think it is a mistake that the Whips should be put on and that a member of any Party should have to vote for something in which he does not believe. The same Deputy, however, was not in favour of having a free vote for the <Col N="756" /> members of his own Party and, as far as I can see, you will find the usual line-up on this Bill.  Whether a Bill is good or bad you will find that the Opposition Parties will oppose it so that you never get an opinion freely expressed in this House.  I can see why the Minister cannot give a free vote. If he did so, the chances are that we would have no licensing laws at all with all the amendments that would be put in from all sides.</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill I reserve the right to support certain amendments. I do not agree that the hours either in Dublin or in rural Ireland should be 11.30 p.m.  I think the people would appreciate an extension of the hours to 11 p.m.  An extension to 11.30 is too late particularly in Dublin where the people working in these houses would not be finished until almost 12 o'clock, by the time they had cleared up.  Then they would have to engage taxis to take them home.  The Minister would be well advised to change the closing hour to 11 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition to this Bill.  The fact that the law is being evaded wholesale all over the country should be sufficient to induce every member of the House to support the Bill.  As far as the proposal for a free vote is concerned, I do not think that I ever remember a free vote on the Second Reading of a Bill.  There might be a case for it on some particular clause of the Bill if the Minister thought fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why there should be opposition to the Bill when we all know that the law at present is unenforceable, I cannot understand.  I am reminded of what took place when I was putting the 1943 Act through the House and I am glad to see that there is a different attitude to-day.  I proposed to do away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  At that time drinking could go on until 6 o'clock in the morning and I felt that the whole <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be done away with.  However, the majority of my own Party and of the Opposition objected and I now feel rather pleased at the change in the <Col N="757" /> Opposition.  The reason I felt that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be abolished was that while it was all right when there were no bicycles or motor cars and people had to walk, it is not so now.  I am glad to see that attitude has been adopted.</P>
    <P>I was on the Commission.  When it was set up the attitude of our Party was that there should never have been a Commission at all.  Our idea was to set up a Select Committee of both Houses and let these different interests come in and give their evidence.  If that had been done, you would have got a practically unanimous report.  However, the Dáil thought otherwise.  There were bound to be all sorts of reservations such as we found in the Report. There were people there who were owners of <i>bona fide</i> houses and they did not wish to do away with <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  As might be expected there was a majority report, a few who had reservations, and a minority report.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that in the Bill the Minister and the Government did not agree to our recommendation that the hours on Sunday should be from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.  However, I think there is a change there now.  I was not listening to the Taoiseach but I think he indicated that we are prepared to do that now.  I think it is the general opinion that the hours from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. would be better.  Two members of the Commission, Messrs. Clear and Flynn, had reservations about 11.30 at night.  I had a reservation, too, but I must confess it was a mental one.  I felt exactly as they did, but I was convinced the Government would never agree to 11.30 at night.  I suppose I should have put myself on paper, too.  I remember saying to some of those who signed the report that the Government would not agree to 11.30 p.m. Now I find in the Bill that for four months of the year the closing hour will be 11.30 p.m.  I think 11 p.m. would be quite late enough either in town or country.</P>
    <P>As for the six-day licences, I do not know whether I would have got up to speak at all were it not that we <Col N="758" /> are expected to look after the interests of our constituencies.  In my constituency, in the town of Ballaghaderreen, nearly all the publichouses are six-day licences.  Deputy Seán Flanagan made the case very well for treating the six-day people in the same way as the seven-day people. The seven-day people are getting something they never had before, the right to open to the townspeople. Consequently, they will do irreparable damage to the people who have six-day licences.  That should not be the case.  I hope the Minister will find some satisfactory way of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this business of extending the area in which six-day licences may be bought to the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties will meet the case or not, but I really think there is a case for giving them the right to open in the same way as the seven-day licence holders.  It is well known in the west of Ireland, especially in Mayo, that the reason there are so many six-day licences is that, when the licences were given out, there was a sort of sabbatarian justice objecting to Sunday opening at all.  In the town of Ballaghaderreen there are only six seven-day licences and fifty-six others.  I would not be surprised if those six were bought when they were available. The position now is they are not available in the area, and whether extension to the whole country would meet that situation or not, I do not know.  But there is a very good case for giving the six-day licence holders the same treatment as the others and I hope that the Government's mind is not closed on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended waiting for the Committee Stage before making my contribution.  Listening to the debate, however, I have come to the conclusion that there is a lot of hypocrisy in it and I should like to comment on it.  It was freely rumoured that the Whips would be off the Government Party, but now a former Minister says that he never heard of that on a Second Reading.  The rumour was so strong that the Taoiseach had to <Col N="759" /> come in himself to deny that the Whips were off.  If the Whips were off, I believe this Bill would be beaten. Some people have come in here trying to salve their consciences by flogging the <i>bona fide</i> people.  People used to go out on foot or by side-car from Dublin, Waterford and other cities.  We are told that it was breaking the law and we have heard a whole lot of abuse about it.  I do not think it was terrible at all.  The people going out to have a drink were over twenty-one.</P>
      <P>I think it is very hard lines on those people, especially around Dublin&mdash;I cannot be accused of trying to catch any votes there&mdash;who spent a good deal of money on these houses and made them the kind of place to which you could bring a tourist.  They sold good drink there and paid good wages. Some of the speeches here reminded me of the Salvation Army or some of these puritancial temperance missions. It was especially true of the Taoiseach's speech.  He brought in the matter of religion and I thought that was going a bit too far.</P>
      <P>I believe there was a need for Father Mathew here at one time.  I have heard it said on the stage in one of our very fine plays that Father Mathew was an overrated man.  He might have been all right in his own time and he might have been overrated, too.  We are a very proud people. Sometimes we get sore with anybody who says anything against us, but, in a second, we can brand our whole people as &ldquo;the drunken Irish,&rdquo; which we are not.  We are legislating here for less than a fraction of 1 per cent.  of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From some of the speeches we have heard one would think that our people were locked up in terror on Sunday and could not get a drink in their local village.  We all know that that is not true and that such persecution does not exist.  It is necessary to have legislation so that people will not break the law.  One would imagine that the people in rural Ireland have been living in a wilderness of prohibition. No such thing.  Our people are no longer barefooted.  The ordinary farm labourer or county council worker has advanced now to the stage of owning a <Col N="760" /> motor cycle.  Some of them are able to afford cars between them and they get into them, or use bicycles, to go to another town in which they can have a few drinks.  I believe they will still do that even when the proposed hours are put into force, even though there is no necessity for it.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to find so many things in the Bill that nobody seems to want, and I wonder who put them into it.  The publicans do not want them.  I went into a lot of public houses and asked both publicans and their customers what they think of this Bill, and I am here to reflect the opinion of my constituents.  They seem to share the same view as the majority in this House, that Sunday opening should be from 12.30 until 2 o'clock and under no circumstances should the pubs be open until 9 o'clock on Sunday night. They believe the pubs should be closed at 7 o'clock.  If it is made legal to open until 9 o'clock the pubs will stay open until then.  They will have to, in order to keep up with the ordinary competition which exists between public houses, but they will not want to do that.</P>
    <P>It has been freely said that this Bill was introduced as the result of pressure by hoteliers, people with hotels in the cities and in the tourist resorts, people with fully licensed bars who can stay open for the whole year. There is a legend about them and I think it applied to the county of Donegal, where a visitor is supposed to have asked the local Garda: &ldquo;What time do the pubs close here?&rdquo; and the answer was: &ldquo;I think in October, Sir.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was supposed to be Donegal but it could be Waterford or in Killarney.  Let us not be hypocrites about this thing.  We all know that there are hundreds of hotels in the country into which it is possible to go at very late hours in the night and get drink.  Nobody has said a word either for or against these, but everybody started shouting about the unfortunate <i>bona fide</i> traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the six-day licensed traders I do not think it would be very <Col N="761" /> difficult to have a calculation made in the normal way regarding their change in valuation to seven-day licences, that is if they want them.  They should be free to apply for seven-day licences and they should be given them.  They should not be put at that disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to make it legal to use unstamped bottles.  That is the most extraordinary thing I ever came across.  I think that it tends towards the integrity of the trade that the bottle should be a stamped measure, and I discovered from correspondence which I got this morning&mdash;I am sure other Deputies got it too&mdash;that the majority of reputable licensed bottlers do not want that.  Again, I am reflecting the opinion of the licensed trade in my constituency, apart from the circular that I got this morning from a group that seems to represent a great many people in the country.  I think the Minister should consider that matter, especially when there is no objection from the trade and when it is not costing the State anything.  It is charged to him on the price of the bottles by the Irish Glass Bottle Company, the cost of having officials there to see the bottles are holding the true measure, and that they are stamped.</P>
    <P>It can be said that milk bottles are not stamped.  A pint of milk is sold at an average price of from 6d. to 6½d., while a pint of beer costs a half-crown or three shillings.</P>

      <P>I am talking about <Col N="762" /> the bottled stuff.  I do hope that the Taoiseach will change his mind when this Bill comes to Committee Stage and that he will take the Whips off his own Party.  It will be an experience for his own Party, for the rest of the House and for the country to see how his Party will vote on some of these sections.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I should mention.  I would like to see all public houses closed on Christmas Day and on Good Friday, because of the days they are.  I do not see why public houses should not be open on St. Patrick's Day.  I have said this before. If one or two people are not able to hold their liquor that is no reason why the rest of the country should suffer.  In any case, if you close the public house by law on St. Patrick's Day we all know that people coming out of Mass in the country districts will go into it.  They will pass through the yard in which horses used to be put up, walk through the stable and into a back room where they meet their friends, while the front of the house is shuttered, with perhaps one window left open to prove that there is nobody in the front part of the shop.</P>
      <P>I am voting against this Bill, first of all because there is a lot of hypocrisy in it; secondly, because it is doing away with the trade of <i>bona fide</i> houses without thought of compensating them and, thirdly, because of unstamped bottles being made legal thus making it possible for people who might not have a conscience to sell bottles that would be eighteen to the gallon, or maybe even twenty to the gallon.  Such bottles could be sold after hours at a time when people would not ask any questions.  I shall not delay the Minister any further and I think he will have a chance of getting his Bill tonight if I sit down now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words in connection with something to which I do not think I heard any Deputy refer.  In regard to the opening hour in the morning, 10 o'clock is a bit antiquated.  Week after week, and day after day, in small towns applications have to be made to the court for exemptions. The fees to the solicitor in such cases <Col N="763" /> amount to £3 3s. and £2 2s. stamp duty.  There should be no need for that expense.  In the country farmers sometimes have to leave home at very early hours.  Sometimes they spend most of the night travelling to a fair. It should be possible for them to halt at some publichouse, rest their cattle, and get some refreshment for themselves. At the moment they can get no refreshment because no publican can afford an exemption to meet such cases, and he does not therefore seek an exemption.  I think that the 10 o'clock opening came about as a result of all-night dances.  We no longer have all-night dances.  Dances now cease at 1 o'clock and there is no problem of people waiting about in order to get a drink.  I think the morning opening should be 7 o'clock. There will be no abuses because the publican will open only when he knows he will get custom.</P>
      <P>No businessman will open his house until such time as there is a fair prospect of trade.  The publican is in the same position.  He will not open his premises unless there is a prospect of trade.  He will not get up and open at an unreasonably early hour in the morning any more than the draper, the grocer or the hardware merchant.  Outside of a fair day, no publican will bother opening his premises at 7 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Sunday opening, I support the view that 12.30 should be the opening hour, 2 o'clock closing.  I urge the Minister to bring in an amendment to satisfy the wishes of the majority in that regard.  Most of those who have said they oppose this measure have indicated that they are doing so because there is no general demand from either the public or the publicans for this long opening on Sunday, any more than there is any need for the late opening on week-days. There is no demand from the publicans for any sort of laws at all in connection with publichouses.  I do not think they have ever been asked for their views or opinions about the licensing laws.  It must be remembered that legislation is passed here because it is believed to be essential <Col N="764" /> for the proper running of the country. In that regard, this Bill is intended to make the administration of the law in relation to the licensed trade more effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements the majority report of the Commission of Inquiry. That Commission was set up by the Coalition Government.  Yet, these are the people who are now opposing this Bill.  I listened to Deputy Larkin the other night.  I was amazed at the arguments he advanced.  He said he had never been in a publichouse.  Yet, he could tell me&mdash;I take a drink and I know a little about publichouses&mdash; what is done and what is not done in publichouses.  He gave us a lecture on what Deputies should and should not do.  I know that if the police raid a publichouse and a Deputy is found in that publichouse after hours he is treated no differently from anybody else, and rightly so.  Deputy Larkin seemed to think that a Deputy could bring in anyone he liked into a publichouse after hours and the Garda take no action.  He is very wrong in that, just as wrong as he is in his views about rural Ireland.  He criticised rural Ireland.  It was not pleasant to hear a member of the Labour Party speaking in the way he did about the people he represents&mdash;the ordinary working classes.  He spoke about their ignoring the law.  I know that the people in the rural areas obey the laws just as well, or perhaps better, than do the people in the cities and towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the St. Patrick's Day opening.  That will legalise the position that has obtained up to this.  Every section in this Bill is designed to legalise the position that obtains now.  That should help the Gardaí in their enforcement of the law in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem where the publican also carries on business as a grocer, hardware merchant, or something else.  Many people in the rural areas do not shop on weekdays. They do most of their shopping on Sundays.  That has been the custom so long as I can remember, and that <Col N="765" /> custom will continue in the future.  I can see difficulty if these laws are to be enforced.  If a publican was prepared to go the expense of sealing off the bar, then there would be nothing to stop him attending to the wants of ordinary shoppers on Sunday morning. The whole premises would be licensed, but the bar proper would be sealed off and no intoxicating drink would be sold on any other part of the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had just begun to deal with this motion when I had to move the adjournment the other night.  I had said that the people on the islands are getting most of the amenities due to them from various Departments, compared with what people are getting on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In regard to the valuation of island holdings, when the valuation was done by Griffith and his team over 100 years ago they had to have regard to the remoteness of an area as well as everything else and as a result they put a valuation on these islands which was lower than it would be on the mainland, especially on the mainland fairly convenient to a town, for land of equal value as regards fertility and other factors.  In fact, therefore, the islanders are asked to pay a somewhat lower rate than the people on the mainland in respect of land of more or less the same value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I did not mention the Department of Agriculture in regard to Departmental schemes except to say that it has various schemes first of all, for the whole country and, secondly, for congested districts.  Of these schemes, the most favourable are applied to the islands, such as the schemes for the placing of bulls and rams, seed schemes for potatoes, oats and so on. All these are applied to the islands under the most favourable circumstances. In the case of the ground limestone scheme the transport of the lime to the island is paid for.</P>
    <P>In introducing the motion Deputy Murphy mentioned in particular post office services.  I find that the larger islands, where there are 100 inhabitants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of only one island did I refer to post office facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the islands of the whole country and not about Cork islands alone.  The Post Office rule is that islands that have a certain population&mdash;I think of over 100 people&mdash;have their own post office.  In other cases the post is brought to the island as often as possible.  I find that in these islands off the Cork coast where there is no post office the delivery is daily where that is possible; in most cases it is four days a week or two days a week and in one case, it is one day a week.  The Post Office is doing what it can.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education also deals with the islands through its various schemes as far as possible.  They give more favourable consideration to allocating schools on islands than they do on the mainland.  They will give a school to an island for a lower number of pupils than they would on the mainland.  In some cases where the number of pupils is very small they must get the pupils to come to the mainland and in some cases transport for these children is paid for; in other cases, the islanders get a subsidy to maintain the children on the mainland during the school term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The islands have Local Government services.  It is true that they have not got the main road, a road to lead <Col N="767" /> from the island to the mainland.  On the other hand, there have been quite a few subsidised transport systems, one of them being to an island off the Cork coast which was recently initiated by the Minister for the Gaeltacht. There is, of course, subsidised transport for the Aran Islands off the Galway coast for many years.  These transport systems are fairly costly on the Exchequer, and are provided to give transport to and from the islands on a very reasonable basis.  Bridges have been built on some of the islands or causeways and these were also heavily subsidised.  A few of them were built at Galway, and recently I sanctioned a proposal to build a bridge to Valentia Island.  That was under discussion and consideration for many years.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification has been extended already to some islands off the Donegal coast, Valentia, Achill, Aran Mór, Bear Island and Spike Island and an island off the Galway coast. In addition to that, the Minister for the Gaeltacht also helped some of the islands off Donegal and Galway to install what is technically known as &ldquo;bottle gas.&rdquo;  The installation of Calor Gas was provided free for those islands and is used for heating and lighting with efficiency equal, I am told, to electricity, and cheap to run and pay for in use.  Naturally, that will be extended to other islands because a start was made only about a year ago.  It will mean that most of the islands will have no further complaint that they are not getting the service from the E.S.B. that people on the mainland are getting.</P>
    <P>So far as the Department of Health is concerned, the bigger islands have doctors on them although it is very difficult sometimes to get a doctor to stay because his income is not very good outside his dispensary practice. That is a case we have under consideration at the moment and I think it is possible that some proposals may be made to make it more tempting for a doctor to stay on one of those islands and content himself with the practice he may get there.  It is true that islanders must leave the islands to get <Col N="768" /> hospital treatment.  The only island that has a hospital is Valentia. Although most islanders must come to the mainland for hospital attention they are helped and facilitated so far as possible in regard to being moved to hospital and they get the usual free service if their means entitle them to free service.  There are nurses on some of the islands where there are no doctors, where the size of the island would justify it.</P>
    <P>There were proposals discussed at some of the county council meetings in the counties concerned with these islands off the coast and various suggestions were made.  Up to recently, most of the islands were paying their rates but in recent years many of the islands have fallen away and are not paying rates at all.  There was a discussion at the Cork County Council in 1956 and the council passed a resolution recommending to the Minister for Local Government that legislation be introduced which would authorise the council to reduce by one-half the rates assessed on holdings situated on the islands off the coast of County Cork.  I see that that resolution was sent to the Minister for Local Government who rejected it and said he did not agree with it at all.  That was in 1956.  He pointed out that the county council had it within their own right to be lenient with islanders who were not able to pay, that they could write it off as a bad debt and not insist on the payment.  That, as a matter of fact, is the position at the moment in these counties which find it difficult to collect rates off the various islands that are around the coast.</P>
    <P>When we are told that the landholders on these islands are very badly off and not able to meet the rates, we find that where land has been sold within the last 10 years, let us say&mdash; we do not want to go back any further than that&mdash;in some of these islands they got a fairly good price.  In fact, I would say that land was sold at about the same figure as the average price of land in County Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Land on Bear Island fetches as much as land in County Wexford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that your statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Add it up for yourself.  Seven and a half acres got £240, that is, between £30 and £40 an acre; 21 acres got £435, that is, over £40 an acre; 10 acres got £380, that is £38 an acre.  My experience of land in County Wexford is that it sells at in or about £40 an acre.  That is the price it fetches.  When I see these prices paid for land on the island holders the conclusion that the island holders are placing as high a value on their land as land holders in County Wexford place on their land.</P>
      <P>My plea when I started to speak about this was that we should try to get a real picture of the position of these islands.  If there is a position to be remedied, and there evidently is, because some of the islands are not paying rates at all, we can only arrive at a sensible remedy by trying to get the true facts.  There is no use in our saying here that the islanders have no amenities whatever because that is only to encourage them, if you like, to look at their own sores and their own disabilities and give them self-justification for not paying any rates at all. We should try to find out in what way do they differ from, let us say, remote holdings on a mountain side or in a valley between two mountains.  When you examine the case you will find that their disabilities are not very much more, in fact, perhaps, not any more than those of holders of land on the mountain side and in the valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to give moral support, as it were, to these islanders not to pay their rates by exaggerating their difficulties, people living in these outlying areas may come next and say that they should not pay rates either, that they have no good road coming near them, no hospital within miles of them, no dispensary doctor within miles of them, and so on.  They could make the same case as is made for the islanders in this House.  That would <Col N="770" /> lead to a very serious state of affairs in many counties where there are wide areas of mountain side and remote valleys and so on.  If people living in these places refuse to pay rates, it would lead to a very serious position indeed, especially for those who did pay rates and who must pay, not only their own rates, but also for the default of those who refused to pay any longer.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy asked for in this motion is a revision of the valuation. Of course, I shall not stand on technicalities but I want to warn the House that it would require legislation to alter the rate on land.  In fact, the Act that was passed at the time of the Griffith Valuation has never been changed. The valuation of land has remained the same.  The rates paid, of course, have not remained the same but the Poor Law Valuation has remained the same and, in order to alter the Poor Law Valuation you would have to bring in an amendment of a nature that has not been brought in for the past 100 years.  If it was done, we would find that, in fact, it would benefit only a small minority, if you like, of the land holders on these islands because the great majority are not paying the full rates.  Some of them are paying half the rates by a sort of gentlemen's agreement with the county council and some are paying nothing at all.  There was no agreement on that; they are just not paying.</P>
    <P>So, to revise the rate would make no difference to the great majority that we are dealing with.  It would undoubtedly give relief to those who have been paying up to this and who, perhaps, might merit more consideration from us for the reason that they have continued to pay even though they suffer from the same disabilities as the others, whatever these disabilities may be.</P>
    <P>To alter the Poor Law Valuation is not the best way to approach this problem. There are, of course, ways of doing it which I have not considered or which certainly the Government have not considered.  A simpler way of doing it, perhaps, would be, that when it comes to the annual consideration of the relief in rates that is given to land holders, it could be considered <Col N="771" /> whether some difference could be made but, as I say, I have not considered that at all and neither have the Government considered it.</P>
    <P>The way in which I approached this question was: I asked what are the disabilities islanders suffer from.  I found that in social welfare there is no disability, that they get any payments that are due to them; in education they are fairly well treated on the whole; they either have a teacher or the pupils are brought to the mainland somehow or other, or sometimes kept on the mainland; in health they have as much medical attention as, I am afraid, we can ever provide for them. If they have to go to hospital they will have to be taken off the island.  That applies to people in remote districts, who also have to be transported to hospital.</P>
    <P>When we come down to consider the question we find that most of the benefits that are given by various Departments or by the local authorities are available to the islanders to the same extent as to those on the mainland.  There is one big exception and that is that they are divided by deep water from the mainland.  If there were some help in relation to transport which would be needed for the islanders between the island and the mainland where the cost would not be any higher than, let us say, they would have to pay in bus fare if they were living on the mainland, that would make them equal with the people living on the mainland.</P>
    <P>The other exception I mentioned already is that some of them complain that, living on an island, they do not get the benefit of rural electrification. Of course there are remote districts in every county where people have not got the benefits of rural electrification and where it will be a long time before they get it.  They would have the same complaint but the Minister for the Gaeltacht approached that in the proper way as far as the Gaeltacht islands are concerned.  He has not dealt with them all yet but he has dealt with a number of them in the short time he has had his scheme in operation, that was, that where it was <Col N="772" /> impossible, except at exorbitant cost laying under water cable, to supply electricity to these islands, the best thing was to supply the alternative, that is, calor gas.  I do not want to advertise calor gas because there are other gases just as good, but let us say bottled gas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they did.  Anyway let us say bottled gas.  Where the island get bottled gas they have as good light as you would get from electricity and as good a system for cooking. Therefore they are as well off as if they had rural electrification, and they have this amenity much cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Minister should not say that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that against electricity all right.  I understand the yearly bill is cheaper than it would be for electricity.  Therefore, we are narrowing down the differences very much and we should proceed on the lines we are going at the moment in giving these further amenities, the lack of which these people complain about, and try to put the islands on equality with the mainland as regards amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House, whatever Party he may belong to, is not anxious to see that the islanders get all the benefits they should get.  They should get fair play in every way.  That is why I should like to have this motion discussed on the basis of trying to find out what their disabilities are and see if we can do away with these disabilities so that they can have as good a standard of life as people on the mainland in so far as we can do that.  I do not think this Government or any other Government would be in any way mean or parsimonious about the amount of money that might be required to do a job of that kind and I should like very much indeed to have this motion discussed in that atmosphere.  We are all anxious to see what we can do but we want to know what the facts are <Col N="773" /> before we sit down to find out what the remedy will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be on the lines suggested by the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, to try to remedy defects we know exist in regard to the islands. I am not so satisfied that the motion on the Order Paper is the best suggestion that can be made but we should be able to solve the difficulty if we approach the matter in a sensible way.</P>
      <P>Having a revaluation of the island would not solve the difficulties.  Indeed it might have the opposite effect because the industrious, enterprising man on the island who improved his holding might find after the revaluation that his valuation would be increased instead of being reduced and the ne'er-do-well who did nothing but draw the dole may get a reduction in valuation.  For that reason I think the revision of valuation would not be a solution to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many alternatives.  Deputy Murphy has given one; I shall give many alternatives in my speech here this evening to improve the conditions on the islands.  I did so in my first speech in Dáil Éireann and I have continued to do so for the past two and a half years, bringing to the notice of this House the disabilities under which the islanders suffer and the necessity for improving conditions on the islands so that the people would be able to live more comfortably and make a better living here.  That is the all-essential factor, that we should provide the island people with those facilities which would enable them to make a good living on their island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one island off the Cork coast, the only island where the population of children has increased over the years, that is, Hare Island, where some 30 years ago the Government built 40 new houses.  As a result of the Government's intervention at that time the number of children on the island going to school to-day is greatly increased. If the Government would tackle this problem seriously there are many things they could do.  The provision <Col N="774" /> of fishing boats is the first essential because fishing is the natural living of the island people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy has suggested alternatives and the Minister for Finance has asked us all for our views so that we may alleviate distress on the islands, and to put forward sensible remedies, to quote the Minister's own words.  That is what I am doing, putting forward sensible remedies for the depopulation of the islands.  I pointed out that on one island there is an increase of population as a result of the Government's intervention 30 years ago.  Government intervention would be welcomed now in providing fishing boats in the first instance and, having provided fishing boats, in providing, say, fishmeal factories, so that when a glut of fish is there it will not have to be dumped into the sea again as has been done off the West Cork coast on many occasions by these island fishermen.  There is an open field for extension and development as regards these islands, especially in the case of the fishing industry and ancillary industries such as canning and fishmeal factories.  We are importing fishmeal from Iceland and various other countries at an enormous cost while our island fishermen are dumping their catches in the sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed they would. If what I suggest is done the valuation of the islands would increase considerably <Col N="775" /> and the people would become prosperous as the result of the setting up of these industries.  In addition to the fishing industry, there is also the question of the island holdings and I must say, on behalf of the island holders, that they have not been treated fairly in the disposal of their milk and butter.  I think an alternative scheme could be put forward by the Dairy Disposals Board for the collection of cream from all the islands.  They could at least collect the cream from the islands at various collecting points along the coast and thus give the islanders the benefit of the creamery facilities available to farmers on the mainland. That would be a great help and if it is not feasible perhaps a subsidy could be given on the butter.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance asked speakers to the motion to offer reasonable suggestions for the betterment of the present conditions on the island.  That is what I am doing on this occasion.  However, I must say that I have not had the same experience as Deputy Murphy who says that all the representations made by the Deputies of West Cork have been turned down.</P>

      <P>I shall quote it for the Deputy.  This is what the Deputy said in the Official Report of the 25th November, column 462:</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the demands made over the years by myself and other representatives particularly in relation to my own constituency have gone unheeded so far as the Government is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not associate myself with that statement because my experience is that any representations I made were reasonably met as regards certain matters in connection with the islands, <Col N="776" /> especially by the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Department of Lands.  I had occasion to visit Deputy Childers as Minister for Lands and Deputy Moran as Minister for the Gaeltacht in connection with the mail boat and the Gaeltacht fishing boat. We got both of these and I think they cost about £14,000 each.  We also got a grant of £1,500 from the Department of the Gaeltacht to be spread over a period of three years&mdash;1958, 1959 and 1960 for the improvement of the road on Cape Clear.  That in itself should make a very good job of the island road.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with the terms of the motion but I would agree with anything that would be for the benefit of the islands. What we want is to improve conditions on the islands and to create conditions under which the population will increase.  I have offered these suggestions at the request of the Minister for Finance and I hope that when the time comes he will not hesitate to grant extra money for the <Col N="777" /> benefit of the islands.  Money talks and the lack of money on those islands is responsible for the depopulation of them.  Vegetable growing and fruit growing would also be a great help.</P>

      <P>The valuation of the islands will be vastly increased if the plans which I am putting to the Minister to-night are implemented.  I am fully behind any proposal which will help the development of the islands the people of which are the essence of Irish nationality.  They are the old aristocracy of this country. They have travelled the seven seas of the world and are excellent sailors and a credit to their country, especially those from Cape Clear and Castletownberehaven.  It would be a good thing if we could help them in any way and I think that we should be able to help them in many ways.</P>
      <P>I do not think that a revision of valuations is the only remedy.  The better one is to improve conditions on the islands, provide amenities and work for the islanders.  If that is done, then you will have more contentment and a better living for the people on the islands.</P>

These people do not receive the benefits for which they are rated.  In justice, they must either get all the amenities for which the ratepayers of Cork pay, or else they should not have to pay for amenities they do not receive.  The only way to do that is to revise the valuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's statement, it was evident that he is not very knowledgeable so far as island conditions are concerned. He made that fact quite clear himself.  I agree with portion of his statement that this is a matter that would require further consideration from him.  That was a frank statement by the Minister.  All other Deputies who spoke supported the motion, but I must express disappointment that my colleague from West Cork, like the Minister, seemed not to be too conversant with island conditions either.</P>
      <P>The last speaker, Deputy Corry, put the whole thing in a nutshell when he stated, as a Deputy not directly interested in this motion, that if we do not provide amenities for people, we should not charge them for them.  If we do not give services, we should not take money for them.  Is that not a reasonable attitude?  As I said in my opening statement, these valuations were assessed in 1852, 107 years ago. Conditions on the mainland have changed considerably since 1852.  Conditions on the islands have changed also, but the changes are not of the same magnitude as those on the mainland. The Minister for Finance stated that one of the difficulties in accepting a motion of this kind would be the likelihood of similar motions appearing in respect of some of the remoter districts on the mainland.  I think the Minister is unduly worried about that. No matter how remote you are on the mainland, you have a firm road under you to take you from one part to another if you need a priest or a doctor.  But on the islands one is surrounded by the deep sea and cut away from the many amenities I enumerated on the previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> In replying I shall refer only to the statements made in the course of the debate.  The Minister told us that educational facilities on the island were almost as good as those on the mainland.  I am afraid the Minister is sadly mistaken.  I would not charge the Minister with telling a deliberate untruth in this House&mdash;he is not a man to make deceptive statements&mdash; but he must not be conversant with the position.  What do we find on the islands?  We find that in a few of the smaller islands there are no educational facilities whatever and that the small number of children in these islands have great difficulty in getting educational facilities.  When applications are made to the Department for help in procuring these facilities, the Department do not view them as favourably as they should.  It is very difficult to get that kind of help from the Department.  So much for national or primary education.</P>
    <P>I know of no island where secondary school or vocational school facilities exist.  That immediately brings to our mind that any pupil living on an island at the present time cannot attain to any of what I might describe as the higher paid posts in this country, because none of them, with possibly very few exceptions&mdash; those who have friends on the mainland&mdash;can avail of secondary education and without that, as every Deputy knows, it is impossible to attain to these higher posts.  Therefore, we see that, looking at it from the educational aspect, these children, by virtue of being surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, are cut adrift from secondary education, except, as I said, the small number who may have good friends on the mainland who may provide accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>It may be said that though an island holder has no secondary or vocational education facilities on the island he has the same right to send a son or daughter to a boarding school as people on the mainland do.  The answer to that is obvious.  People living on islands are not in a financial position to do that, and it would be completely impossible for them to save <Col N="780" /> sufficient money from their slender and meagre incomes to send members of their families to boarding schools with the exception of a very, very small number.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to postal facilities on the islands and said that some few islands had a daily post. He said others had a postal service four days weekly and still others only one day weekly.  I did not refer to that aspect of the position in my opening statement because I appreciate that it is utterly ridiculous to ask for daily postal deliveries for a small island.  I have no complaints, as far as postal deliveries are concerned, from any island in West Cork but what I did try to bring about, in so far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is concerned, was that on the island adjacent to my own home, Long Island, where there are fifty residents, the Department, on both occasions I made the request, refused to install a telephone on that island.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that this is a grave, major disability because, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, if a person on Long Island gets sick and needs clerical or medical attention, people would have to row across a mile of the Atlantic and subsequently walk two miles to the nearest town, Schull, to get these facilities and, if it were a rough and windy night, the task could not be performed at all. I am sure Deputies will agree with me that, in so far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is concerned, the island holders have not proper facilities, and I am putting forward the position in Long Island in support of that fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the Department of Agriculture schemes on the islands were somewhat similar or as good as those obtaining on the mainland.  I say again that that statement is not a fact.  Does everybody not know that until the removal of the subsidies for milk production quite recently, the State subsidised milk production in every part of the country, with the exception of the majority of the islands where there are no creamery facilities?  Only two <Col N="781" /> or three islands around the coast from Donegal to Cork have any creamery facilities and, as a result, small holders on them who were producing milk, were not a burden on the Exchequer inasmuch as that milk was turned into home-made butter and sold without any charge on the produced on the mainland, where creamery facilities were available, was a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Bearing out that statement, I understand that the State-sponsored body, the Dairy Disposals Board which, if I may say so, did very good work in remote areas, after consideration of the island position submitted a memorandum to the Government stating that in their opinion island holders were entitled to some facilities as far as milk production was concerned, and they recommended that butter produced on the islands be allocated a subsidy of 6d. per lb.  They felt this would be the most economical way of dealing with milk and butter production on the islands, that it would be fair to the people on the islands, and that they were entitled to the subsidy.  However, I regret to say that the recommendation of the Dairy Disposals Board was rejected but it is evident, once they made that recommendation, that the board were completely satisfied island holders were in a completely different position, as far as butter production was concerned, from those on the mainland.</P>
    <P>I may say that the Minister for Finance has made possibly the most amazing statement ever heard in this House when he said that the value of land on many islands was as high as the average value of land in County Wexford.  I happen to know County Wexford reasonably well.  It is a good, rich, mixed farming county and I am sure that the value of land in it is reasonably high.  Surely the Minister, in making that statement, knew it was not a fair statement to make?  Surely it is a gross exaggeration?  I do not, however, put it down as a deceitful statement, nor do I attribute the making of a deceitful statement to the Minister.  I attribute it to the fact that the poor man&mdash;if I may use the term &mdash;has no knowledge of the value of <Col N="782" /> land on the islands.  I could give him some idea of the value of island land, at least on six or seven of them in my own immediate neighbourhood.  It is impossible to sell land on the islands. People who migrated from the islands could not obtain any price for their land and had to close their doors and abandon the land.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the land&mdash;I only mention this as incidental to a statement made by the Minister in relation to the value of land on islands and in County Wexford&mdash;it is no harm to remind the House that the Land Commission have refused to help in the relief of congestion on any of these islands over the past few years.  They have closed down on relieving congestion and the information at our disposal is that they are not likely to resume activities in that regard.</P>
    <P>There was one major point to which I referred and to which the Minister also referred; indeed it was because of this particular point that I was anxious to have the Minister in the House. When we had this discussion last week I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that it has come to my notice that in other counties&mdash;Mayo, Clare and Galway have been mentioned&mdash; island holders who are resident on islands do not pay more than 50 per cent. of their rates.</P>
    <P>If that is the position on islands in Mayo, Clare and Galway, irrespective of whether or not the holdings are economic, surely the Government should bring about some uniformity in the payment of local revenue by island holders everywhere?  I can see no reason why there should be discrimination as between these islands and other islands.  The Minister did not elaborate on the position in that regard.  He more or less agreed that the position was as stated.  Surely there is an obligation on him and his Government to deal with this problem and ensure equity for all? I am hopeful the Minister will address himself to this matter during the next few months and that we shall have information from him as to the position obtaining in islands as a whole and the steps he proposes to take to deal with it. <Col N="783" /> My colleague from West Cork said that some of the island holders are not doing too badly.  I have not the same knowledge as my colleague.  I doubt, however, if any Deputy has had more dealings with island people than I have had.  I live in very close proximity to a number of these islands.  We were told about two boats which were made available to Cape Clear.  Those boats were made available in the lifetime of the previous Government. When I say that, I am not casting any reflection on the activities of the present Government in that particular regard; the previous Government were meeting only part of their obligations when they provided these boats for the Irishspeaking islanders of Cape Clear.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with many of the statements made by the Minister but I do not think I should press this matter to a division.  The only obligation resting on me, or on any Deputy similarly placed, is to bring to the notice of the Government as forcibly and vehemently as I can the disabilities encountered by people living on these islands.  Those who have supported me in this debate have done that.  The Minister has assured us that the matter requires further consideration.  It is only right that the Minister should have time to give the matter that further consideration.  I appreciate it is difficult for the Government and the Minister to make up their minds on such a question in a short time.  I am prepared to allow the Minister a fair time and I believe that a fair time would represent three or four months. I hope, therefore, that by the end of the financial year the Minister will be able to give us further particulars as to the benefits he may have in mind for these island people.  He himself mentioned some of their disabilities. He asked for time to consider the position.  I am agreeable to giving him that time.  I hope that, as a result of the examination which he and his Department will institute into this matter, when the House has occasion to deal with it again by way of question, or some other method, the Minister will be able three or four months hence to give us information that will be beneficial to the islanders <Col N="784" /> concerned.  I hope, too, that we shall have more facts then from the Minister about the disabilities under which these people labour, facts which are not in his possession at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not see that any useful purpose would be served by pressing this motion to a division now.  I hope that in the not too distant future the Minister will have a policy and a programme outlined for these people. I hope that the policy will be uniform for all the islands off our coast.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion I made it quite clear that any reductions afforded to these islanders should not be made at the expense of the other ratepayers in the county.  They should not be a county charge.  The rates remitted should be met by a grant-in-aid from the appropriate State department.  I want to make that quite clear.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, as a practical step to stimulate increased production through the improvement of the fertility of our land by badly needed drainage schemes and at the same time help to relieve unemployment in rural areas the necessary moneys to put the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation should be provided immediately.</P>
      <P>I had not expected that the debate on the very interesting motion put down by Deputy Murphy would have concluded so early tonight.  I feel that the Minister for Local Government possibly thought likewise; otherwise, I feel that he would be present for my opening remarks on what is undoubtedly a very important subject, particularly for rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the majority of Deputies agree that excellent work in drainage and liming was carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and that the majority of Deputies, including those on the Government benches if free to do so, would enthusiastically <Col N="785" /> support the resumption of work under that Act.  I cannot personally understand why it was decided to suspend operations under the Act.  Various reasons have been given by responsible Ministers.  One of the strongest allegations made in the House or outside it by the opponents of the Act was that money was wasted on schemes carried out, that consequently the Government decided that, on balance, more money was wasted than was used in an economic way and as a result the decision was taken to suspend the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think that argument is true or that it can be backed up and proved. The fact is that the majority of county councils today do not subscribe to that point of view and the General Council of County Councils have repeatedly sought on behalf of every local authority in Ireland to have the moneys restored so that further useful and beneficial schemes can be carried out.  There is no denial, I think, on the part of the Minister that the General Council of County Councils have urged a resumption of work under the Act.  Apart altogether from that, individual local authorities have separately and repeatedly requested funds to carry out more schemes under this Act.</P>
    <P>We know that when the Act came in as a Bill originally a number of people in the Fianna Fáil Opposition at that time expressed themselves strongly against the measure.  Deputies need only consult the records of the House to find that several divisions were challenged in connection with amendments put forward by the then Fianna Fáil Opposition.  However, the Act was passed; moneys were made available and the schemes were put into operation in various counties. After twelve months when the local authorities saw how successfully the schemes were operated and the benefits conferred on the farmers, the majority of those who had professed fears in regard to the usefulness of the Act naturally changed their minds with the result that there was an almost unanimous opinion in all Parties and in the various local authorities that the Act was an excellent one and should be continued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> It would appear to me now that a few individuals in the Fianna Fáil Party were in a position to carry forward their objections even when this Act was passed.  Later on, they were in the position when they became the Government to thwart the operations of the local authorities in this regard. I think it is a case of men with small minds in the Party being allowed to dictate policy inside the Fianna Fáil Party itself on this very important matter of drainage.  These people objected to the Bill when it came to the House; they persisted in their objections afterwards and they have successfully halted the excellent work being carried out under it.  If they were backed up on logical grounds, one could appreciate their objections but it appears their objections are mainly based on the fact that originally they took a dislike to the scheme and decided to make sure that when they got into office they would prevent it operating.</P>
    <P>I know there is a limited number in Fianna Fáil who strongly object to the resumption of the scheme and I also know that those concerned are so powerful that quite a substantial number of backbenchers in the Party are not able to assert themselves and force these people to see the light of day in regard to this Act.</P>
    <P>I read recently&mdash;and I was glad to read&mdash;that at the Fianna Fáil ÁrdFheis some supporters of the Party from my own constituency brought forward a motion urging and requesting the Government to resume operations, and that motion by Roscommon delegates so far as I can find out was passed unanimously by the organisation and, as such, was a direction to the Cabinet to continue the good work.  That was a motion from a rural area, from people who understand drainage problems and the problems of farmers all over Ireland. They did not put down that motion at the Árd-Fheis for fun.  The Fianna Fáil Party have always maintained that they are a democratic body, that they believe in anything directed towards the benefit of rural Ireland. If that is true, I hope that before next February the moneys will be made available to carry on schemes some <Col N="787" /> of which are already prepared and are just awaiting the necessary financial accommodation to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Let us deal for a moment with the argument that money was wasted under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If every State scheme over the years is examined occasionally it can be asserted in connection with each one of them that there was a certain amount of money lavishly expended or wasted.  That argument can be used by people who are opposed to certain schemes.  It is always possible to find fault with something that one does not like or for which one's opponent was responsible but, when we ask for concrete evidence in the House as to where and in which county money was wasted under the Act, no evidence is adduced.</P>
    <P>I have listened to allegedly responsible Ministers stating in this House and outside it that money was wasted under the Act.  I have sought information as to where and in what counties it was wasted.  There was no answer. There is the extraordinary situation that county councillors and Deputies of the Government Party have stated in their respective counties: &ldquo;We believe that the Local Authorities (Works) Act has functioned excellently in our county.  No money was wasted in our county.  It was in some other county it was wasted.&rdquo;  That allegation has been made at every county council. In Roscommon I have heard spokesmen of the Government Party saying that, to their knowledge, no money was ever wasted in County Roscommon and that the Act should be resumed so far as Roscommon is concerned, that if there was wastage it must have taken place in the South of Ireland.  In the following week one can read in the provincial papers that Cork County Council or some other southern county council had requested the resumption of operations under the Act on the basis that excellent work had been done in that county and that if there was wastage it took place in some other county.</P>
    <P>The major objection to resumption of the Act is the alleged waste of money in the past.  If the Government <Col N="788" /> stand over that objection, I challenge them here and now to make available to the House evidence of waste of money, where it took place and the amount involved.  That is a fair challenge.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Government have had second thoughts about resuming work under the Act.  It may be that the request made in the House, the request made by local authorities and the reasonable request made to their party at the Árd-Fheis have fallen on sympathetic ears and that the present Minister for Local Government, whom I know to be in favour of drainage, will make the necessary money available with the greatest possible speed so that work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act may continue.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government rightly urged local authorities to submit to the Government proposals, the implementation of which would help to expand production from the land.  Every county council received a communication from the Minister for Local Government requesting, at the earliest opportunity, a list of proposals which could be implemented that would increase production and improve the economy generally.  From what source can we achieve greater expansion of the national wealth than we can from the land?  All Parties in the House have decided, after years of experience, that if the country is to make any progress economically and if we are to maintain the limited political freedom which we have, agriculture must be expanded, that there must be the most diverse forms of agriculture and the most intensive cultivation of the land.  Can such expansion be achieved from land that is waterlogged? Is there anything more nonsensical than to appeal to decent farmers, big and small, all over Ireland, to produce more, to grow more grass, to carry more cattle on their land, if there are lakes surrounding their farmhouses?  Where is the opportunity in such circumstances to increase production?</P>
    <P>I emphasise that point to the Minister <Col N="789" /> because the slogan of the Government for some time has been, &ldquo;Export or perish&rdquo;.  I suppose that refers to exports of agricultural produce and that the implication is that, if we do not adopt a dynamic approach to the development of exports, we cannot hope for an alternative expansion from industries which are not based on the land and which draw their raw materials from abroad.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more disheartening to the farming community than exhortations in this House, on the radio and at various public functions, from the Taoiseach and Cabinet Ministers, to increase production when the farmers are in misery, their land and fields being flooded.  The commonsense approach is to provide money for drainage of land which can then be fertilised and put in a condition to enable the necessary economic expansion to be achieved.  There is no sense whatever in asking farmers to increase production if we fail to put the land into proper condition.  It is exasperating and annoying to farmers to be told that money has been wasted <Col N="790" /> under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and that it is not considered wise to spend more money under the Act.</P>

      <P>The rate of expansion of State Forestry in Co. Limerick, as elsewhere, <Col N="679" /> will be determined by the rate at which land suitable for planting can be acquired by my Department. It would be impracticable for me to attempt to forecast what the future employment level on forestry work in the county will be since this will to a large extent depend on the extent of the planting programmes at the particular centres and the volume of general management and maintenance work available.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible will be done to speed up the acquisition of land for planting in Co. Limerick and to increase the annual planting programmes there.</P>
      <P>The total productive area at present held by my Department at the five forests in Co. Limerick is 6,608 acres. Of this, a total of 5,194 acres has been planted.  In the current season additional areas totalling 727 acres will be planted in Co. Limerick, compared with 280 acres last year.  The total number of men at present employed on State Forestry work in the county is 81.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> As regards land acquisition prospects in the county, the position is that at a recent date agreement to purchase 4 areas totalling 556 acres had been reached and title had either been cleared or was in course of clearance.  Negotiations for the purchase of 16 other areas totalling 860 acres were in progress and there were 52 cases with a total area of 3,716 acres at the preliminary stages of investigation.</P>
