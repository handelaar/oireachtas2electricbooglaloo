    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that an estimated 58,100 persons reached schoolleaving ages in 1959, while only 28,200 young persons entered insurable employment; whether the remaining 30,000 have emigrated or have been unable to find employment; and if he will indicate the Government's plans for the provision of employment for young persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 58,100 mentioned in the Deputy's Question is an estimate of the number of children who will have reached the age of 14 years in 1959.  It will be obvious, however, that not all those who attain that age in 1959 thereupon cease their schooling.  Taking account of those leaving school at ages later than 14 years the total number of young persons leaving school in 1959 is estimated to be 55,000.</P>
      <P>Taking the period from 6th January, 1958, to 3rd January, 1959, in the case of males, and the period from 7th July, 1958, to 4th July, 1959, in the case of females, the estimated total number of insurance cards issued to persons aged 16 and 17 years was 28,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be reasonable to deduct the figure of 28,200 from the figure of 55,000 for the purpose of drawing conclusions.  Apart from other considerations, these figures relate to <Col N="956" /> different periods and the figure for the number of insurance cards issued was limited, as I have said, to persons aged 16 and 17 years.</P>
    <P>There is, already, evidence that the Government's Programme for Economic Expansion is promoting increased employment opportunities generally, As the implementation of the Programme proceeds, it will, I hope, progressively reduce the difficulties of placing young persons in employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to publish proposals for the expansion of employment this year.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in view of the fact that there are 40,000 less wholetime wage earners in the State at present as compared with 1957 he will state what steps he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The statement that there are 40,000 less wholetime wage earners at present than there were in 1957 is not a correct representation of the facts.  As I explained in my reply to a Dáil Question on the 25th November, analysis of the statistics indicates that about the autumn of 1956 a very sharp fall in employment began, which, by the beginning of 1957, amounted to a reduction in employment of about 40,000.  By the beginning of 1958 a check in the fall had occurred, and during 1958 relatively little change took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the estimate given in a reply to another Dáil Question on the 11th November, the weekly average number of persons in insurable employment during the year ended 31st March, 1959, was 25,700 less than the weekly average number of persons in insurable employment during the year ended 31st March, 1957.  Since the beginning of 1959 <Col N="957" /> there has been a marked upward trend.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should repeat in this connection that, apart from a general census, there are no means of ascertaining the total number of persons in whole-time employment at a specific date. There are quarterly statistics relating to persons engaged in transportable goods industries and annual statistics relating to employees and other male persons engaged in agriculture, but the employees in the personal service, commercial, etc., sectors of the employment field, representing over one-third of the total number in insurable employment, are not the subject of either quarterly or annual statistics. The best indication of the general employment position is obtained from the estimates of average numbers of persons in insurable employment derived from the quarterly statistics of insurance stamps sold.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to what either Deputy has in mind about publishing proposals in connection with unemployment. Every economic proposal made by the Government, in a number of Bills presented to the Dáil in the present year, to implement the Programme for Economic Expansion or otherwise, has a bearing on the employment situation, and has among its chief objects the promotion of conditions in which there will be increased opportunities of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of clarification, could the Taoiseach tell us is it or is it not correct that, on the figures furnished by him to the House as the last available figures for the years 1956, 1957 and 1958, there was a reduction in the number of persons employed in each of the years mentioned by him on that occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in getting into an argument about the exact significance of statistics which are themselves of doubtful validity. The point I was making was that there are three categories of employees in respect of whom information is necessary to enable any estimate to be given. In the first category are those engaged in industry, in the manufacture of transportable goods, or similar industrial occupations.  In relation to persons so engaged, there are quarterly figures available and it is possible to produce an annual average number based upon them.  In the second category are persons engaged in agriculture and there are figures representing those who are so occupied&mdash;male persons&mdash;whether as employees or farm owners and those figures relate only to one date in each year and give no indication of any seasonal fluctuations or any changes in the employment situation occuring within the year. In the third category are those engaged in hotels, in commerce and finance and all the other groups that are neither industrial nor agricultural.  There are no figures at all for that category of persons which represents as much as one-third of the total labour force of the country.  Any figures that may be published regarding the total number of persons in employment at any time are, at best, very inaccurate guesses. The only certainty of getting the precise figure for any date is through a census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that in the figures the Taoiseach gave us on a previous occasion&mdash;the only figures available to us&mdash;there was shown a decline in the total number of persons employed?  Each of the three years mentioned, 1956, 1957 and 1958, showed a decline from the present year.</P>

      <P>The position as I have said in reply to the question, is that there was a very sharp fall in the number of persons in employment in the last quarter of 1956 which continued almost to the end of 1957.  It did not stop until approaching the end of that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the <Col N="960" /> Taoiseach if he will give particulars of any net increase in the volume of whole-time employment where insured workers are concerned since the Government's Programme for Economic Expansion was published in November, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nine months ended 30th September, 1959, the number of insurance stamps sold amounted to 18,616,500 as compared with 18,271,200 in the nine months ended 30th September, 1958 was 345,300 which crease over 1958 was 345,300 which presents an average increase of 8,854 insured workers per week throughout the nine months as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year.</P>
      <P>As the annual exchange of insurance cards for male workers, beginning in the month of January, is apparently the occasion of considerable purchases of insurance stamps in arrear, it has been usual to associate the March quarter figures with those of the previous nine months to provide a better-timed picture of employment trends, as I did on 11th November in reply to a Question in this House about the numbers in insurable employment over the past four years.  On this basis a better idea of the postNovember 1958 position would probably be gained by comparing insurance stamp purchases in the six months ended 30th September, 1959, with the corresponding period in 1958. Stamp purchases were 11,719,800 and 11,276,400, respectively, showing an increase of 443,400 in the 1959 period. This is equivalent to an increase of 17,052 in the average number of insured workers per week in April to September, 1959, as compared with the similar period in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say why those figures were not published in the series issued a few days ago?  Will he also say whether it is now his contention that the sales of insurance stamps are always to operate a quarter late?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The point which I am trying to make is that those who seek to make calculations <Col N="961" /> as to employment trends from insurance stamp sales would be better advised to do it on the basis of the financial year rather than the calendar year because abnormal conditions tend to exist at the beginning of the calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say what account was taken in those statistics of the increase in the upward limit for those bound to have their cards stamped, in the legislation enacted at the instance of the Minister for Social Welfare this time last year?  That is bound to cause an increase in the number of stamps being sold.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the number of persons in insurable employment calculated on the basis of insurance stamps sold for each of the years ended 31st December, 1956, 1957, and 1958, and to the latest available date in 1959.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the number of Social Welfare Insurance stamps sold in each of the calendar years 1956, 1957 and 1958 it is estimated that the average numbers of persons in insurable employment in these years were 498,500, 463,100 and 462,100 respectively.  The corresponding figure for the twelve months ended 30 September, 1959, was 468,760.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that the period in which stamps are purchased does not necessarily coincide with that in which the relevant employment was obtained.  This lack of coincidence may be particularly marked in the case of calendar year periods since the Social Welfare Insurance cards for males fall due for exchange in the beginning of January and it is likely that a sizable proportion of the stamps purchased early in the calendar year relate to employment in the preceding year.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the commodities included in the calculation of the cost of living index figure which have increased in price since March, 1957, (b) the prices of such commodities on (i) 1st March, 1957 and (ii) the latest convenient date, and (c) the percentage increase in each case.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report, a statement showing <Col N="971" /> (a)  the national average retail prices of certain items of food in mid-February 1957 and mid-August 1959, and the differences between them, and (b)  the percentage change in prices of all items entering into the Consumer Price Index between the two periods. In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful. <Col N="972" /> The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive enquiries. Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices as given in (b), computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentages calculated from (a).</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">(a) NATIONAL Average Retail Prices of Food at mid-February 1957 and mid-August 1959 and the difference between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether in view of the statement made by the Irish Medical Association that there is no ban against medical practitioners applying for posts under the Local Appointments Commission, he will state fully what significance he attaches to a statement appearing in the current issue of the Irish Medical Journal, which is considered to be the official organ of the Irish Medical Association, to the effect that medical practitioners are requested not to apply for, accept or sit on interview boards for specified appointments without first communicating with the medical secretary of the Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medical Association, in its public statement of <Col N="981" /> 13th June last denying the existence of any ban, sought to explain the notice asking medical practitioners not to apply for or accept certain posts in the service of local authorities without first consulting the association as merely a means of enabling the Association to explain to prospective candidates for the posts concerned the terms and conditions of services attaching to such posts, a work of supererogation since the candidates are persons with sufficient general education to read and understand the documents issued to them in connection with their candidature.</P>
      <P>The request to medical practitioners not to sit on interview boards is quite inconsistent with the statement of 13th June.  The Local Appointments Commissioners are careful not to invite to sit on interview boards any person who is not highly qualified and mature in experience.  It is difficult to accept that persons of such standing should require instruction from the Association or otherwise as to how they should comport themselves on such boards.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this question. It is the practice of the Local Appointments Commissioners to ask persons invited to sit on boards to regard the invitation as confidential. The purpose underlying this practice is obvious.  The Commissioners must take all possible steps to ensure that the selection of candidates is purely on merit and is not subject to outside influences.  The action of the Irish Medical Association in asking persons invited to sit on boards to break confidence with the Local Appointments Commissioners by disclosing the fact to that Association is not calculated to reassure the public in this regard.</P>
      <P>In general, I regard the notice as an attempt on the part of the Association to impede the proper functioning of the health services by seeking to interfere with the proper working of the machinery laid down by law for securing the recruitment of the most highly qualified personnel.</P>

I am concerned that this controversy should not be prolonged; but I have a duty to make it quite clear that statements which have been made that there is no ban are in fact without foundation and that on the contrary there is in fact a very active ban.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the means of holders of qualification certificates must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of a holder e.g. acquirement of property, marriage, change of address.  The means of self-employed persons must also be re-examined periodically. Apart from the other reasons mentioned the means of a holder of a qualification certificate must also be re-investigated if his circumstances have not been reviewed for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployment assistance cases in County Kerry reviewed by officers of my Department, in the discharge of their statutory duties, in each of the two years ended 30th November, 1958 and 1959 was 535 and 963 respectively.

      <P>A person who does not reside more than six miles from a local office of my Department is required to attend at such office if he desires to claim unemployment benefit. He is required at the same time to hand in his insurance card and to furnish the name and address of his last employer and the commencing and terminating dates of his employment. The employer is required to verify the facts of his employment and to confirm that he has no further employment available for the claimant. The claimant is also required to make a declaration to the effect that he is unemployed and capable and available for work.  So long as he remains unemployed a person is required to continue to prove unemployment by signature of the register of unemployed on each week day, or, with certain exceptions, less frequently if he resides over two miles from a local office of my Department.  A person who resides over six miles from a local office attends once a week at his local Garda Station or other approved signing centres to prove his unemployment.</P>

In order to make myself clear to the Parliamentary Secretary, might I tell him that is no case that I know of has either the employer's word or the employee's word been taken?  It seems as if a number of Gestapo have been let loose by the Parliamentary Secretary for the purpose of discrediting decent employers and their employees all over the country and telling them that they are a lot of liars.</P>

      <P>An applicant for benefit may offer sworn testimony in the form of a statutory declaration to a deciding officer or at the appeals stage and this would of course form part of the evidence.  At oral hearings of appeals against decisions disallowing benefit, it is not usual to take evidence on oath unless the decision imputes fraud to the appellant, but should the appellant ask to give evidence on oath it would be taken if it were deemed to be necessary or in his interest.  Where the decision under appeal concerns insurability of employment, it is the practice to take evidence on oath.  It is not the practice of the Department to reject offers of sworn testimony.</P>

Such being the case is he aware that this historic building which dates back to A.D. 1200, is a tourist attraction to that part of Ireland and should not be lost to the nation?

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I do so on behalf of the Minister for Finance, who is unable to be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for the payment of the increases in civil pensions payable <Col N="1021" /> from the Exchequer or other public funds, including the funds of local and harbour authorities, which the Minister for Finance announced in the Budget last April.  Under the authority of an Additional Estimate passed by this House on 21st July last, increases have already been paid in most cases with effect from 1st August last.  This Bill now provides permanent statutory authority for the payments.  Army Retired Pay, Disability Pensions and Military Service Pensions are not covered by this Bill; the increases in these pensions will be covered by separate legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides increases of 6 per cent. on pensions that were calculated on the salaries payable prior to the general Civil Service pay increase of 1st November, 1948, and 4 per cent. on pensions calculated on the salaries payable during the period after the general pay increase of 1st November, 1948, and before the pay increase of 1st November, 1952.  In some instances the pay increases corresponding to the Civil Service pay increases of 1st November, 1948, or 1st November, 1952, were granted on other dates.  In such cases the actual date of the pay increase will be adopted to determine whether a 6 per cent. or 4 per cent. increase is payable, and provision has been made accordingly in the Bill.  In speaking of the 1st November, 1948, and the 1st November, 1952, I should wish to be understood as referring also to any alternative dates that are prescribed or may be determined under the Bill.</P>
    <P>This year's pensions increases are directed to the relief of those whose pensions were calculated on salaries below the rates which came into effect with the general pay increase of November, 1952.  The pre-November, 1948, pensioners, who are longest retired, will get the higher increase of 6 per cent. so as to bring their pensions further towards the 1952 level. No increase is proposed for pensions which were calculated wholly on the increased rates of salary payable on or after the 1st November, 1952.  As a corollary, any pension which has already been brought up to the <Col N="1022" /> November, 1952, level by a previous pension increase will not get any further increase under the Bill, and no pension may be increased under the Bill beyond the amount which would be payable to a colleague of identical rank and service who retired on the 1st November, 1952, and whose pension was calculated wholly by reference to the higher salary rates introduced on that date.</P>
    <P>The classes of pensions to be increased are described in the Schedule to the Bill.  Part I of the Schedule covers the pensions of retired civil servants, teachers, gardaí, etc., whose pensions were fixed by reference to levels of remuneration obtaining prior to the pay increase of 1st November, 1948, or the appropriate alternative date.  These pensions will be increased by 6 per cent.  Any other pension which was included in Part I of the Schedule to the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, and which has not yet been raised to the November, 1952, level, will be increased by 4 per cent. subject to the application of the overriding maximum to which I have already referred. The percentage increases will be calculated on the pension as it stands, including any increases under previous Acts.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Schedule covers the pensions payable to the widows and children of Ministers and holders of parliamentary offices and to the widows of gardaí, etc.  Most of these pensions are payable at fixed rates which do not vary automatically with pay increases.  The basis rates of these pensions were fixed prior to 1948; they have already been increased under the Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1950, and 1956, and they will now be increased by the 6 per cent. appropriate to pre-November, 1948, pensions.  The increases establish new fixed rates which will be effective for future pensions as well as for pensions currently in course of payment.</P>
    <P>Most of the pensions to be increased under the Bill were calculated on the annual salary payable at the date of the officer's retirement.  In a small number of cases, however, pension was calculated on average salary for the three years preceding retirement. <Col N="1023" /> Special provision has been made in Section 7 of the Bill to allow part of the 6 per cent. or 4 per cent. increase, proportionate to the part of the three-year average period which fell before the 1st November, 1948, or the 1st November, 1952, respectively, to be given in such cases.  Any similar cases among local authority or harbour authority pensioners have been provided for in Parts III and IV of the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>A small number of pensioners, mainly higher civil servants, who retired prior to the pay increase of 15th January, 1951, received pensions which were affected by the salary reduction known as the &ldquo;supercut&rdquo;. The supercut, which originated as a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus on higher Civil Service salaries, continued over into the consolidated salary rates which obtained from 1946 onwards until it was removed partially in 1948 and completely in January, 1951.</P>
    <P>The pensions payable to officers who retired while the supercut was in force were based on the lower salaries. Under Sections 3 and 4 of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, these pensioners were given either a revision of pension to restore the supercut reduction or the appropriate percentage increase under the Act, whichever was the more favourable.  Following representations from the pensioners concerned, these provisions are now being amended by Section 2 of the present Bill to restore the supercut reduction in all cases and to allow the appropriate percentage increases under the 1956 Act and this Bill.  The effect of this will be to bring the basis of these pensions into line with the pensions of other ranks of the Civil Service whose pensions were based on salaries in which the cost-of-living bonus element was not subject to reduction.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Bill authorise the appropriate increases in the pensions payable from the Exchequer. Sections 5 and 6 empower local authorities and harbour authorities to grant increases in the pensions payable by them which are specified in Part III and Part IV of the <Col N="1024" /> Schedule.  The increases will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health in the case of local authority pensions and to the approval of the Minister for Transport and Power in the case of harbour authority pensions.  The increases allowed will be similar in amount and will be generally subject to the conditions and limitations governing increases in Exchequer pensions.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides the commencing date of increases, which will be the 1st August, 1959, or the date of commencement of pension if later.</P>
    <P>Various consequential provisions will be found in Section 10 which provides, in particular, for the application to the pension, as increased, of the statutory provisions as to payment, etc., applicable to the original pension. It also provides that any increase in the Bill shall not be assessed as means for the purpose of an old age pension or a widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the increases provided under this Bill is estimated at over £70,000 in a full year, including Exchequer payments to local authorities to cover part of the increase payable by them.  In the current year the cost will be over £38,000.  The balance of the £72,000 voted by this House in July last will be required for increases in Army and Military Service Pensions which will be covered in separate legislation. Including the increases in these pensions, the total cost to the Exchequer of the 1959 pensions increases is estimated at almost £130,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House for its approval.</P>

      <P>This Bill follows the announcement by the Minister for Finance in the Budget of an increase in the rates of pension payable but there are two aspects in relation to which the Bill falls very short of what is expected by those affected. In the first place, I failed to understand&mdash;I have not got the text&mdash;in so far as I could hear it the reply to-day of the Minister for Finance to Deputy <Col N="1025" /> Norton about the categories, the number of pensioners in each category.</P>
      <P>In 1956, when the Bill was going through the House there was no difficulty whatever in obtaining the segregation of the number of pensioners under seven different categories running from under £100 per annum to over £450 per annum.  The total number of pensioners then involved in respect of pensions paid from State funds was 6,800.  Of those, 1,570 were in receipt of pensions of under £100 per annum; 530 received pensions of between £100 and £125 per annum; 515 received pensions of between £125 and £150 per annum; 1,710 received pensions of between £150 and £200 per annum; 1,730 received pensions of between £200 and £300 per annum and 360 received pensions of between £300 and £450 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister, in reply to a question, saying that the information was not now available.  The information was available then and the Minister for Finance should have made it available.  The reason that information should be so available is the difference between the approach made by the present Minister for Finance and the approach made in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The smaller pensions in 1956 received a very much greater increase than is being given in this Bill.  Then, as now, the pensioner with £450 per annum received six per cent. or, to be more strictly accurate, then he always received six per cent.  Now in certain circumstances he receives only four per cent. but the person with the small pension and who, therefore, found the cost of living increase pinching hardest upon him was given an increase of 15 per cent. compared with the six per <Col N="1026" /> cent. or the four per cent. offered by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The person between the limits of £125 and £150 per annum, under our scheme, got an increase of 12 per cent. and the person between £200 and £300 per annum, under our scheme, got nine per cent.  This Government think that people with small pensions like these should be restricted and cut down in some cases, as I say, to less than half of what they were given by the Act passed in 1956.</P>
    <P>Apart from that the Bill falls short very materially in another aspect.  It takes no account whatever of the hardship that pensioners who retired since 1955 had to suffer between that date and 1958.  We all know that in 1955 there was an increase in the pay of civil servants and people paid by the State.  A person who retired after 1955 retired on the basis of the pay calculated by reference to the increase which he had obtained but the person who retired between 1952 and 1955 received nothing under this Bill and was not in the Service to get the increase allotted in 1955.  He, therefore, is getting the knock in the measure now introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In addition, there was another increase in 1958.  I cannot remember whether it was at the end of 1957 or at the beginning of 1958 but the exact date is immaterial.  Anybody who retired since 1958 has had his pension calculated on his Civil Service salary as augmented by the 1958 increase, but anybody who retired before 1958, between 1955 and 1958, is not getting any increase in pension under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must acknowledge, particularly for those who retired between 1952 and 1955 and who are not given any benefit under this Bill, that the cost of living has gone up since 1952 just as much as it has gone up for everyone else who has to take account of what has to be bought week in and week out, but there is no provision at all for them.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why, when the Minister was introducing this Bill, he not alone did not, first of all, give increases of six per cent. and four <Col N="1027" /> per cent. to all pensioners but did not, in addition, follow the pattern set by us in the 1956 Act and give a greater increase to those at the bottom of the scale who needed it so badly and why he did not make provision more particularly for those who retired between 1952 and 1955 who are feeling the pinch at this time more and, perhaps a great deal more, than anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can ascertain, the approximate cost of this pension increase is £72,000 in respect of the eight months ending March, 1960, but the pension increase of 1956 provided for an increase of £120,000 and the increase provided for in the 1950 Act was £200,000, so that, in fact, the increase provided now appears to be the smallest of the three increases, although the cost of living to-day is higher, and substantially higher, than it was in 1950 or 1956.  I do not think this Bill measures up adequately to the plight of many State pensioners.  It must not be forgotten that the deliberate purpose of this Bill is to provide an increase of only six per cent. for those who retired before November, 1948, and 4 per cent. for those who retired between November, 1948, and October, 1952.</P>
      <P>So far as those who retired from 1st November, 1952, to date are concerned, there will be no increase whatever over and above the pension as calculated at the time of retirement. It may be said that the person who retired last month or the month before or six months ago has had his pension based upon his income.  That is so.  There are a substantial number of persons who retired between November, 1952, and last year.  There will be no increase whatever in their pensions.  They will not receive as much as a farthing increase in pension, notwithstanding the fact that through the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil Government substantial increases have taken place in the cost of living since they retired and especially since the Budget of 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who retired after November, <Col N="1028" /> 1952, will get no compensation whatever for the Budgetary increases brought about by the Government's deliberate policy.  They will get no increase whatever to compensate them for any other increases in prices or living costs which have taken place, as admittedly they have taken place during the past two and a half years. If it is true, as some propagandists for the Government allege, that the country is now making rapidly for the broad highway of prosperity, it seems rather strange that such parsimonious increases for such a small number of persons represent the Government's appraisal of the need of these persons.</P>
    <P>One would think the Government would have found justification for a much more substantial increase in the amount of the pensions and in the date of application of the increases.  The increases will be given only to those who retired before November, 1952. Because they are getting older in years, the Government's liability will be a dwindling one.  Nothing is being done in respect of those who retired since November, 1952, and who have had to take the full impact of the Government's high prices policy.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what this Bill does in relation to the two previous Acts. Under the 1950 Pensions (Increase) Act, pensions were increased by from 20 to 50 per cent.  In the 1956 Act, the pensions were increased by from 6 to 15 per cent, the emphasis in both cases being on the lower rate of pension. In other words, the lower the rate of pension, the better the percentage increase.  As against the two previous increases of from 20 to 50 per cent. and 6 to 15 per cent., we get the miserable increases of 4 per cent. or 6 per cent. under this Bill.  You cannot get the 4 per cent. or 6 per cent. increase unless (1) you retired 11 years ago or (2) you retired seven years ago. This is treating our State pensioners with particular callousness.</P>
    <P>In Britain and in the Six Counties, they have introduced and passed into law seven increase Acts since 1920. Here we have had three, this being the third.  The other two were in 1950 and <Col N="1029" /> 1956.  The increases we are now proposing to give represent the lowest and feeblest effort we have made to relieve the plight of these unfortunate people. In 1956, when we were giving an increase varying from 6 to 15 per cent., and when the cost of living was much lower than it is today, the present Tánaiste came here to outpour his heart and soul in sympathy with the pensioners.  He then said that the Bill of 1956 was one of the consequences of the failure to check the rising cost of living.  If he looks at the 1956 increase figures and compares them with the 1959 increase figures, the humour of that comment must be apparent even to the Tánaiste.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is a Bill, in fact, to mitigate the hardship to which the continuing upward trend in prices has subjected many hapless people, most of them incapable of serious work, who were retired on pension in days when circumstances were easier and who had been looking forward to comfortable security in their old age.  It cannot be denied that the hardship exists and that in the majority of cases it is severe. Accordingly ... we are not opposing the Bill ... Indeed, the one criticism I have heard of the reliefs to be granted under the Bill is that, so far as the smaller pensions are concerned, they are meagre indeed;</P>
    <P>That speech was delivered by the present Tánaiste in November, 1956, as reported at column 960 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>He had sympathy then with the pensioners.  The increases were meagre, although up to 15 per cent. was granted as compared with a maximum of 6 per cent. now.  He had the fullest sympathy then even though the cost of living was lower than it is now.  He was full of sympathy for them in 1956, although, three years afterwards, his Government do not propose to do anything for anybody who retired after November, 1952, notwithstanding the substantial rise in the cost of living during the past two and a half years.  It is hard to imagine that the finances of the State are in such a parlous condition that <Col N="1030" /> the Government could not grant an increase in pensions of an amount greater than is provided for in this Bill or in the Estimate which we passed earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister, even now, if he has any belief or faith in the statements about a dynamic recovery in the economy, ought to find some more money to do justice to people who served the State to the best of their ability during their years of physical and intellectual vigour.  They are now entitled to say to the Government: &ldquo;Since you permitted the value of money to decrease, you ought not impose that hardship on those who served the State.  You ought to try to pay them their pensions, if not in the money values originally contracted for, at least by some method of compensation which would adequately provide for inoculation against the shrunken value of money in the meantime.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has again seen fit to impose what is known as the overriding limitation, that is, that, while you may apparently get a 4 per cent. or a 6 per cent. increase, if the effect is to give you something more than the person who retired immediately after the dates provided for in the Bill, you will not get the 4 per cent. and you will not get the 6 per cent.  Persons who have written to me on this subject have indicated that under this so-called Pensions (Increase) Bill, the increase they will get will be, in some cases, 3d. a month; and in other cases, 6d. a month; and in other cases, 7d. a month.  That is what this Pensions (Increase) Bill will mean to a number of people because of the continued insistence by the Government on the overriding limitation that any increase under this Bill will not bring them over a certain limit, that limit being whatever is received in pension by a person who retires after the dates specified.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to take this Bill back to the Government and say that, since the cost is so little in dealing with so wide a problem, they should provide more money in order to make some better impression, and to meet the obligations which they clearly owe to those who have served the State in <Col N="1031" /> many fields of endeavour and who are feeling the pinch very acutely because of the increase in the cost of living and the corresponding decrease in the purchasing value of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that whenever a measure of this sort is introduced, it gets a sympathetic reception but, on this occasion, our sympathy must be tempered by reason of the inadequate increases being granted under the terms of the Bill. As has been said by the Minister, and by other speakers, the position is that this Bill grants increases varying between four per cent. and six per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1956, just three years ago, when a similar Pensions (Increase) Bill was introduced, the Tánaiste criticised it on the grounds that it was entirely inadequate.  On that occasion, the Bill granted increases of pensions ranging from 15 per cent. to six per cent.  Since then the cost of living has increased quite considerably, especially between the period February, 1957, to February of this year.  Some play has been made with the fact that the August figure showed a small drop.  Since August, there have been substantial increases in the price of eggs and the price of bread and generally, despite the slight reduction in the August figure, the cost of living is considerably higher than it was three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably an interesting commentary on that fact that although earlier this afternoon, the Tánaiste dealt with a couple of measures on behalf of the Minister for Finance, he handed over responsibility for dealing with this measure to his colleague lest he be reminded of the remarks which he himself made when the 1956 measure was before the House.  I feel, as Deputy Norton did when he referred to it, that the criticism which was made by Deputy MacEntee in 1956 could be reinforced on this occasion by reason of the fact that while the cost of living has increased during the past two and a half years, this Pensions (Increase) Bill provides the very meagre increase of four per cent. to six per cent., whereas the <Col N="1032" /> previous measure granted increases varying between six per cent. and 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>In discussing a measure which covers so many categories of pensioners, it is difficult to make a segregation from an omnibus provision such as that in the Schedule.  I have received representations which other Deputies have probably received as well.  It is impossible to understand why these categories of pensioners are not covered.  I refer to pensioners who were members of the Civil Service serving in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  They retired in April or May, 1951, and they expected they would get an increase of four per cent. but instead, when they got the increase in August last, it amounted to 6/8d. per annum.  When I received these representations, I took the matter up with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs expecting to find some mistake had occurred.  After the Department had examined it, they informed me that the increase was the appropriate one, and the pensioners in this particular category who retired in April or May, 1951, find that instead of the four per cent. increase, which is the lower one, they get only 6/8d. per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some get 3/- per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Minister should reconsider this matter most sympathetically because, without exaggeration, it surely would have been better not to have held out any hope of an increase than to give an increase of 6/8d. per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other categories of pensioners, notably, I think, teachers, who find that, having retired at the earlier date, they have a lower pension than those who retired subsequently because they had the benefit of an increase in salary in the meantime.  At least, the person who was in a position to work on to a later period&mdash; although he, like the person who retired earlier, was affected by any increase in the cost of living&mdash;had the advantage of drawing a higher salary so that the general economic position <Col N="1033" /> of persons who retired earlier is worse, both because of their earlier retirement on pension and because they now find that their pensions are still below the pensions of persons employed in a similar capacity who probably succeeded them in some cases.</P>
    <P>This Pensions (Increase) Bill provides only a sum of something like £70,000 in a full year.  According to the Minister, this year it provides £38,000. The Bill passed in 1956 provided a sum of £140,000.  Since then, as I mentioned, the cost of living has increased and the proposals in this measure are inadequate to meet that increase.  They are particularly ungenerous to certain categories who either because of the terms under which they retire or the particular provisions of the Bill, fail to get the increase or an increase comparable to that of other sections.</P>
    <P>As I say, in a measure of this sort, dealing with so many categories, it is not easy to segregate under which provision particular pensioners come.  I feel that the officers of the appropriate Departments should carefully scrutinise the categories of retired pensioners to see that they are all included.  If they are not included, and are prevented from getting even the four per cent. or the six per cent. as the case may be, the measure should be amended to include them, rather than to leave some pensioners in the position, that though they have smaller pensions than people who have retired having occupied similar positions&mdash; possibly in some cases their successors &mdash;they now find themselves not merely with lower pensions but not provided for in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words to add my protest&mdash;if that is the proper word&mdash;against the inadequacy of the measure of relief provided for State servants retiring under the terms of this Bill.  I want to speak very largely for civil servants, although the remarks I have to make apply generally to all those categories which come within the ambit of the Bill.  My desire to place on record my disappointment with the very inadequate provisions arises from the fact <Col N="1034" /> that throughout my public career, both from inclination and from conviction, and because of the circumstances in which I found myself, I have always been on the side of the civil servants advocating their rights so far as I could, and putting my convictions, when I got the opportunity, into practice.</P>
      <P>The provisions in this Bill can certainly be described as frugal to the point of parsimony.  The Minister for Finance in the course of his remarks on the 21st July, 1959, at Column 1535, gave a kind of justification for the parsimony of his proposals.  He said that the reason the proposals were as indicated by him at that time, and as they are now in this Bill, was that he had only a limited amount of money.  Of course one can justify any proposal on that basis but I think that the matter should have been approached, not on the basis of the amount of money available but on what amount of money was required to meet hardship and to obviate injustice.  It would have been far better not to have introduced these provisions at all than to have given the very small alleviations that occur in the course of this Bill and which will benefit only a small number of pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody who retired in the past six or seven years gets anything.  During that time the cost of living has gone up very considerably.  The people who get any benefits&mdash;as has already been pointed out and examples were given &mdash;under this Bill benefit only to a very small extent.  Only those categories who retired before 1952 will benefit.  I, in common with a number of other Deputies, received letters and representations from my constituents.  May I just give two examples of the kind of thing that will happen under this Bill?  One is the case of a man who spent over 40 years in the service of this State in a responsible position.  While I entirely approve of the expressions of sympathy for those with smaller salaries, I also think that those with bigger salaries are as much entitled to consideration, and to have their position taken into account, as those with very small salaries.  It is only a question of <Col N="1035" /> degree, a relative matter, a matter of what degree of hardship is imposed by reason of their being passed over.</P>
    <P>This man retired on the 20th March, 1952, and his pension was based on his salary at that time.  The pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, provided for a six per cent. increase in pension but for some reason which I do not know, he did not get his full six per cent. increase, which would have been £37 9s. 5d.  He received only £33 10s. 0d. per annum.  Under the increase proposed here he will get nothing whatever, so that in the years that have elapsed since his retirement he has got only the very meagre increase of £33 10s. 0d. per year in his pension, after a life-time's service of a very specialised character with the State.</P>
    <P>There is another person who retired somewhere in the middle of 1951. He retired just before the increases were given to the general body of public servants in 1952 and, of course, to that extent he had the misfortune to reach his age limit before these increases.  That represented a loss of £30-13-4 per year.  Four years later under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, he received an increase of £28 7s. 2d.  Since the 1st August last he has been in receipt of 10½d. a week. Why anybody should get an increase of 10½d. under any Bill passes comprehension. Previous speakers have given further examples, Deputy Norton in particular&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of people getting three farthings per week.  I submit that there is something wrong with a Bill that produces results of that kind.  There are manifest injustices perpertrated on public servants who have given loyal service to the State&mdash;I do not like to use very strong language.  There is no doubt that an overwhelming case can be made for increase in pensions.  It used to be said that when a man retired, no matter what happened,&mdash;inflation, deflation or a fall in purchasing power <Col N="1036" /> or anything else&mdash;he was entitled to a certain pension only but the principle that nothing justifies an increase in that pension has long since been overruled by the practice of this Parliament, and the practice of Parliaments in adjoining countries.  I think it was Deputy Norton who referred to the fact that there had been seven increases in pensions for public servants in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that there had been only three or four here.  The amount that was given, certainly in Great Britain, is far more generous than has been given to our civil servants. There were increases in 1920, 1924, 1944, 1947, 1954 and 1956 as compared with two increases here.  The current Act of the Six Counties, the Pensions Increase Act, 1959, embraces an increase of 12 per cent., grading down to lower percentages for retirement within certain periods.</P>

Surely it would be possible by administrative savings in every branch of the public service to save a little more, and it is not very much more that would be required, to do justice to those people who have retired since 1952 and to those who come within the provisions of this Bill but who are very inadequately covered.</P>
      <P>The Minister should certainly consider a more generous provision.  He has given himself the very minimum amount of money for public servants for this year: surely he should at least hold out some hope to those civil servants who are suffering undoubted hardship after the many years' service they have given in the public service that next year at least more generous provision will be made for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton has put the case as seen from the Labour side of the House.  I rise simply to add <Col N="1037" /> my voice in protest against the delay in providing for these civil servants and pensioners who reside in my constituency.  In common with other Deputies from that constituency, I have received numerous protests against the inadequacy of the pensions, where granted, and against the fact that a certain number are alleged to have been completely omitted.</P>
      <P>I think it was on Budget day that we got the first indication from the Minister for Finance that it was proposed to introduce a Pensions (Increase) Bill this year.  High hopes were raised in the minds of pensioners throughout the country and certainly in my constituency.  These hopes were rudely dashed when the terms of the Bill were made known.  Only those who retired up to a certain date are included: some get six per cent; some four per cent., but even that, little and all as it is, is subject to an overriding clause that you cannot qualify beyond a certain year.</P>
      <P>Regarding that overriding limit, the Retired Civil Servants' Association issued an advertisement in all the Dublin morning papers and in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on October 2nd, 1959. From an examination of the replies received&mdash;close on 60&mdash;following the issue of a questionnaire, it appears that of that number, with the exception of three, none receive any increase.  Of the other three, two will receive an increase of 6d. per month.  That, of an increase of 3d. per month.  That, of course, only relates to those who replied to the questionnaire sent out but, at any rate, it shows what little value this Bill is as compensation for the increased cost of living.</P>
      <P>In reply to Dáil Question No. 10 on today's Order Paper, the Minister told Deputy O'Higgins that between March 1957 and this year, the purchasing power of the £1 had decreased by 6d. In view of that, there is a compensatory pensions increase giving the magnificent extra amount of 3d. per month.  It is on that basis, on the basis that the Bill is totally inadequate and that it does not touch the fringe of what should be done for pensioners that I wish to join my protest to that of the other Deputies.</P>

      <P>I am in the difficulty that when we deal with a Bill of this kind it is not open to the Opposition to propose an amendment to redress any inadequacy or anomaly because such amendment might involve a charge on the Exchequer and would therefore be out of order.  I want to endorse the representations made by Deputies Sweetman, Costello and Cosgrave and others on the general inadequacy of the provision made. That is naturally the principal topic that would ordinarily be discussed on this stage of the Bill, but in addition to the general inadequacy of the provisions made certain anomalies emerge.</P>
      <P>I think we ought to bear in mind, when dealing with pension matters of this kind, that the servants of the State and analogous persons in their original contract of employment, in effect, accept part of their remuneration in the form of pension benefit to accrue to them at the time of their retirement and if they were not building up that right to pension, they would ordinarily receive a proportionately higher salary and the normal procedure for providing for their retirement would be that they would lay aside a certain part of their annual remuneration as a fund on which they would retire when they reached the end of their services, in which event it would be open to them to take the classic precaution against the impact of inflation.</P>

    <P>They could arrange their investment programme in such a way&mdash;either themselves or through the employment of an experienced investment banker&mdash; to ensure that even if in the course of their 30 or 40 years' service, inflation moved against them, the fund they were accumulating would adjust itself so that they would have a proportionately larger fund on which to retire than if they put the money on deposit in the bank.  In fact, the universal practice is that they accept a lesser remuneration in consideration of receiving the pension and when they reach the end of their service, usually with family responsibilities and other considerations of that kind <Col N="1039" /> arising, the average public servant has not very much other than his pension on which to retire.</P>
    <P>I suppose if you compare the responsibilities of public servants and the analogous categories referred to in this Bill with the responsibilities of persons engaged in commercial and professional life, you will find the average remuneration of the public servants is ludicrously low compared with what would be available to such persons if they chose to sell their services to a commercial enterprise rather than to the public service.  Many people often forget that.</P>
    <P>Therefore I think it behoves the State&mdash;and we are the State; we, Oireachtas Éireann, act for the State&mdash; to be scrupulous to do justice to those whom we employ on behalf of the people and, if people sometimes fail to understand the value of the service they are getting, we have a duty to remind them of that service.  Most of us, on both sides of the House and in the Seanad, who have had experience in the administration of Departments, have often been amazed at the quality of the service the people of this country get from the civil servants of this State, bearing in mind the scale of remuneration they receive, and comparing it with the remuneration available to persons of certainly no superior ability or diligence in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that the rising cost of living or inflation, whichever you care to call it, has borne most heavily on persons dependent on pensions. I find it hard to believe that any section of this House is wholly confident in arranging for an increase of six per cent and four per cent in these pensions, considering the degree to which we all know that the cost of living has risen.  Questions were answered here today which illustrate dramatically the difference between the value of a £1 pension which a man received 20 years ago and a similar pension today.  I think it is almost true to say that the pound sterling 20 years ago was worth three times the value of the pound today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> It is true there are not many pensioners drawing pensions today who first received them 20 years ago.  It is true that in the interval we have taken certain limited measures to keep pace with the depreciation in money, but, as was pointed out by Deputy Costello and Deputy Norton, what we have found ourselves able to do here compares very poorly with what it has been found possible to do in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain on behalf of those who have served this State, and who are today in a condition which the most optimistic could not describe as affluent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope the Minister for Finance will note the suggestion made by Deputy Costello that, if he can do no more at present, he should very sympathetically consider an early announcement that on the first possible occasion, some further step will be taken at least to equal on our behalf what the Governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have felt able to do for their public servants in retirement.</P>
    <P>Now I want to mention an anomaly which I find hard to bear because I happen to know some of the civil servants, in the Department with which I was associated when I was in Government, who have been severely hit by it.  This Pensions Bill relates only to civil servants who retired prior to 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a salary increase for civil servants in 1956.  After 1956, civil servants who retired had their pensions related to the new scale fixed in that year but there was a certain category who retired in 1954 and 1955 who are not getting the benefit of any increase, and whose pensions are reckoned on the basic salary scale prior to the adjustments made in 1956.  We are all, I hope, sympathetic and understanding about the great difficulty of preparing legislation of any kind that will cover every conceivable contingency but it is a danger in Ministers for Finance <Col N="1041" /> that they use it as a universal excuse for slipshod procedure.</P>
      <P>I know that hard cases make bad law but you meet a man who has been 40 years in the public service of this State and he tells you that just because his required age of retirement fell within a particular 18 months, he will get no benefit under this Bill, and he is denied the benefit he would have if he had been allowed to stay on for the 18 months until the new salary scale obtained, and you are told that represents to that man a loss of from £50 to £70 per annum, according to whether you calculate it by reference to the Bill or by reference to what he might have got if he had been allowed stay on. It is all very well to say hard cases make bad law but it is a great exasperation to those who have been associated with such men to have to say to them: &ldquo;Well, what can I do about it?&rdquo; and the answer is: &ldquo;Do whatever is necessary to remove an anomaly of this kind.&rdquo;  They will say with absolute truth, as we who are familiar with the Department of Finance well know, that there is no obstacle, or there is no contingency conceivable to the mind of man, that cannot be overcome by the Department of Finance, once the Department of Finance really gets into its mind that the Minister wants to do it.</P>
      <P>Many a time and oft I was confronted with a situation in which I was told most delicately by the incomparable officers of the Department of Finance, in the initial stages of the discussion, that it was quite impossible and could not be done.  That was demonstrated to conviction until you eventually said: &ldquo;Very well; I want the impossible done.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first law in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Their first law is to explain that it cannot be done.  They are perfectly sympathetic but it cannot be done, but, finally, after suitable discussion and argument, it is communicated to them: &ldquo;Well, we know it is impossible and now we <Col N="1042" /> want it to be done.&rdquo;  They then reply: &ldquo;If it is clear in your mind that is Government policy and you want it done, of course it will be done.  It will mean burning more midnight oil, and drafting a more complicated instrument, but it will be done.&rdquo;  It always is done.</P>
      <P>I want to lay aside, if I may, the general case to which I have referred and dwell on this particular one.  I ask the Minister to give it special and sympathetic consideration for the reason that I cannot put down an amendment correctly owing to the Rules of Order prohibiting anybody outside the Ministry making a proposal in this House which would impose a charge upon the Exchequer. The number of persons who are affected, that is, those who retired between November, 1952&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the relevant date in 1956 when new salary scales for civil servants were introduced, cannot be large.  It is a melancholy fact that whatever their number, their average period of survival cannot be long so that the modest sum of my petition is that, for the years remaining to them, they should not be left labouring under a sense of acute grievance that because we did not take the trouble carefully to draft this Bill, they have been left out in the cold. It is poor consolation to them to say that at some future date further consideration will be given to their case because these are men and women, 70 and 75 years of age, for whom pious intentions with regard to future actions have little or no interest.  I would ask the Minister's very sympathetic consideration in relation to this particularly restricted category which I have sought to describe to him.</P>

      <P>In the Budget, the Minister for Finance undertook to spend what the Exchequer could afford on relieving the hardships of the oldest Civil Service pensioners, namely, those who retired before 1948 and before 1952.  Everyone will admit that he does not regard the <Col N="1043" /> pensions to civil servants as adequate; but the most inadequate are the pensions paid to those civil servants who retired before 1948 and before 1952 on very much lower salaries than were enjoyed by those who retired subsequently.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the very generous provisions of the 1956 Act. In fact, the sum estimated in that Act was £180,000 and that was spread over a number of pensioners.  The estimate for the present series of pensions increases is £130,000 and that £130,000 is in addition to the £180,000 voted by the House in 1956. It is something over and above, and the pensioner who got 15 per cent. under the 1951 Act will now get a total of 21 per cent.  because of the additional 6 per cent.  We would, of course, all like to do better, but it is the taxpayers as a whole who have to pay these pensions.  The fact that we have to make these additions from time to time is a reflection of the inflationary trend abroad in the world since the middle of the last war. Numbers of people who are not in the Civil Service have to make their contributions towards meeting these adjustments in pension rates to bring the rates more closely to the value of what they could purchase when the pensions were originally fixed.  The Minister, by giving this additional £130,000, to the pensioners covered by this measure, is doing as much as he can in present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, per year.  The annual cost is £180,000.  There has been a good deal of criticism of the overriding maxima and the calculation of three farthings per week to certain pensioners.  If anybody gets only three farthings per week it means that he has heretofore been in a better position than some of his colleagues who retired with him.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed, first of all, to give 6 per cent. to all in receipt of pensions lower than those calculated on 1st November, 1948, and all civil servants who retired before 1948 are being given 6 per cent. under this Bill, provided that does not take them above colleagues who retired at the same time, or before, and who are in an equivalent position.  The overriding limit, as Deputy Sweetman knows, was also incorporated in the 1956 Pensions Act.  It represents an effort to keep pensions in step and to be fair as between one individual and another. Those who get very little under this Bill have had the advantage all along of something higher than their colleagues.  I am perfectly certain the Minister for Finance is in the same frame of mind as all of us here; we wish we could afford to do better.  In the circumstances, I think the Minister has been pretty generous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1956 the cost of the equivalent Bill was £140,000 in a full year.  The cost of Army pensions and retired pay was £40,000.  I assume the Minister's figure of £180,000 is correct.  I know the cost of the equivalent Bill was £140,000.  That leaves £40,000 for the other costs.  The Minister says now that the cost of this Bill is £70,000, and the cost of the total ancillary provisions and this Bill is £130,000; that is to say, the cost of the ancillary provisions is £60,000. These figures do not compare at all. If, in the previous case, it was £40,000 as against £140,000, in this case it could not be £60,000 against only £70,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the facts here&mdash; £130,000 in a full year.  The same categories of pensions existed in 1956 and the total cost in a full year for the pension increases granted under the 1956 Act was £180,000, so that it is £130,000 against £180,000.  The categories we are dealing with in this Bill are costing £70,000 and I am prepared to take Deputy Sweetman's word that the same categories got £140,000 in 1956.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

The Minister for Defence will bring in a Bill relating to army pensioners, and the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government will bring in Bills dealing with local government officials.  But the total cost of all pension increases in 1956 was £180,000 and the total cost of all the pensions under this Bill is £130,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained what the Minister for Finance was trying to do when the Deputy was absent.  He promised he would set aside a certain <Col N="1046" /> sum of money to deal with the pensioners in greatest need and the pensioners in greatest need were those who retired before 1948 and those who retired between 1948 and 1952. He has not attempted to deal with the pensions of those who retired since 1952.  The Bill is restricted definitely to the categories I have mentioned, those who retired before 1952.  The amount involved is a small sum, in the Minister's opinion, and he thought he would give it where it was in greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but perhaps the Minister does not realise that it has given rise to this anomaly in respect of the amount of the increase in the basic rate of salary. which was prescribed in 1956.  The people involved retired on pensions based on the increased basic rate fixed for those civil servants in 1956 and this tiny group of civil servants who retired in these few years did not get the benefit of this Bill.  I see at once that you can make the case that those who voluntarily retired in those years before their time, between the ages of 60 and 65, made their choice, but take a man who was required to resign, having reached the age limit, and who falls within that period.  I think he has a case of peculiar hardship but perhaps the Minister would draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to the matter.  If anything can be done, well and good.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the Act&rdquo; means the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952 (No. 24 of 1952), as amended by <Col N="1048" /> section 9 of the Finance Act, 1955 (No. 13 of 1955) and section 20 of the Finance Act, 1958 (No. 25 of 1958);</P>
    <P>any reference to a vehicle shall be construed as including a reference to a vehicle and another vehicle or an attachment which, in accordance with subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 of Part II of the Schedule to the Act, are, for the purposes of Part I of that Schedule, to be deemed to form and be a single vehicle.</P>
    <P>(2) THAT for the purposes of the Act, the weight unladen of a vehicle shall, on and after the 1st day of January, 1960, and notwithstanding section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933 (No. 11 of 1933), be taken to be the weight of the vehicle inclusive of all additions, but exclusive of the weight of water, fuel or accumulators (other than boilers) used for the purpose of propulsion and of loose tools or loose equipment.</P>
    <P>(3) THAT for the purposes of paragraph (2) of this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) each of the following shall, with respect to a vehicle, be an addition:</P>
    <P>(i) a body,</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(ii) a part,</P>
    <P>(iii) a fitting,</P>
    <P>(iv) a receptacle,</P>
    <P>(b) in a case in which there is one addition only, the reference to all additions shall be construed as a reference to that addition,</P>
    <P>(c) in a case in which, there being two additions (and not more), on no occasion are both of them used, the reference to all additions shall be construed as a reference to the heavier only of the additions or, where they are of equal weight, to one of them only,</P>
    <P>(d) in a case in which, there being three or more additions, on no occasion are <Col N="1049" /> all of them used, the reference to all additions shall be construed as a reference to the heaviest combination of the additions which is used on any occasion.</P>
    <P>(4) THAT in a case coming within subparagraph (d) of paragraph (3) of this Resolution, where one only of the additions is used on a particular occasion, &ldquo;combination of the additions&rdquo; in that subparagraph shall, in relation to that occasion, be taken as referring to that addition.</P>
    <P>(5) (a) THAT anything placed on a vehicle for the purpose of the conveyance of goods or burden of any other description shall, subject to the next subparagraph, be a receptacle for the purposes of the provisions contained in the foregoing paragraphs of this Resolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> This amendment is to obviate the obvious inequality and hardship which were clearly demonstrated from this side of the House on this Resolution during the Committee Stage.  I do not propose to go over in great detail to-day all the arguments that were then put forward.  The fact is that the Resolution, as it exists and as it is expressed in line 1 of page 2 by the words &ldquo;placed on&rdquo; that are included there, means that any loose container which is put on a lorry, having been put on the lorry, even though it just sits on the lorry without being attached in any way, is then loaded, driven off to its destination and, when it gets to its destination, unloaded, will have to pay under this Financial Resolution the tax proper not merely to the weight of the lorry but that applicable to the weight of the container.</P>
    <P>We had some considerable discussion on this matter on the Committee Stage in relation to the case I gave there, the absurd case as the Minister suggested, of a farmer who had a lorry and who wanted to draw water to ensure that his stock would have adequate water during a drought. There is no doubt whatever that the law requires in such circumstances the farmer, who once a year, perhaps, has to draw water in a lorry for his cattle, to pay the tax for the whole of the year on the weight of the receptacles in which he draws that water.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from that, there are other containers used for carriage just for convenience which are not attached to a lorry.  Under this Resolution they, too, will have to be weighed.  There is no use in the Minister saying, as he said the last day, that nobody will prosecute them. Fortunately, there are people here who like to keep within the law whether there is any question of prosecution or not; and the law should be framed so that they can do so honestly and honourably.  The Minister should not say when introducing legislation &ldquo;Ah, it is all right.  Nobody will ever be prosecuted in cases like those, even though there is, in fact, a breach of the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> The effect of this Resolution is not to catch the defrauding lorry owner alone, but to catch the innocent person as well.  I can understand the case being made by the Minister where a person gets a lorry&mdash;I shall not say where&mdash;weighs that lorry and then gets an entirely different type of body, dismantles the previous body, screws on or attaches to the lorry the new type of body and for the rest of the year has the lower rate of tax.  I can understand the Minister trying to catch that type of man.  I agree that that is an attempt to get habitual use for one weight of lorry at a lower rate of tax.  Where a person, on the other hand, has the body bought with the lorry in consistent use throughout the year but, perhaps once, twice or three times in the year, puts up a temporary ramshackle sort of crib to bring home just a load of turf for himself, or where a person puts up some sort of loose container which, if he had a crane on his premises, he could swing into the lorry but which because he has not a crane, he puts on the lorry loosely, puts what he wants into the container and drives off to his destination and because there is no crane there, takes the things out of the container, the container still remaining on the lorry, that man is caught under this Resolution in a most unfair and unjust way.</P>
    <P>By using the words &ldquo;attached to&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;placed on&rdquo;, in a simple amendment I have tried to ensure that whatever will be weighed will be something permanent or quasi-permanent. By so doing it will be possible to ensure that what I might term the defrauding case will be caught.  The honest case is that of a person who utilises something merely placed on the vehicle, so placed only because he knows he will use it only once or twice in the year, and that it is not something of its very nature that could be used regularly.  It would be most unfair to extract from that person for a whole year the tax applicable to the weight of that additional article, be it a container, the sides of a door used as a rough crib or anything else.  It would be most unfair that he should be <Col N="1052" /> penalised and I urge the Minister, therefore, to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much indeed that, after full consideration, I cannot agree to the Deputy's amendment. First, I should say that I do not think there is any need for the amendment.  Paragraph 5 should be read in the light of the provisions of the Resolution as a whole.  They refer to the vehicle and additions, namely, additions to the vehicle.  The paragraph itself speaks of &ldquo;anything placed on a vehicle for the purpose of conveyance of goods.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo; is, therefore, of importance, particularly having regard to the fact that taxing enactments, as I said before, are construed strictly against the State.  I do not think there is any danger that the paragraph would capture items like barrels, sacks or the like, which form part of the separate packages of goods and are used as such primarily and not as additions to the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Further, I do not think that the change proposed by the Deputy would give proper effect to what he has in mind.  There are in fact quite a number of full-sized containers in use which are placed on a lorry, particularly for short local hauls, without being attached to the lorry.  They are very often held in position by the weight of the goods and the weight of the container plus the help of the edges of the lorry platform.  There are other types of full-sized containers with projecting legs or shafts which go into ready prepared slots.  For these reasons I feel that the Deputy's amendment would not result in what he is trying to attain.</P>
      <P>There is a danger inherent in the acceptance of the amendment that lorry owners might be encouraged not to attach containers which normally would be attached, thus giving rise to increased dangers in regard to such contrivances.  Then we come to the much talked of case of the barrels of water the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The roads are usually pretty good.  I put it to the Deputy, seriously, that in the very case he has quoted and the case which typifies his whole approach to this matter, the case of the barrels of water, the person concerned would be precluded from tying the barrels, if and when he carried them.  Anybody who has handled barrels on a truck, cart or trailer of a tractor, particularly in farming areas where they have to be carried on and off the public roads and on to mere cart tracks which are often rough and bumpy, knows that it is very necessary to be able to tie them on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment intended to help a man engaged in that operation <Col N="1054" /> but which, in effect, would be far from helping him and would put him in the position that he could not tie on the barrels.  As I have said already, I do not think there is any necessity for a special clause to cover this type of case because I think it is exempt.  I do not think it is caught within the terms of the Resolution.</P>
    <P>I might add, for the benefit of the Deputy and others who may feel with him, that although I do not accept his main argument, it does not at all imply that I have not given the matter full consideration in every possible way to try to meet his point of view but the difficulties I have outlined and the matters that would be thrown up as a result of meeting his wishes were such that I just could not find any formula that would meet it and meet the objections which are inherent in the case he has made on this amendment.  I am quite satisfied that the Resolution, as drafted, will not have the effect suggested by the Deputy and I, therefore, recommend its acceptance, without amendment, by the House.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, this Resolution is the forerunner of a Bill the Minister proposes to introduce after the Recess.  We shall have an opportunity on the Committee Stage of that Bill of discussing again the wording of the section.  I do not pose as being the perfect draftsman, nor do I hold myself out as such.  I was quite conscious when putting down the amendment that it might not cover exactly the point but I thought that, in any event, it was adequate to raise the matter on this section of the discussion and that the full discussion would come at a later stage.  I hope the Minister, between now and then, will suffer from the pressure of certain farmer Deputies of his own Party who will see that, if the Bill is drafted in form to follow this Financial Resolution, it will extract money for him all right, probably even more than he intends to extract, but will work out with very great hardship indeed.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to make was this: The suggestion was made the last day on this Resolution that £50,000 to £100,000 was being imposed as new taxation.  That was repeated to-day.  Just before the Minister came in, Deputy Sweetman remarked that £100,000 was being introduced as a new burden on the people who are paying this duty.  I should like the Minister to make some observations on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, Deputies on all sides of the House must have been aware when they returned to their constituencies over the week-end that there was quite an amount of consternation amongst licensed hauliers with regard to their position if this Resolution were passed.  I understand <Col N="1056" /> that when the Minister for Transport and Power introduces his Bill, he will deal with the matter more comprehensively but perhaps the Minister might say in passing what the position is.</P>
    <P>I shall give an example.  Say a merchandise licence is for two tons unladen weight.  The people who have merchandise licences were under the impression that all that was being allowed to them, irrespective of the weight of the crib, the creels or the container which they had carried hitherto, was 7 cwts.; in other words, that if they had two tons unladen weight, the maximum they could enjoy under the new position would be 2 tons, 7 cwts.  If that were the case and if there were no escape clause or no consideration of the hauliers who have been on the road for many years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the announcement already made in the House that it was proposed to promote legislation to increase the standard lorry weight of licensed hauliers to ameliorate any hardship which might be caused by the proposed new motor taxation legislation. This motor tax legislation removes the doubts which have arisen as to what constitutes the weight of a motor vehicle for motor taxation purposes and provides that additions to lorries such as creels, side-boards, special bodies etc. must be included in the unladen weight of vehicles for taxation purposes.</P>

      <Col N="1060" /> Under road transport legislation, a licensed haulier may not operate in the course of his licensed business a lorry or lorries the total unladen weight of which for taxation purposes exceeds the standard lorry weight specified in his licence.  This standard lorry weight is based ultimately on the weight of the lorry or lorries he operated prior to licensing though it has in fact been substantially increased since that date.</P>
    <P>The existing level of standard lorry weights has been settled on the assumption that the weight of additions, such as creels, sideboards, etc. was included in the weight of vehicles for Road Tax purposes and therefore, in standard lorry weights.  A number of licensed hauliers have challenged the official interpretation of the law relating to the weighing of vehicles for Road Tax purposes and have removed creels and other additions when their lorries were being weighed for taxation purposes.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed taxation legislation on these cases could be to bring the unladen weight of their lorries over the standard lorry weight specified in their licences. Hauliers so affected would be unable to continue to use their present lorries and in the absence of an increase in standard lorry weight would either have to replace their lorries with lighter vehicles or operate them without the attachments or additions which might be essential to their business.</P>
    <P>It can be said that this was a risk which they should have foreseen when they chose to anticipate an interpretation of the law favourable to themselves; it is nevertheless the case that many did so in good faith and that the new legislation may indeed cause them considerable inconvenience or even hardship.  In these circumstances the Government feels that some increase in standard lorry weight might be granted to help offset such hardship as may arise.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely inequitable, however, to grant an increase in standard lorry weight to licensed <Col N="1061" /> hauliers who had deliberately excluded such equipment as creels and side-boards when their lorries were being weighed for taxation purposes and to deny such an increase at the same time to licensed hauliers who to their own detriment, abided by the long-standing and more generally accepted interpretation of the law.  It would mean that of two licensees who had been entitled to identical standard lorry weights ever since 1933 when licensing commenced, one would in future enjoy a greater standard lorry weight and be entitled thereby to use a larger vehicle.</P>
    <P>There is a wide disparity in the lorry attachments which may be used by a licensed haulier.  Some licensees may have acquired comparatively light attachments only, such as side-boards; others may have acquired creels or even special bodies or tanks affixed to their lorries.  The extent to which such acquisitions may have brought about an excess on their standard lorry weight will vary considerably not only according to the type of attachment but also according to the type of lorry.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely impracticable to determine the extent to which standard lorry weight may be exceeded as a result of the new motor taxation legislation in each of some 1,000 individual cases.  Moreover, there would be nothing to prevent hauliers acquiring new and heavy additions now for weighing with their lorries on 1st January next.  For these reasons, therefore, as well as on the grounds of equity I have already mentioned, it is essential that any increase in standard lorry weight should be on a uniform basis and applicable to all licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>A special increase in standard lorry weight of 7 cwt. per lorry to permit the use of livestock creels by licensed hauliers authorised to carry livestock has already been granted on grounds of hardship to about 190 hauliers.  This increase applies only while the lorry is actually being used for the carriage of livestock.  The figure of 7 cwt. was found on examination to be adequate to meet the additional weight of cattle creels <Col N="1062" /> used with the great majority of lorries operated by licensed hauliers, that is, lorries not exceeding 2 tons 15 cwt. unladen weight.  It had been claimed on behalf of the licensed hauliers that because such creels were essential for the safe carriage of livestock and that, since the weight of creels had to be included in the weight of the lorry for road tax purposes, they could not in most cases be used at all without exceeding the relevant standard lorry weights under the Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances and having regard in particular to the fact that the present level of standard lorry weights is intended to include the weight of additions, the Government consider that a general increase of seven cwt., the amount already approved for livestock creels, would represent a reasonable and indeed a generous contribution towards relieving any genuine hardship that may be caused by the new road tax legislation.  The existing conditional increase for livestock creels will of course be cancelled and replaced by the general unconditional increase provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that the proposed increase of 7 cwt. per lorry is not sufficient to meet the hardship imposed on carriers who may use certain heavier equipment particularly lift vans and special cattle bodies which may weigh as much as 30 cwt. each. The degree of genuine hardship in these cases is somewhat questionable.  As I have already indicated, the present level of standard lorryweight&mdash;which has been substantially increased since 1933&mdash;and the concession authorised for cattle creels were based on the assumption that all additions of this kind were included in the weight of lorries for tax purposes in accordance with the long standing official interpretation of the relevant road tax legislation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, representatives of the licensed hauliers have been agitating for years for increases in standard lorryweight for such purposes on the grounds that these articles must, in fact, be included in the weight of their lorries when they are weighed for taxation purposes.  Hauliers, therefore, <Col N="1063" /> who acquired special bodies of this kind, which brought the weight of their lorries over and above the approved standard lorryweights prescribed by their licences, must have done so in the full knowledge that an adverse Court decision could have put them in precisely the same position as the new road tax legislation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, this Bill envisages an all-round increase on a uniform basis and there is no practical alternative to an increase on a uniform basis for reason both of equity and administrative practicality.  An all-round increase of the order of 25/30 cwt. per lorry would be out of the question as it would increase the total carrying capacity of licensed hauliers in general very substantially and would enable many of them to acquire additional or bigger lorries.  This would lead to a substantial increase in competition with C.I.E. at a time when that undertaking is engaged on what is indeed a life and death struggle for survival.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, and having regard to the whole background to this Bill, I am satisfied that the proposed all-round increase of seven cwt. per lorry is indeed a very generous contribution to such hardship as may exist.  Nevertheless, I will be prepared to consider under the provisions of Section 116 of the Transport Act, 1944, any individual case of genuine and deserving hardship which may be brought to my attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for giving the whole case away in three words&mdash;&ldquo;competition with C.I.E.&rdquo;  The purpose of the Resolution we have just dealt with, and which necessitates this Bill, part of the financial aspect of which we have been discussing, is to ensure that as much as possible of certain traffic is driven out of the hands of private hauliers into C.I.E.  The Minister has just admitted that by saying it would be &ldquo;competition with C.I.E.&rdquo;  I challenge that point of view completely as being reasonable or legitimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some considerable discussion on the other Resolution on what is to be added for taxation purposes. <Col N="1064" /> Let us take the lift vans, to which the Minister referred.  He must be aware that a lift van is swung on to a lorry, that it is unloaded at the house where the furniture is being delivered without being taken off the lorry.  That van, when placed on a lorry, is not part of the sides, like fixed creels.  It is a container put down on a lorry and stays there, as the Minister for Local Government admitted a few minutes ago.  Because of the height of the sides, the lorry floor, edges and back, it fits more or less into a groove.</P>
    <P>All those who, as private hauliers, carry furniture have heretofore been under the impression, and have been accepted as being within the law, that it was the weight of their lorry only, unloaded, which was to be taken into account for motor taxation purposes. Now, as this Financial Resolution stands and as it governs the position that will arise in relation to road transport licences, those firms who carry on the furniture business will have to weigh not merely their lorry but also the container on that lorry, that is, lifted on to the lorry, because it does not come completely within the ambit of Paragraph 5 (b) of the Financial Resolution.</P>
    <P>Every furniture remover in the country feels apprehensive that this will mean not merely that he will have to pay more motor tax but that he will be put out of business entirely because the addition of seven cwts. to his road transport licence could not possibly cover the additional weight of the container. It was my interpretation all along that a container such as I have referred to would be included in the new taxation arrangements.  A few seconds ago, the Minister for Local Government made it clear that that type of container, if it fits into slots, would be covered and caught by the new taxation.  Therefore, the person who has those lorries will, unless the matter is amended, be completely put off the road.  I understand that that is the effect of it.</P>

      <P>The position is that their conditions of operation will not be worsened.  Their cases will be examined sympathetically.  If it is necessary to give them an additional weight, over and above seven cwts., it will certainly be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The object should not be to worsen conditions.  That is not the way to deal with the situation. It is wrong.  It is an entirely wrong principle to start off by slipping into an Act a principle that hits everybody and then say: &ldquo;If anyone comes along and makes a case, I shall deal with it under another section.&rdquo;  If the Minister were doing his job properly, he would introduce a clause in this Bill under which the furniture removal people would be covered by the Act passed in this House without having to go, cap in hand, to him in his office on a hardship case.  The hardship section of the Road Transport Act, 1933, was never intended to cover a general class of person like that.  It was never intended to cover something of a sweeping nature in the way this Bill will inevitably affect the furniture removal people.  It could be covered perfectly simply by the Minister, by introducing, on Committee Stage, an amendment covering container traffic and not merely in relation to furniture removers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section of the community who will be seriously affected by this Bill.  The export of bacon, particularly from the south of Ireland, is carried out in containers.  It is seldom that they can be lifted fully loaded on to the lorry at both ends of the journey.  At one end of the journey, there may be a crane available to lift the container on to the lorry, but at the other end, there may not be a crane to take the container off the lorry.  Therefore, it depends on whether the bacon is to be put into the container before the container is put on the lorry or while it is on the lorry. In either case, the export trade in relation <Col N="1066" /> to bacon will be unnecessarily hit by this proposal.  Under the law up to the present, it was the unladen weight of the lorry on which the container sits which was taken into account but now it will be the weight of the lorry, plus the weight of the container.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that it is not a feasible proposition to have everywhere the type of crane necessary to lift these insulated containers.  If there were a crane everywhere to lift them, then they would not be affected by this Financial Resolution at all.  If they are lifted on and off by crane, they are not caught by the Financial Resolution, but if they are lifted off at the port but cannot be lifted on at the factory, because there is no suitable crane, then they are caught by this measure and, in fact, they will be put completely out of business.  It will be not merely a question of paying more money but of being put completely out of business, because the addition of the insulated container weight to the weight of the lorry would far exceed seven cwts.  They would not then be entitled to operate under their licences and the effect would be to push that traffic, too, over to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I have heard also-and frankly, I do not quite understand how it arises -that there is great anxiety amongst undertakers that the effect of this Financial Resolution will be such that the seven cwts. increase will mean that they cannot carry on their business. Frankly, I do not quite understand how a hearse has been weighed up to this. I assume it must be in relation to the body-weight of the hearse and not the weight of the container within, but I understand there is considerable anxiety amongst undertakers that the effect of this Bill will be such that they will find it virtually impossible to carry on their business.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that there is all this anxiety around the country and that the Minister is forced, in his defence, to suggest that the hardship rule for individual cases in the 1933 Act is the way in which to cope with this problem.  The Financial Resolution and this Bill have been rushed, and brought to this House without <Col N="1067" /> proper consideration from a drafting point of view and from the point of view of principles.  It is not a satisfactory way of doing business, and most of all, there should be consideration for the manner in which Parliament should be run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was inevitable in the ordinary course of events that provision would have to be made for an increase in the unladen weight permitted to licensed carriers.  It is quite a few years since there was any review of that part of the regulations and during that time the general specifications applicable to lorries and trucks and vehicles of the kind used by licensed carriers have been adapted to an extent that it was necessary, for reasons of economy, to introduce a heavier type of vehicle.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker made the point that one of the reasons&mdash;and I think he suggested the main reason-why this legislation was now being introduced was to favour C.I.E.  At the outset, it is desirable that the Minister should explain if, in the matter of assessing unladen weight, C.I.E. are subject to the same laws and regulations as any private licensed carrier.  As I understand the whole set-up, I feel I am correct in saying that under the 1933 Transport Act, a number of merchandise licences were issued to C.I.E.  Those merchandise licences had attached to them specifications in regard to weight which were also applicable to a licence given to a private individual. It is very desirable that that point should be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision was made under the 1933 Act for C.I.E., then the G.S.R., or whatever railway companies were operating mechanically propelled vehicles for merchandise to acquire licences.  What I want to get clear at this stage is that, in 1933, the licence for unladen weight was two tons or two and a half tons.  If such a licence were issued to C.I.E. for a particular lorry, have they been obliged to live within the scope of unladen weight in so far as unladen weight has been concerned since?  In <Col N="1068" /> other words, if some legislation has not been passed in the intervening period which permitted an increase in weight to C.I.E., I want to know if there has been any differential in the weight so allowed as between C.I.E. and a private carrier.</P>
    <P>I know that some years ago amending legislation was introduced to permit an increased weight to licensed carriers.  Quite a lot of them at that time were badly in need of that concession.  As I have said, the type of truck now available which can be utilised in an economic way has changed radically in dimensions from what it was in 1933.  At that time the ordinary loads which were hauled were three or four tons whereas in the same type of truck to-day the 100 per cent. overloading can be safely undertaken.  It was inevitable, therefore, that four or five years ago the then Government should have seen fit to bring in a Bill whereby an increased weight was allowed.</P>
    <P>The idea that legislation of this kind can favour C.I.E. appears to me to be all wrong&mdash;if I am correct in my assumption in this connection&mdash;as C.I.E. will be obliged, I take it, to weigh their trucks in the same manner as any ordinary licensed carrier.  In my view, C.I.E. should be no different, as a haulier of merchandise, from an ordinary person.  If this legislation is to operate with equal justice, as between C.I.E. and the private carrier, I think it is fair enough on the surface. I wonder however, how the figure of seven cwt. now allowed has been calculated?</P>
    <P>I do know that most licensed carriers' organisations&mdash;or certainly one organisation, the Licensed Hauliers Association have been agitating for quite a number of years for a substantial increase in unladen weight. From my own knowledge, I feel that seven cwt. is quite inadequate under present conditions and I suggest to the Minister that he should look into this point.  It is undesirable that legislation should have to be introduced too often in a matter of this kind.  For that reason it would be more satisfactory if the weight could now be fixed <Col N="1069" /> at a realistic figure.  Some of the interpretations put on this new legislation have, in my opinion, been a bit exaggerated.  By and large most of the licensed hauliers throughout the country have been weighing in their trucks correctly.  They had to do so because on various occasions they were so obliged by the local taxation authorities.  From time to time also inspections were made of their carrying capacity and their unladen weight. There was a common feeling among those carriers that C.I.E. were insisting that they would not be allowed to utilise their licences beyond the extent to which the law permitted them and, generally speaking, they were engaged in a type of trade very much more under the eye of the law than trades of a comparable kind.</P>
    <P>The figure of seven cwt., which the Minister has indicated would be allowed under this new legislation, may in a number of cases be quite adequate but I feel there are quite a number of cases among the 1,200 licensed hauliers &mdash;I think that is about the number in the country&mdash;where that weight will be quite insufficient.  A number of these merchandise licensees in recent years have gone into businesses such as furniture removing and container traffic.  In such cases it is desirable that the legislation should be as liberal as possible.  The Minister has indicated that under Section 116 of the 1944 Act he is empowered to examine individual cases of hardship.  I think, however, that is something that he or any other Minister would be quite anxious to avoid.  I suggest that, as far as possible, the legislation now being introduced should be such that he could avoid a situation of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Minister's statement, as I understood it, to a 25 per cent increase being more or less sought by a number of people who are holders of merchandise licences.  I think that would be quite unreasonable because in most cases if any licensed haulier has changed the kind of truck he had in use by 25 per cent I am afraid he has gone outside the law for quite some time.  The legislation passed some years ago enabled a number of licensed hauliers to get over <Col N="1070" /> a very difficult problem which they had then to contend with and the present legislation more or less tends to do the same thing.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he should examine the point as regards the adequacy of the 7 cwts. very carefully because from what I know of this business, and I happen to know something about it, the figure suggested is, in my opinion, absolutely inadequate generally.  I am afraid the Minister will find himself in difficulties in a large number of cases if he does not meet this requirement fully now.</P>
    <P>The question of undertakers has been mentioned but I think there is no real problem there.</P>

      <P>I think it desirable when we are discussing a matter of this kind that, as far as possible, we should keep to the points involved and not refer to a number of licensed carriers owning other vehicles who are not involved.  I have little else to say beyond suggesting to the Minister, now that he is making what I regard as a realistic approach to this problem, that before the legislation is finally enacted he should be satisfied that what he is attempting to do will meet the requirements of all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance brought in a Financial Resolution last week I raised a point in regard to merchandise licence holders. As I told him, I was not interested in the amount of tax the lorry owners had to pay but I was very interested in the people who had lorries and merchandise licences and I felt that if the Financial Resolution went through as it was, these people would be put out of business.  The Minister assured me that his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, would be coming in here the following week with amending legislation providing for the case which I had mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt quite happy when I heard that but during the week when I saw the Bill and read that the increase to be granted was seven cwt.  I was not so happy about the position.  I know several merchandise licence holders who have weighed correctly and kept <Col N="1071" /> to the allowance.  They have put on horseboxes, or proper conveyances for carrying cattle, with new floors and so on, and they often brought these up to the showgrounds at Ballsbridge.  When the inspecting Guard saw them, he said, &ldquo;You are all right.  Your horsebox is an addition to your ordinary merchandise licence allowance&rdquo;, and they were passed.  Now, apparently, under this Bill they will not get through any more.</P>
    <P>It means that he will have to tax both his lorry and the horsebox and any other addition, a cattle creel or anything else that he puts on.  Definitely, seven cwt. would not be any benefit to him.  If he puts on something about seven cwt. it would have to be a very flimsy creel or horsebox and there is danger of an accident and of the whole vehicle breaking down. I do not think the Minister should encourage that; he should rather encourage people to put on substantial additions when necessary.  These people do not want to be outside the law.  They are ordinary working men and they want to be within the law. Up to this they felt they were within the law and they were allowed to pass by the Gardai at Ballsbridge and elsewhere. But this Resolution puts them outside the law unless they get a very substantial addition to their merchandise licence.  I think the Minister should consider this case favourably so that he will not have to bring in another Bill to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>Under a section of another transport Act the Minister said that he could deal with cases of hardship.  That would be all right if only one or two were involved but, if the Minister is faced with 100 or 200 cases of hardship, is he not bringing a lot of trouble on himself, having to go into these cases, take statements and so on, when he knows, or his officials should know, that these people, if they are to carry on business as they have been doing, would require much greater weight on their existing licences?  I do not think it right that the Minister should put himself in the position of having to consider individual cases.  When he is bringing in this Bill he should do the <Col N="1072" /> decent thing and give proper facilities so that carriers who bring in a lorry to have it weighed will not have to take off anything.  They are quite prepared to pay whatever road taxes are due under the circumstances and the Minister should meet them and give them a proper code or proper allowances so that they can put on proper horseboxes, creels or other containers.  They can get the heaviest of those weighed and pay the appropriate tax.  These people are prepared to do that and I think the Minister should meet them on a fair basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman suggested that the purpose of the Bill was to protect C.I.E. in some measure.  I do not agree with that. Previously, on the Financial Resolution the Minister for Local Government pointed out that C.I.E., from the point of view of tax, would pay exactly the same and would be in exactly the same position as other transport operators in the State.  We should also bear in mind that C.I.E. is a national concern and the taxpayers have been subsidising it as the Minister for Transport and Power pointed out a fortnight ago.  I, for one, would not criticise unduly the extent to which the taxpayers have been bled in the past by C.I.E. when on the other hand we consider that C.I.E. has been employing 14,000 workers constantly.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister's statement about C.I.E. in his introductory speech has been misinterpreted by Deputy Sweetman.  I am not attempting to speak for the Minister&mdash;he is here to make his own reply&mdash;but I interpreted his statement to mean that he wanted to examine each case individually on its merits and that if he were to give a global increase to all existing merchandise licence holders, that could hit C.I.E. very much.  I think that is the point the Minister made, that if you increase the existing merchandise licences out of all proportion to the amount they have hitherto been permitted to carry, it would hit C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Crotty is reasonable.  His argument seems to be that if, in the past twelve months the lorry's unladen weight was X tons <Col N="1073" /> and the carrying capacity X+Y tons he would be licensed accordingly and that X tons unladen weight plus 7 cwt. would be of little use to him. That is why I presume the Minister has relied on Section 116 of the Transport Act, 1944.  He has pointed out that without introducing any amending legislation he is already empowered to deal with cases of hardship under the 1944 Act.  Section 116 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister is of opinion ...(c).  That, for the removal of hardships, the operation of a merchandise (existing carrier's) licence should be extended to a minor extent...then, not withstanding anything contained in the Act of 1933 but subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Minister may amend the licence to such extent as seems to him fair and reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I was a bit premature, evidently, in speaking on this matter on the Financial Resolution but I should like the Minister to be more explicit in his reply if he possibly can.  I appreciate that he has said that each case will be examined and dealt with on its merits under the power vested in him in Section 116 of the 1944 Act but I should like him to be more explicit. Apart from the fact that the taxation period will be commencing on the 1st January&mdash;I am not unduly worried about that aspect of it on behalf of holders of merchandise licences&mdash;but, evidently&mdash;this debate today has to a certain extent cleared the air&mdash;there was consternation throughout the country over the weekend as every Deputy knows.  The people believed that if their merchandise licence covered an unladen weight of 2 tons and if they wished to put a container on to that, or a creel or crib&mdash;as Deputy Dillon called it last week&mdash;it would weigh more than the 7 cwt. and the compensatory figure of 7 cwt. would be only a sop to those people. They were perfectly right.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister says in cases of hardship he can amend the licence to such extent as seems to him fair and <Col N="1074" /> reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case.  I dwell on this because I want the Minister to be more explicit.  Would he not agree with me that it would be reasonable, bearing in mind decisions of various district justices and, indeed, of some higher members of the Judiciary, that the owner of a merchandise licence was not entirely to blame?  Would the Minister not consider this proposition reasonable: if the holder of a merchandise licence can put a case to him that in the past 12 months, or two years, he carried a maximum addition to his unladen weight, that should be considered as the optimum, or maximum, amount, by which the merchandise licence should be altered and increased in his favour?  In other words, I think that the average increase in the case of quite the majority of the holders of merchandise licences will be not in the region of seven cwts., but a ton and a half, or a ton and a quarter.  That would be a more realistic figure-25 cwt.&mdash;taking into consideration the container, crib, creel or double-decked trucks.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that in the past these people were acting illegally and should have known that, but how can the unfortunate holder of a merchandise licence interpret the law when he finds a district justice in one county disagreeing with a learned colleague in another county a few miles away?</P>

      <P>Through the Chair, I am addressing it to the Minister.  I am, if you like, defending the owner of the merchandise lorry.  This could lead to a lot of unsavoury business, and I would respectfully ask the Minister to be a little more helpful.  I know some people who are seriously debating whether they should tax their lorries on 1st January, and whether it is a gamble that the Minister will say: &ldquo;Yes, yours is a case of hardship.  I shall add X tons, or X cwt., to the existing unladen weight shown on your merchandise licence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition I am putting to the Minister is that if the holder of a merchandise licence can put to him. <Col N="1075" /> through his solicitor, or any other person, an affidavit to the effect that he carried a certain maximum weight on either one or more occasions during a specified period, it will be dealt with expeditiously and get sympathetic consideration.  I do not at all understand this seven cwt.  I suppose it is because I did not hear the Minister give the very cogent reasons which were, no doubt, contained in his introductory remarks as to how the seven cwt. was arrived at, but certainly it is not a realistic figure when applied to people who have an unladen weight and, when a container is added, a crib or creel, it is completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the feeling over the week-end, until we got some modicum of clarification here to-day, was that they would be swept off the roads because the seven cwt. would not cover them.  Now we hear that the Minister, under Section 116 of the Transport Act of 1944 may himself&mdash; though of course he delegates his powers and accepts his advisers' advice &mdash;if he thinks it fair and reasonable, extend that, but the Minister did not refer to the snag in the extension.  For his edification, I mention it now.  That section states: &ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinion ... that, for the removal of hardships, the operation of a merchandise ... licence should be extended to a minor extent ... the Minister may amend the licence to such extent as seems to him fair and reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;  The snag is that there is no definition of &ldquo;extent&rdquo; in the Preamble to the 1944 Act.  Evidently the interpretation is entirely at the Minister's discretion, and I do urge him to be more explicit as to the manner in which he will deal with these applications for an increase.</P>
    <P>He owes it to the merchandise licence holders, in view of the taxation period which is coming on 1st January, to make a more explicit statement and, with the greatest respect, I also say he should give some indication as to what time will elapse in the Department of Transport and Power before a decision is made on any individual, specific application.  In other words, if a holder of a merchandise <Col N="1076" /> lorry sends in an application for an increase in the unladen weight on a Monday, when might he expect to get a decision if the Minister says each case will be dealt with, like a medical card, on its merits?</P>

There will be certain individuals who have merchandise licences who will send them in envelopes with a covering scrawl which the Minister may, or may not, be able to decipher.  We can allow ten days for that, still bearing in mind that the taxation period starts on 1st January, and that it is a big decision in a person's business career&mdash;deciding what he will do, whether he will get out or not.

In fact, so remarkable did it become, that a regulation was introduced that no more forms would be issued to Deputies; they would be issued to applicants only.  I put it to the Minister&mdash;he has now listened to Deputy O'Malley's case&mdash;that it is now proposed to fall back upon a section of a previous Transport Act&mdash;the Transport Act of 1944&mdash;which gives the Minister absolute discretion to determine, on grounds of individual hardship, whether or not a man will retain his merchandise licence in the event of his putting a certain weight on a lorry. Is it conceivably possible to have more poisonous legislation?  Can you imagine every licensed haulier dependent for his livelihood on the absolute discretionary power of the Minister for the time being in charge of the Department of Transport and Power? <Col N="1078" /> We heard Deputy O'Doherty of Mayo boast here of the fact that 14 transport licences issued in Achill, consequent upon a political meeting held by himself and the other Fianna Fáil Deputy for North Mayo, to which no Deputy of any other Party was invited.  On that being queried here, he said no other Deputy was invited because the people in Achill are all supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what the Deputy refers.  I do not think his remarks are relevant, but I assure the Deputy there was an inflexible rule.  I think he will find that all schemes were based on the fundamental rule that the <Col N="1079" /> Minister had no discretion at all.  Certain conditions were laid down.  Anybody conforming to those conditions was entitled, as of right, to common facilities.</P>
      <P>There is some element of certitude so long as the seven cwts. proviso applies.  The other arrangement is detestable, dangerous and undesirable. Does the Minister mean in this Bill to protect the revenue or is it a Bill to force traffic into the hands of C.I.E.?  I want to remind the Minister&mdash;it is a matter of most urgent and vital importance&mdash;that the livestock trade is at present passing through a depression unprecedented, in my memory, since the war.  There has been a collapse in the price of cattle; there has been a collapse in the price of sheep and lambs.  As Deputy O'Malley, in particular, ought to know, the pig population has fallen very heavily.  Anybody who knows conditions in rural Ireland knows that one of the common assignments of the smaller haulier is going around to six or seven different farms and picking up a load of pigs to bring them in to a factory; or picking up a load of lambs to bring them into a market, or possibly a load of cattle from four or five small farms.  All these operations involve the use of cribs on lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that it is quite unthinkable that C.I.E. would undertake this work.  They are not available when they are wanted. They have not the kind of local knowledge to make the kind of calls that a mission of that type requires.  The whole of the operation depends on somebody with local knowledge going up the by-roads to one house and down another road to the next house, getting the job done quickly, and understanding the kind of assignment upon which he is embarked.  Take that traffic away from the private haulier, and two consequences will ensue.  One is that you will put the private haulier out of business because he will not have enough normal traffic to justify the retention of his vehicle. That means another man off the road &mdash;for England!  Secondly, when he is <Col N="1080" /> put out of a decent livelihood, what will the people do who depend on him now for that kind of transport?  It is a very exceptional farmer who has a lorry load of pigs for the factory.  Not one in a thousand farmers would ever be in a position to fill a lorry with pigs.  It is a very exceptional farmer who would have a lorry load of sheep and lambs for a market.  It is only the odd farmer who would require an individual lorry to carry his own cattle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The pig buyers have transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit the pig buyer could fill the gap in the case of pigs, if he is using his own lorry.  Will he be able to use his own lorry now?  If he has his own lorry, and he is carrying his own goods, then if he is prepared to pay the appropriate tax, he can certainly carry his own pigs.  As I understand it, however, the policy is to facilitate the farmer in sending his pigs to the factory and having them graded there for his own advantage. Perhaps the policy has been changed. I have no reason to believe it has.  I am thinking of the condition of which Deputy O'Malley must have personal knowledge.  I am thinking of the lorry which services three, four, or five farms and collects a load from them. They will cease to function under these proposals.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Transport and Power seriously intend to put many lorries owned by private hauliers out of operation with a view to transferring traffic to C.I.E.?  I want to put it to him that the effect of his proposal will be to put the private hauliers out of business without giving the traffic to C.I.E., because they are not organised for such service.  You will simply drive the farmers back to less efficient means of transport and very much less competitive means of transport at a time when they are not in a position to afford that charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley says he is puzzled as to what exactly this legislation means.  So am I.  I interpreted the legislation, when I saw it, to mean that the Minister was giving notice that he <Col N="1081" /> was making a concession to private hauliers that he would ignore an attachment which weighed less than seven cwts.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all getting an increase of seven cwt. on what was previously written on their licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is what I assumed, that substantially that would be the limit of the increase available to them and there would be no wider use of the discretionary power under the 1944 Act than had been made heretofore, which was virtually nil.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But there were hardship cases in the last 14 years but they were few and far between and they were marginal.  Is it seriously contended that the Minister, on the grounds of hardship, will allow one citizen to have 30 cwt. added to his merchandise lorry licence and another seven cwt. and no more?  Surely such legislation would be cockeyed.  Let us face it.  Unless the administration were one of archangels, could it be conceived that the case for hardship would not be more eloquently pressed upon the Minister by those intimately associated with him in his own Party than by people who had no contact with him other than casual official contact or even no contact at all? Surely the very essence of good law is that it should be uniform for everybody?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say that if the definition of &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; were strictly interpreted and meant that, in circumstances I cannot envisage by the definition of &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; there were to be a further marginal concession, such an arrangement would be defensible, but if Deputy O'Malley's interpretation is correct, that it is to be the general <i>vade mecum</i> of the Minister for <Col N="1082" /> Transport and Power and that any case, where a person during the past 12 months has in fact <i>bona fide</i> used attachments up to 25 or 30 cwt., is to be, in the judgment of the Minister, a case of hardship, then surely the administration of the law would become insane.  It would be much more simple for the Minister to say in his Bill &ldquo;30 cwt.&rdquo;, and to say to all citizens: &ldquo;Everybody is entitled to have his merchandise licence increased by 30 cwt.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things important in the enactment of law and I cordially agree that realism and pragmatic practicability are two very essential things, but surely what is essential above all other things is that all men should be equal before the law.  Nothing is more evil than that we should so legislate as to make it possible for discrimination to be made under the law between two citizens of the State.  Surely every man is entitled to know what his position is under the law, to know with certainty whether he is conforming to the law or whether he is in breach of the law. Surely we ought not to assume in this House that the majority of our fellow countrymen do not care about the law and are prepared to drive a horse and cart through it if they can get away with it.  Surely we, legislators, should seek to take every opportunity of so enacting the law that no honest man need break it and that any man who does break it is very much on his proof to demonstrate to conviction that he did it by inadvertence or else he will be deemed guilty of having broken it.</P>

      <P>If 30 cwt. were given to every licensed haulier it would be unjust to a large proportion of the licensed hauliers because that would enable them to carry goods which hitherto they had not been carrying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If they have a general licence to carry, they can carry everything. But it must be absolutely clear to all Deputies that we ought not to enact a law which says that one man shall be confined to seven cwts. as in the Minister's Bill but that a favoured person, on the grounds of hardship or alleged hardship, will be in a much more advantageous position.  That is what Deputy O'Malley is suggesting.  I am making the case to the Minister that if he stands by the law as drafted by him he will put out of business a great many small licensed hauliers who who are at present getting a living out of it.  He will not provide any more traffic for C.I.E. because they are not equipped to handle it and he will put the small farmers at great additional expense, either of time or money, at a time when the condition of the livestock industry makes it urgently necessary that we should do nothing to increase their costs of production but do everything that lies within our power to bring those costs down.</P>
      <P>I am well aware, and I believe Deputies are aware, that for a long time there has been a tendency by regulation and restriction of one kind and another to seek to divert more and more traffic out of the hands of the independent hauliers into the hands of C.I.E. for the simple reason that the Minister conceives it to be his duty to assist in every way he can in reducing the deficit of C.I.E. Important as that purpose may be, I put it to him that to do it by adding substantially to the costs of the livestock industry at the present time is crazy and it is doubly crazy if he increases the costs of that industry and does not get any corresponding benefit for C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain aspects of this which are far from clear.  There is a constant agitation going on in the newspapers, and generally among farming organisations, to promote the use of the container traffic for perishable agricultural produce such as pork, turkey, fowl and other commodities of that category.  It is pointed out that great economies in the cost of transport might be effected if certain <Col N="1084" /> trade union difficulties could be overcome in order to ensure that this kind of transport was readily usable at the port of Dublin and elsewhere.  Can anyone tell me, if a man has a five-ton lorry and a container is packed in Cootehill with turkeys&mdash;the Minister will know the kind of receptacle to which I refer&mdash;and if the container is loaded on to the lorry, driven to the docks and there unloaded with hooks and put on board ship, does that not make the lorry liable under the terms of this legislation?  It does.  Does the Minister want to do that?  Does he realise that in existing circumstances it may be a matter of vital importance to encourage bodies like bacon-curers, the Cootehill Co-operative Fowl Society and analogous bodies, if we can get them organised elsewhere, to use that kind of transport?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will say: &ldquo;If they are going to use containers, let them send for C.I.E.&rdquo;  But he may find to his cost, and to the cost of the country, that the differential in the expense of employing C.I.E. for the purpose of transporting that container and the cost of employing a local haulier may make the use of that container uneconomic.  I am not familiar with all the details of the trade, but remember that to get transport from C.I.E. is not always a thing you can do at very short notice.  The packaging and despatch of highly perishable produce is a matter of high urgency.  At this time of the year you may have turkeys plucked and ready for collection at 12 o'clock in the night.  It may be a matter of great consequence to get a container for their transport so as to be at the docks in Dublin in time for the morning boat.  If an exporter applies to C.I.E. he may be informed: &ldquo;That means overtime for everybody.  If you wait until 8,30 a.m. or 9 a.m. the following morning, it will travel at the ordinary rates; but if you want to ship it during the night it is possible it will cost you from 50 to 75 per cent. higher,&rdquo; whereas, the owner of a merchandise licence and an immediate neighbour will quote a price and take the load.</P>
    <P>I would be staggered at the thought of our putting these extra charges on <Col N="1085" /> the transport of agricultural commodities at present without apparently knowing, or very much caring, what we are doing.  It has never been made clear to us&mdash;and I do not think the Minister himself knows&mdash;what is caught by this proviso about the container on a lorry.  I do not know whether a container such as I have described is caught.  The Minister's colleague certainly does not know whether a barrel containing water is caught.  He says nobody will prosecute a man for using a barrel for the purpose of transporting water.  That is not a satisfactory explanation of legislation to this House.  Apparently, cribs are caught.  I have a shrewd suspicion that the majority of Deputies do not want them to be caught and do not think it expedient that they should be caught.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Malley is trying to lay a soothing unction to his soul by referring back to the 1944 Act so that he can with a clear conscience support what he does not believe.  I ask the Minister for Transport and Power this categorical question, to which I think I am entitled to an answer: does Deputy O'Malley's interpretation of the section, as read out, of the 1944 Act apply?  Is he correct in believing that it is the Minister's intention to avail of his discretionary powers under that Act to give widespread concessions?</P>

Of course, it has not been widely used.  It was never meant to be. It was contemplated to be a power to be used only in cases of hardship. Either Deputy O'Malley is right or the Minister is right.  We must depend on what the Minister says. Deputy O'Malley has intervened for the purpose of interpreting what he understood the Minister to say.  I think I am entitled to ask the Minister to state categorically whether Deputy O'Malley's interpretation is correct.  I think Deputy O'Malley's interpretation is not correct.

      <P>I think Deputy O'Malley will at least agree with me that it is urgently necessary that all Deputies know what the facts are. The Bill, as we read it says:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power may, on application made to him by the licensee under a licence with respect to which this section applies, grant an increase in the standard lorry weight for the licensee.</P>
      <P>That is subsection (2) of Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase under this section shall be calculated at a rate not exceeding seven hundredweight in respect of each lorry operated by <Col N="1087" /> the licensee or the original licensee (as the case may be)...</P>

      <P>(b) in case the licence was issued in pursuance of subsection (1) of section 114 of the Transport Act, 1944, the qualifying conditions specified in subparagraph (v) of paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of that section.</P>
      <P>That says that in individual cases of hardship the Minister will have a wider discretion.  Is that not so?  The Minister, as I understood him, tells us that that is used relatively rarely although there have been in the past general concessions made which applied to all the licensed carriers.</P>

What does &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; mean?  Will the Minister explain to us what he has in mind? Suppose a person comes to him and says: &ldquo;I cannot carry enough sheep, pigs or cattle in my lorry to make it worth while operating the lorry unless I put on 30 cwt. of equipment.&rdquo;  Is that a case of hardship?</P>

      <P>It is necessary to understand the meaning of legislation. As I understand the Minister's intervention, the position is that this Bill means very little at all.  I do not understand why he has put in a general increase of seven cwt. if it is open to him to give anybody an increase up to 20 or 40 cwt., if he is satisfied that they ought to have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And we are to assume that anyone that it does not cover has a very good prospect of getting a further licence?  Remember, if that is the representation made to this House, it ought to be honoured. Frankly, I do not believe it but I wait to hear what the Minister says in his concluding speech and I will note it well.  What I want to know is: are we correct in believing that, if this is passed, any person who has heretofore used equipment ranging up to 30 or 40 cwt. legitimately can ask for his merchandise licence to be adapted under the 1944 legislation to make it possible for him to use it indefinitely in future?  That, I think, is a categorical question and it is one to which we are entitled to have an answer before the Minister asks the House to dispose of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not in the House when the Minister spoke because I have been approached by some licensed hauliers and furniture removal associations in Dublin county and city.  Some of them seem very alarmed about the change in taxation.  I just want to put a few points to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one case a man with eight furniture removal vans states that his increased taxation will be approximately £250, and that it may be responsible for forcing him not to tax some of his vans in future.  This evening I received a deputation from some licensed hauliers from County Dublin. The licences under which they are operating are based on the unladen weight of the vehicles, which did not include lift vans or other equipment issued from time to time.  An increase in taxation in respect of such lift vans would, in many cases, put the owners outside the allowable tonnage under which they have been able to operate <Col N="1090" /> in the past.  The limitation does not apply to a cheap competitor.  The lift vans are their own or other companies' or railway container vans.  These are very heavy vans, which are used from time to time.</P>
    <P>I want to get from the Minister an assurance that no lorry owner or holder of a merchandise licence will be expected to put a heavy railway van on his lorry to be weighed, when he may have it only periodically.  I should like that assurance from the Minister and a further explanation of the points that have been made by these people. They state that this equipment is constantly being changed and is not permanently on the vehicles.  Their vehicles, of necessity, are of the flat lorry type more strongly and heavily built than if they were built to use the lighter, alloy, fixed bodies.  The vehicles that are used carry a total weight of about 4 tons.  These people, especially the furniture removal people, are very perturbed as to the type of container they will put on the vehicles so as to have the legal weight.  If their weight is in excess of that required by the Bill while the Bill will allow 7 cwt. over the present weight, will the Minister consider granting an exemption so that no hardship will be incurred?</P>
    <P>Some licensed hauliers have had a lean time for a period and are finding it very difficult to continue.  If, as a result of legislation passed by this House, their position is worsened, will the Minister deal with each case on its merits and see that no hardship is incurred by hauliers who have operated under a merchandise licence over the years and who give a good deal of employment in the city and county of Dublin?</P>
    <P>While the increased taxation represents a very heavy burden on quite a number of licensed hauliers, the ordinary farmers who at present weigh their lorries without fittings will also be affected.  A farmer may have one fitting on his lorry in the morning and may have a heavier fitting on the lorry in the evening.  He may be challenged at any time.  He may have to put a very heavy container on his lorry for some purpose.  Any guard or any transport officer can challenge <Col N="1091" /> him and say: &ldquo;What is the laden weight of this lorry to-day?  Had you a container on when your lorry was weighed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the points I should like the Minister to clear up and on which I should like an assurance for the people I have the honour of representing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to clarify the position with a view to seeing what is being done under this. As I understand the legislation as it operated heretofore, the Minister had power to amend licences in order to relieve hardships and grant certain increases.  About 18 months ago, there was a Transport Bill before this House.  At that time, the Minister agreed that on account of changed conditions or changed methods of manufacture, lorries differed considerably from the old unladen weight of 2½ tons or 2 tons 13 cwt., some of them because of tipping gear or other such fixtures which are now commonplace on all lorries.  As a result of representations made directly to him and to Deputies at the time, the matter was considered here and he undertook to grant amendments, wherever they were considered reasonable.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, however, it is decided, under the provisions of this section, that not merely does the original discretion remain but the Minister may, on application made to him by a licensee, grant an increase in the standard rate up to seven cwt. Numerous queries have been put to the Minister to ascertain how seven cwt. was decided on.  His answer is that he was advised by the officials of the Department, that that was their recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other Deputies, I received representations from the furniture people.  They say that the weights vary but one case put to me was that the container, box or whatever it is called, is moved in on these vans.  In some cases, it is a fixture. It weighs anything up to 25 cwt. I am told that there are even one or two very large ones which can weigh as much as 35 cwt.  These people who are licensed hauliers and who <Col N="1092" /> operated within the law and who want to continue to do so, want to know whether they will be excluded.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other case to which reference was made&mdash;horse-boxes.  I do not know whether they would come within the normal creel weight as applied to cattle.  The horse-boxes that are attached, as distinct from a horse-box proper, would certainly weigh more than seven cwt.  A number of these hauliers attach these and detach them as they wish to carry other traffic. I should like the Minister to explain in his reply whether he is satisfied that this proposed amendment will allow an increase to cover either furniture people or other licensed hauliers who tell me that in some cases the attachments vary in weight between one ton and 1½ tons.  The details are available to the Department as well as to Deputies, but if it appears that what we are doing in this is making an amendment which will be inadequate, then I feel that there is a strong case for providing sufficient cover in the section for all these categories of licensed hauliers, whether furniture removers, people who attach horse-boxes or people who attach creels for the carriage of cattle or sheep.  Sufficient cognisance should be taken of the changed types of lorries now being used and also the different equipment available over and above that which was available when these Acts were originally drafted.</P>
    <P>From the discussions we had here on the last occasion, it is obvious that this legislation and the terms on which licences were granted are out of date when you take into account modern conditions, modern methods of constructing lorries and the various equipment that goes with them.  When the original Acts were framed, lorries were generally much lighter.  They had not the mechanical attachments which many of them have to-day.  Consequently, I feel that consideration should be given to the peculiar position of those people who have licences and who wish to continue to carry on their business within the law and who have attachments which weigh considerably more than seven cwt.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the concluding words of the Minister for Local Government on the Financial Resolution and the opening speech of the Minister for Transport and Power on this Bill, it is clear that a complete new principle is established.  It is clear that this Bill will bestow upon the Minister for Transport and Power a legislative as well as an executive power.  He himself will decide the type of person who can prove hardship to get more than seven cwt. in respect of a container, creel or whatever it may be.  He will decide that for each individual.  He indicated that by a nod of his head and a nod of the Minister's head is as good as a wink to Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>Then we had the very extraordinary spectacle of the Deputy from Limerick, Deputy O'Malley, who, when the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, said that abuses took place in the past about markings on certain forms, named a very honourable society in this House and sneered at it.  I protest against that kind of conduct and I feel that the Chair should not allow it.  However, I do not want to cast any reflection on the Chair, as I suppose the Chair did not advert to it at the time.  I resent the insinuation of Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>We have ample evidence over the years that when a discretionary power is left to a Minister, which is not controlled by statute, great abuses can arise.  It is a fundamental principle, and a principle of the first importance, that everybody should know where he stands before the law.  On the Military Service Pensions Act, I held that everybody should know whether he was in or out.  It was not so held and we got dissatisfaction.  Here is the same thing being resurrected in another form.  The Minister argues and Deputy O'Malley asserts that it was there in Section 114 of the 1934 Act. That is being changed, as Deputy Norton properly pointed out.  When one person established the case of hardship under that section, hitherto it applied to everybody in that category without any further ado.  Under this new Bill, each case will be separate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Acts have been used on two occasions to grant quite substantial increases in the unladen weight of the vehicle and that applied automatically to everybody. To that extent, therefore, the Act was used extensively in that general way.  It was used in a more limited way to grant extensions in cases or hardship but only in a very minor degree and a limited number of cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, instead of seven cwt., the Minister takes power, if he so desires, to make it 44 cwt.  That is something more than the statute ever intended.  Furthermore, the case will be made for each individual person.  That is all right for Fianna Fáil, when Fianna Fáil are in office.  Fianna Fáil will not always be in office, no matter what their intentions may be.  The day will come when we shall have a Minister for Transport and Power of another Government.  What then? The principle the Government are now seeking to establish is most dangerous. No matter who the Minister may be, he should not be given that power.  If he has it, it should be circumscribed in such a way that everybody knows what power he will exercise, how he will exercise it, his rights under it, the method by which one can secure one's privilege or one's right.  We should be very careful, in view of the speech by the Minister for Transport and Power, that this Bill is not passed with this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand Deputies being worried and in some degree perplexed about the discretionary powers vested in the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to hardship cases.  The difficulty is that we in the Department do not yet know what character the hardship cases will take.  It would be very difficult to provide in a Bill for all the circumstances under which an increase beyond seven cwt. could be given.  There are very many individual circumstances relating to the operations of licensed hauliers to take into consideration.  I want to make clear that there is nothing new in the Minister <Col N="1095" /> for Transport and Power making use of an individual discretionary power in connection with merchandise road transport legislation.  The Minister has absolute power to decide on the most difficult question of contemporaneous evidence in relation to a licensee who did not, when he applied for a licence under the 1933 Act, give properly and completely the evidence for area covered by the lorries in question.  The examination of that, and all it involves, is a matter for individual decision by the Minister in each case.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy MacEoin, there is no statute which tells exactly whether the Minister can grant an extension in the area of the licensee, except the general declaration that there must be contemporaneous evidence. Some of the evidence is dated back a considerable period.  The documents have to be examined for authenticity, to avoid accepting forged documents as evidence.  There are other sections of the Act where, again, the Minister has individual discretion. He may decide to extend the area of operation of the licensee because it would appear that to exclude a particular county when in fact counties surrounding that county were mentioned previously in the documents would be inequitable.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Minister has absolute discretion, in some instances, to increase the types of merchandise that can be carried in the lorries owned by licensees.  In certain circumstances, if, for example, a licensed haulier has a number of commodities on his licence but some are excluded, the Minister has to decide in relation to the transport available in the area whether it is reasonable to exclude those commodities. There has to be an individual decision by the Minister and there is no specific statute or subsection of a Bill to guide him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In areas where there is inadequate transport and where statutory bodies such as C.I.E. do not operate, the Minister has absolute power to decide how many licences he will give in order to provide transport in an area. He has power to increase the weight <Col N="1096" /> in those circumstances, on his own discretion.  There is no section in the transport legislation which determines how he can increase the weight for persons who receive licences in an area where no public transport is available.  He has the discretion there. He has the choice of deciding how many licences he can reasonably give. I think he also has the choice of the classes of merchandise in each case that they can carry.  That indicates that there is no innovation in making use of Section 115 of the 1944 Act to give discretion in these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of some event which he claims took place in which different forms were marked in a certain way.  I have no knowledge of such instances.  I have had enough time to confer with very experienced officers of the Department in regard at least to the recent phase of the administration of the Acts.  Naturally, I have been in the main, looking at the postwar position.  In that period, if I remember rightly, there have been four Governments.  There has been hardly any public controversy over acts by the Minister-extensions of an area or any other decisions given by the Minister. There has been a very fine tradition in the Transport Section of what used to be the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Under three Governments before the present Government was set up, and since the present Government was set up, there have been virtually no complaints, no allegations of political discrimination.</P>
    <P>Ministers, I agree, are in a very difficult position.  I always like, when I have the opportunity, to commend the work of our civil servants when this is their due.  The officers of the Department of Transport and Power know the legislation backwards.  They have shown a capacity for maintaining an equable approach in advising the Minister, whether, for example, Deputy Norton was Minister for Commerce or Deputy Lemass, or myself.  They keep their decisions consistent and showing a pattern that can be understood. One can read in the Department literally dozens of files relating to the discretionary powers exercised <Col N="1097" /> by the Minister, and see running through them a thread of reasonableness, fairness, equity, common sense and a human approach.  I do not believe any Deputy would contradict my statement.</P>
    <P>I am taking a great interest in all aspects of my Department's activities but it takes longer than three months to get the whole of the transport legislation off by heart and know the ins and outs of it.  No person could do it in a short period who also had to acquire a knowledge of the rest of the Department at the same time.  I have had time to examine a great many files.  I have sat continuously with the officers and prodded them with questions : why did you do it in this case and why not in that case?  Every time the answer was reasonable and logical, and made common sense, and not only that, but there was a reasonable human approach towards the persons concerned. I hope in relation to anything Deputy Dillon said about forms being signed, whatever he was referring to is not the experience of the House in regard to the administration of these Acts.</P>

      <P>Of course, if Deputy Sweetman wants to accuse the members of the Government of a capacity to be politically corrupt in the adminitration of licences, he can do so, but I do not believe the people in the country will agree.  I want to assure the House that whatever action is <Col N="1098" /> taken with discretionary powers to increase the weight over and beyond seven cwt. there is no intention to uproot or disrupt the cattle trade or to place impossible burdens upon the farmers or to cause a slow-down in the rapid transport of pigs, cattle or sheep from farm to market, or from the farm to any other destination.  I can assure the House also that if through some unknown factor, we suddenly saw ourselves involved in anything which would cause widespread hardship, I would go immediately to the Government and say: &ldquo;Here are circumstances we have not foreseen which will disrupt the cattle trade and we have to have some kind of emergency action immediately to deal with it.&rdquo;  I do not think there is any necessity to raise scares in people's minds in regard to that question.</P>
      <P>I want to say next that the purpose of this Bill is not to drive more traffic in the direction of C.I.E.  In fact, the first result of the passing of the Bill would be an increase in the capacity of the lorries involved, by 10 per cent. or 12 per cent., at the expense of C.I.E. to some degree.  Although I am determined to assist C.I.E. in every way possible in their effort to become solvent and cease to mulct the taxpayers to the tune of millions every year, I can assure the House there is no secret plot involved in this Bill to drive traffic towards C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies know, licensees have already had considerable increases in the weights permitted since 1933.  The general weights have been increased by 45 per cent. in the case of four-ton lorries and by 22 per cent. in the case of lorries over four tons.  In addition to that, an allowance of 10 cwt. has been given to any lorry fitted with permanent tipping gear, and allowance is made for any lorry fitted with a diesel engine in place of a petrol engine up to five cwt. Several hundreds of licensees took advantage of both of these provisions so that a very large number of licensees have been able to increase their weight and they availed of the provisions provided for them under the terms of legislation at different times. <Col N="1099" /> We intend to examine every case of hardship arising from the limitation of seven cwt. on its own merits. People who were genuinely confused in regard to the weights which apply to their lorries and have been doing a <i>bona fide</i> trade will have their cases sympathetically considered.  In the Department, we have already received a deputation from the furniture removers, who are, quite obviously, in a special category, and everything will be done to avoid unnecessary hardship on them.  The same will apply to people who use containers. In relation to the Road Transport Acts, the container position is not entirely clear.  If we get applications from persons who use containers that are fixed to lorries, containers that can be removed by crane, containers belonging to other parties or other types, we shall have to examine them.  All I can say is that I shall have to ask the House to trust my judgment in this matter.</P>
    <P>I believe the officers of my Department will be able to create the same kind of pattern of consistency in examining these cases as they have in the past in regard to many exceptional points which have arisen in connection with previous legislation.  I think the officers have the capacity to draw a consistent pattern and one which can be easily perceived and in connection with which there can be no allegation of political bias or corruption.</P>
    <P>If it should emerge, when we have examined many applications, that there are difficulties involved so that it would appear that it might be necessary to have some further legislation, we naturally will bring it before the House, but the officers of my Department believe they can deal with a case of genuine hardship sympathetically and having due regard to the fact that we consider that the majority of the licensed hauliers operated legally and did not evade their responsibility. Those who did not evade the payment of tax and can prove genuine hardship can be given additional weight in renewing their licences.  But in cases of <Col N="1100" /> deliberate evasion we obviously cannot grant increases of weight without negativing the purpose underlying this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can say any more about it than that because we have, first of all, to get the applications.  I do not believe that anybody genuinely engaged in business and keeping to the law need fear a worsening of his position. We do not intend to worsen the position of those who have not evaded the law in the past.  We shall do everything we can to see that the position of C.I.E. is safeguarded, but we are not going to drive traffic into the arms of C.I.E. through the operation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying &mdash;and I should like to repeat&mdash;that the Minister has exercised very wide discretionary power which is fully comparable with what he will have to exercise in deciding on hardships arising from the general application of seven cwt.  There are literally hundreds of files in the Department which testify to the truth of his having so acted and of having acted&mdash;this refers to all the Ministers concerned in the past ten years&mdash;with commendable restraint, sympathy and discretion. The answer is very simple&mdash;that there have been no Parliamentary Questions during the past ten years which have seriously questioned the probity or integrity of the Minister in removing anomalies or dealing with grievances.</P>

In view of the fact, I repeat, that the taxation period will begin on 1st January, and assuming that this Bill will pass all its Stages tonight or tomorrow, does the Minister propose to publish a statutory notice&mdash; strangely enough, there are people in the country who do not read newspapers&mdash;inviting all allegedly aggrieved parties to make immediate application to the Department for an increase in unladen weight and giving their reasons?

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,460 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>The Department of Transport and Power was established on the 27th July, 1959, and it is necessary to provide funds to meet the cost of the services administered by the Department to the end of the present financial year.  It is considered inadvisable to make any changes in the existing financial arrangements in the current year in respect of the services transferred for which provision is made in the Votes for Industry and Commerce (Vote 50); Transport and Marine Services (Vote 51), and Aviation and Meteorological Services (Vote 52).  Accordingly, expenditure on those services to the end of 1959-60 will, as indicated in the note to this Estimate, continue to be borne on Votes 50, 51 and 52 and accounted for by the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The expenditure for which the authority of the Dáil is now being sought relates only to certain services not provided for in any other Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The staffs working on the functions which have been transferred were taken over by the new Department and their salaries, etc., will continue to be borne on Votes 50, 51 and 52.  Provision has to be made, however, for the new Minister, for two new posts, Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary, for the Private Secretary to the Minister (Higher Executive Officer) and the Private Secretary to the Secretary (Executive Officer) of the Department. In addition, a provision is included to cover the allowances paid to the Private Secretaries and to the confidential Shorthand Typist to the Minister. The salary provision amounts to £5,160.  In addition, a sum of £300 is provided to cover the travelling expenses and subsistence allowances of the staff of the Department whose salaries are borne on this Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not a dummy.  He should have some power to restrict statutory bodies where their policy creates undue hardship for the public.  I hold that the practice of the E.S.B. in asking the people I have in mind to save money for them is wrong.  I have a case I propose to raise tomorrow where an old age pensioner used 9d. worth of light and her bill was 14/6d.- 13/9d. for the meter rent and 9d. for the charge.  Is that not hardship? <Col N="1106" /> Surely the excuse the E.S.B. has that it would be costly for them to put in a coin meter is something that can be queried, and surely the Minister should be concerned with the hardship this policy inflicts on poor people.  It is his duty to see that these bodies are in some way restricted so that an old age pensioner such as I have in mind who puts on a light for about a half an hour before going to bed thinking that it will be cheap will not get a bill for 14/6d., 13/9d. of which is for meter rent.</P>
      <P>If the case is being made in regard to P.A.Y.E. against asking people for lump sums, the same thing should apply here.  The Minister should restrict the E.S.B. from compelling poor people to save money for two months.  They are unable to do it. It is contrary to the nature of things. Under this policy, thousands are cut off every year among the poorest people because they are not able to save money.  When the bill is due, the money is not on hands, the current is cut off and they have to pay 10/- to have it reconnected.  That policy of inflicting hardship on the poorest people is wrong.  Meter fees and such are all right for business people who have a reserve of money but not for poor people and I shall continue to agitate against this policy.  That is all I shall say because I am not prepared but I am well prepared on the point I have just made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister, if he replies to Deputy Sherwin, will say that he has no function in this matter.  Since the pronouncement was made by the Minister that a new Ministry was being set up, I had hoped that we would have a clarification by the Taoiseach of the powers of that Minister, the Minister for Transport and Power, who would deal with such very important aspects of our economy, but so far I must confess that I have been completely in the dark as to what the real functions of the Minister are.  I had hoped that when the Supplementary Estimate came before the House under which money would be made available to <Col N="1107" /> pay for these services&mdash;about which we are not clear&mdash;the Minister would let us into the secret that seems to exist between himself and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>There are four major bodies now concerned with transport and power. We have two major bodies connected with transport, C.I.E. and Aer Lingus; we have two other major bodies, the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna concerned with power.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me, he did not make clear what the functions of the new Minister would be in connection with these State bodies.  I mentioned two dealing with transport.  If any Deputy has a matter of public importance to raise in connection with either of those State bodies, he is precluded under <Col N="1108" /> Standing Orders from raising it in this House.  I happened to have the privilege of being a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges up to recently and it was clearly and definitely established that it was against the rules of procedure to allow questions of importance in connection with these bodies to appear on the Order Paper.  How can Deputies query the Minister as to his responsibilities at Question Time in connection with either Aer Lingus or C.I.E.?  In what way is the Minister to be held responsible to the House?</P>
      <P>The Chair knows that an attempt has recently been made to prevent Deputies from putting down Private Members' motions dealing with C.I.E., E.S.B., Aer Lingus or Bórd na Móna. Not only are they prohibited from putting down questions but an attempt was made to prevent us from putting down motions on the subject.  Yet we now have the Minister charged with the responsibility of looking after transport but the hands of the House are tied.  They cannot ask questions; they cannot deal with the subject for which he is responsible.</P>
      <P>Let us take the question of power. The E.S.B. is another State body that has been given specific statutory powers by this House, powers which prohibit Deputies from interfering in the administration of practically every aspect of the E.S.B.  Yet the Minister comes into the House and we are told he is responsible for that body.  If he is responsible here for that body, for its policy and administration, the members of the House should be in a position to query aspects of the administration or policy of the E.S.B.  The same applies to Bórd na Móna.  It might not be desirable to have every aspect of these State bodies discussed in the House; I do not suggest that should be done.  But I am trying to find out what exactly the Minister's functions are, and how far Deputies can force him to accept responsibility for matters of importance that come to their notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, we have a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and if a Deputy wishes to raise questions in connection with the Department of Posts and <Col N="1109" /> Telegraphs, he may do so and the Minister must accept responsibility. That is reasonable.  We have another Department called the Department of Lands and in connection with it we have a Minister with very little functions and very little power.  Are we now to appoint another Minister in charge of transport and power who will have as little responsibility as the Minister in charge of Lands has?  If that is the case, I object to making money available for the payment of a Minister whose responsibilities we cannot find out, and who will not be responsible to this House on matters of importance.</P>
    <P>If I, for instance, put a query to the Minister as to whether he intends to amalgamate the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, I am precluded from advocating any such amalgamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must realise that neither he nor any other Minister, nor the civil servants advising here, have authority as to what questions appear on the Order Paper. That is decided by the Ceann Comhairle and in my personal knowledge and experience, questions which I put down in connection with the administration of Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., and C.I.E., time and again have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  Will that situation still obtain?  Can the Minister tell me, in future, that due to the fact that he has assumed responsibilities which apparently up to this were the sole responsibilities of these State companies, by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, it will be possible for Deputies to put down questions and have them answered?  If the Minister clarifies that point, I shall not delay him any longer, and he will be welcome to this Estimate.</P>

      <P>It has been established tradition that the Minister does not interfere with the day-to-day working of State companies.  He examines general policy, their financial position, and how the operations of the various companies are going to affect the economy as a whole, and I can assure Deputies that there is plenty of work to do in that connection.  This matter has been discussed for many years, not only here but in other Parliaments, as to just how free State companies should be in day-to-day policy and administration.  It has been very widely debated and men of equal stature, equal probity and political reputation, have disagreed on the subject and it would be very difficult for me, at this stage, to start a philosophical discourse on what has been a question of great interest, but upon which there have been wide differences of opinion.</P>
      <P>I should, however, like to refer Deputies to the very able discourse by the Taoiseach to the Institute of Public Administration on this subject, and in that they will see the case outlined as to what interference there should be and as to how free State companies should be from interference or inquiries of routine character. I do not think I should say anything more about it.</P>

In reply to the Deputy, <Col N="1112" /> I could make a statement that few members of the House would disagree with, that in relation to the E.S.B. and the charges made to persons in very low income grades, it would be rather more a matter for public assistance, for the level of the social welfare services, than to suggest the E.S.B., for example, should subsidise current to one level of consumers on very modest incomes, at the expense of other groups on almost equally low incomes, people who manage to pay their electricity bills&mdash; but that is the kind of thing which will lead us nowhere.</P>

      <P>It is very important for the person appointed Minister for Transport and Power to take an active interest in every phase of activity in respect of all the companies over which he has general supervision, and I can assure Deputies that in the course of the year if multiple complaints, which in the ordinary way are not regarded as subjects suitable for Parliamentary Questions arose, I would examine all of them.  If the point were reached where I felt I had the right, in view of the general powers of a Minister, to inquire into the working of any State company, because of complaints, naturally I should do so.  That is quite different, however, from interference in the day-to-day activities of a State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter on which there are different opinions.  Even in Great Britain, one finds Conservatives and Socialists with varying opinions on the subject.  I hope to be able to hold the balance in an equitable manner, so that, when I come before the House to report on the Estimate, there will be no criticism to the effect that I have maintained the tradition of allowing <Col N="1113" /> State companies to be free to the point of encouraging social or economic abuses.  I hope I shall be able to face the House in such a manner that nobody can accuse me of that.  As I said, this involves tact and discretion.  While I am not actually prepared to speak at length on this matter, I am giving some general impressions.</P>
    <P>I can cite a particular example. Today a Deputy asked a perfectly normal question, one which was permitted by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as to the number of persons in County Mayo who have been paid for their land by Bord na Móna.  The reply was that that was a matter of day-to-day activity by Bord na Móna; it was not a question in which I should like to interfere.  Quite obviously, of course, if I knew that Bord na Móna were getting generally behindhand in their payments and that there were substantial abuses, I would take action.  I knew very well in that particular case, as in most cases, it was a question of producing title and, in the circumstances, it was quite unnecessary for me to reply to the question in detail.  It was a matter of day-to-day routine and I knew from the general conduct of Bord na Móna that there was unlikely to be any delay in payments.  The reasons for the delay in this instance were both normal and acceptable.</P>
    <P>All these matters can be discussed on the main Estimate.  I do not claim that I can contribute much more to the experts who have debated this question of the freedom of State companies. I doubt if I can do any better than the Taoiseach, who spoke excellently on the subject, or than some other people who feel there should be some special machinery for inquiry into the operations of State companies, a matter upon which, as everyone knows, there has been controversy here from time to time.  I doubt if I have very much to contribute to the argument now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the situation, the Minister has set out in Appendix III of the &lsquo;buff&rsquo; White Paper the various rates of tax that will be payable by certain classes of people in respect of unearned income.  I recently tried to make some comparison between these rates and the rates applicable in other countries.  The position about which I wish to obtain some information from the Minister now is that in relation to a married couple with two children.  The relevant column is the last column in Appendix <Col N="1117" /> III.  As far as I can ascertain&mdash;I should like the Minister either to confirm or correct me&mdash;a married couple in Canada, with two children, earning 4,000 dollars a year would fall within the category equivalent to £1,430.  In the category of £1,430, as I calculated from Appendix III, he will now be paying here in Ireland about £159 or £160.  I should like the Minister to tell me whether my computation is correct.  If it is correct I should like to ask the Minister why it is at that figure when in a similar case in Canada it is only £64.  There is virtually £100 more tax to be paid by the married couple with two children in Ireland than in Canada.</P>
      <P>In relation to the same income in the United States the tax would be £86 as against £159 or £160, as far as I can compute it.  I do not want to take the Minister short, as he has only just taken over this brief, but I am sure in the brief will be found a table showing the rates of tax for a married couple with two children, not merely by the jumps of £250, as are on the White Paper, but approximating to the figures I have mentioned.  The position appears to be that the Canadian tax in that case would be £64 and the American tax £86, that is to say, provided that my conversion of $4,000 Canadian is correct at £1,430, that my conversion of $180 Canadian is correct at £64, and my conversion of $240 U.S. is correct at £86.</P>

Of course, when one starts talking about American income tax and income tax in Canada, one has to remember that in addition to federal taxes there are also State taxes in the United States and, I think, provincial taxes in Canada, certainly in the United States.  I am just wondering what sort of red herring Deputy Sweetman wants to bring into this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying I really did not see how any Deputy looking at this question realistically could ask me at this hour of the night why the Canadian income tax, assessed upon a married couple with two children in relation to an income of the equivalent of £1,400, is so very much less than the tax paid here.  The reason the income tax here is high is that, first of all, there are in general so few income taxpayers, that such a relatively small proportion of the population pay income tax here.</P>
      <P>The next point is, as I have already mentioned, that we are carrying a very heavy superstructure of social and other services which would have to be paid for either out of direct taxation or indirectly by tax upon beer and spirits and other commodities which I remember the Deputy wanted very much more lightly taxed.  If we tax this excisable liquor or tax tobacco lightly we have to increase the burden on the direct taxpayer.  That is perhaps one of the reasons why there is such a marked contrast between the amount of tax borne by the married couple with two children in Canada and the United States and the amount borne here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a much more relevant comparison which the Deputy might have made and that is the amount of tax borne by a married couple with two children here and the amount which a couple in the same circumstances with the same income would bear in Great Britain.  The perspective would be very much <Col N="1119" /> better if the Deputy would contrast the position here with the position in Great Britain.  A married couple with two children would pay under our existing system £128 15s.  Under the P.A.Y.E. system, when it is introduced, they will pay £120 4s. 6d.  In Great Britain a similar couple with an income of £1,250 would pay £131 7s. 2d. which in any event indicates that they are not better off than our direct taxpayers here.  That is the real comparison to make, not with these distant empires across the Atlantic, not with these great world States but with our neighbours in Great Britain and perhaps some of the countries on the Continent.  I do not want to go into that now, but that would give the people a very much truer appreciation of what the position is here than trying to draw their attention to what is happening in America and in Canada.  The fact is that far-off fields are green, as we know.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, as a practical step to stimulate increased production through the improvement of the fertility of our land by badly needed drainage schemes and at the same time help to relieve unemployment in rural areas the necessary moneys to put the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation should be provided immediately.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputies McQuillan and Dr. Browne.)</P>

      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to say at this stage whether he intends to allow the motion to conclude before the House rises on Friday, whether time will be made available to other Deputies to speak within the time remaining, or is it possible the Minister has decided to make a pronouncement tonight?  I should like if the Minister could let <Col N="1121" /> us know whether the motion could be finished rather than have it go on until February 10th when the House is to resume.  I put that point to the Minister before he speaks himself.</P>
      <P>I have little more to say except to emphasise that one of the best pieces of legislation to come from this House in the last 12 years was the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  A tremendous amount of good work was carried out throughout the country under this Act as far as drainage is concerned.  The farmers, no matter what their political views, welcomed it wholeheartedly.  As a matter of fact, some of the greatest supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party were the most enthusiastic supporters of the Act.</P>
      <P>It is a mystery to me why the working of such a splendid Act was suspended by the Government, especially in view of the fact that the same Government have so often appealed to the farming community to increase production from the land.  The Taoiseach, who was always interested in industrial revival and expansion, declared within the past two years that unless we achieved a tremendous expansion in agricultural production, there was very little hope for the future.  He was even prepared to say that the key to our future success as a nation lay in the proper use of the land.  I shall not ask whether that was conversion or anything else on the part of the Taoiseach.  I am prepared to accept he was completely genuine when he said it was his firm conviction that we had to depend on the land to bring us forward as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little use in appealing to the farmers and farm workers to increase production if the land itself is covered with water.  It is only common sense to say that before you can have more grass, more cultivation of the land and more livestock, you must have the land in a fit state to carry the tillage and the livestock.  If farmers see &mdash;as many of them in my constituency do&mdash;their land constantly flooded, it is most disheartening to have these constant appeals from the Government to increase production.  It is frustrating and enraging for the farming <Col N="1122" /> community to have these appeals to increase production when they cannot even see their land for nine or 10 months of the year because of flooding.</P>
    <P>I have heard the case put forward that money was wasted under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Again I would ask the Minister to give particulars of where such waste occurred.  I can assure him he will find it hard to produce evidence of waste of money in the constituency I represent.  The farming community there are accustomed to severe losses over the years because of the flooding of the major rivers, and a good deal of alleviation of distressing conditions was brought about by the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Recently the cleaning of one river&mdash;the Crannagh Cross river&mdash;was half way through when the working of the Act was suspended.  This meant that many farms in the locality were left in a shocking condition because of flooding. I can say without any exaggeration that on occasions the farmers did not see much of their land over 12 months of the year.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and restore the moneys so that the good work, which had been going on up to 18 months ago, can be continued.  It has been suggested that the Government are not satisfied with the Act itself, as such, and that they are prepared to bring in new legislation to deal with some of the drainage problems that were dealt with under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not care whether or not they bring in new legislation.  So far as drainage is concerned, &ldquo;A rose by any other name&rdquo; suits me.  If the Government feel they will lose face in connection with this Act and wish to change the name of the Act and bring in another one, I shall not mind.  I am sure many Deputies will not mind and neither will the farmers.  What they want is to get their lands drained so they can get on with the job.  I hope the Minister will have a word of encouragement and hope for the farmers all over the country who have been anxiously looking forward to a resumption of work under this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few points to make in seconding the motion.  The Taoiseach has asked us on a number of occasions, with a certain amount of conviction and sincerity, to put forward suggestions for consideration by the Government as to the methods by which he could help to increase employment in the country as a whole and most people have been struck by the open-mindedness with which he has handed out these invitations to everybody in regard to the question of employment.  The general feeling is that he really does wish to see employment opportunities increased both in rural Ireland and city areas.  Indeed, industry, the trade union movement and local authorities, by means of a circular, have all been asked to make suggestions as to methods by which the Government could increase employment in their various areas.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the proposition in the motion is a particularly good one.  It suggests an extension of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which was introduced by the late Deputy Timothy Murphy, a former Minister for Local Government.  It was, I always believed, an excellent piece of legislation because it was reasonably flexible.  It gave the local authorities power to carry out minor drainage operations to a certain extent, the removal of obstructions, the widening and deepening of rivers, the building of embankments, the replacement of embankments, and generally served the two purposes of creating opportunities for employment on the one hand and, on the other hand, in rural Ireland, of seeing that the floods that interfere with the working of the land were dealt with and, in city areas, ensuring that the problem arising from flooding as a result of rivers overflowing their banks, as has happened in recent years in the city of Dublin, could be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A city Deputy has as much interest <Col N="1124" /> in this proposition and in the working of the Local Authorities (Works) Act as the rural Deputy in so far as, in the City of Dublin, on a number of occasions, there has been very serious incidence of flooding as a result of the overflowing of the Tolka recently and, on various occasions, of the Dodder and other smaller and larger rivers.  The Corporation and the county council, clearly, could use their powers under this Act to provide, first of all, for the clearing of obstructions and the deepening and widening of rivers, thus obviating the flooding which causes great inconvenience, particularly in the winter periods, and the great dislocation of people's lives, which has occurred from time to time in the city area. I would suggest to the Minister that he should encourage the Corporation and the county council to examine carefully and fully the powers which they have vested in them under this Act in order to find out ways in which they could deal with flooding in the city and county areas.</P>
    <P>Secondly, of course, as we all know from endless questions that have been put down here to the Taoiseach, in the last few weeks in particular, there is great need for the provision of employment opportunities in the city areas.  There are many hundreds of people at the employment exchanges and, approaching Christmas, it is particularly regrettable that that is so. The Minister should indicate to the local authorities that he is willing to consider schemes put forward by them in addition to those which he has already accepted and which are in operation.</P>
    <P>The city Deputy is also concerned with the activities under this Act from the fact that one of the troubles which have arisen in the past 30 to 40 years is due to our failure to increase opportunities for employment in rural Ireland to anything like the extent needed.  In the first instance, the normal increase in population creates persons who need work and, secondly, the relatively quick advance of mechanisation of agriculture in rural Ireland, particularly in the post-war <Col N="1125" /> period, is throwing greater and greater numbers of people from rural Ireland on the employment exchanges and giving them the alternatives of moving into the large towns and cities and, the next step, emigrating.</P>
    <P>I understand that the figure given in the Report of the Commission on Emigration is that something like 11,000 to 12,000 persons a year required work or were disemployed each year in rural Ireland.  That, plus the 11,000 or 12,000 who are turned out by the schools every year also requiring employment, means that 25,000 or 26,000 people require new jobs each year and, of course, nothing like that number of new jobs are being provided or, so far as we can see from what the Taoiseach has told us, are likely to be provided in the foreseeable future.  If we were to look at it from the very selfish point of view of a city or urban Deputy, it is very important from our point of view that every possible opportunity be given to the man living in rural Ireland to live there and, if possible, to find permanent employment in rural Ireland and, in that way, save the tremendous, growing pressure which there is on the very limited amount of opportunities for permanent employment in the city areas and also, of course, where they have qualified, on the relatively few opportunities for relief work, made available in the city areas from time to time.</P>
    <P>So, no matter in which form of employment the Minister is interested, whether that concerning rural Ireland or the city areas, it seems to me that the proposition here to provide more moneys for work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, whether in the city or rural areas, must be of undoubted benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages in this Act, which has always appealed to me, flows from the fact that it can be a form of expenditure of a creative kind, a form of productive capital investment.  One of the disabilities under which we suffer as a result of putting all our hopes in a private enterprise economy is that we are completely dependent on the haphazard <Col N="1126" /> development of employment opportunities in cities or rural areas, on the whim or wishes of the particular industrialist, factory owner, or businessman, whoever he may be. We cannot direct him to create opportunities for employment in any area where there may be a particularly large number of unemployed persons.  We cannot direct him to erect his factory or industry in that area.  In fact, we failed completely to offset the great depopulation of the western seaboard, under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I think most people accept that it has failed to serve its particular purpose.  We have failed to get private enterprise to provide employment in rural Ireland.  We are at the moment engaged in spending a tremendous amount of money in the Shannon estuary for much the same purpose.</P>
    <P>The net result is that over the years various local authorities and various Governments have had to restrict their powers and direct the sources of the creation of unemployment to non-productive investment capital which is house building and road building and, to a more limited extent, hospitals and schools which could not really be said to absorb anything but a tiny minority of the people requiring work.  Successive Governments have had no alternative but to put money into road building as funds for the local authority and into the building of a tremendous number of houses.</P>
    <P>In the early stages, there was a certain amount of social dynamic in the provision of houses.  Latterly, as the various politicians began to understand the position, they realised it was really the only effective way of directing opportunities for work to particular areas.  I understand from a speech made by the Minister for Transport and Power that we have something like nine times the total road area of most European countries.  We have a tremendous number of roads.  The position in regard to the roads is so because we have not any other use for the number of people who require work in rural Ireland.  Road building has been a nominal relief scheme to a <Col N="1127" /> considerable extent.  I think it is not unfair to describe it as such.  To a certain extent, it could be said that we have overreached in the matter of housebuilding because we are building for a dwindling population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion deals with the improvement and fertility of the land, and the question of unemployment in rural areas but it does not open up a debate on houses, hospitals and roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain that this is the only way in which we can canalise money into the creation of opportunities for work in rural Ireland. We have saturated our demand for houses and we certainly have saturated our demand for roads.  Consequently, the only opportunity left for the creation of new work in rural Ireland is by the extension of the moneys made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
      <P>The particular advantage of this Act is that it is productive investment, in so far as it makes available land for the growing of crops.  It increases the fertility of the land and the output of the land.  In that way, it increases the national welfare and wealth generally.</P>
      <P>As I said in my opening statement, the Taoiseach made repeated suggestions to Deputies that they should put forward their ideas as to how opportunities for work could be created in rural Ireland.  The building of roads is the way largely depended upon at the moment by most rural local authorities. It is non-productive investment.  It has also had the effect, as far as I can see, of delaying complete mechanisation. Most local authorities or county councils take the view that if they eliminate road building as a source of employment in rural Ireland by mechanising to the maximum extent possible, they will deprive themselves of the opportunity of finding work for the unemployed in the peak unemployment periods at different times of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were to take the view that the money made available to local authorities should be used to the best possible advantage and if he had a <Col N="1128" /> choice between road building, having regard to the present stage of development of roads which is very well advanced, and the draining of rivers, the improvement of the land, the increasing of the fertility of the land, which must add to the national wealth, it seems to me that this motion is one which the Minister should readily accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act was, in the first instance, a Cork measure.  It was brought in by the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, Minister for Local Government, God rest his soul, in view of the experience he gained in the Cork County Council of problems that could not be dealt with under any other legislation.  As a matter of fact, when introducing the Bill here, he read letters which I had written to his predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, appealing to him to take steps in the same direction.</P>
      <P>Public money is being spent in a far worse manner than the manner in which it was spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I admit there were flaws in it.  Like every other Act which passes through this House, experience showed the flaws.  I suggest to the Minister that he could rectify those flaws with a very slight amending Bill.  The main flaw was that when the river was cleaned, it was allowed go back into its original condition again. That was practically the only flaw I could find in it.</P>
      <P>I went to work the moment it went through.  In my county council area alone, something like £12,000 or £13,000 was spent in two years.  The results are to be seen there up to the present day.  We have land reclamation which all Parties in this House are crying for and shouting about.  How many times have officials, under the land reclamation scheme, inspected land which needed drainage and then come along and told me that it would be a good job but that the river should be cleaned first and there was nothing to clean the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing to clean the river.  That is the difficulty we find ourselves in.  I saw a scheme <Col N="1129" /> upon which £4,000 was spent.  There are now something like 150 acres of that land drained and cleaned and giving decent crops&mdash;land that was constantly flooded previously.</P>
      <P>There is a stretch of land from Ballymacoda into Ballycotton with five rivers flowing through it.  I have been hammering in this House at Ministers for Lands, the Office of Public Works, and so on, in an effort to get them to do what should be done for the farmers in that area.  I was down there last spring.  One unfortunate man told me that he had been preparing for early potatoes.  He was a 40-acre man and he had five acres prepared for potatoes but the water was running along the drills and the place was flooded out.  He was not able to put in his crop of early potatoes because it was too late by the time the land was free of the flooding, and he lost money as a result.  That condition of affairs prevails constantly even on land with a poor law valuation of from 35/- to £2 a statute acre.</P>
      <P>I have further cases of land divided by the Land Commission.  I had to bring five or six men this year to the rate collector in order to get them a relief of rates.  Their land was in such a derelict condition&mdash;land of that valuation&mdash;that they could do nothing with it.  They had to get a relief of rates, which meant a loss of rates revenue to the local authority, and there was a loss of land annuities to the State as well.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Act was passed that did so much good for the ordinary farmer in my constituency as this Act.  It has been said that it has faults. Almost every Act has needed amendment. I urge the Minister to remedy any defects which he has found in it.  I guarantee that, even in his own constituency, he will find plenty of room for spending some of that money, not to talk of other constituencies.  I am speaking of what I know and see in the country and from my own experience. There was nothing that could not be done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that our County Surveyor said to me: &ldquo;You cannot do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;You cannot do that&rdquo; under <Col N="1130" /> the Act.  I said: &ldquo;When the Inspector comes from the Department, bring him down my way and we shall have a consultation.&rdquo;  He did.  Deputies would be amazed at the jobs we were able to do on the roads under the Act. There is a fine tarred and steam-rolled road to my house which was done under the Act.  It was examined by officials of the Department of Local Government and by the County Surveyor.</P>
    <P>With money that might have been provided under the Act in the past five or six years, we could have had far more production in East Cork. There were plans.  There is land there soggy with water.  It has been soggy with water over a long period.  It could have been drained.  If the Minister cares to consult the Department dealing with land reclamation he will see the number of reports from inspectors which say that this job or that job would be a good job but the river must be cleaned first.  That type of report is made by men paid by the State to examine schemes.  Unfortunate men with 20, 30 and 40 acres, waiting for drainage, must turn their backs on their hopes for the moment because their land cannot be attended to until the river is first cleaned.</P>
    <P>Unanimous appeals have been made to the Minister's Department by the Cork County Council in this connection. On at least six occasions, four or five different parties were unanimous on the value of this Act and in their approval of it.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce whatever amendments are required to enable the Act to be put into operation once more, to the benefit of all concerned, because of the good work that can be accomplished under it.</P>
    <P>There is very little use in cleaning a river if, in three years' time, that river needs to be attended to again. Sometimes a river silts up again very quickly.  It is a fault in the Act if nobody is made responsible for seeing that the river is kept clean but the fault could be remedied by a few lines.  If the Minister is too busy to do it, I will bring in an amendment myself.  It is urgently required.  I appeal to the Minister to do it as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with this motion.  The purposes that brought the Local Authorities (Works) Act into being in the first instance were (1) to bridge the gap between arterial drainage and the small drainage jobs occasionally done by the Special Employment Schemes Office and (2) to give employment at a period of the year when things are slack in rural areas.  I agree with every word the last speaker said in support of this motion but I do not find myself 100 per cent. in agreement with him that there are flaws in the Act.  The only flaw in it is that it is left open to the Government of the day to withhold money and thus paralyse the whole functioning of the Act.</P>
      <P>The principle of maintaining watercourses once they have been cleaned under the Act is admirable.  I know the works that were carried out in my county in 1949 and 1950.  I see them every day.  They are still in perfect condition although there has been no maintenance since.  I believe they will not require cleaning or deepening inside the next 20 or 30 years.  At the same time, I should like to see some provision for the annual maintenance of such works. However, even with that, the Local Authorities (Works) Act was of wonderful benefit from the very beginning. The first inter-Party Government introduced it.  It was significant that each time Fianna Fáil came into power, their first action was to clip down the annual grants to something less than one-third or almost a quarter and then to wipe them out altogether. They did not make any grant available at all.  I do not want to develop any heat or bitterness but I want to impress on the Minister&mdash; there should be little need to impress it on him&mdash;the urgency of the need for restoring the grants under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the first time the inter-Party Government took office, the land reclamation scheme was introduced by Deputy Dillon.  In many cases, there were perfectly good tracts of land belonging to small farmers which could <Col N="1132" /> not be dealt with under that scheme simply because the outfall was not drained or the river was choked.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was brought in to help out that scheme for drainage jobs which were not covered by the scheme and which the scheme was not properly equipped to do.  The scheme had not the funds and it is doubtful if the staff was available. Much excellent work was done apart from that and there is no harm in mentioning the employment it gave.</P>
    <P>We have the highest rate of emigration of any country in the world and the reason is the lack of employment at home.  Boys and girls who go to England, America, Canada or Australia do not go simply for a change of climate but to make their time and not to waste their lives sitting idly at home.  The Minister may think the employment given during the winter months would not make many young people stay at home but most of them would be employed on the holdings or farms of their fathers or mothers during the spring and summer months. It is the lack of employment in the three or four winter months which drives the young people off the small holdings.  If savings have to be made, they should be made in some direction other than cutting down on a very useful job of work giving much needed employment at home.</P>
    <P>I was astonished when I read some of the figures connected with the administration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The first county I turn to is my own.  In 1949-50, we gave £55,404 to the Mayo County Council. In 1950-51, we gave £75,976; in 1951-52, Fianna Fáil returned to office and the figure dropped from £75,000 to £48,800.  The next year, it was again cut in half and came down to £23,903. In 1953-54, Fianna Fáil were in office and they reduced the figure to £14,458. We came back to office the following year and it climbed steadily up to £26,000 from £14,000, and when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1957, the curtain was rung down on that useful Act.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to Roscommon, Deputy McQuillan's constituency.  In 1949-50, <Col N="1133" /> £28,105 was spent; in 1950-51 the figure was £49,349; 1951-52, the figure was down from £49,000 to £33,000; in 1952-53, that £33,000 dwindled to £15,591; and in 1953-54, it came down to £10,000.  It went up again until it reached £25,884.  I could give the figures for Galway and other counties.  Some people have alleged, and it is very hard to blame them, that the enmity of the Government to the land reclamation scheme was due to the fact that it was an innovation of the first inter-Party Government.  If such is the case, I do not see much hope for the country, regardless of the rise or fall of Governments.  That all good works which emanate from any Government are to be abandoned by other Governments, for that reason is a system and a precedent that should not be adopted and must get the hatchet in the neck.  That is a bad line of policy to follow.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this poser to the Minister.  This is a very unusual motion or, at least, this motion aims at a very unusual and good job of work.  I throw down this challenge to the Minister: If it comes to a vote at the conclusion of the time allowed for this motion, will he give a free vote to the House?  Will he take the Whips off his own Party, and will the Whips be taken off the other Parties, and Deputies allowed to vote according to their consciences?  That was asked for in respect of the referendum and other recent measures, but it is much more necessary now.  That is a fair poser to put to the Minister and one he should find difficulty in turning down.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was the means of carrying out of some of the most useful and most necessary work in this country.  The Minister comes from a rural constituency and he should not have much difficulty in realising how useful and good it was. There were perhaps faults in administration, but there is no instrument that human beings can devise that will be perfect.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act may have had its flaws but it would have been possible to remedy them.  I cannot see many <Col N="1134" /> flaws of any kind, except the bitterness the then Opposition engendered by prejudice against it.  As it stands today, it is a simple Act which gives power to carry out works.  If my recollection is correct, there is an unusual power in Section 4 that any local authority, after giving due notice, can enter on land to carry out drainage work.</P>
    <P>We know of many cases where small rivers pass through several farmers' lands and one farmer's land might be left high and dry and his problem might be a shortage of water rather than a deluge.  We often found in such cases that a selfish type of farmer might say: &ldquo;No; I will not allow you to do that work because it will not benefit me.&rdquo;  The Local Authorities (Works) Act overrode that objection. Having served due notice, there was power to enter.  If that farmer was aggrieved or if he felt there was damage to his land or property by reason of the execution of the work, the court was available to him and the Department was liable to pay him compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be doing one of the best jobs of his career as Minister for Local Government if he insisted on the Minister for Finance giving the necessary money to bring that Act back into operation.</P>

The reason, I expect, that he wished me to intervene was that I sponsored a motion similar to this at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis recently; but I want to make it clear that the resolution which came before the Ard Fheis from my constituency in North Galway, from the Fianna Fáil Dáil ceantair, at a meeting at which I was present, asked the Government to introduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act with the condition that when the work was completed, provision would be made for maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies who have spoken so far tonight&mdash;except Deputy Blowick&mdash; have agreed that one of the big flaws in the Act was that there was no provision <Col N="1135" /> for maintenance.  I have seen good work done in my constituency under this Act, but, unfortunately, because that provision was not there, the work carried out, the useful and good work carried out at the beginning, is being negatived now that the main drains have begun to become clogged up.  If that provision for maintenance were included, I would agree thoroughly with this motion.  I wanted to make that matter very clear and I would support this motion only on that condition, that some provision such as that would be included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry hit the nail on the head when he said that under this Act, as we experienced it, we could do almost anything.  As I said, I have seen good work and bad work done in County Galway.  The good work was that which Deputy McQuillan has in mind in this motion, that is, work to stimulate increased production.  I agree with Deputies who say that you may have four or five farmers waiting to carry out a scheme of land reclamation on their lands&mdash;I have seen this in my own constituency&mdash;and the land project inspector comes out with a scheme for them.  He hands it to them but says: &ldquo;You cannot go ahead with it until this main drain is cleaned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At one end of my constituency we have the Corrib arterial drainage scheme in operation.  We see good work being done under that scheme, where a proper survey has been carried out, with everything planned and all the snags foreseen and where land reclamation and work on the main drains are going ahead.  But at my own end of the constituency which borders on the River Suck&mdash;I am on one side of it and Deputy McQuillan is on the other&mdash;we see hundreds of acres flooded.  A scheme such as this, if it could be amended, or if some other scheme could be introduced, would make a good job of it, and would undoubtedly relieve the flooding on these lands.  I should not like to see any of the money spent on roads, as Deputy Corry said.  That was done in Galway in the initial stages and it was money sent down the drain.  As years went by, the work became more selective&mdash; whether the direction came from the <Col N="1136" /> top or not, I do not know&mdash;and it was diverted into more productive channels.</P>
    <P>I consider that arterial drainage is a proper scheme.  The big snag is that you will never get smaller rivers done under that scheme for years and years to come.  Therefore, we shall require some in the intervening years and if we could get this priority scheme for arterial drainage changed, it would help.  At present schemes costing over £100,000 get priority and then there are those from £25,000 up to £100,000.  This motion deals with those under £25,000 down to £1,000 and less.  If we could get the Board of Works to bring these smaller schemes up on the priority list, particularly in view of the fact that drainage plans under the land project are held up owing to the main drains not being cleaned, it would help and would benefit production.  It would also give employment, a matter mentioned in this motion.</P>
    <P>As I say, my reason for intervening was that I was asked, or challenged, if you like, to intervene, but I want to make it clear that the motion I sponsored contained that provision, that there should be maintenance.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to sympathise with the Minister because really I do not think it is the Minister's duty to take this motion.  The Minister is merely a type of conduit pipe through which money passes from Finance to a certain source.  Unfortunately, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, it is to the Department of Local Government it goes and if this conduit has now clogged up, I do not think <Col N="1137" /> the present Minister or any Minister for Local Government should be blamed for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister for Finance who makes the money available to the Minister for Local Government, to implement the Act. Deputy Corry made a very reasonable speech on this motion.  I do not wish to quote Deputy McQuillan, or Deputy Dr. Browne, because they are the sponsors of this motion, but Deputy Corry, who is a Government supporter, made a reasonable speech. We have heard Deputy McQuillan who represents a rural constituency; we heard Deputy Browne; we heard Deputy Corry who is a Government supporter; and we heard Deputy Blowick, a farmers' representative.  We also heard Deputy Kitt and all are in favour of the motion.  I cannot understand why it should not be accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has been on a very high level.  No political slogans were used and I hope they will not be used.  Certainly I shall not endeavour to do so.  I think it was Deputy Corry who explained why a colleague from Cork, then a Minister, Deputy Murphy, introduced the Bill and eventually succeeded in piloting it through this House and the Upper House.  It was to bridge that area, or that land, if you wish, between where the land project applied and where the local authority worked in. Only the other day, I came across the Minister's reply to a letter pointing out, in the case of some minor drainage scheme between Tipperary and Limerick, that it was not the function of his Department, that it was a scheme&mdash;I do not remember the name of it&mdash;which should be administered under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but unfortunately the local authority had no money available under that Act.  It was a very good scheme and I think Deputy Kitt and Deputy Corry, members of the Government Party, made a very good case for it.  Deputy Kitt's only <Col N="1138" /> objection to Deputy McQuillan's motion was that no provision was made for maintenance.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister and the House to the Act which says&mdash; I quote from Section 2 (1)</P>
    <P>This Section applies to the following local authorities ...</P>
    <P>and it goes on to describe the corporations and county councils and says:</P>
    <P>(2) Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) any land owned by them, ...</P>
    <P>I refrain from quoting subsection 2 (b) but it then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...any land owned by them ... has sustained or is likely to sustain damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or any similar occurrence, the local authority may execute such works ...</P>
    <P>In my opinion there is nothing there to prevent recurring works being done on a particular job.  If the local authority see that this land owned by them has sustained or is likely to sustain damage from flooding they may drain it.  If they think that next year or the year afterwards it is likely to sustain such damage they may drain it again.  That is my interpretation of the situation as a lawyer.</P>
    <P>I do not say it is maintenance. I know there is a subsection preventing maintenance but, from my legal knowledge, on the interpretation of the Section I believe a local authority could have recurring expenditure on the drainage of land likely to sustain damage.  Really, that is maintenance. I speak subject to the correction of the Minister and, possibly, his legal advisers but this is something that has never been considered and is worth considering because everybody from the Government, the main Opposition and the various other Parties here are in favour of the Act but they all fight shy of maintenance.  I think this should be tested.</P>
    <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, I think it was Deputy Kitt or his constituents who sponsored a motion which was carried unanimously.  I believe if the question were left to a <Col N="1139" /> free vote of the House&mdash;I do not want to be acrimonious in any way&mdash;it would still be carried.  I know the Minister is in favour of the Act because I can quote his views on it speaking in Donegal County Council.  I know he was a Deputy then and I have sympathy for him&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be personal.  I understand the Minister's position and I could possibly find myself in the same position.  The only clog is finance: there is that clog in the conduit or pipe line but it is unfortunate that the Minister for Local Government should find himself in that position.  I think the Minister for Finance should be here to explain the position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick gave figures.  When this Act was first introduced in 1949 by a predecessor of the present Minister, Deputy Murphy from Cork, go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam, it was welcomed by all Parties.  There was much suspicion on the part of the then Opposition, the present Government. All they could do was cast suspicion; they did not oppose the measure.  I am not going to quote, but in reply to a question put by Deputy Lindsay today we got certain figures circulated showing the expenditure under the Act through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall just quote for my own county; I have not had an opportunity of totting the figures.  In the first year, 1949-50, £59,384 was expended in my county.  That is a lot of money to have spent during the winter months when unemployment was rampant. That was the first year.  In the second year we got £78,727, in 1950-51.  There was a change of Government in the following year and the Party who did not vote against the Local Authorities (Works) Act but who cast suspicion on it saw the benefits of it, I suspect, but thought they should play it down. They did that by decreasing the Vote with the result that in 1951-52 we got only £50,587 in my county.  In 1952-53, when Fianna Fáil were in office, we had only £24,541 spent, less <Col N="1140" /> than 30 per cent. of the amount in the previous year.  In their third year in office, we dropped to £12,941, approximately one-fifth of the amount spent by the first inter-Party Government in the first year and one-sixth of the amount spent by them in the second year.  In 1954-55 we began to step up again with the second inter-Party Government in power and we spent £13,654.  There was a further step up in 1955-56 to £29,872.  Then, when the present Government were back in office in 1956-57 the amount was £19,888.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt and Deputy Corry, who speak for the Government Party, agree with the Act.  The only fault they find with it is possibly one of interpretation which could be very easily clarified. Personally I think maintenance could be brought in under Section 2 (2) (b).</P>

If there is the fault that Deputy MacCarthy points out, by a one page Bill we can amend it.  I am certain that if we are worried about maintenance there will be agreement on all sides of the House to include maintenance in the provisions of the Act.  I think that is really what is worrying Deputy MacCarthy and, if it is, would the Deputy say so? Perhaps Deputy Kitt might answer the <Col N="1141" /> question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House beyond saying that naturally the Labour Deputies support the motion.  Deputy MacCarthy may, or may not, be worried about the question of legal interpretation in regard to maintenance, but our biggest worry may be divided into two heads&mdash;the loss of employment affecting road workers in County Cork, and the valuable work that still remains to be done there.  It is well known that since 1949, in the various years when money was provided in Cork under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, very valuable work was done in different parts of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that members of the present Government, when showing opposition to the Act, said that work was not carried out in a satisfactory manner in other counties.  That may, or may not, be the case.  I do not know, but if these Ministers wish to complain about the unsatisfactory supervision of work by local engineers in these counties, that surely must be a matter between the Ministers and the officials.  Where Cork is concerned, no hand of condemnation was ever <Col N="1143" /> lifted by any member of Fianna Fáil in relation to the work carried out by the workers and supervised by the engineers.  The tragedy is that since these schemes have been slowed up it has automatically meant that grave unemployment exists during winter periods.</P>
    <P>Up to 1949 there were three months each year, January, February and March, when the men working for Cork County Council unfortunately had many periods of unemployment but, with the introduction of this Act, that ceased to be the case.  Men were satisfied, even though it was not the best thing in the world to have to work in some rivers in winter time, to do the work, and they made it quite clear they much preferred to work on schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act than go to the unemployment exchanges to draw a few shillings dole.  Are we to go back on that now when we know that schemes carried out under the Act were successful in the past?</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, I know that there are other speakers anxious to take part in this debate and I wish to co-operate with them.  However, one obvious thing I must say, is that we see this as the one way in which the Government can co-operate and help local authorities to provide work. Deputy Corry must realise his position in that respect.  In 1949 he went out of his way to help to co-operate with the then Government in having various schemes introduced, schemes which gave so much employment. Surely time cannot change so much the opinions of members on the other side of the House?  If, in the past, they were so anxious to create employment in Cork during the winter period, they must be equally anxious now to see a continuation of work under the Act.  If there is any sincerity in what the Deputies from Cork have said at meetings of Cork County Council, they will find themselves in the lobbies with the proposers of this motion when it comes to a division, and will vote to give added employment in the slack period of the year to workers in Cork, and <Col N="1144" /> thus help to complete the important works still waiting to be completed there, due to the fact that for some years back there has been a slowing down because of the decrease in the amount of finance made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the general tone of the debate on the motion as put forward to-night, let me say straight away that the Government are fully alive to the necessity for increased agricultural production, and realise very fully the important part that may be played in such an increase by proper drainage planning, arterial drainage generally, and schemes for the smaller river catchments throughout the country.  If anyone should doubt the Government's concern and their being fully alive to the situation, and giving a full and proper place to the importance of drainage in our national economy, I surely need only point to the fact of the recent five year drainage programme that has been outlined and which is now, in fact, in operation under the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
      <P>That five-year programme, as those concerned well know, provides for an increasing expenditure on this very important national work, an expenditure which will reach £700,000 by 1961-62 and which will show at that stage an increase of 60 per cent. as compared with the expenditure before the five-year programme now under way was initiated by the present Government. In the current year's Vote there is no less than £1,000,000 to be expended on this expanded programme. Furthermore, under the land project a sum of upwards of £2,000,000 has been earmarked in this year also for the drainage and development of agricultural land.  I call Deputies' minds to the fact that we are not in any way overlooking the importance of drainage in our national economy.  Far from forgetting drainage, we have in fact taken positive steps to do something more, and to do that something more more speedily than work was being done when we took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> There is, of course, the argument advanced by those who support this motion that the greater the expenditure on drainage the greater will be the increase in productivity.  But there is a limit to the extent to which expenditure on drainage will produce a proportionate return.  It is not enough for local authorities to pass resolutions or to make protests, as the case may be, advocating the reintroduction of 100 per cent.  Local Authorities (Works) Act grants.  I appreciate the general anxiety of county councils to have these grants restored to them, grants which they enjoyed for some few years in the not too distant past.  I appreciate their concern from the point of view of the employment they could give were they getting these grants in their 100 per cent. form.  County councillors are scarcely the best judges in relation to these schemes.  The expenditure of large sums&mdash;and the sums spent under the L.A.W.A. were large&mdash;is a major question and a matter of national economics rather than something to be decided in a local council.  Such expenditure is a major concern to any Government and must form part of major policy decisions.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we have then to consider the merits and the results obtained from this large expenditure in the past as compared with the competing demands of what can be considered more directly productive schemes and directly productive purposes. While I appreciate the anxiety of local authorities in these matters, I think it only fair they should realise that this is a major question of national economics and one to be considered, because of the large sums involved, by the Government as a whole.</P>
    <P>Between 1949-59 no less than £7,500,000 approximately was given by way of 100 per cent. grants under the L.A.W.A. by successive Governments. Of this £7,500,000 roughly half was spent on road protection.  Indeed, as Deputy Corry told us tonight, it was spent not only on road protection <Col N="1146" /> but also on tar spraying.  Deputy Corry was making an excellent case for the motion until he blew the top off it by his admission that practically anything could be done under the L.A.W.A.  If it needed condemnation, then that is the roundest condemnation from the point of view of the expenditure of public money.  Deputy Corry told us about the road that was tar sprayed to his own door.  He maintained that was done by having a consultation with some inspector, or other, and the local engineer, who queried the wisdom and the authority of doing the work under the L.A.W.A.</P>
    <P>Regardless of all that, the fact remains that about half was spent on road protection.  The other half was spent on drainage.  Only a small fraction was spent on effective and lasting works.  No doubt there were some good schemes.  I have had an examination carried out in the Department of Local Government, and so I talk now with knowledge, and not through the medium of rumour, suggestion, or any ill-will towards the Act itself or towards those who sponsor it.  The proportion of economic and durable works done under the drainage side of the L.A.W.A. was so small a fraction of the whole as not to justify the expenditure of £7,500,000.  The records are there for everyone to see.  It is quite true that the failures were not the fault of local authorities but were rather due to the difficulties and complexities of drainage problems.  Those difficulties and complexities grow larger once one leaves the realm of field drainage.  Indeed, local authority engineers and officials would be the first to submit that they do not pretend to be experts, and in this sphere experts and skilled men are required if a proper and permanent job is to be done after a proper and sufficient survey.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the estimated cost of increasing the minimum wages of farm workers in the Dublin area to £7 9s., in Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow to £7 4s. (in each case), and in each of the remaining counties to £7 2s., on the basis of the number of agricultural employees in respect of whom employment allowances were granted under the Agricultural Grant for the year ended 31st March, 1959, and the total cost.</P>

      <P>On the assumption that the minimum weekly wage rates of all agricultural employees, whether <Col N="1005" /> adult (20 years and over) or juvenile, were to be increased by the amount necessary to bring the present minimum weekly rates for male workers 20 years and over up to the rates specified in the question for the various counties, it is estimated that an additional annual cost of £3,961,000 would be involved.  This estimate is based on the number of agricultural employees in respect of whom employment allowances were granted under the Agricultural Grant for the year ended 31st March, 1959.  The total cost of paying these increased rates is estimated at £13,996,000 per year.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give an estimate in respect of a recent year of the value of each of the principal items of agricultural produce lost to farmers in the home market due to emigration and the total value in the form of a reply of 17th June, 1958.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated in the reply to which the Deputy refers, it is not possible to compile figures for net emigration except for intercensal periods.  Figures for the annual consumption of the principal foodstuffs of the average annual number of persons who emigrated in the last such period for which data are available (1951-56) were given in the reply in question.  It is not possible to estimate the value of such consumption in the home market lost to farmers, since the estimate of the consumption given is not necessarily equivalent to the decline in the home market due to emigration, and further since the amount of such consumption which relates to farm produce consumed without process of sale is not known.</P>
