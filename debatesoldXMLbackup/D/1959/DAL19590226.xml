However, with regard to Vote 52 and No. 4&mdash;the motion in regard to the State Guarantees Act&mdash;we feel that requires further examination from our point of view.  Would the Tánaiste agree not to take that until Tuesday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking about this matter last night, I mentioned there is a slump in shipping at present and that approximately 1,000,000 tons are tied up in Great Britain for want of orders.  That means that Irish Shipping, with the expanded capital now to be made available to them, must consider whether they should engage in the building of new boats or the repair and the maintenance of the existing fleet.  It was mentioned that we in this country could do with an increased tonnage of about 60,000 or 70,000, in addition to the 140,000 tons being operated at present by Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping has been operating now for over 20 years and has been very successful.  A number of the boats originally used by them served us well during the emergency days, but they have become somewhat out of date. It is obvious that in the years to come it will be necessary to replace with <Col N="207" /> new ships those boats beyond repair. Our fleet at present consists of between 17 and 20 ships.  When we consider the world slump in shipping at present, it is obvious that the repair side of the operations of Irish Shipping will have to move faster than the building side in order to maintain the efficiency of our existing fleet and avoid the construction of new boats, which would be necessary if the existing boats were not properly maintained.</P>
    <P>With the Common Market coming into operation, it is obvious that Irish Shipping will be faced with a new field of competition.  No doubt, the Common Market countries will share their own shipping amongst themselves and it will therefore be necessary for us to give a monopoly of our own shipping to our own nationals and to our own trade as far as possible.  It is only natural to expect that Irish exporters will give preference as far as possible to Irish ships and Irish importers should be encouraged to import in Irish ships.  There will be a big opportunity there for Irish Shipping to bring in the goods this country normally imports, providing preference is given to Irish Shipping by our importers.  We import annually a vast volume of goods, including heavy cargo such as grain, fertilisers and oil, to mention but a few items involving heavy tonnage.</P>
    <P>In considering the building of new ships, it will be necessary for us to decide the economic size and practical size in relation to the capacity of our ports.  At the moment, facilities exist at Dublin only to deal with ships over a certain tonnage.  There is a possibility that Cork at a later stage will be in a position to accept ships with a larger tonnage than those at present plying to the Port of Cork.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to draw attention is the fact that Irish Shipping might be in a position to help in both the construction and repair of fishing boats.  There is a certain demand for fishing boats of a larger size than those at present being used because of new methods of fishing.  In addition to construction, it is possible that the repair and maintenance <Col N="208" /> of boats could also be undertaken by Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>When the oil refinery is finally established in Cork, we should consider the advisability of giving the importation of oil to Irish Shipping to help them on with the work they have in hands in relation to Irish shipping. While Irish Shipping might be able to engage in coasting to a limited extent, it would be wiser, I think, for them to concentrate at the present time on meeting requirements here as against going out and seeking trade outside the country.  In the coastal trade, competition is very keen.  There are 1,000,000 tons of shipping tied up in Great Britain, all available for trade and anxious to get work, not to mention the tonnage available in other countries which are quite ready to enter into competition and get trade anywhere they possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who live in the south-western part of the country are probably not quite so competent to speak on a subject of this nature as are Deputies who are fortunate enough to reside in the eastern sector of the State, since the general impact of shipping affects the eastern sector more than it does the southern or south-western sector of the country. However, this is a matter in which we should all have a very active interest. It is something which makes a large contribution towards the development of the economic life of the country as compared perhaps with other developments undertaken by the Government in recent years.</P>
      <P>The success which has attended the efforts of Irish Shipping has been phenomenal.  The company started with a very modest capital of about £200,000 away back in 1941.  The Government's action in then initiating Irish Shipping is to be very highly commended.  The development started at a critical phase in our history and was, therefore, all the more valuable in the economic life of the nation, particularly during the war years which followed its inauguration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the general experience gained over the years, it is obvious now that the time has arrived for <Col N="209" /> a general overhaul of the financial structure of the organisation.  I have no doubt that the figure of £12,000,000 in the Bill was arrived at after careful and close examination of all the relevant factors.  I think it would be a bad thing on the whole if shipping requirements had to be left exclusively in the hands of Irish Shipping and I rather feel the Government are not predisposed in that particular direction.  I believe that private interests, anxious to take the initiative in relation to the provision of shipping, would have the backing of the Government and of Irish Shipping as well.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country, merchants could come together in a joint undertaking to acquire and operate ships for the purposes of their own business.  That problem should be dealt with now at Government level.  I submit it should be part of the policy of Irish Shipping to encourage small groups of business people, particularly those with businesses in port towns, to provide their own shipping fleet requirements. I know the capital outlay for such a project is considerable. There again, I would go so far as to suggest to the Minister that he might consider, in so far as it lies in his power, to have the policy of Irish Shipping directed on the lines that an undertaking of that kind might be encouraged by way of loans or such facilities.</P>
    <P>During the debate here, a suggestion was made by a number of Deputies that the modern type of boats which Irish Shipping are likely to acquire are regarded as being somewhat on the big side for utilisation in the various ports of this country and an appeal was made that the smaller type of boat should be encouraged.  I subscribe wholeheartedly to that suggestion.  The difficulty is, I expect, that it might not be as economical to operate the smaller boats as it would be to operate the larger modern type which have been planned by all the shipping companies. I feel, however, that since considerable sums of money have been spent in recent years on the development of many of our small ports, cognisance should be taken of this fact <Col N="210" /> and a number of the boats in the fleet that will now be acquired and operated should be of the type that can be docked in our smaller ports.</P>
    <P>There are many advantages, of course, in having at least part of the fleet consisting of that type of boat. It would create a very desirable situation in so far as the distribution of imports would be decentralised in the various ports and, generally speaking, it would help to co-ordinate the general policy on inland transport for the people who are taking care of our inland transport problems.  We know, of course, that in modern times the emphasis seems to be on the larger type of ship and it is quite obvious that the reason for this is that the larger the cargo, the lower the freight rate will be.  That is all right in its own way, but taking the long-term view in this matter, there is a lot to be said for having part of a fleet composed of boats of medium tonnage. In that connection, I hope the Minister will convey the views of Deputies who have spoken on this point to the company and perhaps when he is concluding the debate, he will give us the benefit of his own views on the matter.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, a Deputy made the point that Irish Shipping should be encouraged to undertake passenger service work.  We should all be very pleased if that were possible and feasible in existing circumstances.  Many complaints have been registered over the past few years as to the congestion and the general disappointment suffered by passengers, particularly cross-Channel passengers, at Dún Laoghaire and sometimes the ports of Cork and Rosslare.  The position is that the congestion and inconvenience arise only at peak periods during the tourist and holiday seasons. There is no record of any such disappointment arising at other periods of the year.  When one makes the suggestion to Irish Shipping that they might provide a service which would obviate these difficulties, one finds oneself faced with a situation where we are asking Irish Shipping to come to the rescue in this matter for a month <Col N="211" /> or six weeks and there is no work to keep their boats employed for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a way out of that. If Irish Shipping found it feasible to go into this passenger service they might be able to enter into a leasing arrangement for their boats at other periods which would keep them occupied.  I am glad this occasion has arisen and I am availing of it to try to fix the attention of Irish Shipping on this problem. I am sure it has been drawn to their notice already, but I earnestly request the Minister to examine the point and see if anything can be done in the course of the reorganisation now about to take place.  Such development as I have suggested would be very worth while and would, I am sure, contribute to a big increase in our tourist revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of Irish Shipping deserve the goodwill and the encouragement of all sides of the House and this Bill deserves strong support.  It is wise to look at the world abroad at times, but it is our own position and our own needs that should be the guiding factor in our decisions. In war conditions and in very difficult times, the board of Irish Shipping built up an admirable fleet of ocean-going freighters.  There is great credit due to them and these vessels are a credit to our country when they go into the ports of the world.  That is one type of service which the smaller boats cannot provide, because undoubtedly, apart from the risks of the sea, they would be uneconomical to work and consequently the board have to provide a quite substantial fleet of ocean-going ships.</P>
      <P>The coastal service, to which reference has been made, is a different problem entirely.  Some of our industries like the Irish oil refinery now provide scope for the company in that regard because tankers no longer are required to meet the needs of present circumstances in long ocean trips.  I understand it is now proposed to use them for redistribution of the refined oil in some of our Irish ports and to have a coastal service for its distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> A cross-Channel service for passengers is another problem to which I am sure Irish Shipping have given attention.  It would, of course, be a great thing for many of the Irish boats, including the smaller boats, and we can see a very desirable development in that direction in recent months.  Some of the ports around our coast which were devoid of shipping for many years are again getting some work in that way.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping are also to be congratulated on the scholarship scheme they have initiated in vocational schools to provide skilled personnel on their ships.  It shows that every aspect which will serve the country's interests and needs is being considered by them, and that they are, indeed, a very progressive body.  The increase in shipping which will be brought about by the establishment of the oil refinery will be of general service.  I think it is undesirable that we here should be talking about monopolies because we know that that company is an amalgamation of various world-wide oil companies and, if we get a fair share of their business and service, we should be satisfied.  Of course, we shall be obliged to enter into competition with other interests in carrying out that work.</P>
    <P>The new development in the dockyards at Rushbrooke is proceeding very desirably.  We now will have skilled personnel there which will develop what is already in existence. There is a fine dry dock there and at present a ship of 520 feet is getting certain replacements and certain other work done to it.  I think that dock can take ships of 540 feet, that is, ships 180 yards long, ships which are of very considerable proportions.  The happy part of it is that there will be very little, if any, competition with the Dublin dockyards because at Haulbowline they will be handling the bigger types of ships.  The whole national economy is being improved and has got a great impetus from these developments, and I think that what the Minister is doing now, in providing an opportunity for increased capital and higher borrowing powers, <Col N="213" /> will have the support, not only of the House here, but of the whole country because, as a maritime nation, the development of our shipping resources is of primary importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The welcome extended to this Bill, and the general support expressed by Deputies for the policy of extending our merchant shipping services, are very encouraging. In my view, we have, in the development of our merchant shipping organisation, not done much more as yet than make a good and encouraging beginning.  I believe that a great deal more is possible, certainly as a long term objective, and it is the Government's aim to promote a much more substantial achievement than we have yet recorded.</P>
      <P>The development of Irish merchant shipping services is not, however, a matter for Irish Shipping alone.  Private enterprise has its part to play in that field and, indeed, we would wish to see it playing a much bigger part than at present.  In order to secure greater activity in the merchant shipping field by private interests and to encourage the existing firms to extend the scale of their operations, important tax concessions were made in last year's Finance Act.  The results of these tax concessions have been not discouraging and, indeed, in recent times these private companies have acquired, or ordered, some five additional vessels. These vessels are, of course, of the smaller size intended for trading with the North Sea continental ports and on similar routes.  Irish Shipping do not compete with them on these trades and indeed it is, I think, necessary to give them an assurance that Irish Shipping will not compete with them at any time.  The main objective of Irish Shipping is to develop deep sea services, requiring generally the operation of much larger vessels than the private companies control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me what is the policy of Irish Shipping in regard to the extension of its fleet during the present period of depression in the shipping business.  As I stated, the aim of building up a minimum fleet of 200,000 tons dead weight in dry cargo vessels is related to our experience <Col N="214" /> during the war, and represents what we regard as the minimum size of fleet required to maintain essential supplies to this country in circumstances of an international emergency during which ships of other nationalities might not be available to us.  The decision to build up a fleet of that minimum size, was taken at a time when it was uncertain that Irish deep sea shipping services could be operated profitably and, by and large, that aim is to be regarded as independent and separate from the commercial results of the company's operations.  By that, I mean that the decision to secure and operate a fleet of that size is based upon factors which are not directly related to the prospects of successful commercial operation.</P>
    <P>The company will, no doubt, take into account, in preparing their plans, trends in shipbuilding costs and it is important that they should do so.  It is necessary also to take note of the fact that the company have no financial reserves, that by Government decision, the whole of the surplus revenues which they have earned in recent years were utilised in acquiring new tonnage, so that they are not in a financial position to meet the consequences of repeated deficits on their operations.  I intend, after the enactment of this Bill, to consult with the board of the company as to their future programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin emphasised the necessity to have modern, economic ships.  I think it is true to say that new ships could operate, certainly without loss and possibly with some margin of profit, even at the present level of freight rates.  The aim of the company is to replace their ships after ten or 12 years so that they always will have a fleet comprised of modern, economic vessels.</P>
    <P>I notice a report in this morning's newspapers that the President of the Irish Exporters' Association has been urging consideration of the possibility of buying ships, now that a large proportion of the world's merchant tonnage is laid up.  I think that would be a wrong policy.  There would be no future for Irish Shipping, in the circumstances which we foresee, operating uneconomic vessels even <Col N="215" /> though they could be acquired at a low, initial price.  The policy of maintaining a modern efficient fleet is, I think, the right one to follow.</P>
    <P>It is important that the House should understand that Irish Shipping are engaged, in the main, in the tramping business, that is to say, their vessels are employed wherever in the world there is business for them and, indeed, much more than 80 per cent. of their total revenue is derived from carrying traffic from one foreign country to another, traffic which has no relation to this country at all.</P>
    <P>Many of their vessels, when they leave this country, do not return here for some years, being completely occupied in foreign trade during these periods.  There is, perhaps, a need&mdash; and again what I have to say in this respect arises out of remarks attributed to the President to the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association&mdash;for what are called liner services, that is, cargo vessels which operate on regular routes on regular occasions, but the operation of services of that kind requires association, it seems to me, with an organisation which can secure for them traffic at intermediate ports on the selected routes.  I do not think it can be said that the volume of business which is likely to be generated here for ships on such a service could, by itself, be sufficient to maintain the service, even if we were able, by exhortation and otherwise, to secure the bulk or all of the available business from Irish firms for it.  The possibility of developing services of that kind will, of course, be always kept in mind and we should like to see them being organised, but the practicability of the undertaking is a matter for expert examination by people who are intimate with all aspects of the business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked about the intentions of Irish Shipping with regard to building new vessels in Ireland.  I take it he has in mind, in that respect, the larger type of vessel which constitutes the bulk of Irish Shipping's fleet. I think it is known that the plans for the development of the Verholme United Dockyards at Cork involve at a later stage the undertaking of building work there.  It is contemplated that <Col N="216" /> two slipways will be built upon which vessels of quite large size, up to 45,000 tons dead weight, can be constructed. It is likely to be some years before building operations upon vessels of that size will be undertaken.  Meanwhile, any vessels which Irish Shipping decide to buy will be purchased by them to the best advantage.  In that connection, I think I should say than on each occasion in the past on which Irish Shipping required vessels of the larger size, they invited Messrs. Harland and Wolff, Belfast, to tender, but that firm were not in a position to do so.  Indeed, a Government direction which I conveyed to the company in 1951 when the company's third building programme was being initiated, required them to explore the possibility of placing orders for their vessels with Messrs. Harland and Wolff, if that firm was in a position to tender.  Some repair work for Irish Shipping has been done in Belfast.  By and large, it must be the policy of the company to acquire the ships they need wherever they can get them at lowest cost.</P>
    <P>In connection with the new building programme of Irish Shipping, it will be appreciated that it has to be considered in two parts.  There is the programme that would represent an extension of the fleet and the immedate objective is to extend the 140,000 tons up to 200,000 tons dead weight and there is also the programme which covers replacement of existing vessels as it is decided to effect replacement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and other Deputies referred to the size of the ships to be acquired by Irish Shipping.  That is a matter of some difficulty.  It is obvious that to the extent that the company is acquiring a fleet which has the specific purpose of being available to meet the essential needs of the country in time of emergency the ships must be of a character that can be utilised at more than one Irish port.  There is room for doubts, however, as to the extent to which the company should have any economic penalty imposed upon them by that overall strategic consideration, if I may so describe it.  I may point out that of the company's existing fleet of 17 dry cargo vessels six are under <Col N="217" /> 4,000 tons.  These are quite small vessels which can operate into many Irish ports.  Only six of them, leaving out the deep sea tanker, are over 9,000 tons.  At the most recent annual meeting of the company, the chairman in his speech in relation to a new ship which they are about to order, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have not yet decided on the exact size and type but since I referred to this matter last it has become more evident that the 14,000 ton size has attractions for charterers in many trades.  It is obvious that during a period of very low freight rates such as that through which we are passing ships of this and of even larger size can operate much more economically and to keep abreast of this type of competition we shall (although very few ports in this country can accommodate ships of this size) be bound to add units of this type to our fleet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The aim of the company must be to maintain a fleet which is flexible and with so many categories of ships within it that it can operate with commercial success, taking any trade that may become available to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies referred to the possibility of Irish Shipping interesting itself in the cross-Channel trade.  That question is one which has been considered on many occasions, but the consideration given to it brought to light many substantial practical difficulties.  Some years ago, Irish Shipping were authorised to construct two ships suitable for the cross-Channel coal trade.  They built those ships; indeed, the ships were engaged in the cross-Channel coal trade under charter for some time and when the charter expired Irish Shipping did their best to get someone else to take over the charter or utilise the ships on that service, but without success.  Ultimately, the boats had to be adapted for foreign trade on which they are now engaged.  The whole question of Irish participation in cross-Channel services is, as I have said, a very difficult and complicated one.  The possibility of securing some satisfactory solution to the problem is, however, under active <Col N="218" /> consideration at present and I hope to be able to inform the House in due course of the outcome.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I feel I should say something about the comments made here by some Deputies regarding the cross-Channel passenger trade.  In so far as inconvenience or difficulty arises in the handling of the cross-Channel passenger trade, it is associated with two very brief periods in the year when traffic reaches its peaks, one in mid-summer and the other, perhaps, around Christmas time. Clearly, the only way of meeting the requirements of peak traffic of that kind is to have other vessels available which can be added to the service and it would be a particularly difficult operation for an Irish company, with no other interest in the passenger trade, to have vessels which would be available for peak needs and which would not be required at all or could not be utilised at other times of the year.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements, whatever may be said about them, do offer the possibility of additional vessels being made available to meet peak requirements and, by and large, I think the difficulties which have been encountered in that respect in recent years have been more or less overcome, but there are problems there which no organisation can cure completely, unless one is prepared to contemplate a substantial fleet of high-class passenger vessels being utilised for three or four weeks in the year and lying in dock for the rest of the year. While the cross-Channel passenger trade could be a very remunerative operation, if the passengers could be spread evenly out over the whole year, that is never likely to be the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other point made in the course of the debate to which I need refer now, but I should like to thank Deputy Kyne for his tribute to the merchant shipping section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have heard similar tributes from other sources and personally I think they are well deserved.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the <Col N="220" /> Bill be now read a Second Time. The Air Navigation and Transport Act of 1936 gives the force of law to a convention known as the Warsaw Convention which was described as &ldquo;the Convention for the unification of certain rules relating to International Carriage by Air&rdquo; and the convention was set out in the First Schedule to that Act.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give the force of law to a protocol which amends the convention and which was adopted at the Hague in September, 1955.  The Warsaw Convention provides a simple, standardised code of legislation governing international carriage by air.  It lays down maximum limits of the liability of carriers in relation to passengers, baggage and cargo carried on their aircraft.  It also lays down the information to be included in such documents of carriage as the passenger ticket, the baggage ticket and the air waybill. Without such an internationally accepted code of legislation governing carriage it would be very difficult to determine the rights of persons killed or suffering bodily injury or loss of or damage to goods or baggage.  The convention has fulfilled the need for such a standardised code and international aviation has benefited considerably from it since it came into force internationally in 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding its advantages for all concerned in the business of international air carriage, experience has shown that the convention is in need of revision.  The limit of the carriers' liability for the carriage of passengers, as laid down in the convention, is nowadays inadequate.  The convention fixes a maximum limit of 125,000 gold francs for this purpose.  Expressed in Irish currency, this amounts to about £3,000.  In practice, in various States claimants in respect of air carriage which is not governed by the convention, have been awarded considerably higher amounts.  Another aspect of the convention which has given rise to difficulty is its requirements regarding the completion of the various documents of carriage; air carriers have found it difficult to comply fully with those requirements.  Further, certain expressions in the convention are ambiguous <Col N="221" /> and it is desirable that their meaning should be clarified.  The convention was drawn up in the French language which text is the only authentic one and there are no authentic texts in other languages.</P>
    <P>The International Civil Aviation Organisation had the question of amendment of the convention under consideration for a number of years. Following a detailed examination of the matters involved and having obtained the views of its member States, that organisation convened an international conference at the Hague in September, 1955.  Forty-four countries, including Ireland, and eight international organisations, were represented at the conference.  The conference adopted a protocol amending the Warsaw Convention and that protocol was signed at the conclusion of the conference on behalf of 26 States including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Hague Protocol is set out in the Schedule to the present Bill.  Its principal effects on the convention are: it raises the maximum limit of liability of the carrier in the case of injury or death of a passenger from 125,000 gold francs (that is about £3,000) to 250,000 gold francs (or about £6,000); it simplifies the requirements regarding the completion of the various documents of carriage; it clarifies the meaning of certain expressions used in the convention; and it brings the provisions of the convention generally up-to-date.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from Chapter III of the protocol that it is subject to ratification by the signatories.  To date, nine States have ratified it and it is understood that a number of other States are in the process of doing so.  It will not come into force until ratified by 30 States.  Accordingly, provision is made at sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill for the making of an Order by the Government bringing into operation the provisions of the protocol as set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The intention is that that Order will be made when the protocol itself is in force, i.e. when 30 States have ratified it.  When that stage has been reached, the convention as amended by the protocol <Col N="222" /> will operate in relation to international carriage between the States which have ratified the protocol.  Until then the convention as set out in the First Schedule to the 1936 Act and as amended by Part II of this Bill will continue to have effect and even after the protocol has come into force the convention itself will continue to operate in relation to those States which although they have ratified the convention have not ratified the protocol.</P>
    <P>The only reservation which a State is permitted to make to the protocol relates to carriage by its military authorities.  Under Article XXVI of the protocol a State may formally declare that the convention, as amended by the protocol, shall not apply to carriage by or on behalf of its military authorities.  With this exception the protocol has either to be ratified in full or not at all.</P>
    <P>The protocol when it comes into force will undoubtedly be of benefit in relation to international air carriage. It will represent an improvement on the original convention and it is in the public interest that legal effect should be given to it as is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that the limit of liability is being raised from £3,000 to £6,000.  A sum of £6,000 appears to be a very low figure, if a death is involved. I should like the Minister to explain whether he is prevented by existing regulations from adopting a higher figure than £6,000.  We have noticed the amounts awarded for deaths of persons in traffic accidents.  There is no doubt that if a life is lost in a traffic accident, there will be dependents as there have been in the case of accidents we have seen.  When this protocol is being ratified, according to the arrangements at the Hague Convention, we should try to have the limit increased or leave the cover unlimited, as far as the payment of compensation in such circumstances is concerned.</P>

      <P>I should explain that the adoption of this protocol does not deprive anybody of his rights under common law.  If it is possible for a <Col N="223" /> claimant against an air transport company to proceed on the basis of proven negligence, there is no limit to the damages that can be sought.  As far as the general position is concerned, we have to keep in line with the other countries of the world.  I think it is true to say we would have supported a proposal for a higher limit in respect of damages than is now agreed.  It was indeed difficult to get agreement even to raise the old limit, and some of the countries wanted a lower limit, but ultimately agreement was reached on this figure, and I think we have to go along with this agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. <Col N="224" /> Deputies are aware that the Impositions of Duties Act, 1957, provides that Orders made under the authority of that Act imposing or amending duties must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they were made.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm 39 Orders made under that Act during 1958.  An explanatory memorandum of the various Orders has already been circulated to Deputies.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go in detail through all the 39 Orders.  The duties imposed by six of them afford protection to new industries which went into production last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>What six?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These Orders were in relation to industries concerned with printed fabrics, electric motors, self-adhesive plastic tape, pile floor rugs, sections for beehives, and flypapers and fly-catchers.  Nine of the Orders were made to protect the manufacture of additional lines undertaken by existing concerns in the course of the year.  To forestall Deputy Crotty, I shall read out the commodities they are concerned with: electrical accessories, plastic tubes and pipes, dyed jute yarns and dyed or bleached jute piece goods. The latter were the subject of two Orders.  The other commodities were: abrasives having a base of vulcanised fibre, waxed paper, builders' hardware, bandages and bandaging material, and oil space heaters.</P>
      <P>A further 13 Orders increased the rates of duty to protect certain of our industries against low priced goods from Far Eastern countries, and against dumping from certain other countries.  Seven others amended earlier duties which it was found were being evaded.  Another Order permits the importation of unprinted paper without payment of duty when such paper is intended for use in the manufacture of corrugated paperboard, a product in which our paper mills do a considerable export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining three Orders refer to certain agricultural products.  The first of these amended the duty on raw tomatoes and the purpose of the <Col N="225" /> amendment was to give growers a measure of protection which would encourage them to cater for the early market by installing heating apparatus. The duty on dried peas was amended to provide an incentive to the pea processing firms to extend the acreage of peas grown here.</P>
    <P>The duty on wheat is part of the arrangements made by the Government to deal with the situation arising out of the failure of the 1958 wheat crop.  It was decided that portion of the savings resulting from the necessity for increased imports of wheat should be applied towards giving relief to growers and reducing the loss to An Bord Gráin on the disposal for animal food of wheat purchased from growers and unsuitable for manufacture into flour.</P>
    <P>As I said, the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies indicates the general character of each Order, but I shall, of course, be willing to give any further information or answer any questions which Deputies may wish to ask about the Orders relating to industrial products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I want to make is that, while I know it is provided for under the 1957 Act, it does seem unsatisfactory to have such a lengthy list of varied items all introduced together.  It is pretty well impossible to have anything like a debate on so many different items affecting so many industries.  For that reason, I should like the Minister to consider whether it might not be possible to take a Bill of this sort, in which a shorter list might be presented, at more regular intervals.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in view of the high cost of bread and flour, why was it considered necessary in present circumstances to put a duty of £2 per ton on wheat imported after 15th November last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual to review these duties at certain intervals.  I cannot understand why the duty on silk and artificial silk should be increased by 200 per cent. full and 133?rd per cent. preference on goods costing not more than 1/3 per yard.  It is extraordinary that any industry here should require a protective duty of 200 per <Col N="226" /> cent. at the present time.  I should like the Minister to tell us how many yards were imported in 1957-58 and the cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to dried peas, the Minister is quite right in protecting the home industry, but has the Minister gone asleep?  Does the Minister not know that the pea crop failed last year and not one hundredweight of peas reached maturity in this country last year?  Instead of this being a protective duty, it is now something in the nature of a tax.  The Minister is asking the people to pay 6d. per lb. full and 4d. per lb. preferential on dried peas.  Because of the high cost of vegetables at the moment, this penal tax should be removed immediately.  I come from a pea-growing area.  Many people contracted to grow peas last year and hoped to do well out of them. Through no fault of their own and through no fault of the Minister&mdash;it was an act of God that we had the weather we had&mdash;they could not even try to save the crop.  The entire crop was lost.  Peas are a very popular vegetable, especially with the poorer classes, and I think the Minister should remove this tax immediately.</P>
      <P>Imagine a maximum duty of 5/7½d. and a minimum of 3/9 on little berets imported into the country.  It is only right that home manufacture should be protected, but does the home industry really need protection of this nature in 1959?</P>
      <P>The duty on waxed paper is 30 per cent. full and 20 per cent. preferential, printed.  If unprinted, the duty is 25 per cent. full and 15 per cent. preferential. I know there is no necessity for that duty.  The firms manufacturing this paper here were quite competitive. They were not under-cut by outside firms.  The difficulty was they were not sufficiently enterprising and they were not prepared to give any facilities to those purchasing these papers.  Those who wrap goods are fully appreciative of the fact that it is up to them to support Irish industry, but, if Irish industry will not give them the facilities, then I do not see why it should be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of an instance where travellers took orders and when they <Col N="227" /> went back to the firm they were told: &ldquo;You do not take orders on those terms.  You take them on our terms.&rdquo; These people are obsessed with the idea of demanding their own terms; they are not in favour of enterprise or competition.  They go to the Department and they point out that in a particular year so much waxed paper was imported; they say they could have manufactured every bit of that. In 1957, for example, they would have got sale for every bit they manufactured and they could have got the import trade as well.  I do not think it is fair for these firms to go to the Minister and his Department and make a case not wholly founded on fact.</P>
    <P>I see from the reports published by these various companies&mdash;the manufacture of waxed paper is only a sideline&mdash;that they have done very well this year.  There is no question of profits not being very high.  What the Minister has done is to give them not so much protection as a complete monopoly.  I appeal to the Minister to review the situation and to ensure that these people do not get a monopoly. If goods were being dumped, or if there was any element of unfair competition, I should be one of the first to say that the home industry should be given protection.  I am not of that way of thinking in the present instance, because these people do not want to facilitate their customers.</P>
    <P>With regard to wire netting, matting and felting, 50 per cent. full and £33 6s. 8d. preferential: that is a very heavy duty.  I remember applying for sanction for a labourer's cottage and the Minister for Local Government refused sanction because the price of fencing was so high.  It is hard to understand, then, why this extraordinarily high duty should be imposed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wheat Order, there is an imposition of £2 per ton. The case of wheat is not quite as bad as that of peas, but wheat was lost last year.  Yet, there we are putting on a tax.  We have all read in our papers that the production of flour by Ranks has gone down over the past year.  In 1957, the production of flour went <Col N="228" /> down by 30 per cent. as compared with 1955.  The chairman stated that for every ten sacks of flour sold in 1955 they sold only seven sacks in 1957.  One would think that as a levy of 5/9 was put on wheat this year&mdash;and the farmers have to pay that levy&mdash;they would not have to pay a tax on wheat. That is not a protective tax; it is a revenue tax and not protection for the farmers.  I feel the Minister should examine this again and more especially I wish to refer again to the tax on dried peas.  That is a tax on the vegetables of the poorer section of the people.  I ask the Minister to review that and to give us the quantity of peas imported in the year 1957, the value and the duty paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the principle of duties is to protect existing industries and to give an opportunity to new industries to get on their feet.  I was shocked to find in this list of duties the one that refers to wheat.  Imagine imposing a duty of £2 a ton on wheat importation.  Surely the duty is not being imposed to give an opportunity for wheat to be, if you like, grown or manufactured during the current year to which these duties apply.  Surely it is not imposed in order to give protection to the production of wheat because it does not arise, as the growing period of wheat has not yet begun this year, but here we find a duty of £2 a ton which will result in taking approximately £500,000 from the people who eat bread. Surely that £500,000 is not being taken from the consumers of bread to protect the wheat growing industry. It is purely and simply a tax on those who will use flour and bread this year manufactured from imported wheat.  The imposition of that duty is unjustified.  It is most improper to ask the Dáil to approve the imposition of such a duty when we consider that the wheat crop was a failure last year.  The consumers should not be penalised for that failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this £2 a ton being taken from the consumers under this Imposition of Duties Bill, £2 6s. a ton was taken from the producers already, making a total of £4 6s. a ton on a certain quantity of homegrown <Col N="229" /> and imported wheat.  The Minister and the House should not approve the imposition of a duty on the importation of wheat for our ordinary bread requirements.</P>
    <P>I see also that a duty is being imposed on milk cans which has the effect of increasing very considerably the cost of milk cans to the milk producers and dairy farmers, particularly in the creamery areas.  We know that although they are required to pay the increased price for milk cans of 14 gallons capacity, the price of milk to them has been reduced during the past 12 months.  In addition to having the price of milk reduced, there is also a tax rake-off from the creamery milk suppliers in order to meet the cost of subsidising butter exports.  I feel that the matter of increasing the cost of milk cans by this duty should be considered in addition to abolishing immediately the duty being applied to the importation of wheat for the manufacture of flour and bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the difficulty of having an effective discussion on a Bill of this kind with a very long Schedule of Orders to be confirmed.  It was the practice originally that the duties imposed under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act had to be confirmed by legislation within six months.  That did not prove to be a very satisfactory arrangement either, because in practice it worked out that at the end of each session of the Dáil, it became necessary to bring in a Bill to confirm Orders that might expire during the recess.  My predecessor thought up this idea of dealing with the confirmation of these Orders on an annual basis, having all the Orders made in one year confirmed by legislation in the next following year.  I thought it a good idea and I proceeded with the legislation he had drafted in the Act of 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, however, that the difficulty, if there is one, emerges from a disposition to discuss the Orders on Second Reading, whereas I think the procedure which would lend itself best to a full examination of any Order the House wished to discuss would be to have the Dáil in Committee and move <Col N="230" /> amendments to bring up, for separate discussion, Orders about which Deputies may feel concerned or on which they may desire more information.</P>
    <P>On the specific matters that were referred to, there are just a few words of explanation I should like to offer. Deputy Crotty referred to the imposition of a minimum duty per yard on fabrics of silk and artificial silk.  We are not the only country in the world which has had to face this very acute problem of exceptionally low prices for textile goods imported from Far Eastern or Iron Curtain countries.  The prices at which some of these fabrics are offered for sale here have no relation whatever to production costs in this part of the world and, indeed, so far as the Iron Curtain countries are concerned, it is not clear that economic considerations alone apply in the determination of their prices.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen that Britain, certainly a far stronger industrial country than we are, has had to take action to restrict imports by the imposition of quantitative limitations and otherwise.  We had to face up to that situation.  We were not going to allow our textile factories to be put out of business by these imports at prices which would be completely impossible in this part of the world.  We decided we would have to take the same protective measures as every other European country has had to take in order to maintain our own textile industry.</P>
    <P>In the case of dried peas, I think Deputy Crotty misunderstands the position.  In fact, that duty is not paid. It is a device adopted to confine the importation of dried peas to firms which have entered into contracts with farmers for the growing of peas in this country.  Firms that entered into these contracts are then permitted to import free of duty, the quantity of peas which relates to the acreage for which they have contracted here.  It is a device for organising the production of peas rather than a tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of waxed <Col N="231" /> paper, I think I should make it clear at the start that there was no application for a duty in this case.  The decision to impose a duty followed upon an examination of the position undertaken by the Department.  There seemed to be no reason why waxed paper should be imported.  The price at which waxed paper is sold throughout Europe has been determined by a convention made between firms concerned and certainly the price at which it was offered for sale here was no higher than the price prevailing in Britain and on the Continent.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it would seem that there was no need for imports and yet imports were taking place and, whether that was due to some hidden subventions being given to the importers, some departure from the agreed prices of imports from certain continental firms which were not disclosed on invoices and could not be tracked down, I do not know, but there was no reason why these imports should be permitted and we, on our own initiative, imposed the duty. Prices are the same as they are in Great Britain and the undertakings we have received from the firms concerned are that prices prevailing in Britain will prevail here and, if that situation changes, I am prepared to consider taking the import duties off again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of wire webbing, netting and fencing, again the problem was one of dumping.  Certain continental firms were offering these fences and wire webbing at prices which were below the cost of the wire from which they were made and clearly, in a situation of that kind, there was no alternative but to take action to restrict these dumping practices.  It was obviously a case of dumping and, while we might get some advantage by allowing dumping to continue for a while, we knew it would persist only for a short period and eventually economic prices would prevail, but, in the meantime, quite important industries here would have gone out of existence.  The wire is produced by one firm and the webbing and fences are produced by others, and they are important undertakings which we <Col N="232" /> should not allow to be jeopardised by temporary conditions which, on the Continent, would induce certain firms to try to get rid of their stocks at any price they could obtain.</P>
    <P>Again, in the case of milk cans, I think the Deputy slightly misunderstands the situation.  There was for a very long time an import duty on milk cans which applied to cans of under 12 gallons capacity.  It was found that the duty was being evaded by importation of cans of 12½ gallons and 13 gallons capacity, and the effect of the Order was merely to amend the definition of the cans to which duty applied by increasing the capacity from 12 gallons to 14 gallons.</P>
    <P>In regard to wheat, there will be, as Deputies know, a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Agriculture on which the whole arrangements for dealing with the special situation which developed in connection with the wheat harvest last year can be discussed.  The imposition of the import duty was one of the steps taken to deal with the situation.  Not one penny of the revenue from that comes to the benefit of the Exchequer. The whole of that revenue is being passed over to An Bord Gráin and is paid out by them to the farmers who were the main sufferers from the failure of the harvest and, if the duty were to be repealed, if that revenue were to be lost, the only sufferers would be the farmers for whose benefit these arrangements were made.  All the arrangements can be discussed together on the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Its purpose is to amend and extend in certain respects the law relating to companies contained in the Companies Acts 1908-1924. Since this is the first piece of company legislation to be introduced here in the Dáil with the exception of the 1924 Act which was needed to deal <Col N="233" /> only with a passing difficulty and effected no permanent change in the law, it may be useful if I give the House a brief outline of the origin and development of our present system of company law.</P>
      <P>For historical reasons, of which Deputies will be aware, the course of development of company law in this country is very similar to that of British company law, since the various enactments passed from time to time in Britain on this subject were customarily extended, with occasional minor adaptations, to this country. Here, as in Britain, the forerunner of the ordinary commercial company as we know it to-day was the joint stock company which originated in the seventeenth century, when the advantages of participation by a large number of people in a commercial undertaking first became obvious.  These joint stock companies were usually founded on a deed of settlement which set out the rights and obligations of the members, and divided the capital into shares of fixed amounts freely transferable by the holders.  They were, in fact, little more than large partnerships and there were always legal difficulties associated with them.  Commercial interests were in ensuing years continually pressing for their recognition as companies with separate corporate existence.</P>
      <P>In 1844, the first Joint Stock Companies Act was passed.  This Act required all companies subsequently formed, with certain exceptions, to be registered under it, and companies thus registered were given the privilege of incorporation.  Incorporation may be described as a device whereby a company is given a legal existence quite distinct from that of the individuals who go to make it up.  An incorporated company is endowed with faculties, privileges and powers not enjoyed by an unincorporated body, for example, power to hold land, to sue and be sued in its own name, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies incorporated under the Act of 1844 still lacked the very important privilege accorded to companies incorporated by special Act of Parliament or by Charter, namely, <Col N="234" /> the immunity of the individual members from liability for the debts of the company or, as we call it to-day, limited liability.  About a decade later, however, the registration of joint stock companies with limited liability for the members became possible under an Act of 1855.  Several amending Acts were passed about this time conferring additional rights or imposing additional obligations on companies, but the law remained unsatisfactory in a number of respects and, by reason of the multiplicity of Acts, it remained somewhat confusing, until the whole system was eventually overhauled and remodelled in the first major Companies Act&mdash;the Companies Act, 1862.</P>
    <P>This was a milestone in commercial legislation and indeed the Act is often referred to as the charter of modern co-operative enterprise.  It proved its value in Britain where it facilitated to a remarkable extent the enormous expansion of trade and commerce which occurred in the second half of the last century.  Its value to this country was naturally limited by the political and social conditions prevailing here at the time.  Nevertheless, such industrial and commercial expansion as did occur was facilitated by the provisions of the Act.  Though amended and supplemented on many subsequent occasions, a large number of its provisions have remained unaltered to the present day.  The main object of this Act was to make available to all, by a simple and inexpensive system of registration, the privilege of carrying on business with limited liability.  All that was required was to submit for registration a document known as a memorandum of association signed by the requisite number of persons and to procure in return a certificate of incorporation.</P>
    <P>The years between 1862 and 1908 witnessed no fewer than 18 Acts to amend and extend the Companies Act of 1862.  The existence of all these enactments caused considerable inconvenience and confusion, and for many years there was a strong demand for a consolidating measure.  Eventually all the legislation was brought together under the Companies (Consolidation) <Col N="235" /> Act, 1908, which, with some minor amendments made in 1913 and 1917, is the principal statute relating to companies in this country.  During the War of Independence the records held by the Registrar of Companies at the Custom House were destroyed by fire, and the Companies (Reconstitution of Records) Act, 1924, was passed to deal with the problems thereby created. Since that time, no further company legislation has been enacted.</P>
    <P>The question has sometimes been asked whether we should not think in terms of a more comprehensive change in our system of company law than is now in prospect.  There have been suggestions that there might be advantages in adopting an alternative system, either one based on continental law or one which might be designed to change even more fundamentally the character and responsibilities of companies. Whatever theoretical case might be made for a fundamental change, the practical difficulties of attempting it and the unpredictable effects which would follow on it, would make it a very formidable and perhaps dangerous enterprise on which to embark.</P>
    <P>The whole commercial organisation of the State has been built up on the basis of the present law, and while that law has its flaws and weaknesses, the practical advantages of adhering to it seem to outweigh the very problematic advantages of a comprehensive change. There is probably no perfect system in any case.  The defects in the existing law which have been shown to exist will be, in large measure, remedied by this and the subsequent measure and while it would be unwise to suggest that the third Consolidation Act, when passed, would be liable to amendment, that possibility would exist in the event of the emergence of a serious need to change it.</P>
    <P>The main concepts on which company law here is founded are that individuals may come together and form themselves into a body known as a company having a separate corporate existence of its own distinct from that of its members, thus ensuring the continuity of the concern notwithstanding <Col N="236" /> the death or bankruptcy of the members and these members may, and generally do, declare that their liability is limited so that in the event of the company being brought to an end they will stand to lose only whatever capital they have put into the venture, together with any amounts remaining unpaid on their shares or guarantees.  The members are free to transfer their shares either to other members or to outsiders. Lastly, as a convenient and workable arrangement, the day-to-day management of the company can be vested in a board of directors elected by the shareholders.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, only the barest outline of the fundamentals of company law; the Acts deal with these and a host of other matters in great detail. There are, for example, provisions dealing with the internal regulations of the company known as its articles of association, the raising of capital from the public, its financial accounts, the reduction of share capital, the appointment of directors and numerous matters of management and administration. In addition there is a large number of provisions dealing with winding up, the object of which is to ensure that when a company is being brought to an end, its assets will be disposed of, and its creditors satisfied in due order of priority.  The procedure varies according to whether the winding up is compulsory, by order of the court, is under the supervision of the court, or is voluntary.</P>
    <P>The need for comprehensive changes in company law has long been recognised, but it has been difficult to find an opportunity to bring about these changes because of the magnitude and complexity of the task.  A committee was set up however in 1951 to report on the reform of company law and it submitted its report in February last. As will be evident from the report, the committee undertook a particularly arduous task involving a detailed examination of an unusually complicated subject, and I would like to take this opportunity of expressing the appreciation of the Government of the valuable services rendered by the committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Its report, which contains numerous proposals for the amendment of existing legislation, is under examination at present, but it is clear that owing to the complexity of the problems involved, some period of time must elapse before all the committee's recommendations can be fully examined. Accordingly, some time ago I announced that, as an interim measure, legislation would be introduced to give effect to some of the more urgent reforms requiring attention, and these amendments are dealt with in the Bill which is now before the House.  A second and much more complex Bill will have to be introduced later to deal with the remaining amendments requiring to be made in company law.  Finally, it is my intention to introduce a consolidating Bill which will gather together in one measure all the law on this subject.</P>
    <P>The actual matters arising out of the need to change the law and the report of the Committee on Company Law Reform that this Bill deals with are these.  The Bill will authorise a company limited by shares to issue redeemable preference shares.  That is dealt with in paragraph 58 of the report.  Under the existing law, the share capital of a company cannot be reduced without the sanction of the courts.  A company cannot, therefore, issue preference shares on the basis that they are redeemable, because to do so would involve an assumption that the courts would sanction the reduction of capital&mdash;in fact, they might not.  It is sometimes difficult to raise capital on satisfactory terms by the issue of ordinary shares.  The issue of preference shares may be an unsatisfactory alternative, since preference shares do not nowadays find the same support as they did in former years.</P>
    <P>One reason for that is that, over a number of years, there has been a tendency for their market value to fall, with the result that prospective purchasers are often deterred from buying them for fear of suffering a capital loss. As assurance of redemption at par within a fixed time would go a long way towards removing this disadvantage and would reduce the difficulty which <Col N="238" /> a number of Irish firms have experienced in procuring capital for development purposes.  I am satisfied that, provided adequate safeguards are adopted, the issue of redeemable preference shares would be advantageous.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which this Bill deals is dealt with at paragraphs 73-75 of the committee's report.  At present, a company may not purchase its own shares, as this would constitute a reduction of its share capital.  It is possible for a company to circumvent this prohibition by providing financial assistance to other persons to enable them to purchase its shares.  Such a practice is objectionable as it could seriously weaken the security enjoyed by the company's creditors and I propose, therefore, to prohibit it.  I am providing, however, an exemption which will permit a company to provide funds for the purchase of shares for the benefit of the employees.  Profit sharing schemes for the benefit of employees are desirable, and I do not wish that the new legislation should interfere with any such arrangements.  As a corollary to prohibiting companies from dealing in their own shares, I propose to prohibit a subsidiary company from purchasing shares in its holding company.</P>
    <P>The next matter dealt with in the Bill is discussed in paragraph 96 of the committee's report.  Schemes for the amalgamation of companies may, in certain circumstances, prove impracticable under the law as it stands.  It sometimes happens that a majority of the shareholders of a company whose shares another company wishes to acquire are willing to sell, but that for one reason or another a small minority are not prepared to do so.  It is sometimes not an attractive proposition for the purchasing company to take less than 100 per cent. of the share capital of the other company&mdash;leaving a small minority interest behind&mdash;and amalgamation schemes which are, perhaps, desirable in themselves may fall through for this reason.  It is important to provide a remedy for this difficulty, and the Bill contains a provision that if an amalgamation scheme has been approved by the holders of at least 80 per cent. of the shares the transfer <Col N="239" /> of which is involved, the company which is acquiring the shares will have power to purchase compulsorily the shares held by the dissenting minority. The position of minority groups is being safeguarded, however, by providing for a right of appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the Bill deal with matters discussed in paragraphs 127 and 128 of the committee's report.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands, certain resolutions, such as resolutions in connection with a change of name of a company or a change in its objects or articles, are effective only if they are passed at two successive meetings; at the first the resolution must be passed by a majority of three-fourths of the members present, and at the second it has to be confirmed by a simple majority of the members present. These resolutions are known as special resolutions.  In practice, the second meeting is almost invariably a formality and serves no useful purpose. There is, therefore, no point in putting companies to the expense of calling a second meeting, and I propose to dispense companies from the obligation to hold it.  I propose also to make a change in the law as regards the computation of votes at a meeting.  As the law stands, members who are present at a meeting but do not vote on a resolution are regarded as voting against it.  This is obviously unsatisfactory and I propose to amend the law to provide that, in future, the requisite majority will be computed by reference to votes actually cast.</P>
    <P>Every company is required to send each year to the Registrar of Companies a complete list of its shareholders showing their names, addresses and occupations and also details of their shareholdings.  The preparation of this list involves a good deal of labour in the case of companies with a large number of members, and I feel the obligation could be eased without weakening the real effectiveness of the Act in this respect.  I propose, therefore, to relax the requirement somewhat so as to provide that in future a complete list of shareholders need be filed in every fifth <Col N="240" /> year only, a list of additions to, and deletions from, the full list to be filed in the intervening years.  In order to facilitate the examination of the lists at the companies office, companies will have to provide a suitable index if the list is not in alphabetical order.</P>
    <P>The name of a company must be set out in the memorandum of association which is registered in the companies office, but this name may be changed subsequently in accordance with a procedure prescribed by the Act which involves ministerial approval. A number of companies which have been registered under the Companies Acts have had their name prescribed in a separate Act, and as a result they are unable to change their name without an amendment of the latter Act.  A case which illustrated their difficulty in a practical way came under my notice some time ago.  I would have been perfectly willing to convey my assent to the proposed change of name, but I was advised that the procedure under the Companies Acts could not be utilised and that amending legislation would be necessary.  The effect of the amendment which I am now proposing is that the provision under the Companies Acts will be made available in the type of case I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity of repealing the Companies (Foreign Interests) Act, 1917.  This Act, which was passed during the First World War to control the interests of aliens in British and Irish companies, is now an anachronism.  It has long ceased to serve a useful purpose, and it is proposed to repeal it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, as I have explained, an interim measure intended to deal with a number of matters which are of special urgency.  Many of the other matters arising from the committee's report are of a complicated and perhaps controversial nature and they will require detailed study before it will be possible to reach conclusions in regard to them.  The examination of all these matters is proceeding, and legislative proposals will be put forward in due course.  In the meantime I hope that the present interim Bill will make a <Col N="241" /> useful contribution to the task of bringing the law up to date on some aspects of company law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill which the Minister has introduced arises out of a report furnished by a committee set up in 1951 as well as by reason of the obvious need for certain changes in legislation.  I might endorse the remarks which the Minister made concerning the work of that committee. It was appointed for the purpose of examining what amendments or changes were desirable in company law and I may say it was one of a number of legal reforms which were initiated, some of them implemented by the previous Government, as a result of recognition that improvements and changes were desirable.</P>
      <P>This is a very useful report.  It was unfortunate that due to reasons mentioned in the preliminary part of the report it was so long delayed.  The persons concerned carried out an exhaustive and thorough examination of the problem.  They have also provided in the report a useful historical summary of company law and the various changes which have taken place.  So far as this country is concerned, the increase in the number of companies in the State has been considerable and is, indeed, a compelling reason for the reform of company law. It is notable that the increase is due almost entirely to the number of private companies.  With the direct and indirect investment of public moneys in industry, it is important that companies should comply with a uniform system and that that system, both of law and of accounting, should supply the public or those interested with adequate information about the business and activities of the company concerned. For that reason, I was pleased to hear that this is only an interim measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the recommendations made in the report which was the subject of careful consideration by the committee was whether it was desirable merely to change the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, or introduce a new Bill.  The committee came to the conclusion that they should recommend that new legislation by way of <Col N="242" /> amendment was not desirable and that a new Bill should be introduced.  I am glad to note from the Minister that he proposes to introduce a Consolidation Bill later.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in this country is that, with the amendments which have taken place in Britain, and with which the committee and others who have interested themselves in this matter agree, the amending legislation, particularly the British Act of 1948, is quite inappropriate in our circumstances. Nevertheless, it is obvious that changes should be made.  It is also important that matters concerning company law should be contained in one statute.  It is in itself a rather complicated and complex part of the law and the fact that our companies arrangements follow fairly closely the British system is one reason why&mdash; while not following it, certainly not following the very radical changes which were made in the 1948 Act&mdash; it is not desirable at this stage to embark on a new system of company law which would take no account of the practices and procedures which have been followed because of the application over the years of similar statutes to this country.  However, the proposals which are contained in this measure deal merely with a few matters and I suppose it is not possible at this stage to consider the question in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The power taken in Section 2 to issue redeemable preference shares is a very useful provision, which will be welcomed by business people generally. I should like the Minister to consider, between now and the Committee Stage, whether it would not be possible to get an amendment which would not merely cover the power which is contained in this section but which would also enable existing preference shares to be converted into redeemable preference shares where all the preference shareholders of the company agree.  In a recent speech the chairman of the Industrial Credit Company and the chairman of the I.D.A. referred to the fact that, if this legislation is enacted, the Industrial Credit Company propose to provide capital, and would be <Col N="243" /> enabled to provide capital, for industry in a way in which it is precluded from doing at present.  He went on, in the course of that address, to deal with the advantages in issuing redeemable preference shares, which have been referred to by the Minister and which are the subject of this section.  I believe that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The other provisions which are proposed here were all recommended in the course of the report published last year.  One of the problems which the committee found was that it was impossible to get a unanimous view on certain matters; and it seems to me, from reading the report and from looking at the complexion of that committee, that the difficulties arose because of the views taken on the one hand by lawyers and on the other hand by accountants.  The committee, on certain aspects, particularly those dealing with winding up and with the question of accounts, admitted that they found it difficult to get agreement. However, I hope that between now and the introduction of the consolidation measure, these other matters will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has had experience of winding up companies is struck by the difficulties which arise and by the unsatisfactory nature of the procedure here.  It ought to be possible to devise a system which, while not encumbering itself with the more elaborate procedure which is in operation in Britain, nevertheless will enable speedy and satisfactory effect to be given to the voluntary winding up procedure, which is at present both slow and unsatisfactory. In the case of winding up under the auspices of the court, the difficulties are not so great and provision is made for dealing with the matter in a more satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>The other changes which are made here are desirable and follow from the recommendations made in this report. The introduction of a comprehensive consolidation measure is one which will fill a need long felt by those who have to deal with this matter, especially accountants, solicitors and people engaged in commerce generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> One of the difficulties which was adverted to by the committee is the fact that, generally speaking, there are no text-books available here dealing with company matters for persons concerned with such matters.  That refers not merely to those directly concerned: there is no adequate presentation of what the law is for those interested in investment here.  While it is generally understood by outsiders that our system follows fairly generally the system in operation in Britain, it is important, with the need for increased investment here, that the law should be readily understood by those who propose to invest here and that the requirements which they will be obliged to fulfil or comply with should be easily ascertained and understood.  That aspect of the matter was also referred to in the course of the address by Dr. Beddy. It is one of the questions generally addressed by outside investors who contemplate investing in this country or establishing an undertaking here.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the question of stamp duty was not considered by this committee and that the question of duty on transfers is not considered in this measure.  Probably, it is not strictly appropriate and the committee decided not to discuss it, but any impediment to increased investment here should be removed.  If it is not considered possible to include such a provision in this Bill before its enactment, I hope it will be the subject of consideration before the consolidation measure is introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very technical Bill to the ordinary man, but I welcome it.  The last Companies Act was the Act of 1924 which was introduced for reasons explained by the Minister at that time.  The question of reforming company law is very important because of the number of people employed in the various industrial and commercial firms who would be affected by the financial manipulations which take place at the top in those firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has explained that this is more or less an interim Bill designed to consolidate the existing company laws and to provide facilities <Col N="245" /> which have been lacking up to the present.  I agree that a change in company law must be approached very carefully because so many classes are affected and because the very basis of the commercial and industrial set-up of the country might be undermined.</P>
    <P>Tribute should be paid to the 1951 commission which examined this matter and reported back in February, 1958, suggesting reforms.  Of course, some of the suggestions could not be adopted very readily without examination of their possible effects on the national economy.  That is why I am glad to hear from the Minister that this is more or less an interim Bill. Of course, there will be opportunity on Committee Stage to go more fully into the technical aspects.</P>
    <P>I agree that the need for the proposed changes has been recognised for a number of years.  The Minister instanced a case where he was prepared to facilitate a certain firm but found that amending legislation would be necessary and he was unable to facilitate them, owing to lack of legal provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of his speech that arrangements would be made for the redemption of shares at par at a fixed date.  I was wondering what provision it will be possible to make towards that end. Government stock is guaranteed by the State to be redeemable at par at a certain time, but, in the case of private enterprise, it may be more difficult to assure shareholders that the shares will be redeemable at par at a certain fixed date.</P>
    <P>It was also mentioned that there were possibilities under the existing law for a holding company to enable an outside interest to purchase shares from it or on its behalf.  Amendment of legislation in this respect is very desirable.  However, the existing company law has enabled a parent company to establish a number of subsidiary companies.  In view of the limited capital available here, it is possible that, were it not for that facility, the enterprise displayed by the subsidiary companies might not have been possible and we might not have had the industrial growth that was achieved <Col N="246" /> by some of those companies.  That development was mainly due to the people who were associated with the original company and who formed a number of companies down along the line by manipulating the limited capital available.</P>
    <P>I agree that this legislation will be of particular interest to accountants and the legal profession.  It will have the effect of attracting outside capital to this country.  Our industrial development has been hampered by lack of capital.  If the introduction of this Bill encourages people with capital outside the country to invest it here, great advantages will accrue to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that a complete list of shareholders need be filed with the Registrar of Companies only once every five years in future.  I assume that in the intervening period the Revenue Commissioners will be working on the old list and will become aware of changes that take place, such as the death of a shareholder, the disposal of shares, and so on, and that the Revenue Commissioners will be facilitated to that extent and that that list will be a check for their purposes.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think this occasion should not pass without paying a tribute to the very valuable work done by members of the commission in putting before us in their report every aspect and every problem arising from the existing company law which enables us here to-day to consider the introduction of an interim Bill designed to meet the position that exists at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately, might I correct one statement Deputy Rooney made that may cause some apprehension?  The list of shareholders is supplied to the Registrar of Companies and not to the Revenue Commissioners. It is not intended by this device to empower the Revenue Commissioners to get after defaulting taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, in the circumstances surrounding it, I appreciate that my difficulty will be to defend what is not in it rather than what is in it.  There is before us a report <Col N="247" /> recommending a whole series of changes in company law.  The procedure which I contemplate is that we proceed at once to make the minimum number of changes which are required quickly and then examine all the recommendations of the committee and prepare a comprehensive amending Bill which will make all the changes in the law which we decide upon after examination of the committee's report.  Finally, there will be the Consolidation Bill which will incorporate the whole lot in the one Act.</P>
    <P>When I got the report of the committee and considered it, I consulted the Government as to the procedure to be adopted.  I asked my officers to bring out from their recommendations a list of the changes which were proposed which would not likely to be controversial and which would be, therefore, easily embodied in the first of these three measures.  They proposed 32 separate proposals which, if I proceeded with them, would defeat my main purpose because it would take a considerable time to frame a Bill containing these 32 provisions. The discussion on them and the possible amendment of them would also be a cause of further delay.  Therefore, I proceeded to incorporate in this Bill only those changes in respect of which, from my own experience or because of representations made to the Department, there is a desire to do something quickly, leaving over all the other changes to the second amending Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies not to seek to go too far in bringing into this Bill additional proposals which are not in it at the moment, unless there is good reason for doing something about these matters quickly.  All these matters will come up again in another Bill which is now in course of preparation. The aim is to get this Bill through fairly quickly so that the facilities it gives, particularly in regard to the issue of redeemable preference shares, and so on, will be available without delay.</P>
    <P>It may be, I appreciate, that a case will be made either by some special interest or by individual Deputies for <Col N="248" /> incorporating in this Bill some further changes which we have not proposed in the Bill at the moment.  They can be considered but, in legislation of this kind, hasty action as a rule is not desirable.  For that reason, I would ask those interests that may be thinking in terms of a further amendment of this Bill to keep in mind that there will be another Bill of a more comprehensive kind in which action can be taken if it is necessary and that, really, we should pass this Bill and put it on the Statute Book without holding it up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of £4,400 for the expenses of the Television Commission arises mainly out of visits abroad by members of the commission to study the operation of television programmes in certain foreign countries.  Groups of 12 members have already visited London, Glasgow, Manchester and also centres in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland.  A small group will <Col N="249" /> shortly visit selected centres in the United States and Canada.

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister on this Supplementary Estimate if it is clearly understood that no commitments concerning the establishment of a television service will be undertaken here before the publication and discussion of the report of the Television Commission.  As I understand it the procedure which has been followed concerning this commission is to some extent different from that followed in other cases of commissions established by the Government. Generally, commissions consider whatever particular question is referred to them and take evidence from interested parties.  In this case, I understand that definite commercial proposals have been put to the commission by interested parties.  In view of that somewhat unusual procedure, I should like the Minister to assure the House that no commitments will be undertaken before the Dáil has a full opportunity of considering and debating the proposals.</P>

I wonder if a site for a television station has been purchased by the Government and, furthermore, can the Minister indicate on what lines, if any, it is proposed that this service shall operate? There has been a great deal of speculation on this matter in the Press and elsewhere.  There have been some rumours.  I believe it is desirable that the Minister should allay public anxiety and inform the House on the matter so that the public may understand the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood from the Minister's <Col N="250" /> statement that he referred to the countries the commission had visited and that he furnished the names of the countries which the commission propose to visit.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions, if he has the information at his disposal.  £9,500 is a formidable sum in expenses for a commission that has been in operation for less than 12 months. Perhaps the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>All commissions?  I am sorry.  That disposes of one of my questions, because the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said yesterday that the total that would be required for the Television Commission would be in the region of £5,000.  I was going to ask the Minister to reconcile that with the figure of £9,500.  It is now proposed to send members of the Television Commission to the United States of America.  I am not an expert on television, and I am sure the Minister is not either, but did the Government, or the Minister, not consider the possibility of inviting some television experts from the United States of America to come here to give evidence before the commission, rather than to send three, or four, or half a dozen people to the United States, at a probable cost of £1,500 or £2,000?  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate provides the expenses of persons visiting various places and the Minister mentioned London, Glasgow, Belgium and Holland.  As far as I know, these are <Col N="251" /> not all technical people; they come from various walks of life and they are considering this matter from various points of view.  In view of the various activities taking place within the country in anticipation of a television service being provided, such as people putting forward proposals and suggestions and so forth, I wonder if the Minister can say whether or not a time limit has been placed in respect of the report which is to come back here from this commission set up to examine and report on the possibility of providing a television service.  I consider that it is very important to have a time limit on the activities of this group because we have seen, even in the past ten years, the changes which have taken place in connection with television technique and while the members are visiting various countries now and intend visiting the United States of America the position may have changed considerably in a few years' time.  That is why I think we ought to have a report soon and a time limit imposed, so far as the report is concerned.</P>
      <P>I assume that these people have been given terms of reference which will form the basis of the report which they will submit to the Government. We know that owing to the small population here, a very limited service could be given, and it is probable that private enterprise and commercial interests would be required to play a big part in the provision of a service. For these reasons, I feel we should have a time limit on the submission of the report so that the various interests will know where they stand and the country will have a decision regarding the provision of a television service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general feeling that the country cannot afford to have a television service provided by our own Government, at the expense of the citizens and taxpayers, and we should know as soon as possible whether or not it will be possible to provide a service according to present standards. We have seen from the international television services the vast amount of material required, within any given space of time, to provide a service and <Col N="252" /> possibly when we receive this report, we will find that the country could afford only a service of one or two hours per day, having regard to the colossal expense involved in setting up a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked if there would be any commitment by the commission before their report.  I cannot say no definitely, but the commitment which will be entered into will be very small and only in connection with an option on a site which was considered advisable, as far as the commission was concerned.  I do not say that the Government have agreed with that, but they have been asked to do it and if they do it, it will only be a matter of a small amount.  It will be so small that it will not commit the Dáil to the point that we must go ahead with the matter.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked if, instead of paying the expenses of some members of the commission to America and Canada, it would not be better for experts to come across to this country. I think experts did come across.  It is an extremely difficult matter.  No Minister for Finance likes incurring or sanctioning expenditure of this kind, if he has a feeling that it is going to create a precedent for future commissions. On the other hand, we must remember that members of commissions give a great deal of their time free and give good advice, generally speaking, to the Government.  For that reason, we cannot be too parsimonious if asked for a concession, or expenses, of this kind, this being a matter where the very latest information might be advisable.  I must say that after consideration I was induced to agree that they should get these expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also assured that that would not delay the report.  As a matter of fact, they have made good progress in their deliberations and they expect, I believe, to present a report in the course of a couple of months.  On the whole, therefore, I think they have worked hard in getting all this evidence and in making progress with the preparation of their report.  They expect, when they get this additional information <Col N="253" /> which they feel is necessary, by three of the members going to the United States of America and Canada, that the report will be completed in a very short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,250 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for such of the salaries and expenses of the District Court as are not charged on the Central Fund (7 Edw. 7. c. 17, sec. 3; No. 27 of 1926, secs. 49, 50 and 66; No. 15 of 1928, sec. 13; No. 48 of 1936, secs. 51 and 77; No. 4 of 1946, secs. 35 and 36; No. 21 of 1946; No. 8 of 1951; and No. 32 of 1953) and for a capitation grant.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the extra expenditure which has been necessitated by the appointment of three temporary additional justices to fill vacancies.  The reason that these vacancies have not been filled on a permanent basis is that it is proposed later in the year to make an Order under Part V of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, reducing the number of district justices. As the House knows, the salaries of permanent justices are charged on the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate, I want to renew a protest against the appointment of temporary district justices.  The very essence of our system of justice <Col N="255" /> is that judges, minor and major, shall dispense justice while holding their positions under special tenure in order to preserve their independence.  Temporary district justices have no security at all, and, in principle, it is a bad thing to be appointing temporary justices, particularly when they are dealing with criminal matters.</P>
      <P>The whole basis of giving justices peculiar security of tenure is to ensure their independence <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Executive and to make certain that the humblest citizen coming before them can be assured of getting justice, whether he is in conflict with the Executive or not.  If you appoint temporary district justices, there is the danger that these men are more or less on trial, in the knowledge that if they do not give satisfaction during the period when they are temporary justices, they are unlikely to be appointed permanent justices.</P>
      <P>It has always been argued that it is inescapably necessary from time to time to appoint temporary district justices.  I do not believe that is so.  I believe with a little reasonable foresight and management, we could arrange that any person dispensing justice from the bench in this country would hold his position by the tenure which this House and the country have thought it proper to confer on judicial persons.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Justice that it is his intention to provide in the future that the appointment of district justices on a temporary basis will stop and that we will appoint only on a permanent basis so that district justices may have that security of tenure in their office which makes them independent of the Executive in the dispensation of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the sum of £250 is required for salaries of temporary additional justices.  For what period would that cover the wages, salaries and allowances of temporary justices?  I should imagine it would be for a very short time.  It is well known that appointments of temporary district justices have been very frequent in recent times.  I agree with the view that we ought to have permanent men <Col N="256" /> and a system whereby any vacancy arising can be filled almost immediately, instead of the present system under which temporary district justices do not know where they stand.  It is well known that they have a kind of roving commission in the country. They find themselves in one district one month and elsewhere the next. That is very unsatisfactory, particularly when we remember that there is an accumulation of work in the District Courts at present.  Many interests depend on the disposal of that work and the making of decisions in those courts.  That is why I think the Minister ought to devise a system whereby we could ensure that the work, particularly that which had accumulated, would be expedited.  The appointment of temporary district justices for an unspecified period is not the way to meet this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has given a sufficient answer in the case of this Estimate.  I understand that the reason for the continuing reappointment of temporary district justices is simply that the Minister anticipates a change in the District Court areas in the near future and that otherwise, if he did not adopt this course, we would have a redundancy. I think that is a very fair explanation and on that basis I can accept this Estimate.</P>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Dillon.  It is an extremely pernicious thing to drift into any habit of temporary judicial appointments. They are unavoidable in certain circumstances. Let us face the practical fact that for short periods you have to appoint a temporary justice in some capacity or other, but I think that should be controlled, as Deputy Dillon suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it unavoidable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into all sort of details, I can foresee cases where a thing like that is unavoidable. For instance, take the case where a justice dies.  The work must go on, but the people responsible for appointing justices want a little time to look around and make arrangements. <Col N="257" /> It may be that an opportunity for some readjustment will come. There are all sorts of administrative reasons like that and, in a case like that, it would be unreasonable to insist that one did not make a temporary appointment.</P>
      <P>While I agree completely with Deputy Dillon on the principle, I think it is a bad thing to drift into a state in which one is reappointing temporarily people who are already temporarily appointed.  In the long run, that is a bad practice, and a dangerous one.  If a policy like that were to be adopted it would eventually result in the best people not being available for appointment.  If the road to the bench is through a temporary channel, the more suitable people will hesitate to take the risk and, not having been in the running at the temporary stage, they will be out of the running altogether when the permanent stage is reached, because the appointers would naturally incline towards the people who had actually done the work in the meantime.  If that policy were to be adopted, in the long run, there would inevitably be a deterioration in standard.  However, these questions are really beside the point at the moment but, as Deputy Dillon raised the principle, it is no harm to have it noted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the intention is to reorganise the districts and, in the process of solving that administrative problem, the question of providing moneys for temporary justices arises.  There can be no objection in this particular instance to doing what the Minister wishes.  I do not think there is at the moment any particular dangerous infringement of the principle mentioned by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question: can he explain the relationship between a salary amounting to £250&mdash;I do not know how much a district justice gets per week&mdash;and £2,000 for travelling and subsistence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the remarks of Deputy Rooney first, the Deputy was concerned about the appointment of temporary district justices and the <Col N="258" /> fact that they might be sent here, there, and everywhere.  The Deputy may not be aware of the fact, but there are such people as &ldquo;movable justices&rdquo; and the function of these justices is to go wherever a vacancy occurs through one cause or another&mdash;illness, holidays, or some other contingency of that nature. A temporary justice is usually appointed to a particular district in which a permanent justice has been operating but has fallen ill and will be unable to operate for a certain period; in that event, the temporary justice takes over and continues to operate until such time, and until such time only, as the permanent justice returns to work.  I do not subscribe to the view expounded by Deputy Dillon that because a district justice is appointed in a temporary capacity only, he will not give of his best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, anyhow, that any person who applies for a post as a temporary justice will do the work as efficiently and as effectively as the permanent justice.  He will not scamp the work because he is in a temporary capacity.  Hope springs eternal, and the temporary justice will always have in mind the fact that, if he does the work efficiently and effectively, he will naturally be considered when the time comes to make a permanent appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does his work as the Minister thinks he ought to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose I happen to be in the dock and I want him to acquit me of a criminal offence of having called a gentleman by the name of Oscar Traynor whatever I choose to call him, I may think the justice ought to do his work in quite another way. My belief is that he should be independent to do his work in whatever way he thinks is just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to believe anyhow&mdash;perhaps I am simpler than the Deputy&mdash;that he will do it as effectively and as efficiently as the permanent <Col N="259" /> justice before whom the Deputy would rather appear.</P>
      <P>The temporary justices for whom we are catering here are there merely because&mdash;in some cases, at any rate &mdash;some of the permanent justices have died.  There are, I think, two cases in which death has intervened.  In another case, there is illness.  We are taking steps to reduce the number of districts from 30 to 25 and we are not prepared, therefore, to appoint any of these as permanent justices because they would ultimately become redundant when the number of districts is reduced.  Were we to carry the total number of permanent justices&mdash; 30 at the moment&mdash;and subsequently five of them became redundant, the House would be perfectly correct in criticising me for allowing that situation to arise.  I should certainly not be acting in the interests of economy.  We are, therefore, appointing temporary justices to meet the situation that exists at the moment.  As long as I can remember, temporary justices have been appointed from time to time.  I do not believe anyone would expect us to appoint a permanent justice to do the work of a man who falls ill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Even when we reduce the number to 25, the contingency of illness and death will still have to be met.  Possibly in the case of death, we could appoint a permanent justice right away.  Speed is important because the courts must continue to function and a man has to be replaced immediately.  The question is: can we appoint a permanent justice within a short period of time and without giving to the appointment the consideration that should be given to it?  I do not think we would be justified in making too speedy appointments. However, as I say it is not done regularly.  We took our time about that and so far as the temporary justices are concerned, we are not anxious to appoint them, if it is possible to appoint a permanent justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> In answer to the point made by Deputy Corish, it simply means that we are short of the sum of money that was estimated originally.  We are short of that amount of money and we must secure that amount of money in order to ensure the payment of the salaries.  The question of the payment of travelling expenses arises from the fact that the travelling expenses of temporary justices are paid in a different manner from those of permanent justices.  The expenses of a permanent justice are paid only when he reaches his district.  If he happens to live in Dublin and to be operating in Donegal, his travelling expenses do not begin until such time as he reaches his headquarters in his district, whereas the expenses of a temporary man begin from the time he leaves his home in Dublin, or wherever he lives, until he reaches the district in which he is operating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the £250.  What is a district justice paid?  About £25 a week, I think. That means for ten weeks' work he gets £250 and £2,000 is paid by the State in travelling and subsistence expenses.  It may be perfectly all right, but it seems incongruous to me.</P>

    <P>The bulk of the additional sum required is to make good a deficiency in the estimated fees payable in connection with the execution of court orders and Land Commission warrants. Although some of the fees were increased by the Sheriffs Fees Order, 1958, the yield was not as great as anticipated.  On the other hand more expenses were incurred in the execution of court orders.  The additional sum required for travelling and subsistence allowances is due to the fact that there were more court sittings in consequence of which the judges and stenographers had to do more travelling.</P>

      <P>Of the total sum, £6,500 needs to be provided by way of capitation grant in respect of recognised pupils in secondary schools.  May I explain at the outset that recognised pupils are pupils who have done an appropriate entrance examination in order to indicate that they have the secondary school education and that they then follow the required minimum course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants are payable in respect of recognised pupils in secondary schools <Col N="262" /> in the preceding school-year.  At the time of preparation of the Estimate it is not known how many of the pupils on the rolls will fulfil the conditions for recognition and a percentage based on experience in previous years is taken.</P>
    <P>In framing the Estimate for the financial year 1958-59, it was assumed, in the light of previous experience, that 97 per cent. of the pupils on the rolls in the school-year 1957-58 would fulfil the conditions for recognition, the percentages for the three previous years being 96, 95 and 94.  It happens, however, that 98 per cent. of the pupils on the rolls in the school-year 1957-58 are recognised pupils.  Accordingly grants are payable in the financial year 1958-59 on a greater number of pupils than was provided for.</P>
    <P>The rates of capitation grant are as set out in the Book of Estimates for 1958-59.</P>
    <P>On sub-head B (1)&mdash;Incremental Salary Grant&mdash;the additional amount required is £12,500.  Again, if I may explain, I am sure that the House is aware that the school pays the basic salary of the secondary teacher and the Department of Education pays the incremental salary at the end of the first year of satisfactory service.  The quota of teachers in a secondary school to whom incremental salary may be paid is related to the number of recognised pupils in the preceding school-year.  The increase in the percentage of recognised pupils in the school-year 1957-58 made possible the employment of an increased number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary as from the beginning of the school-year 1958-59, the greater part of which falls within the financial year 1958-59.</P>
    <P>I am sure at this juncture the House &mdash;without wishing to widen the scope of the debate which may follow&mdash; would be interested in the comparative figures of the development of secondary education over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The following comparative figures give a brief indication of the progress in the development of secondary education in the last few years.  The number of secondary schools has <Col N="263" /> increased from 480 in 1956-7 to 489 in 1957-8 and 494 in the present school-year 1958-9.  The number of pupils on the rolls of these schools was 62,444 in 1956-7, in 1957-8 it was 66,221, and in the present school-year 1958-9 it is 69,568.  The number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary in 1956-7 and 1957-8 was 2,701 and 2,814 respectively.  In the present school-year 1958-9 it is 2,948.  In 1956-7 the number of secondary teachers given registration in accordance with the Regulations for the Register of the Intermediate School Teachers was 188.  This number increased to 245 in 1957-8, while in the present school-year it may exceed 270.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Institutions of Science and Art, for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services, and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The first sum required is £600 on sub-head A (15) of the National Library, that is, for the survey and reproduction of films of Irish historical interest. There are many old films of Irish historical interest in film collections outside this country, for example, in the Pathé company's archives in London, the British Film Institute, the Imperial War Museum and the French Film archives in Paris.  The discovery and cataloguing of these films has been proceeding for some time.</P>
    <P>The early films are on a cellulose nitrate base and are likely to deteriorate rapidly at a certain stage.  It is necessary, therefore, to have them copied on to a permanent base before that stage is reached.  When this has been done, it will be possible to make paper enlargements from any of the frames.  It is expected that the work of survey reproduction may take about five years.  The necessity for the Supplementary Estimate arose because these films on a cellulose nitrate base were deteriorating so fast that it required immediate provision in order to ensure that they would be preserved on some permanent base.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí deontas-i gcabhair de £8,000 ag Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge i 1946 nuair nach raibh an Chomhdháilach <Col N="265" /> ina thús, deontas £10,000 i 1948 agus deontas de £10,300 sna blianta 1954-56.  Cuireadh deontas de £9,800 ar fáil tré meastachán na bliana 1958-59.</P>
    <P>Tháinig toscaireacht ón Chomhdháil chun cainte, áfach, leis an dTaoiseach, le hAire na Gaeltachta agus liomsa i mí Aibreáin 1958 agus rinne siad cás go mba chóir an deontas a cuireadh ar fáil dóibh a mhéadú i ngeall go háirithe ar an laghdú atá tagtha i luach an airgid le blianta anuas.</P>
    <P>Chuir an toscaireacht in iúl gur bh'éigin don Chomhdháil cumhangú mór a dhéanamh ar a gcuid imeachtaí toisc an laghdú a bhí tagtha ar luach an deontais.  Bhí orthu, mar shompla, duine dá gcuid timirí do chur den bhóthar, scor de scoláireachtaí de scríbhneoirí etc.  Ba mhór mar do ghoill an cumhangú san, easpa timireachta agus poiblíochta go speisialta, ar chúrsaí na gClub Leabhar tré líon na gcomhaltaí do choimeád ró-íseal.  Sé an líon comhaltaí atá ann faoi láthair i gcás Club Leabhar na Sinsear ná 2,200 agus i gcás Club Leabhar na Sóisear ná 2,500.</P>
    <P>Fagann den líon ró-bheag comhaltaí atá ins na clubanna leabhar agus den éileamh ró-bheag atá ar leabhair Gaeilge ag an bpobal i gcoitinne go mbíonn sé riachtanach cabhair speisialta do thabhairt d'fhoilsitheoirí leabhar Gaeilge i dtreo nach mbeidh cailliúint ró-mhór orthu de bhárr leabhair Gaeilge do chur amach. Tugtar cabhair den tsórt sin tré Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge ach táimíd sásta taréis dúinn an scéal do bhreithniú go mion nach leor an chabhair a tugtar ar an mbealach sin i gcás foilsitheoirí nach bhfuil gnó ró-mhór á dhéanamh acu agus go bhfuil gá dá bhrí sin lena thuille cabhrach i dtreo nach dtiocfaidh meath ar na clubanna d'uireasa leabhar oiriúnacha do bheith dá bhfoilsiú.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin tá beartaithe againn an deontas&mdash;i gcabhair do Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge do mhéadú de £4,000 sa bhliain 1958-59 i dtreo go mbeidh ar a gcumas fiacha áirithea atá orthu de bharr an laghdaithe i luach an deontais do laghdú agus cabhair <Col N="266" /> bhreise do thabhairt i leith costaisí a bhaineann le foilsiú leabhar áirithe gnáth litríochta i nGaeilge do no clubanna leabhar agus téacs leabhair áirithe do na meán-scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé de nós le tamall ag Gael-linn Gear-Scannáin Gaeilge do chur dá dtaispeáint ins na pictiúrlanna mar agaisín le Universal News.  Bhí ceann de na gearr-scannáin sin ar thaispeáint gach mí.  Thosnaigh Gael-linn ar scannáin bhreise do dhéanamh i dtreo go mbeadh ceann ar thaispeáint gach coichíos in ionad gach mí agus chuireadar an beartas sin i bhfeidhm le héifeacht ó Mhí Meán Fomhair 1958. Ar an iomlán chuireadar ocht gcinn de scannáin breise ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Is chun cabhrú le Gael-linn chun costas na scannáin breise sin do ghlanadh atá an t-airgead breise seo ag teastáil.  Tharla go bhfuil deireadh le Universal News anois ins na pictiúrlanna. Tá beartas eile i dtaobh gearr-scannáin Gaeilge fé bhreithniú idir Gael-linn agus lucht tairgthe scannáin do na pictiúrlanna.

      <P>On sub-head A (15), perhaps the Minister would tell us what is happening to these films that are to be reproduced from the originals now held in various places in England? Are we to have these films reproduced merely to store them over here somewhere? I should like to know of what type and dimensions they are and whether or not they will be available to commercial cinemas or to such places as those mentioned by the Minister in sub-head B (10).  I have not much idea of what type of films they are and perhaps the Minister could expand what he said and say if they will be available to large cinemas or to Connradh na Gaeilge, An Réalt and other Irish promoting societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not understand a word of it.  Under sub-head B (9), I understand that £3,250 is to go to Gael Linn for the production of films.  I think <Col N="268" /> it is only right that somebody should pay tribute to Gael Linn for the tremendous work they are doing.  It is very difficult for them to compete in a market in the atmosphere in which they are competing, the atmosphere of the modern cinema where top class films are shown with top class actors and commentators.  Gael Linn does its part for the Irish language in an excellent manner.  I suggest that if the Department of Education is taking further interest in Gael Linn, there should be some sort of explanatory note or preface to the films by, perhaps, the Minister for Education asking the public to listen and learn.</P>
      <P>Sometimes these Gael Linn films are subjected by some of the audience to derision.  In my opinion, that low criticism is disappearing, but I think if the films had encouragement by way of a short message from the Minister for Education, or the Minister for the Gaeltacht, they would be even more acceptable than at present.  I would gladly support any encouragement, particularly of a financial character, the Minister can give to Gael Linn or any other body seeking to promote the Irish language in the only way in which I think it can be promoted, through forms of amusement and entertainment.</P>
      <P>As far as the last item is concerned, I have no objection to the grant to the institution which I believe is situated in Cork City.  I am not at all jealous of Cork, but I should like the Minister to say whether or not the Department has funds at its disposal to aid similar institutions, although possibly not on the same big scale.  There are other societies and institutions all over the country promoting the Irish language through plays, films, lectures and ceilithe and other forms of amusement and I should like the Minister to say if grants, however small, can be made available to An Réalt in the different provincial towns where they operate. I do not want to subject the Minister to a barrage of applications, but it would be a good thing if there were some funds at the Minister's disposal by which to show even token encouragement of the excellent work done by the bodies which the Minister has just mentioned.</P>

I think it is a miserly sum to give Gael Linn and if I might couple Comhaltas Uladh with Gael Linn, they are doing more than the Department did over the past 25 years.  About 90 per cent. of the Deputies have been educated through Irish and should now be Irish speakers.  How many of us can speak Irish?  Students who have taken advantage of scholarships sponsored by those two bodies are now native speakers and not afraid to use the language.  They may not be Irish scholars, but they are certainly Irish speakers.  This is a niggardly sum.  I wish we could see the day when we could hand over the question of the Irish language to Gael Linn to concentrate on the spoken word and forget all about reading and writing Irish.  It is only when we reach that stage that we will have a real revival. I hope that the commission set up in connection with the Irish language will listen to the views of Gael Linn. £3,250 is a meagre sum when we can give £13,800 for the printing of books and such other matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Corish, the type of films which are in question here and which we desire to preserve are cinema films of Irish historical interest.  The intention is that we make copies of them and they are available, I understand, in the form of newsreels. Typical examples of these are the O'Donovan Rossa funeral with Pearse making the oration, the funeral of Thomas Ashe, the scenes of the Easter week fighting and the Treaty Debate meetings of Dáil Éireann.  As I indicated when I introduced the Supplementary Estimate, these are on a certain base which is no longer capable of preserving them.  We may have to make copies quickly of them on a more permanent base in order to have them preserved for posterity.</P>

      <P>It will not be possible to have copies made of them at all if we do not move now.  In regard to Gael Linn, I agree with what has been said by Deputy Corish and Deputy O'Donnell.  However, the sum granted in this instance, £3,250, was specifically requested by them.  As the House knows, for some time past, they have been adding <i>Amharc Éireann</i> to the Universal News feature and they were able to do that out of their own funds every month by arrangement with the Rank Organisation, and apparently the Rank Organisation has been very co-operative with them.  Gael Linn decided they could do it every fortnight, but they did not have the resources themselves to do it, but would require the extra sum of £3,250 to do it.  Unfortunately, after the grant had been sanctioned, but before the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate, Ranks put an end to Universal News in the cinemas. Gael Linn are now trying&mdash;and I am sure they will succeed&mdash;to produce some alternative means of presenting these films fortnightly on the screens.</P>
      <P>I do not think the suggestion of Deputy Corish is really necessary for the carrying out of this work.  On their merit, Gael Linn are good enough to command public attention and respect without any imprimatur from the Minister for Education.  I admire their initiative and think their success is really due to the initiative they have shown and the independence with which they can work.  By leaving them alone and giving them whatever assistance they desire from time to time, if it can be given, I believe they will do far better work for the language.</P>
      <P>In regard to the suggestion that due attention be given to Gael Linn in the commission which is studying the Irish language in general, that will be done; in fact, they are represented by their chairman on the commission and he is one of the most active men in Gael Linn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made both by Deputy Corish and Deputy O'Donnell referred <Col N="272" /> to the provision of £3,000 for Dun Laoi.  Dun Laoi was a project started some years ago in Cork.  The Gaeltacht organisation there had no adequate centre of activity and they bought an old house in the North Mall reasonably convenient to the centre of the city.  I forget exactly what they paid for it, but the total sum for acquisition and reconstruction amounted to £7,000. Much of the work done was voluntary, including the architect's work.  Most of the members themselves did the work of reconstruction.  Notwithstanding that, they found themselves unable to meet the full cost of £7,000.  They provided £4,000 from their own resources and as well as that the annual outlay amounted to £1,000, with the result that they were unable to make any provision to pay the balance of £3,000 that was due on the purchase and reconstruction of the premises.</P>
    <P>It was in order to meet that situation that we came to their assistance. There was grave danger that, having got so far, if they did not receive assistance from us, they might have had to abandon the house and all the activities that go with it.  This is not intended to be an annual grant by any means.  It is a capital sum.  Neither is it intended as a scheme whereby similar organisations in different parts of the country can feel themselves entitled to grants.  This was a special case, as I have indicated, and special provision was made to meet it.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £22,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for Grants to Universities and Colleges, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The provision in this Supplementary Estimate of a grant of £22,500 to University College, Dublin, towards the cost of adaptation of premises is necessary to enable the college to supply additional laboratory and lecturing space for students in the department of chemistry.  The number of students taking the degree in science has increased so much that there has been great overcrowding in the department of chemistry and it has been necessary to triplicate classes, involving a great strain on the necessarily small staff.  It was ascertained by the college authorities that some relief could be obtained without undue delay by effecting structural alterations within portion of the existing premises at Upper Merrion Street which would result in the provision of laboratory working space for 120 more students together with a lecture theatre to seat 120 students.  The Office of Public Works have been consulted in regard to the plans and it is felt that the adaptation of the premises in accordance with these plans will provide a solution to this urgent problem at a reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to the completion of the work, the work was planned in two stages, the first stage (lower floor) to be completed by the date of opening of the 1958-59 academic year and the second stage (upper floor) to be completed by early January, 1959.  The work was carried out accordingly and the second stage was completed early this year.</P>

      <P>When the Minister gets this, does he propose forthwith to make provisions for moneys to provide the accommodation recommended in these reports?  We are wobbling and hobbling over providing adequate accommodation for the National University of Ireland, for the last decade.  Why on earth someone does not take courage in hand and tell University College, Dublin, we will give them £500,000 a year for the next 20 years, in order to get the accommodation erected, I cannot imagine.  Everyone knows it must be done sooner or later and, so far as the experience of most of us goes, commissions and inquiries ultimately result in nothing being done.</P>
      <P>I think that at the present moment there are over 4,000 students in accommodation which was originally designed to accommodate 1,000 students, but of which only a quarter was ever built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Seán Ó Loingsigh Seán Ó Loingsigh">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the original plan designed to accommodate <Col N="275" /> 1,000, I do not think any more than a quarter was ever built and the rest of it consists of ruins at the back of Earlsfort Terrace.  There are now 4,000 in the schools there.  The College of Science was there, but by way of supplement we took half the College of Science and turned it into the Department of Agriculture and Government Buildings.</P>
      <P>It is almost unbelievable that, in this year 1959, University College, Dublin &mdash;one college of the National University of Ireland&mdash;should have 4,000 students, that is, over 4,000 seeking education, on premises which are merely adequate to cater for 250 to 300 students.  If we go on indefinitely appointing commissions and establishing inquiries, the end of it will be that nothing will be done.</P>
      <P>I believe that to-morrow one could say with perfect confidence, in respect of the Science School and the Engineering School, that whatever the report has to tell, it will certainly say that new accommodation is required for both of those.  It will take several years to complete such accommodation, from the date on which authorisation to proceed with it is given. Why on earth do we not take our courage in our hands and say that, pending the publication and consideration of the comprehensive report referred to by Deputy Mulcahy and the Minister, on the total problem of accommodation in all the colleges, <i>ad interim</i> we will tell University College, Dublin, to go on with the plans which are in existence for the provision of a Science School and an Engineering School?  If we do that, we will be getting somewhere and, in the meantime, the Government can hatch on the various reports which are being sent to them and can defer a final decision to a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who doubts that, over the next ten years, we shall have to spend some millions at least on providing decent accommodation for University College, Dublin?  I do not think there is.  If that is universally agreed, is there anybody in doubt that two parts of that new accommodation will consist of a <Col N="276" /> Science Faculty and an Engineering Faculty?  I do not think anyone will seriously challenge that.  Why do we not tell them to go on now, at least with these two buildings, and postpone the commencement of the other schools which are in contemplation until the Government have received and considered this report?  If the Minister did that, I would rather envy him his opportunity of doing it, because if it were done, his name would be indissolubly associated with a great new departure.  I would sooner wait for the fall of his Government that somebody&mdash;not personally, of course, but politically&mdash;more worthy would have the privilege; but I am prepared to forswear that advantage in the interests of University College, Dublin, if it would ginger the present Minister into doing what should have been done some time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The general discussion of this matter is more appropriate to the main Estimate when it comes before us, but there is something more involved in this than the mere supplying of the moneys required here now.  The provision of the accommodation which is the direct subject of this Estimate is an absolute and urgent necessity, from the mere administrative point of view of physically catering for the attendance of the students.  That problem is, perhaps, the one which forces the immediate issue.  Over and above that, however, there is a chronic problem, a serious problem, in all our University Colleges.  It arises out of modern developments, and it is the problem of maintaining the standard of schools in certain faculties, the problem of maintaining the standard of technical education and training given in technical faculties, and the standard of the degree which is awarded at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, the National University and the University of Dublin have been able to award degrees and maintain a standard of degrees which has been equal to&mdash;and, in some cases, perhaps, better than&mdash;degrees awarded elsewhere. Certainly, the standard in the Science and Engineering Faculties has been as high as anywhere in Ireland <Col N="277" /> or England.  As time goes on, it becomes more difficult to maintain that position, on account of the complexities of these subjects in modern times and the amount of equipment needed to do the courses properly.  That specialisation brings further complications, both in regard to teaching personnel and in regard to equipment, which make it more difficult.  Lastly, there are the research problems.</P>
    <P>All these faculties depend to some extent for their success on the availability of accommodation and the orderly arrangement of the courses of study.  Unless adequate facilities can be given, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain the standards which should be maintained in these faculties and which have been maintained heretofore.  A graduate of any of our universities can take his place at present with a graduate of any other university anywhere in the world in his own line.  Particularly where honours graduates are concerned, that situation has so far been satisfactory.  Now there is a dangerous threat and the accommodation problem is inextricably tied up with the safeguarding of ourselves against that danger.  On any showing, it would be sad and disastrous if there were any deterioration resulting from our having supplied insufficient facilities to the staffs.  I am quite confident the staff can do the job if they have the facilities.  That in itself should be sufficient to move us.</P>
    <P>There is another point which might appeal to a certain class of mind.  It is an equally strong argument and it is this.  Nowadays, the faculties of engineering and science are not only university faculties but they are also turning out members of certain professions. Engineering has long since been a profession and science is now ranking itself amongst the learned professions.  In these cases, university degrees are accepted as the qualification for practising, so to speak, and in the faculties of medicine, veterinary medicine, engineering and science, and all these faculties, it is very important that our degrees will be recognised abroad as professionally equal to the degrees of other universities.</P>

That very practical argument is another reason for spurring us on to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should say anything further about it on this Supplementary Estimate other than to advert to it.  This is a Supplementary Estimate for a particular purpose and there can be no question about it.  We should leave the matter generally for the debate which will occur very shortly on the Estimates as a whole and should adopt this Supplementary Estimate, but it would be a good thing, on the occasion of the main Estimate, to advert to this problem, which may be a serious one for all people interested in these particular faculties.</P>

      <P>The Government should change its tune to a certain extent.  I, for one, am not in agreement with them with regard to their apparent policy on this matter of university education in the specific respect dealt with in this Supplementary Estimate.  Would the Minister tell us if the Government have any intention of decentralising certain faculties to a certain extent?  We know that at present a large percentage of the students in University College, Dublin, come from rural Ireland.  The cost of accommodation in Dublin is very high.</P>

      <P>I was about to come to that.  If the Government insist on building a new engineering school or a new college of science in Dublin, <Col N="279" /> that is a departure from their avowed policy of decentralisation.  Is this policy of decentralisation purely lip-service? The inevitable result of erecting university buildings in Dublin is an increase in the number of students at University College, Dublin, making Dublin more top-heavy than it is at present.  I do not say that the cost of accommodation in Limerick City or in Deputy Corish's city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Dublin is the most expensive place in Ireland in which to live at the present time.  That will not be contradicted. The Government would be doing a good day's work in bringing these faculties to Limerick or Waterford or in extending University College, Galway.  At one time the Engineering School in University College, Galway, was regarded as the best in the British Isles and Ireland.  I do not know what its standard is now.

      <P>That is right, Sir.  I have made my point.  It would be more fitting to concentrate on the existing university colleges, such as Cork or, preferably, Galway or to start a new building in Limerick.  If the position at present obtaining in U.C.D. is allowed to continue, it will become a more glorified technical school than it is already.

Will it be a complete university college in the sense that it will have a faculty in every subject?  If that is so, are we wise in spending money now on the erection of other new university buildings?  I should like an assurance from the Minister that there will be no wastage and that there will not be a surplus of buildings when the new building is eventually erected.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall confine my remarks to two points.  I shall deal now with the last point made by Deputy Coburn.  No new buildings are in contemplation.  The work for which this money is being provided has already been carried out. In the College of Science, there was one part of the building which had a very high roof.  By reason of the overcrowding, it was sought to procure some alternative accommodation.  The best way of providing that was the provision of a new floor in that particular part of the building.  It accommodates <Col N="281" /> 120 extra students, giving them laboratory space and lecture theatre space. There is little doubt that that expenditure is being put to good use and there is no question whatever of money being thrown down the drain, so to speak.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Dillon said, there are two major considerations which would render his suggestion, for the moment, at least, not quite practicable.  As Deputy Dillon and the House know, the authorities of U.C.D. have land at Belfield to which they added some considerable extensions in recent years.  They contemplated building a new college out there.  The major consideration then arose as to whether it was necessary to build a new college out there or whether it was possible to expand, within the limits of their possessions at Earlsfort Terrace or with what acquisitions they might be able to procure in that vicinity. That was the first question to be considered and the major question with which the commission were faced.  I have not adverted to the report because I am still awaiting the report on University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>The second consideration, then, was what some Deputies here have expressed concern about, that is, the centralisation of all faculties in Dublin or the making of Dublin so much more attractive than the other two colleges. It was decided to submit, also, to the commission the question of the needs of these other two colleges.</P>
    <P>For these two reasons&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Dillon would agree&mdash;it was not practicable, therefore, to offer Dublin a sum in a particular year&mdash; this year and next year&mdash;so as to go ahead with whatever extensions they wanted, because it would first have to be decided whether it would be better to build in Belfield or to try to expand on what they have in Earlsfort Terrace and what they could acquire.  Therefore, until that question was resolved, it was impossible to permit them to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I expect the final point of the report to be presented in a matter of weeks. It will then have to be presented to the Government who will examine it and make up their minds and come <Col N="282" /> to the House to procure sanction, ultimately, for the very heavy capital outlay&mdash;several millions&mdash;which will be involved and which will have to be spread over a long term of years, not because of economy but because of the physical difficulties that would be met in the provision of these extra buildings and the extra accommodation, not only in Dublin, but in Cork and Galway as well.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £177,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund (No. 14 of 1950 and No. 11 of 1952).</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is concerned with the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  As Deputies are aware, the Exchequer, under Section 39 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, makes good, through sub-head A of the Social Insurance Vote, the amount by which the expenditure of the fund exceeds its income in any year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of this deficit for 1958-59 was originally estimated at <Col N="283" /> £4,213,000.  It is now estimated at £4,390,000 and the Exchequer must, therefore, provide the extra £177,000 to balance the expenditure and income of the fund for 1958-59.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £177,000 required is attributable, as to £102,000, to an estimated short-fall in the income of the fund in the current year from employment contributions payable by insured persons and their employers. The original Estimate for this income was £5,886,000.  It is now estimated that the income will be £5,784,000, a variation of less than 2 per cent.  The actual income from contributions in the first six months of the previous financial year.  In recent months, however, this tendency has been reversed and income is now running somewhat above the 1957-58 level.</P>
    <P>A sum of £44,000 is required because the amount drawn from the Exchequer during the year ended 31st March, 1958, was that much less than the deficit, approximately £4,531,000, which emerged when the actual figures of expenditure and income became available after the close of that year.</P>
    <P>The balance of the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;£31,000&mdash;is the net deficit resulting from a number of small variations, up and down, in other items of expenditure and income of the Social Insurance Fund.  The sum includes provision for heavier expenditure on disability benefit arising from the present influenza epidemic.  No provision was made in the original Estimate for epidemic illness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>This, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, may seem a harmless sort of Supplementary Estimate, despite the fact that the sum asked for is £177,000.  The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate demonstrates the trend in employment or, if you like, unemployment. It seems to me that the forecasts of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, and the anticipation of the Government and their promises with regard to unemployment, <Col N="284" /> have not materialised.  The Minister for Finance, I am sure, approved of this Supplementary Estimate two, three or four weeks ago. It seems strange that he should, a little over a week ago, announce that there was a big reduction in unemployment in the country.  The indication contained in this Supplementary Estimate is that there is no material improvement in the unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary introduced the main Estimate for this year. He was slightly optimistic with regard to unemployment.  As reported at column 106 of the Official Report of 13th May, 1958, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State subvention to the Social Insurance Fund of £4,213,000 for 1958-59 is £274,000 lower than the corresponding provision for 1957-58.  This is mainly due to an anticipated decrease of £190,000 in benefit expenditure and to an anticipated increase of £100,000 in contribution income.  The main variations giving raise to the net decrease of £190,000 in benefit expenditure are reductions of £150,000 and £117,000 in unemployment benefit and disability benefit respectively, offset by an increase of £69,000 in the provision for widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both the reduction in the provision for unemployment benefit and the increase in the provision for contribution income are based on the expectation of an improved employment situation in 1958-1959.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that it is necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary to come here and ask for a sum very similar to that by which he cut the Estimate last year, surely at this stage he should say to the House: &ldquo;What we anticipated in respect of employment has not materialised.&rdquo;  Over and above all that, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Social Welfare should be honest enough to come in here and say: &ldquo;We did not carry out the promises we made with <Col N="285" /> regard to a reduction in unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that many of the Fianna Fáil speakers have no regard whatever for figures, for figures of unemployment and figures of expenditure on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  That is evidenced by the fact that Deputy Haughey appeared in the House yesterday and, in reply to certain allegations by a member of the Fine Gael Party, blandly told us that the people in the City of Dublin&mdash;and I expect this is a slight exaggeration&mdash; are 50 times better off than they were two years ago.  How can Deputy Haughey, or any spokesman of the Government, or the Minister for Finance, who says unemployment has been substantially reduced, reconcile their views, as expressed here and in the public Press, with the fact that at present we still have&mdash;I have not got the figure for this week&mdash;approximately 84,000 people unemployed, and a substantial number of those in receipt of unemployment benefit?</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, we have emigration, which the Taoiseach says is not easy to estimate, and some tens of thousands of people have emigrated since 1st April, 1958.  That too, has relieved the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund to the extent of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of pounds.  Therefore, it is dishonest for any spokesman of the Government to try to tell this House, and the people at public meetings, and through their three national newspapers, that unemployment is on the decrease.  The fact is that it is not.  Of course, if intending emigrants who contemplate going to Britain to look for work were to read the <i>Sunday Press</i> every Sunday and read about the dozens of mythical factories that have been established, or are to be established they would never think of leaving this country.</P>
    <P>Apart from the dishonesty of speakers of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is dishonest of the <i>Irish Press</i>, controlled by the Government Party, to try to fool the people into the belief that there is work here, or that there are to be a substantial number of factories established to give much <Col N="286" /> needed employment.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced this Estimate is an admission by the Government that they have made no improvement as far as the employment situation is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is an admission by the Government that the promises which they made prior to the last election, and the promises they made on assuming office, have not materialised.  There is nothing but talk of factories and promises of factories.  The people have been subjected to plans and promises of plans, but the plain fact is that there are still 83,000 or 84,000 people unemployed and it does not seem that, within the near future, that figure will be curtailed to any substantial degree.  As a matter of fact, the Parliamentary Secretary and members of this House know that as far as employment is concerned in road making, in bog development, in drainage and in house building, it is diminishing, and diminishing rapidly, and that has been mainly brought about by the actions of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the situation would have been if there had not been emigration.  Nobody will allege that I condone emigration, but if the 40,000 or 50,000 people who are alleged to have emigrated in 1958 were here and had been paid either out of the Social Assistance Fund, or the Social Insurance Fund, the Supplementary Estimate which the Parliamentary Secretary would have to bring in here would be of considerable dimensions.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us also what effect there has been on the Social Insurance Fund by the raising of the ceiling for insurable employment from £600 to £800 per year in respect of certain workers deemed not to be engaged in manual work.  That, too, mark you, must be added to this figure of £177,000 because that is an income that was not anticipated when the Parliamentary Secretary introduced the Estimate in 1958 or, if it was anticipated, it was never mentioned when the Estimate was being introduced.  The Social Insurance Fund, therefore, has been relieved to the extent of, I suppose, £30,000 or <Col N="287" /> £40,000 by reason of the raising of the ceiling for insurable employment in respect of non-manual workers from £600 to £800 per year.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Estimate seems to be a repudiation of the allegation that unemployment has been reduced and it is certainly a repudiation, and a strong repudiation, of the allegation by the Minister for Finance, a little over a week ago, that unemployment had been substantially reduced during the régime of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>That may be so.  I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that there is considerable delay in paying those applicants the unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit to which they are entitled. Since 1st January, I have written to the Department of Social Welfare on 24 occasions for 24 different applicants for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  Their applications have been held up for some considerable time and no money has been paid to them.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, the Parliamentary Secretary made a statement that 50 per cent. of the applicants for unemployment assistance were receiving the amounts they were receiving under false pretences.  That may be the cause of the delay now in paying out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will root it out for the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would appeal to him not to victimise these unfortunate people by holding up the amounts due to them.  Pay out the money due to them.  I would make particular reference to the money due under the reciprocal arrangement entered into by Deputy Norton, when Minister, with the British Government. <Col N="289" /> Prior to 1950, contributions paid by Irish workers in Great Britain were absolutely useless to them for the purpose of drawing unemployment benefit.  As a result of that very fine agreement by Deputy Norton with Britain, now they may draw certain benefits in this country for contributions they paid while working across the water.  These people contributed towards the fund and they should be entitled to the benefit of it.  There should be no delay in paying it, but there is a dragging of feet, with the result that in some cases the applicants have actually gone back to Britain without the money being paid.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up investigations and pay out whatever money is due to applicants.  I beg of him to stop this reinvestigation of means.  We all know that the cost of living has gone up and the means of the individual should now come down instead of being increased.  I would ask him to give us some reason, if not now, then on the principal Estimate, why this reinvestigation of means is carried out. It is like the poor law valuations.  The Government are afraid to introduce a Bill here at this time, but they have inspectors around the country increasing poor law valuations all over the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the Departments, I am sure the House fully expected that this would be the last Department which would come in here with a Supplementary Estimate.  The reason for it is that last year the Parliamentary Secretary intimated that the Government was so full of confidence in relation to the future that they could present a reduced Estimate.  Now he comes in to-day and eats humble pie. The anticipation of the Government has not been realised.  This money is not intended to improve the lot of any recipient because of the increase in the cost of living, but it is intended to cater for people whom the Government thought would not really make a demand on the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an indictment of the Government's failure to improve the employment situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that £102,000 of <Col N="290" /> the £177,000 Supplementary Estimate is occasioned by a short-fall in contributions. There is tangible evidence that the Minister for Finance, when he was speaking a week or two ago, was completely erroneous when he claimed there was a dramatic improvement in the unemployment situation. Here is the positive evidence that far from there being the anticipated improvement, the existing situation requires that the Government should supplement the fund by the sum of £177,000.</P>
    <P>Many reasons can be put forward for the Government's failure to bring about an employment situation in the country where the fund would not have to meet this charge upon it.  It is true that following on the round of wage increases, which again was sparked off by the Government's financial policy in withdrawing the food subsidies, a number of industrial companies, unable, because of price competition in the goods they were distributing, to recoup themselves by increasing the prices of the goods they were producing, succeeded in recouping themselves by actually reducing their staffs. They laid off four, five and six here and there, and in some cases even a dozen.  In consequence people who were in what they thought was sure employment found that they had to queue up to draw social insurance.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary intimated also that he expects a heavier withdrawal, due to the incidence of 'flu.  This, he expects, will only account for a very small part of the Supplementary Estimate.  I may say to him that this is one of the occasions which will assist in bringing the Government to a realisation of the difficulties that exist in the country. The Government are not helping the situation when in the newspapers owned by the Taoiseach, particularly the <i>Sunday Press</i>, the most extraordinary hopes are held out to the people of the good that will flow from governmental action.  We saw recently that 300 people were to be employed in the town of Bandon in Deputy MacCarthy's constituency in a jewellery factory.  That has been exploded for all time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is occasioned by a short-fall in the contributions and by the fact that the view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary introducing the Estimate last year has not been realised. The Government expressed the opinion that the situation would be such in the 12 months now under review in this Supplementary Estimate that there would not be any need for a charge on it comparable with that of the previous year We find that far from these hopes being realised, there is this considerable short-fall in what the Government anticipated would accrue to the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann <Col N="292" /> Comhairle, I propose to take questions numbered 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt recall that when speaking on the Vote for my Department last year I adverted to the difficult situation which had developed in relation to the Hospitals Trust Fund and to the fact that as a consequence I had no choice but to defer, as a temporary measure, the undertaking of new building works apart from essential works costing comparatively small amounts.</P>
      <P>The three major projects mentioned in the questions were included in the hospital building programme drawn up some years ago.  The intention was that these projects would be financed, together with many other schemes included in the programme, from the accumulated reserves in the Hospitals Trust Fund and subsequent annual income from sweepstake sources.  Owing to the heavy cost of earlier schemes undertaken under the programme and to the substantial increase in the payments which had to be made on foot of the deficits of the voluntary hospitals, recourse had to be had to Grants-in-Aid from the Exchequer to maintain the solvency of the fund and to ensure that accruing commitments were met.  The Deputy is aware of the reasons why the Exchequer grants had to be reduced in 1956 and discontinued subsequently. As a result, it became necessary, as I have just stated, to postpone the undertaking of further building works, in particular those of a major character.  I also decided that, before any large scale building activities could be resumed, a reserve should be accumulated in the fund to ensure that any commitments entered into could be discharged if any untoward developments affecting the income from the sweepstakes should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate at which an adequate reserve can be built up in the fund depends on many factors and, consequently, it is difficult to forecast when the major projects specified by the Deputy can be undertaken or to decide in what order of priority they will proceed.  Another factor which I have to bear in mind is that any one of the <Col N="293" /> major projects would absorb a large proportion of available funds and thus militate against the undertaking of other smaller but essential works.</P>
    <P>Whilst the position of the fund is improving, I am not able to say definitely when it will be possible to allow the projects mentioned by the Deputy to proceed.  I have the matter under constant review, however, and I shall convey my decision at the earliest possible date to the appropriate authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state whether or not it is a fact that in the recent National Loan £1,250,000 of Hospitals Trust Funds was invested?  If that is correct, would the Minister not agree that such a sum would have been sufficient to finance the building of the new St. Vincent's Hospital which was due to commence in the month of February, 1958, and in respect of which the site development has been completed and all arrangements made for the commencement of the actual building?</P>

      <P>I am perfectly in order, and it is not for the Minister so to decide.  This is a supplementary question.  Further arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not correct that the yearly income of the Hospitals Trust Fund is now running at the rate of £2,500,000?  Would the Minister explain why, with such an income and with an accumulated reserve of over £1,000,000, he has not proceeded with the building programme which was available to him when he took office and which would help now to relieve <Col N="294" /> the serious unemployment problem in the city at the moment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was referring to the fact that it is somewhat surprising that this Department should require a Supplementary Estimate.  The Parliamentary Secretary who is responsible for this section of the Department was vociferous throughout the country not so long ago in declaring that, in his opinion, there existed many gross abuses in the administration of social assistance and social insurance and that he was actively engaged in eliminating <Col N="301" /> the abuses under his jurisdiction. If that were a fact, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have had sufficient time to attend to the abuses which they allege exist, and a sum of money would be saved, which would more than meet the charge which the Parliamentary Secretary now states is necessary.  It is in those circumstances that we agree with the Estimate, but we emphasise that it is one of the measures which reflect the inadequacy of the Government in carrying out their expressed beliefs, and their expressed promises, that they would resolve these problems, that were so recently expressed by the Minister for Finance when he claimed that, in fact, considerable advances had been made in resolving these difficulties.</P>
      <P>If that were true, there would be no need for this Supplementary Estimate. If what a Dublin Deputy told us here yesterday is true or even partially true, that the people in the suburbs of Dublin, the workers in the suburbs such as Crumlin, Finglas and Ballyfermot, are 50 times better off than they were two years ago, surely there would not be a short-fall in the contributions. The sooner the Party in office get together and the sooner the Deputies who realise the situation in the country advise the members of the Government, and advise them in time, the sooner it will be unnecessary for this House to pass such a Supplementary Estimate as this.</P>
      <P>It is in that atmosphere that we are examining it and it shows quite clearly that far from resolving the difficulties the Government undertook to resolve with such alacrity on their assumption of office, when they assured the wives that their husbands would be put back to work within such a short period, far from an improvement having been secured, the Government are now in the situation that what they estimated for 12 months ago is insufficient to meet the charge.  It is in these circumstances that the House is examining this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is a clear admission of failure on the part of the Government <Col N="302" /> to implement their promises to provide employment.  The Social Welfare Estimate was cut by £100,000 last year because it was expected to get that amount by way of extra contribution from people in employment. That happy frame of mind, no doubt, was instilled in the members of the Government when they were encouraged by the results of the Sweetman policy, which came into effect in 1957, and remedied the financial position in this country.  The financial position improved to such an extent in 1957 that, early in 1958, the Social Welfare Estimate was cut by that amount in anticipation of extra work being provided, thereby increasing the number of contributors.  Not alone did the Government not get that £100,000 from those whom they expected to get employment, but, in fact, they now find they require £102,000 under this sub-head.  It is just another example of the Government fiddling the 1958 Budget instead of facing up to the facts.</P>
      <P>When we come to examine on what grounds did they expect extra employment to be provided, and examine what has been the Government's performance in the past 12 months, we find that we were told during the debate this morning on the Imposition of Duties Bill, 1958, that there were six new factories provided during that period.  Just look at what those factories were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position, but I shall not continue on that point. We have just found out that there were six little factories provided, but every week we read in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of the wonderful plans which the Government have and of the wonderful future facing the people, but nothing seems to happen.  Here we have a situation in which contributions in the form of insurance stamps total £102,000 less than was expected&mdash;£2,000 more than the cut made in the Estimate last year.</P>
      <P>We had a statement from a prominent citizen in Ballyfermot to the effect that there are 700 destitute, hungry families there.  No doubt the fall in the contributions can be explained by all those families in Ballyfermot who cannot get a day's work and, therefore, will not contribute to the Social Insurance Fund.  Nearly 20,000 people are unemployed in the City of Dublin.  It is a record figure and no contributions are coming from them.  We had a heading: &ldquo;Drogheda&mdash;1,000 people unemployed.&rdquo;  We had a heading from Navan: &ldquo;Record number of people unemployed&mdash;a protest meeting to be held.&rdquo;  That is the situation all over the country, and it is no wonder that the contributions have fallen to the extent of £102,000 during the past 12 months.  Over 84,000 people are unemployed and here, in Dublin City, there are 7,000 young people ready and willing to work, if they could get work. They cannot get one day's work in the city, and this is the Government which offered full employment, an improvement of their conditions and an end to emigration, to the people.  Here we have a situation where they have to admit failure themselves by asking this House to pass an Estimate to put into the Fund money which the Government expected would be subscribed by thousands of people to whom they promised employment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary this question: <Col N="304" /> are we to infer from the note on the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;which says that this £177,000 represents &ldquo;additional provision required to meet the amount by which the income of the Social Insurance Fund is less than its expenditure (No. 11 of 1952 (sec. 39))&mdash;that there are fewer people in employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me it does mean that because there are fewer people stamping cards, fewer people are contributing to the fund than was anticipated.  Is that not so?  I want to direct the attention of the House to the conclusions that flow from that, if that be a fact.  We are told there are fewer persons registered as unemployed in the weekly returns, but, if at the same time there are fewer people stamping cards, what has happened to the people?  They vanished somewhere. Are we to infer from this that the people who failed to get work have simply left the country?  There are fewer unemployed registered; there are fewer people stamping cards.  Where have they gone?</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he is closing his eyes to the manifest evidence that is before him.  What is happening is that these people are clearing out of the country, and that explains the figure which the British Minister of Labour gave to the House of Commons, that there are 50,000 entrants into the Social Insurance Fund in Great Britain of persons born in Ireland, and entering social insurance for the first time in the year 1958.  It is their presence in England which explains the absence of their contributions which makes this Vote of £177,000 necessary.  If that is true, it is a sad commentry on a Government which secured election by plastering this country with posters saying: &ldquo;Women, vote Fianna Fáil and get jobs for your husbands.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I had better reply to Deputy Corish first, because he contributed to the debate after I introduced the Supplementary Estimate. We are twitted with underestimation, but, in the financial period <Col N="305" /> 1957-58, we had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate of £872,000 on social insurance and, in dealing with a fund in which the expenditure is £10,500,000 and the receipts are in the proximity of £7,000,000, the sum involved here is about 1 per cent. of the whole.  That sum is broken up into an estimated balance of £44,000 of Exchequer grant due to the fund at the commencement of the current year in respect of deficits up to date, and a number of small variations which I explained at the end of my statement, which come under sickness benefit.  For instance, with regard to the flu epidemic, my information from the Department is that in the past couple of weeks new claims have increased by about 1,000 a week.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the delay in payment of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits. We are merely dealing with benefits here, and our anxiety is to facilitate the payment of benefits as quickly as possible.  Very often, the claimants do not facilitate us as they should, but if we can direct the Department to help out the claims, we do it.</P>

      <P>That is a very debatable point.  I suggest that automation and machinery have something to do with the lower sale of insurance stamps.  In the case of roads, for instance, local authorities are buying graders and all sorts of machinery for the roads.  The amount of continuous employment for the individual in that sphere is less.  The amount of stamps sold over the 12-month period is less than it would be three or four years ago because of that.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the making of roads, but there is automation <Col N="306" /> in other spheres of work also decreasing the number of working weeks in which certain people are employed.  If we examine the whole problem in that way, the case Deputy Dillon is trying to make, I think, falls to the ground. There has been a decrease in registered unemployed since 1957.  In the month of February, 1957, the figure was 93,000; in 1958, it was 84,000 and in the present year, 81,000.</P>
      <P>There is another factor which relates to what I have said and Deputy Dillon is well aware of it. About Christmas, I was in part of my constituency and I was told that the number of agricultural workers in continuous employment was much less than it was a few years ago, because of tractors and other machinery known to Deputies.  Continuous work for 52 weeks was not available while the workers got maximum employment, say, from April until the end of October when work ceased for them.  That is another factor in the sale of insurance stamps.</P>
      <P>I admitted in my statement that there was a decrease in the first half of the year in the sale of these stamps, but the sale is now on the up-grade according to figures up to the end of the year, which have not yet been verified and which we have secured only tentatively for the month of January this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish or some other Deputy referred to the increased income to the fund because of the raising of the salary limit from £600 to £800.  That did not become operative until the 29th December, 1958.  We shall not know the effect of it for a while and we can only give an estimate. An outside estimate is £20,000. As Deputies know, employers do not pay weekly but periodically.  That is a very small sum in relation to this and we could not take it very much into account when preparing this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan tried to draw me about abuses of the Act.  I think it was Deputy O'Donnell who alleged that I said that there was 50 per cent. abuse.  I did not make that allegation, but when I came into office, I found a vigilant Department had been <Col N="307" /> alerted by my predecessor about abuses.  I followed in his footsteps and I think nobody will stand over any individual buying 13 stamps and drawing £80 from the Exchequer without working or anything else. That is the abuse my predecessor attempted to stamp out and we are following his footsteps and we make no apology for doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £2,220,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Most of the sum required is accounted for by three items: losses on disposal of wheat and payments to wheat growers, £1,160,000; subsidies on dairy produce, £625,000; and fertiliser subsidy, £500,000.</P>
      <P>The payments on wheat are required to meet (a) the balance of the losses on the disposal of the 1957 crop, (b) portion of the sum needed to make the special payments to growers of wheat in 1958, and (c) portion of the losses incurred in the disposal of wheat of the 1958 crop purchased by An Bord Gráin.</P>
      <P>The losses on the disposal of the 1957 wheat crop were greater than estimated, largely because the quantity of wheat to be disposed of was higher than originally estimated.  This arose from the sharp decline in flour production in 1958.  The amount required under this heading is £610,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The handling of the 1958 crop presented great difficulty, and, as already announced, it is proposed to make a special additional payment to growers of wheat in 1958.  The total cost of these payments is estimated at <Col N="308" /> £420,000, of which provision is being made for £300,000 during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The balance of £250,000 is required to meet portion of the loss incurred in the disposal of wheat of the 1958 crop by An Bord Gráin.  In this regard, I may say that the board will have to dispose of over 200,000 tons of wheat at an average loss of up to £6 a ton. After taking into account the receipts from the customs duty on wheat and the wheat levy, it is estimated that the net Exchequer commitment in respect of the 1958 wheat crop will be about £520,000.</P>
    <P>As regards subsidies on dairy produce, the provision under this heading is always difficult to estimate accurately, as so much depends on such variable items as the quantity of butter likely to be available for export and the prices obtainable on the export market.  The net outcome is that a further £625,000 is required during the current financial year to meet the losses of the Butter Marketing Committee.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that total exports in the year ending 31st March, 1959, will amount to about 238,600 cwt., of which 203,500 cwt. were produced in the 1958 season.  The total losses to be met during the current financial year are estimated at £2,674,200 of which £2,025,000 will be met by the Exchequer and £649,200 out of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund from levies collected from creameries on the sale of butter.  There is, of course, a certain amount of overlapping in regard to payments.  This year, for instance, the Exchequer will bear the full loss on all butter produced in the 1957 season and exported after 31st March, 1958, while some of the payments on exports of butter produced in the 1958 season will not be recouped until the 1959-60 financial year.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser subsidy is an entirely new service which has been introduced in accordance with the policy announced in the White Paper.  A substantial subsidy is being paid to enable the price of single superphosphate (8 per cent. phosphorus) to be cut by £4 a ton, with corresponding reductions <Col N="309" /> in the prices of other grades of superphosphate and of other phosphatic fertilisers.  Phosphates are now cheaper in this country than in most other countries, and we are hoping for a very big increase in the use of this essential fertiliser, particularly on grassland. The annual amount of the subsidy is estimated at about £1,750,000.</P>
    <P>More money is also needed for the ground limestone subsidy.  The original estimate assumed that the reduction in the rate of subsidy by approximately one-third, or about 4/- a ton, would come into effect very early in the financial year, whereas, in fact, it was decided to apply the reduction only from the 1st June, 1958, that is, after the peak period for deliveries had passed.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required under sub-head F. (7) includes £25,000 towards clearing the indebtedness of the Faculty of General Agriculture of U.C.D. on capital account.  This indebtedness was incurred owing to the necessity of providing additional accommodation and equipment to cope with the increased numbers of students. £2,000 is included for the establishment of a Professorship of Forestry.</P>
    <P>The sum required under sub-head N. (1)&mdash;Diseases of Animals Acts&mdash;is mainly for swine fever compensation.  I am glad to say that we have had no outbreak of this disease since last May, and it has, therefore, been possible to relax the restrictions that have been in force for some years.  The total amount paid in compensation from the time of the first outbreak is £140,000.</P>
    <P>The additional provision under sub-head M. (1) is for customs duty on the import of a mobile clinic which was recently donated to the Blue Cross for use in Ireland.  The donation covered the cost of the clinic but not the duty. As the duty is a revenue one it was not feasible to remit it, and it was, therefore, arranged that the duty would be paid by my Department.  I may say that this mobile clinic is the most up-to-date vehicle of the kind in Britain or Ireland and will enable much good to be done for injured or distressed animals.  It will also have a considerable educational value.</P>
    <P>More money is required under sub-head <Col N="310" /> O. (6) (Grain Storage (Loans) Act) because a loan that was provided for in 1957-58 could not be issued during that year owning to delay in completion of legal formalities.</P>
    <P>The farm buildings and water supplies scheme (sub-head M. (6) is costing somewhat more than was estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will have noted the extraordinary terms in which the Minister for Agriculture has referred to the loss on the disposal of the 1957 crop.  He almost ceased to be articulate at all when he was reading out that paragraph from his brief.  The plain truth is that the Minister, in a moment of genius, shipped out of this country a very large quantity of good, millable wheat of the 1957 crop which he sold abroad, so far as I know, at £1 a barrel, and then found himself in the 1958 cereal year with virtually no Irish millable wheat at all.</P>
      <P>There is not a single barrel of that wheat of the 1957 crop that need have been exported or a 1/- that needed to have been lost.  I remember very well the Minister romping in here to announce that during the administration of the late Senator Moylan in that Department, nothing had been done to deal with this surplus problem, that he was a great man for taking decisions and he had taken a decision on the subject: ship it all abroad.  It was not a very well chosen decision, but it is done now and we have to pay for it.  The remainder of the money under this sub-head, a substantial sum, represents the operations that have been carried on in respect of the 1958 wheat crop.  I am told now by the Minister and others of his colleagues that it is the millers now who are to determine the millability of Irish wheat.  I can assure the House that if that is to be the criterion for the future, there will be a lot of unmillable wheat knocking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been quite unable to follow what took place in the dealings and counter dealings whereby the 1958 crop has been disposed of.  I know that very little of it has been converted into flour.  I know also&mdash;and <Col N="311" /> there are few facts about this whole transaction which one can ascertain with certainty&mdash;that there has been no surplus of millable wheat to export. That is certain; yet we put a levy of 5/9 per barrel on wheat last year to create a fund out of which losses on the export of surplus millable wheat were to be recouped.  There were no exports of surplus millable wheat and, in those circumstances, it seems to me a reasonable proposition that the 5/9 levy which was made on wheat should be returned to those from whom it was taken, because the event in contemplation of which the levy was made never transpired.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, some other device has been operated to return a part of that levy to the farmers from whom it was collected.  I think that is wrong and unjust.  If an agreement is made with a body of citizens of this State to which the Government is one of the parties, that agreement ought to be observed.  You can fool them or trick them out of what they are entitled to, and if you are a strong Government with a docile Party behind you who are prepared to go into the Lobby to support you in doing that, it is physically possible to do it; but that does not make it desirable. Hereafter, anyone who puts his hand to an agreement with the Government has notice that if subsequently the Government elects unilaterally to change the agreement, that may be done and that possibly will make it much more difficult to get the kind of collaboration the Department of Agriculture ought to have available to it and without which the work of the Department of Agriculture becomes very much more difficult.  However, it is one of the fruits of strong government that the rights of relatively small minorities fall by the wayside, particularly when they are represented in this House by a Deputy like Deputy Moher or Deputy Corry.</P>

      <P>We were talking about wheat.  I often wonder if the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;who made such valiant promises about the 84/-which they pledged themselves to secure&mdash;feel free to tell the truth now to the wheat growers, who trusted them and who not only did not get 84/-a barrel for their wheat, but saw a levy of 5/9 collected from them and, when the event for which it was collected failed to transpire, were refused the justice of getting a refund.  I wonder if any of those Deputies who gave those promises to their own constituents, will get up and say in Dáil Éireann what they were wont to say so eloquently at the crossroads in their own constituencies.  Or have they become so utterly depraved that they are prepared to suffer in silence the utter repudiation which they have experienced at the hands of the Minister who constitutes part of the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; Government which we at present have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the butter subsidy. I think the price of butter is improving in the world market and that it probably will continue to improve. There arises one feature, Sir, in regard to that, on which I think the Minister might give us further and better information.  There is a sum of £2,000,000 required for subsidies on dairy produce in this year.  We had a very bad hay season last year.  There has been an exceptional outbreak of fluke, not only in sheep but in cattle as well; and I apprehend that the production of butter next year will be materially reduced.  It may well be that there will be a relatively small charge to be met by the Exchequer in respect of butter subsidy, when one considers the probability of reduced supplies and of improving prices on the British market.  In those circumstances, <Col N="313" /> I wonder if it is possible to consider providing some inducement to our creamery farmers voluntarily to co-operate in the elimination of bovine tuberculosis, by offering them some extra payment for milk delivered to the creamery where they voluntarily eliminate T.B. reactors from their herds.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether sure, Sir, owing to the limited nature of the sub-heads that we can pursue this exhaustively on this Supplementary Estimate.  I merely suggest to the Minister that, between now and the time of the main Estimate, he may give consideration to that possibility.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the fertiliser subsidy.  I think the Minister made a ghastly mistake in reducing the lime subsidy by 4/- a ton as he did.  There is no fertiliser more urgently needed in this country than lime.  It is all produced from Irish raw material, by Irish labour.  It involves no imports at all.  If there ever was a case when it was desirable to promote the maximum possible user of a commodity, it is the case of ground limestone. It means simply bringing men, machinery and raw materials together, to provide a substance which greatly improves the fundamental national wealth of the country, which is the land.  I would suggest to the Minister that, instead of persisting in his policy of reducing the limestone subsidy, he should restore it.  In my judgment, the application of lime to the land of Ireland is just as important as the application of phosphates, and it has the additional advantage that its raw material is here in abundance, whereas all our phosphates have to be imported.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention. I think he makes a mistake in trying to pursue with mathematical precision the various percentages of phosphatic fertilisers.  He has prescribed a subsidy for basic slag, based on the percentage of phosphates contained in the slag.  Slag comes in with 18, 19, 20, 21 and up to 24 per cent. phosphates; but one cannot find out what the phosphate content of the slag is until it has been delivered.  Therefore, there <Col N="314" /> is slag selling in different places at the present time with different rates of subsidy attaching to it.  The difference is trivial.  It amounts to only a few pence per cwt., but it must involve a good deal of administrative expense in order to maintain this mathematical calculation of the subsidy as between one variety of slag and another.  It would be far better if the Minister simply prescribed a rate of 3/- or 4/-per cwt. for the slag and left it at that. The end result would be just the same but a great deal of unnecessary confusion would be avoided.</P>
    <P>The subsidisation of phosphatic manures is a good thing and I echo the Minister's hope, now that phosphatic fertilisers are as cheap in this country to the farmer as they are in any country in the world, that very greatly increased quantities will be used.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the quantity of potash used in this country is far too small, but the optimum quantity which it is necessary to use is relatively small compared with the optimum quantities of phosphate or lime that are used.  A very modest appropriation to subsidise potash would result in substantially increased quantities of this fertiliser being put out.  If we could feel that sufficient quantities of lime, phosphate and potash were being put out on the land, we might reasonably anticipate within the foreseeable future the elevation of the mineral content of the soil to the proper level and the Minister might well consider including potash in the fertiliser subsidy as well as phosphates.</P>
    <P>I know that it is generally anticipated that whenever the Minister for Agriculture brings an Estimate before this House, he may expect to start a row.  I do not particularly want to start a row on this Estimate.  I do not want to underestimate the problems with which a Minister for Agriculture perennially has to grapple.  I do not want to suggest that any Minister for Agriculture confronted with the situation which arose out of the catastrophic wheat harvest last year could have disposed of it without considerable difficulty, but I think the Minister's belief in his own exceptional <Col N="315" /> capacity for arriving at whole flocks of decisions in one afternoon, if his mind turned in that direction, has been responsible for his making very serious mistakes in regard to the way in which the problem of the wheat growers was handled in this year, and especially I deplore the fact that precipitate decisions in regard to the sale of the 1957 surplus have involved the Exchequer in huge losses which it should never have been asked to bear and foolish decisions in regard to the wheat levy have left a deep sense of grievance with a great many farmers who believe, and justly believe, that they have been unfairly treated.</P>
    <P>I think it right to sound this note of warning: One of the results of the way in which the wheat farmers are being treated this year is that you may have a very big swing away from wheat into barley in the coming cereal year.  That, in itself, would not be a bad thing, if we are equipped to handle the increased quantity of barley, but the Minister ought to prepare himself for an event of that character and see that steps are taken in time to ensure that the barley crop will be handled expeditiously and economically.</P>
    <P>Such other matters as I might wish to refer to must await the main Estimate as the restricted scope of this Estimate limits me to the mention of the matters referred to in the sub-heads, but I think the Minister owes a duty, not only to himself but to the House and to the country, to avail of this opportunity to inform the House and the country how does he justify retaining the levy of 5/9 which he was authorised to collect for the purpose of financing exports of surplus millable wheat when, in fact, he had no surplus of millable wheat to export?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate contains an admission from the Minister of a very stupid decision which he made early last year regarding the export of sound wheat surplus from the 1957 crop at sacrifice prices.  The Minister was so convinced that he was right that he decided to set up the <Col N="316" /> Grain Board to handle the wheat deliveries and cut 5/9 per barrel from the price of wheat, which was to go into a fund for the purpose of meeting losses which might result from the export of wheat this year from the 1958 crop, again at sacrifice prices. These are the considerations which arise in connection with this Supplementary Estimate in regard to the price of wheat.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Party should stop telling the farmers that they were well treated regarding the sale of wheat and the price which they received. The farmers were badly treated, in the first instance, because the Government did not face up to their responsibilities and deal with the farmers on the basis of a guaranteed price, but, instead, handed them over to a Grain Board with instructions to deduct 5/9 per barrel.</P>
      <P>In addition to the deduction of 5/9 a barrel, there were further reductions in the price of the basis of screenings and defects, as they were described, on delivery.  In regard to sub-head M (14) there is a note to the effect that the sum of £300,000 is required to enable authorised purchasers to make &ldquo;<i>ex gratia</i> payments&rdquo; to growers in respect of the 1958 wheat crop.  These are not <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  This is a refund of a deduction in the payments made to farmers, namely, the 5/9 per barrel and further deductions under the headings of &ldquo;moisture&rdquo;, &ldquo;screenings&rdquo; and so on.  This is described as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment instead of a refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the harvest started last year the farmers understood that there would be a cut of 5/9 a barrel, the proceeds of which would be used towards making good any loss resulting from the sale of the surplus exported from the 1958 crop.  The Government and the Minister should stand over that. We remember that last year those surplus quantities of wheat were exported at the ridiculous price of £1 per barrel. No wonder these exports were gladly accepted across the water.  No wonder businessmen realised that the wheat was simply being given away last year. It was a surplus that was capable of being milled and that should have been milled.  We know ourselves that in <Col N="317" /> other countries vast quantities of wheat and flour are held over from one year to the next.  Many countries have a large quantity in store up to a period of two or three years.  It is only at that stage that the question of a surplus might be considered and dealt with.</P>
    <P>Here, we have the Minister dealing with a surplus from one harvest&mdash;the harvest of 1957.  He takes an opportunity to run away with the wheat, expecting that he would have another surplus in 1958.  Supposing he had another surplus in 1958?  At least, he would only then consider himself to have what might be regarded as a small problem.  He should have waited until the 1958 crop was harvested, knowing from experience that in our climatic conditions, there is difficulty in the harvesting of wheat.  On an average, at least every third year and sometimes every second year, there is a problem in connection with the harvesting of wheat.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister had already taken the precaution of arranging for a substantial cut to be made in the price of wheat.  The remarkable thing about the difficulties confronting wheat growers is that they were given to understand they would get £4 2s. 6d. per barrel early in 1957, if Fianna Fáil got into power.  A question was asked in March, 1957, of the Minister for Agriculture.  It was not the Minister across the floor; I think that at the time it was Deputy Aiken.  He was asked if, in view of the statements made in relation to the wheat price and in view of the fact that most of the crop had not then been put in the land in March, 1957, he would, at that stage, alter the price guaranteed by Deputy Dillon at the end of January, 1957.  He was asked if he would at that stage alter the price in accordance with the statement on the wireless by the Minister for Finance who referred to the cut in the price of wheat in a previous year as &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; and &ldquo;unjust&rdquo;.  The reply given by the Minister at that time, in which the name of Deputy Corry was mentioned, stated that he realised the national importance of wheat-growing and that he would make a statement later.  But we never heard anything <Col N="318" /> further from him.  We waited and got nothing better than the price guaranteed by Deputy Dillon at the end of January, 1957, and they were glad to accept it.</P>
    <P>Then, in 1958, the Minister decided to divest himself of all responsibility and handed over his responsibility to An Bord Gráin which was charged with the responsibility of cutting the price of wheat in various ways.  When we examine these figures, we see that there was a cut of £2 6s. per ton, being 5/9 per barrel.  In addition, there was a cut from the screenings, and so on.  Further, we now have the situation where there is a tax of £2 a ton being put on wheat imported into this country.  The consumers of bread and flour are paying that tax of £2 a ton in the form of a duty which is being applied to all wheat imported at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government should stop telling the farmers that they were well treated in relation to this matter last year.  Fianna Fáil went back on every word they uttered in relation to their policy on wheat.  Do we see the walls and hoardings covered any more with the words: &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo;?  In years past, that was one of the Fianna Fáil slogans. They have dropped it.  There are no more votes in that slogan for them.</P>

      <P>I have just one further point to make in relation to this cut.  Would the wheat growers have agreed to a cut of 5/9 a barrel if they knew it was not to be applied towards making up a loss on an exportable surplus?  If they were told that the 5/9 was not to be used and applied towards a surplus, does the Minister think the farmers would agree to a cut of 5/9 a barrel in the price paid for their wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the dairy farmers in the creamery areas.  There, again, promises were held out to the dairy farmers that they would prosper if they had a Fianna Fáil Government. Instead, there has been a substantial cut in the price of milk.  The statement <Col N="319" /> recently issued by the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association shows that their costs have gone up even higher and that the cut has brought greater hardship to them.  A sum of £649,000 is being taken from the creamery milk suppliers.  They were not warned, when the Fianna Fáil Party were looking for their votes, that an arrangement would be made whereby £649,000 would be taken out of their pockets in relation to the manufacture of butter from milk supplied to creameries.</P>
    <P>Those are two matters the Minister should explain to the farmers.  I hope that, when he is approached by the farmers concerning the adjustment of the price for their milk, the Minister will consider the case they have to put up to him and explain to them why he decided, instead of giving them the increase they expected from him and his Government, to cut the price in the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is such a large sum that the Minister and the Government must have been very remiss in preparing their Estimates last year that they could not take into consideration the charges for which this money is now intended.  It is true that it has been inflated by the fact that the Minister must export butter produced in the Munster counties because of reduced consumption of butter at home as a result of the Government's policy which has put butter beyond the level at which many ordinary people in this country can now buy it.  It is extraordinary that, having made such a strong case for the complete abolition of subsidies to reduce the price of butter at home, we should now have to vote such a very large sum to subsidise that same butter for the British or foreign consumer.  We say: &ldquo;Would it not have been a better thing if nothing had been done?&rdquo; Perhaps the Government were not prepared to travel the road of assisting to increase home consumption.  At least, they could have abstained from a policy that was bound to bring about what we knew by experience would happen. There has been a sharp reduction in the home consumption of butter.  This <Col N="320" /> is now being met by a levy on production.</P>
      <P>The country could not have secured the high level of production it enjoyed in recent years&mdash;which is contributing so much to our economy in providing us with a level of exports which makes it possible for our people to enjoy their present standard of living&mdash;were it not that price guarantees were given on certain commodities.  With the exception of beet, we are now reaching a situation in which none of the four commodities the price of which was guaranteed up to the advent of this Government will have that guaranteed price.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the agriculturists realise how much it would redound to their own benefit, as well as to the benefit of the nation, to have that level of increased and more economical production.  It will not assist in any way&mdash;in fact it will be very detrimental&mdash;to have a situation wherein shareholders in co-operative creameries will be provided with their annual report and see an item there for a levy on production &mdash;that is the description by the auditors, &ldquo;levy on production&rdquo;&mdash;of an amount exceeding £17,000.  In the circumstances in which so many sections of our people are asked to bear an increase in the cost of living and asked to bear the consequential increase in wages and the spiral of higher costs sparked off by those increases, it is all wrong that a section such as the dairy industry should be called upon to contribute this levy of almost £650,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to wheat, the case made by the Minister at the time An Bord Gráin was set up was based completely on the assumption that there would be an exportable surplus.  The Deputies on the far side who spoke were emphatic on the point that it was only occasioned because of the practical certainty that there would be this large exportable surplus.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy Rooney and others, referred to the foolishness of the Minister in stampeding in relation to the yield of wheat which he had from the 1957 crop.  There is no doubt that there was plenty of accommodation throughout the country to hold that grain.  If it was to be made available at all, even if the Government felt that they had to dispose of it&mdash;and we <Col N="321" /> contend that they did not have to dispose of it&mdash;at least they could have made it available to the Irish farmers, to the pig feeders and to the people who would happily have purchased the grain for the price at which it was dumped in Britain and elsewhere. We stand over our point that it was foolish to have disposed of it at all, that it could easily have been stored and that we would not have the problems we have, consequent on the disasters of last year's harvest, if the Government had not stampeded into disposing that wheat.</P>
    <P>The persistence of the Government in retaining the levy that was imposed to meet the eventuality of having that surplus is completely contrary to their entire history in relation to wheat growing, and entirely contrary to the assurances they gave to the electorate in many parts of the country, and positively to the wheat growers, that in the event of Fianna Fáil again gaining office, they would pay a minimum price of 80/- a barrel.  Some Deputies opposite have denied that they made such statements.  I said here on another occasion that I heard Deputy Corry making that statement from a platform in Kilkenny, in the presence of the Taoiseach.  He was good enough to come in here and admit that he did say it.  Of course, he was looking for votes at the time and anything was good enough to delude the farmers of Carlow-Kilkenny, and Leix-Offaly, that their best bet would be to remove the inter-Party Government and once a Fianna Fáil Government were elected, then, from that date onwards, the wheat growers would enjoy a price of £4 a barrel for wheat.  No section of the community was as hard hit by the winter as the grain growers were last year, but despite that, the Government persist in keeping the levy on the grain growers.</P>
    <P>It will be very hard for the Minister and the Government to maintain their case in regard to the imposition of that levy.  It is also true that a sum of money has been set aside from the rearrangement of prices to effect a reduction in bread, but the manner in which that was done has led to a lot of criticism because there is quite a lot of money involved&mdash;£400,000.  It <Col N="322" /> is interesting to see how much of that has been passed on to the benefit of the consumer because we know what happens in shops throughout the country when the difficulty arises of finding the farthing.  We know what happens, and somewhere in between a fairly fine sum of money&mdash;£400,000 &mdash;has been &ldquo;mopped&rdquo; up.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious in trying to undo some of the harm they have done in reducing the consumption of flour and bread, to which the Minister adverted here to-day, they would have gone further than giving the miserable farthing which was given to reduce the price of bread.  We have a situation where the industry is also affected by that reduction in consumption, in both aspects of agriculture, both in relation to wheat and in relation to milk.  The Government now in office led, the people to believe that on their accession to office they would experience different treatment from that which has been meted out to them in the past two years.  Despite their great conversion to the importance of the cattle trade, unless the Government realise that in these exceptional years, when the dairy farmers are being called upon to bear the brunt of an extremely costly and desirable, but still necessary economy&mdash;the elimination of bovine T.B.-and unless they realise the impact that will have on the depletion of herds and on the reduction of incomes of many thousands of people, then the situation will develop, in some years' time, where we will see a reversion to what we experienced before the advent of the first inter-Party Government, the situation where there will not be enough stock in the country and where ultimately, every section will experience the recession that will follow from the fact we have not the amount of cattle to provide the high level of exports upon which all sections of the country depend.</P>

One is wheat and the other is milk&mdash;wheat prices and milk prices.  One would have to enjoy, too, their concern about the Government and the Government Party, in so far as the electorate is concerned.  As has been said before, on this side of the House, there are a few of us who have seen the other days, as far as Fine Gael are concerned.  We cannot believe what we hear from them in regard to these matters.  Indeed, the signs are that the public outside do not believe them either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Much play has been made with this wheat levy.  The whole background that presented itself last year is being distorted.  It has been stated here that my Department and the Government were unwise to dispose of the surplus wheat carry-over from 1955-56 and 1956-57, which amounted to roughly 120,000 tons. Some of the Fine Gael Deputies who appear to have some connection with the National Farmers' Association outside apparently do not realise that the farming organisations here worried about this wheat carry-over because they looked upon it as a threat to their security.  In fact, the representatives of these organisations repeated their fears time and time again in that regard.</P>
      <P>The decision to dispose of that wheat was not a matter of my suddenly deciding to do it.  It was a matter to which I had given a great deal of consideration; and the decision to sell could only be taken on the understanding that the Government approved and that the Department of Finance would meet the burden.  I do not mind telling the House and telling Deputy Dillon, who has referred to this matter on more than one occasion, that my belief is that the reason for the carry-over of that surplus wheat was that the previous Government were not really in a position to face up to financing the disposal of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no purpose in this country <Col N="324" /> in carrying over large quantities of surplus wheat, because with every week and every month that passes, there are interest charges and all sorts of maintenance charges and the price is soaring up and up, as far as the Exchequer is concerned.  Surely, with the prospect of a harvest from 420,000 acres, which in normal times could be expected to yield 420,000 tons of native wheat, it was not an unreasonable decision?  I do not think it is necessary to go to any great pains to defend oneself for having made that decision.</P>
    <P>In 1958, the harvest did not turn out as we had hoped.  Who could ever make a calculation of that nature?  In the months of April, May or June, all we could say was that, as far as we could determine, there was a certain acreage of wheat sown and that from previous experience we could expect it would yield one ton of wheat per acre.  The determination of the levy of 5/9 was based on that reckoning.</P>
    <P>When An Bord Gráin was set up, the understanding was that, as far as the wheat growers were concerned, a guaranteed price would be provided in respect of 300,000 tons of wheat and that the growers would subsidise any sale of wheat grown in excess of that quantity.  In the working out of that plan, the growers and their representatives were consulted.  Indeed, it is true to say that that scheme was their scheme.  Shortly after the harvest started, it became apparent to everybody that the wheat crop was of such a low standard, because of the season, that none of it, as it was being presented, was being accepted by the millers as millable.  If the Government had pulled out at that stage and had allowed the growers to dispose of that wheat at, maybe, 20/-, 25/- or 30/- per barrel, they could have done so; and the growers might not have been called upon to pay a levy because the wheat they were producing was not millable wheat in the sense which the scheme envisaged.</P>
    <P>It was in my own mind that the idea first arose&mdash;it was not I that developed it&mdash;of treating this problem entirely on a new basis and forgetting the understandings that had been arrived at on the assumption that the season would <Col N="325" /> be a normal one, that the crop would be normal and that it would be harvested under reasonable conditions.  My suggestion was: &ldquo;What about buying this wheat, which we will classify as sound, though not millable?  What about buying this wheat at prices determined by the Wheat Order, collecting the 5/9 levy, in the knowledge that this wheat would have to be disposed of, not as millable wheat but as animal feed at animal feed prices.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Why not let this wheat be paid for as sound wheat on the basis of the Wheat Order, that the levy be collected, that the Government stand in to meet the rest and that the remainder of the wheat of that class of this year's crop be disposed of at animal feed prices ?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That decision was made because there was urgency there.  It was made as a result of consultations with those interested in the matter and with their approval.  It was a means of dealing with a desperate situation and was a fair approach to the problem.  While I would not expect to hear from the Fine Gael benches that it was fair, I know what I am saying now will be completely understood by those who had to deal with this matter down the country.</P>
    <P>Some few criticisms were directed at the amount of the levy collected from the milk producers.  In this regard, it can be said that, had one known what the Almighty was going to send us, the sale of butter in November and December of 1957 and in January, February, March and April of 1958 could be said to have been a foolish transaction because butter prices in those months were at their very lowest.  I have not, of course, the genius of some of the members of Fine Gael who can look into the future and see what is to happen and I am not here to gamble with business of this nature.  Had we kept the butter that was sold in those months and put it on the market now, it is obvious that the losses would not have been so great.</P>
    <P>Somebody recently in the course of conversation reminded me of that fact. I think that &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; was also a member of one of the committees set up to examine the whole matter of butter marketing.  Sometimes, when <Col N="326" /> criticism of that nature is levelled at one because of judgment determined as faulty after the event, and when has to listen to recommendations as to how one should behave in future, things just do not seem to add up. Having regard to the amount of the contribution being made by the taxpayer in this matter, this levy is entirely defensible and, for my part, I have not the slightest hesitation in taking my stand to defend it here or outside.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £92,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain Protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to provide for a further sum of £212,000 for C.I.E. The major part of that, namely, £120,680 is, I think, a book transfer of money which was provided in the current year's estimate for the G.N.R. Board, but which was not paid out to the G.N.R. Board before the merger with C.I.E. on 1st October last.  The balance of £92,000 is to cover increased losses on the part of the G.N.R. undertaking not budgeted for when the original Estimates were prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that the amount included for C.I.E. in the Vote for Transport and Marine Services in this year is £3,204,300.  Of <Col N="327" /> that amount, £793,300 is for repayment to the Central Fund, in accordance with the requirements of the Transport Act of 1950, of advances made to meet interest payment on transport stock in 1957-58.  A further amount of £793,300 is also included to enable C.I.E. to pay interest on transport stock in the current financial year without recourse to the Central Fund as in previous years.  The balance of £1,617,700 is to cover capital expenditure and expenditure on renewals and replacements to the extent that working profit, before charging depreciation and interest on transport stock, falls short of this expenditure.</P>
    <P>The G.N.R. undertaking within the State, apart from the Dundalk Works, was merged with C.I.E. on 1st October last and the losses and capital expenditure of the two undertakings were also merged.  Losses and capital expenses of the G.N.R. Board from 1st April, 1958, to 30th September, 1958, were met out of the provision for the board in the Vote.  The unexpended balance of the G.N.R. Board in the Vote was £120,680.  The additional amount of £212,000 required is entirely attributable to the portion of the G.N.R. taken over by C.I.E.  If, therefore, the merger had not taken place, C.I.E. would not require any increase on the provision in the Vote.  When account is taken of the unexpended balance of £120,680 in the Vote for the G.N.R. Board, which falls to be surrendered to C.I.E., the additional amount to be voted for C.I.E. is £92,000.</P>
    <P>The financial year now coming to an end is a transitional one for C.I.E. Under recent legislation, as the House is aware, they are under a statutory obligation now to eliminate losses by the end of the next five years.  To assist them in that task an annual Grant-in-Aid of £1,175,000 will be provided for each of the next five years under that legislation.  That obligation is, of course, a very formidable one and it would be unfair and unreasonable to ask C.I.E. to embark on the crucial five-year period encumbered by borrowing to meet losses arising during the present financial year, especially as <Col N="328" /> these losses are attributable to the part of the G.N.R. undertaking taken over by C.I.E. in October.  I am asking the House, therefore, to approve the Supplementary Estimate and give C.I.E. the clean start which it was intended by legislation they should be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to be a tying-up Estimate.  We are merely making provision for the payment to C.I.E. of certain moneys to cover certain losses incurred in the operation of the G.N.R. for which provision was not made at the time of the taking over of the railway.  Aside from that aspect of the Estimate, I should like to ask the Minister if he is now in a position to give us any closer estimate as to the way in which he thinks C.I.E. will be able to fulfil the obligation imposed upon them by legislation, namely, to become a financial lineball at the end of the five-year period.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister say what are C.I.E. losses at the moment?  I think they are about finishing their financial year now.  They will receive a subsidy of something over £1,000,000 per year for the next five years.  Can the Minister tell us what the losses for the current year are likely to be?  Can he tell us whether in fact, there is any real relation between the current losses and the subsidy which they will get in each of the next five years?  I have a suspicion that the losses are in the vicinity of £2,000,000 at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are losing £2,000,000, giving them a subsidy of £1,000,000 or thereabouts is still very much under-shooting the target which was set by legislation. In a small and sparsely populated country like this, the difficulty of making a railway undertaking pay its way is recognised by everybody. I do not think the difficulties of C.I.E. are a political issue in this country, and they are certainly not a Party political issue.  I think all Parties would say if C.I.E. could pay its way, well and good, but if it cannot, in order to maintain a railway system, we have to subsidise it and that subsidy is given in the interests of the people who use the railway service. At the same time, methods of efficiency and methods of Organisation can, of course, play a big part in helping <Col N="329" /> to bring about a reduction in the adverse balance on the railways.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the new Board of C.I.E. is approaching its task, giving evidence that it is alive and alert to the responsibilities which devolve upon it.</P>

      <P>This would seem to be a matter for the main Estimate, and not for the Supplementary Estimate which is very specific.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you I shall not spend more than three minutes more on this whole question.  What I wanted to do was to put on record my appreciation of the way in which the Board of C.I.E. is dealing with the many problems which confront it. C.I.E. seems to have gone out in a very special way to get the co-operation of the thousands of workers employed by the company.  I have always said to the Boards of C.I.E., when dealing with them, that unless they could carry the workers with them in the things they were doing, they would be up against very serious difficulties.</P>
      <P>The board has quite intelligently decided that it will have a close liaison with the trade unions concerned, that it will acquaint the trade unions with what it proposes to do and that it will invite the unions to contribute their suggestions as to how these things can best be achieved.  I have a feeling that there is already a substantial improvement in the relations between the board and the trade unions.  I hope that intelligent policy will be continued. In fact, I feel sure it will be continued and if it is, it will probably play a bigger part than any other factor in helping to bring about a balance in the accounts of C.I.E.  My main purpose in rising was to ascertain from the Minister what C.I.E. losses are at the moment so that we can judge, now that we are about to enter the first year of subsidy, how far the subsidy will go to meet current losses.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to <Col N="330" /> an interesting fact.  On the occasion of adopting an Estimate of £3,880,000 subsidy for the amalgamated railway company here, I should like to refer the House to the <i>Derry Journal</i> of Tuesday, 24th February.  The Lough Swilly Railway Company had an improved year.  If Deputy Norton's reference to a small and sparsely-populated area had reference to anywhere in the country, it had reference to the area around Burtonport, because if there is a sparsely-populated part of Ireland, it is that part.  The Lough Swilly Railway Company operated a transport undertaking between the City of Derry and Burtonport, through Letterkenny and on to the west, and this year the Lough Swilly Railway Company have a total net income of £11,583.</P>

      <P>The directors recommended a dividend of 5 per cent. on the preference stock and 7 per cent. on the ordinary stock, less income-tax, leaving a balance of £22,622 to be carried forward.  That is the only transport company in this country now left in the hands of private enterprise and it can pay 7 per cent. on its ordinary stock.  We are planning to pay £1,250,000 subsidy in the next five years in the pious hope that C.I.E. will break even.  After Deputy Norton's observations, I do not want to sound ungenerous.  I believe the chairman of the board, who is an old &ldquo;Fianna Fáiler,&rdquo; has shown great courage and despite his bad qualities, I greatly admire his decision to abandon the position he had as chairman of the Turf Board and undertake the formidable task of guiding the future destiny of C.I.E.  I wish the board and the chairman of the board good luck in the work to which they have put their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what Deputy Norton said and I hope he will not misunderstand me when I say that it often struck me <Col N="331" /> that one of the difficulties in having satisfactory relations between C.I.E. and the trade unions was the multiplicity of the trade unions operating in the service of C.I.E.  I have seen reports of the enormous difficulties created for B.O.A.C. in London who found themselves involved in every kind of difficulty in labour relations owing to the multiplicity of unions serving that company,</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear that the Board of C.I.E. has reached the sensible conclusion that if it wants to have any prospect of success, it must work in friendly co-operation with the trade unions representing the men.  The trade unions could make some reciprocal gesture in getting some joint council to represent them effectively so that negotiations would not have to be conducted with about 15 trade unions &mdash;or is it 14 unions C.I.E. have?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>All of us appreciate the difficulties associated with that, but from the point of view of the trade unions themselves, it would be a maximum contribution to the effort which Deputy Norton acknowledges on the part of the Board of C.I.E. to deal on a basis of cordial reciprocal good relations with the trade unions, if the pattern of the trade union organisation of the workers on the railway were simplified, which at present calls for 23 unions to represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree this is not an occasion to go into too great detail and I shall not do so.  The price must be paid and all of us must do what we can to help the Board of C.I.E. to make a success of the enterprise to which they have put their hands.  On behalf of the rural community, I think the Minister might sound a note of warning. If we are to get the type of patrols that he is sending into the <Col N="332" /> rural areas, a kind of general Gestapo to &ldquo;lep&rdquo; on the back of any farmer who carries anything on a tractor for which he pays an £8 licence, we will not have the goodwill of the rural community.</P>
    <P>It is admirable to show goodwill towards trade unions representatives of the employees and it is admirable to reassure the Board of C.I.E. that we wish them well and hope they will succeed; but it will not create goodwill if the people of the country are to be persecuted and harried as they are being persecuted and harried by flying columns who are, I suppose, engaged in an effort to restrict what has come to be known as illegal transport. A little &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo; would help.  I shall return to that in greater detail on the main Estimate.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Estimate is to fulfil an undertaking to hand over the G.N.R. to the Board of C.I.E. without any liabilities attaching to it and it is to serve no other purpose than that.  We shall have, I imagine, a fuller opportunity of discussing the effects of the operation of the new transport policy when the main Estimate comes along.  I hope by then to be able to give Deputy Norton more detailed information than I could possibly supply him with now.</P>

      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 3rd March, 1959.</P>
