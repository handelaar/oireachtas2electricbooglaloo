    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the names and the extent of all the Gaeltacht areas in the State, and the Irish speaking population of each area in the years 1948 and 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a number of different definitions of the Gaeltacht for various purposes. The Report of the Gaeltacht Commission, 1925, sets out the areas determined by the Commission as a result of a special census made in August of that year, to be Fíor-Ghaeltacht (i.e. Irish speaking) and Breac Gaeltacht (i.e. partly Irish speaking) areas.  Two further definitions of the Gaeltacht were adopted for the purpose of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, and The School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1933.  More recently the Gaeltacht has been defined in the Gaeltacht Areas Order 1956, for the purpose of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956, under which the separate Gaeltacht Department was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only Gaeltacht areas in respect of which separate statistics of the Irish speaking population are available are Fíor-Ghaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht areas defined in the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission, 1925.  Figures are not available however for the years specified by the Deputy.  The most <Col N="1176" /> recent statistics which can be furnished relate to 1946.  The total number of Irish speakers returned for Gaeltacht areas in that year was 192,963.  For details I would refer the Deputy to Volume VIII of the Report of the 1946 Census.</P>

      <P>Statistics of the Irish speaking population for the whole of County Clare are available from the Census of Population for the years 1926, 1936 and 1946.  The 1926 total, which relates to persons of all ages was 28,842.  The 1936 and 1946 figures, which exclude persons under 3 years of age were 27,078 and 21,186 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1925, at the request of the Gaeltacht Commission a special census was <Col N="1177" /> taken covering selected areas of the country in which it was anticipated that considerable numbers of Irish speakers were located.  A total of 18,824 Irish speakers were returned for County Clare excluding the Urban District of Ennis and the Rural Districts of Limerick No. 2 and Scariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the standing practice employed by employment exchanges in submitting names of unemployed persons for notified casual employment vacancies in the Department of Defence; whether in the case of recent vacancies for carpenters at Collins Barracks, Cork, the standing instructions were complied with; if not, why not; and, if so, why the list submitted included the names of persons not registered as unemployed, or registered for one day only, and excluded registered person No. 855349 (name supplied to the Department), who had been signing for employment for several weeks, and who had previous satisfactory service with the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In submitting names of suitable persons for vacancies of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, preference <Col N="1178" /> is given to those who are holders of military service medals or who have had certain specified service with the permanent Defence Force.  If there are none, or not sufficient of such persons to fill the vacancies, the names of a reasonable number of other suitable persons may be submitted, preference being given to those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Failure to follow this procedure and an error of judgment on the part of the official concerned resulted in only three unemployment benefit claimants, including the only suitable medal holder on the register, being submitted for the vacancies for carpenter at Collins Barracks, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it further that the only explanation for this appears to be that there was an error of judgment made by one of the officers of this Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Parliamentary Secretary to say that that arose out of an error of judgment on the part of one of the officers in his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did the Parliamentary Secretary ascertain, during the course of his inquiry into this matter, that the two people who did secure the posts were, first, people who were fully employed up to the night before they got the appointments in utter disregard of the class of people who were genuinely unemployed and, secondly, that their names were submitted to his Department by a Fianna Fáil Deputy and that, in fact, they could be regarded as political hacks of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary endeavour to investigate the matter further?  Would he endeavour to ascertain whether or not this alleged error on the part of one of his officers was not, in the first place, the responsibility of somebody higher up&mdash;very much higher up&mdash;and that this officer was instructed to include these two names because of the reason I have given, because they were attached to Fianna Fáil, and that their names were recommended by a Fianna Fáil Deputy?  I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary investigate whether that is true or not?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the Cork County Council had to remit portions of rates due by several tenants of the P. &amp; J. Ryan Estate, Ballycotton, County Cork, recently handed over by <Col N="1182" /> the Land Commission to these tenants, because the Land Commission did not make provision for the abatement of flooding of large portions of this estate; and if the Land Commission will take steps to have these waterways cleared and the flooding abated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information regarding the remission of rates due by some tenants on this estate.</P>
      <P>The Ordnance detail shows that the lands on the eastern part of the estate in Ballybraher townland, in common with adjoining lands outside the estate, are permanently liable to floods.  They adjoin an area flooded by tidal action.  The relief of this type of flooding is not the responsibility of the Land Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that up to six years before this happened that place was completely dry and there was no flooding?  It was only recently and due to the neglect of the Land Commission in not clearing the stream, that this heavy flooding occurred.  Those unfortunate tenants, I understand, are paying rent to the Minister's Department for the land they got.  They also had an inspection of that land by the rating officials of Cork County Council and they had to be relieved of the rate due to the neglect of the Land Commission.  Has the Minister any respect at all for the money that has been expended and paid for the purchase?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the lands of the Gaskell Estate, Garryvoe, Ballycotton, are water-logged on account of the condition of the sluices, with the <Col N="1183" /> result that farmers are unable to sow the early crops for which the district is famous; and if the Land Commission will now take steps to protect the advances which they made for the purchase of the holdings, either by compelling the trustees of the estate to repair and clear the sluices, or by compulsorily acquiring the land on which the sluices are situated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the periodic flooding of some vested holdings on this estate is due to the absence of natural fall in the stream draining the holdings and, as a result of tidal action, to the blocking by sand of the outlet channel to the sea.</P>
      <P>The lands through which the outlet channel flows are privately owned and any question of compelling the owners to clear the channel is a matter for the farmers whose lands are stated to suffer from periodic flooding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this case the Land Commission stepped in under the 1924 Act and purchased this estate compulsorily? The Land Commission excluded the portion of the land covered by the sluice.  That is now the cause of all the flooding.  That was left in the hands of the landlord for letting for duck shooting and of course the more water, the more money the landlord would get for the shoot.  Would the Minister say if he is prepared to take any steps now for the compulsory acquisition of that part of the estate so that this land may be drained?  The poor law valuation is 35/- per statute acre.  The tenants are paying enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to provide for the establishment of a Department of Transport and Power, and for that purpose to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that there would be no extra staff for this Department. I should like him to give us an indication now, if he can, of the number of personnel to be transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce and the existing cost of this personnel.  I have the gravest doubts that there will not be some additional cost.  For one thing, it will probably mean a certain number of promotions and people will be paid at a higher level.  Secondly, we all know that Parkinson's Law will most certainly operate.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I want to put this to the Taoiseach.  The Department he is setting up is to cover marine services and harbours, which have been under the direct control of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is to cover also inland transport.  Ninety-five per cent. of inland transport is dealt with by C.I.E.  There is, of course, the administration of the Road Transport Act in respect of which the licensing provisions are dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Taoiseach said yesterday he did not believe in giving full autonomy to public boards.  I take it that by that he means full autonomy in matters of general policy and that he is not making any suggestion that the day-to-day administration of C.I.E. will come within the purview of the new Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil aviation policy is dealt with very largely by statutory concerns&mdash;<Col N="1191" /> Aer Lingus, Aer Linte and Aer Rianta. The Department of Industry and Commerce has some direct control.  As far as I remember, Shannon Airport is under the direct control of the Department. But, again, virtually all the day to day work is dealt with by statutory concerns.  In relation to power, frankly I cannot see what work the Department would have other than matters of general policy, because the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna seem to cover all that is involved.</P>
    <P>If that is so, it seems clear that there will not be sufficient in this Department for a Minister and for a proper working Department.  On that basis it would be highly desirable that some other work should be embraced in this Department for the purpose of saving the additional cost that will otherwise be involved.  The suggestion was made yesterday that communications should be included.  I cannot see why communications could not be included. The Taoiseach's objection yesterday was that he did not want to have the Post Office administered without a Minister.  There will be a Minister for this Department and it could be quite well administered.</P>
    <P>We all know that the fact has been that certain Ministries have been greatly overworked and certain Ministries, to put the matter at its minimum, have not been hard-pressed.  I can appreciate the Taoiseach's point of view in sub-dividing some sectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce, but if he is to do the job efficiently, he should at the same time ensure that there will be an administration in relation to those Departments where an active Minister would not be engaged full time.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact, for example, that the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence would each hardly have full time occupation in the normal course in their existing Departments? For one reason or another, of course, it may not be desirable to amalgamate the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might. I shall confine myself to the consideration that the Taoiseach, when he is providing the money for this Department, will either give us the most firm and absolute undertaking that the personnel will not exceed the personnel being transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce under any circumstances, or else that he will communicate to us why it is not possible to make up that saving by amalgamation with other Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct a misunderstanding on the part of the Taoiseach as a result of some remarks I made yesterday.  The Taoiseach suggested, when replying last evening, that I advocated splitting power and fuel.  I did not want to interrupt him then.  What I did say was, in fact, that I thought power&mdash;which I understood to include fuel as, in fact, it does&mdash; should remain with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and those services covered by transport should be taken over by the new Minister.  I went on to suggest possibly communications in the Post Office might be added at a later date, making a Ministry of Transport and Communications.  I quite agree with the Taoiseach that it is obvious one cannot divorce power and fuel.  They are too closely connected.  Such a divorce was not present to my mind as, I think, the <i>Official Report</i> will show.</P>

In the course of the discussion I referred to the amount of time spent in the examination of claims for grants for harbours.  In the first instance, applications for grants are sent to a committee which spends quite an amount of time posting the applications. The applications are then sent to the Board of Works.  The Board of Works advises as to the feasibility or advisability of the proposed works.  If it is decided to make a grant the Board of Works is again consulted.  At least 90 per cent of the time occupied from the date of application until the final decision is taken is occupied in the main by a Board of Works examination <Col N="1193" /> of the whole problem to find out what is practicable in the circumstances. Remembering that, it might be wiser to consider whether harbour grants and repairs to harbours should not be transferred to the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>The Board of Works acts as the technical authority in advising the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Minister and the Department are often in an embarrassing position when they are pressed for a decision as to whether or not a grant will be made when, in fact, they can do nothing whatever and are as impotent as a monument in O'Connell Street until such time as they are advised by the Board of Works.  Since the Board of Works undertakes all manner of work of a constructional character and, in fact, looks after certain harbours itself exclusively it might be a good idea to give the Board of Works the responsibility for the administration of harbour grants which at present impact on the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Dún Laoghaire harbour is maintained by the Board of Works.  I see no reason why the Board of Works should not look after every harbour since it does 90 per cent of the technical work in connection with such grants.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister where it is proposed to locate this new Department.  I take it, it is not proposed to remove the existing sections out of Kildare Street.  There is room there for all sections and the mere substitution of a Minister for a Parliamentary Secretary should not involve any movement out of the Kildare Street building in order to establish <Col N="1194" /> the complete independence of the proposed new Department <i>vis-a-vis</i> the surviving Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister also whether all that is involved in this change is, in fact, merely a transfer of sections from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the new Department, sections which are deemed by this Bill to be appropriate to the new Department.  Secondly, is it a fact that all that it involves is the conversion of a Parliamentary Secretary into a Minister to look after the proposed new Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what Deputy Norton has said, would the Taoiseach agree that it might be desirable to put the Board of Works in with this new Department and thereby get some semblance of rationalisation into St. Stephen's Green?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, when we are appropriating money for this new Ministry, which is to take charge of all the State and quasi-State bodies, will he apply his mind to the repercussions thereof on the ordinary taxpayer?  The purpose is to give the taxpayer better service for his money.  One of the gravest difficulties under which the existing system labours is that referred to by both Deputy Russell and myself yesterday, that the average citizen when he comes in contact with one of these semi-State bodies finds himself in a much more impotent position than that in which he would be if he came in conflict with a Department of State.  If he comes in conflict with a Department of State he can always have recourse to Parliament, by way of Parliamentary Question, a motion on the adjournment and so forth.  By means of that procedure the Minister can be brought to answer for his performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the Taoiseach correctly, we shall now have a Minister responsible for a number of semi-State bodies.  If questioned here he will almost uniformly be placed in the position of saying that he has no <Col N="1195" /> function and therefore must decline to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the matter very general.  He should confine himself to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we are appropriating this money, I think it is in order to suggest that one ought to make provision for an ancillary service where these semi-State bodies are concerned. I suggest&mdash;in default of a better suggestion, I think my suggestion is a good one&mdash;that the Taoiseach might well consider the Scandinavian model. If the Minister is not answerable to this House for detailed matters relating to these semi-State bodies there should be somebody to stand beside him, somebody analogous to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners in his relationship with the Minister for Finance, or the Comptroller and Auditor General who enjoys a constitutional position of independence.  That &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; should be invested with the duty of dealing with complaints made by members of the public in respect of grievances which they believe themselves to labour under <i>vis-a-vis</i> semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach said he emphatically did not want the Minister to be responsible in any way for the day-to-day activities of these companies. Indeed, he could not see how anybody is at a greater disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> these semi-State companies as compared with any other company. The answer to that is that these semi-State companies are monopolies.  One of the reasons that they are semi-State companies is because they must be monopolies in order to function properly. The individual citizen has not, <Col N="1196" /> in relation to them, the traditional sanction of taking his custom elsewhere. If he is not pleased with the service he is getting he has nowhere else to take his custom.  Every citizen stands in a position in relation to a semi-State company quite different from that in which he stands in relation to a public or private company.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that it is the intention of his Government to expand public enterprise under the auspices of this Minister.  I think you are going to have a growing volume of protest in this House that this Minister is not equipped adequately to meet the legitimate requirements of public representatives in respect of complaints that reach them on behalf of their constituents. I accept that it is not practical to charge a Minister to answer to this House for every detail of administration in respect of the public companies for the general policy of which he answers.  If it is not, then I think there ought to be some other person who would have the quasi-judicial independence of the Executive, whose duty and right it would be to deal with such complaints and to give satisfaction either to public representatives or to aggrieved individuals who believe that they have a legitimate cause for complaint against a State body enjoying a monopolistic position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the individual consumer, the citizen.</P>

      <P>We are asked to vote money for the setting up of a new Ministry.  When we think of a Minister we think in terms of someone who has power, some authority.  As far as I can see, this Minister would be only a figurehead, a kind of king who does nothing but show himself off.  He will have no power because he is asked to administer statutory bodies that cannot be questioned.  For instance, if we want to ask a question about them, we are told we have no authority to ask questions.  If we have not, has he? What power will he have?  That is my objection to spending a lot of money setting up a Ministry that has no power, even to influence these bodies or to convey the feelings of this House where there may be some <Col N="1197" /> genuine grievance on the part of some member of the House.</P>
      <P>I have a question down for to-morrow asking why members cannot put down a question in relation to these bodies.  I hope to get an answer.  I should like to think that a Minister has power, that he is not just a figurehead.  If that is all he is, there is no point in wasting money.  That is my only objection.  He ought to seek some power to influence these people or to have some say and not be just a dummy.  It has been conveyed to me that I cannot ask a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the total staff to be transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the proposed Department of Transport and Power will be about 400, but a very substantial part of that number would be represented by the employees at Shannon Airport.  The staff will be housed where they are located at present, in the Department of Industry and Commerce building in Kildare Street, where the new Minister will also have his office.  There will be no change in that regard.</P>
      <P>The justification for the arrangement, in my view, is precisely what was said by Deputy Dillon, that this will give the public better service at no greater cost.  So long as the activities appropriate to these divisions of the Department of Industry and Commerce now are not extended, there will, of course, be no increase in staff. I am not, however, going to put the new Department into a strait-jacket and say that they must never expand. Indeed, as I mentioned yesterday, we contemplate the possibility of certain developments affecting some of these matters which could in course of time impose new responsibilities on the Department.  Whether that will involve any increase of staff or not cannot be decided now and, of course, any proposal of that kind must come to the Dáil and be justified here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the matters raised by Deputy Sweetman were, I think, raised also last evening by Deputy Costello and I referred to them.  It is certainly not intended that the new <Col N="1198" /> Minister or any Minister should interfere with these statutory bodies in their day to day administration.  They were set up deliberately by this House with that independent position in regard to their management affairs which they now have because we believed that that would make for more efficient working.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello last evening denounced the Departmental file.  Do we want to stuff up these statutory boards with Departmental files, the type of records that they would have to keep if Deputies were entitled to ask questions on details of administration&mdash;why some official was promoted or some official was dismissed or why a supply of power or transport or something else was given or not given in certain circumstances?  If Deputies were entitled to ask for details about their administration of that kind, then, of course, the Departmental files which are now, according to Deputy Costello, the bane of Government Departments, would have to reappear in equal number in the offices of these State boards.</P>
    <P>It is not true that Deputies are refused answers to questions about these bodies.  Indeed, the practice has been that, when questions relate to policy, the answers are given in the fullest possible terms.  It certainly has been, so far as I know, always my practice and, indeed, the practice of everybody who has held the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce, to give full answers to questions dealing with policy matters but to refuse to give information in matters where the Minister has no responsibility, matters which are by law transferred to the independent decision of these statutory boards.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting that they abuse their powers but I am quite certain that, if any Deputy believes that, the boards of these organisations will investigate the allegation. The boards of these organisations are not officials administering them.  They are there as representatives <Col N="1199" /> of the public, chosen because of their suitability, to ensure that the service the public are entitled to get from these boards is, in fact, provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman inquired whether the Minister in charge of the new Department will, in fact, have enough work to occupy himself.  I have stated that my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce was that, being occupied with other matters, I was unable to give to many of these affairs the personal attention I thought they required and that situation is likely to be aggravated in the early future when it is obvious that, in respect of some of them at least, quite important policy decisions will have to be taken.</P>
      <P>I would not at all agree with Deputy Norton's suggestion about transferring responsibility for harbour development grants to the Board of Works.  Where the question of developing a harbour arises, two questions have to be dealt with, one, the commercial considerations which would justify the outlay and the other the technical problem of carrying out the works involved.  It seems to me to be far more sensible to have responsibility for the final decision rest with the Department which is concerned with the commercial prospects, leaving the technical matters to be dealt with in the technical Department, rather than to have the technical Department dealing with the purely constructional aspect and seeking the advice of the commercial Department on the justification for the outlay. Indeed, in that regard, I have been quite conscious of the fact that, in respect of certain harbour projects, in regard to which difficulties of one kind or another arose, such as at Galway, or problems of another kind which do not appear to be easy of solution, I, as Minister, was unable to give them enough personal attention or even, on many occasions, to meet the local representatives who wanted to discuss their problems with me and I should hope that, as a result of this division, that situation will be greatly relieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;one cannot be certain&mdash;that <Col N="1200" /> the amount of routine administrative work which will devolve upon the new Minister will keep him fully occupied.  I hope it does not.  I hope he will have time to study and deal with these policy matters to which I have referred and to contribute as a Cabinet Minister to the development of Government policy in the widest sense. It seems to me, however, that Deputy Sweetman is not applying Parkinson's Law here because, if that does operate, the volume of work in the Department will tend to grow to the point at which all the time of its officials will be fully occupied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>I think myself that it would be no harm if we had a discussion at some stage or other on the relationship between the Government and the Dáil on the one hand and the statutory bodies and the State financed organisations on the other hand.  I may say that I do not necessarily agree with Deputy Dillon that there is a problem to be solved.  I expressed my views on this matter in an address which I gave early this year to the Institute of Public Administration which has since been published as a pamphlet.  I welcomed the opportunity of expressing my views on that occasion as, I may say, the matter has engaged our attention for some time and also the attention of other Parliaments without any workable proposition emerging as to how the commercial independence of these organisations could be maintained while, at the same time, they could be made subject to any degree of Parliamentary control.</P>
      <P>In my view the procedure we have, under which their administrative independence is guaranteed by statute but with general responsibility to a designated Minister of State, is as workable as any that has been suggested but, if any Deputy has any idea to put forward or any proposition to make, the House would, I am sure, welcome an opportunity of debating it and it would help to clear our minds and the minds of the public on the whole subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the facts illuminated by Deputy Sherwin.  It may be as clear as crystal to the mind of the Taoiseach that any of these boards provide adequate protection for the individual but I want to press on the Taoiseach that he is mistaken in that belief.  When the individual comes into conflict with one of the great Departments of State he should be able to call on Deputy Sherwin, or myself, or any other Deputy and bring the head of the Government if needs be, to give an account here.  That is one of the great fundamentals of human liberty.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to the Taoiseach, however, that in the case of these monopolistic State bodies when the average housewife comes in conflict with them&mdash;I am not taking sides in this argument at all&mdash;or when the average housewife has her electric light or power cut off, as she thinks unjustly, she is conscious of a deep grievance.  In that position she should have the right to have her Deputy bring the Minister in charge of that Department to account for what has been done to her.  At least that will give her the feeling that she has some protection against the anonymous power of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in my writing a letter to the Board and getting back a smooth reply and sending it on to her. She says that that is not enough.  As <Col N="1202" /> Deputy Sherwin says, she feels a grievance that she cannot get information. I quite agree that the new Minister should not be charged with meeting these complaints but there should be some method by which a Deputy could bring these complaints before the House and make the Minister responsible answer them.</P>

You could divorce him form Parliament altogether but you could give him such powers that, if Deputy Sherwin or I are approached by a constituent, we can go to a person of that status who would have the right to investigate the matter in the Department concerned on behalf of the aggrieved person.  I agree with the Taoiseach that the Parliamentary Question is not the appropriate procedure.</P>

In that I made it clear that I had not come to any final decision at all and I contented myself with stating both sides of the problem while indicating my provisional conclusions.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that these statutory bodies, which have an obligation of providing services to the public, should have within themselves some method by which public representatives and others could seek explanations of any action taken in any individual case.</P>

      <P>I want to correct a misunderstanding. I am not clear whether the Taoiseach has, in fact, informed himself of this, and I fully appreciate that it might not have been drawn to his attention.  I would like him to look at the scheme operating in Scandinavian countries, not that I am prepared to say I am certain it is right for us, but I think it is worth consideration. I should like to distinguish between it and what he himself said, that there should be in each of these bodies an officer of the body charged with this responsibility.</P>

    <P>I want something slightly different. I want a person with an independent status, analogous to that of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who <Col N="1204" /> would have a right to approach any of these bodies and to seek information that an ordinary inquirer would not be entitled to have, not for the purpose of publishing it but so that when he wrote in reply: &ldquo;I have carefully investigated your inquiry and I have come to the conclusion, for the following reasons, that no genuine grievance exists&rdquo;, I, Deputy Sherwin or Deputy Norton, will know this man had the power to make such investigations, and that we have every reason to believe, with our experience of the public service, that he would have discharged his duty faithfully.</P>

      <P>I could not say that. I think there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the cutting-off of power and light from individual houses.  I think that matter was blown up by a good deal of propaganda but, if such an officer existed, as I am adumbrating now, that kind of propaganda could never have got under way.  I have had a great volume of hullabaloo about that matter, and I did investigate a few cases.  I am aware of the fact that the Gas Company never cuts anybody off and they can collect their money, whereas the E.S.B. would seem, superficially, to be acting in a peremptory way but, when you examine individual cases&mdash;this is my experience anyway&mdash;you find that this has happened two or three times with an individual and the E.S.B., in a manner of speaking, threw their hats at it and took the peremptory step of cutting off his light.  I am sure that is not true in all cases, but I do not think that kind of anxiety would have become widespread if there was somebody with authority to go in and root through the E.S.B., somebody who had sufficient power to make certain he got all the facts he could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of that, I believe you are going to have an extension of this kind of business, and it will be impossible to avoid ructions in Dáil Eireann, where exasperated Deputies <Col N="1205" /> will raise the roof because they are not getting the kind of information to which they think they are entitled when they are under legitimate pressure from aggrieved humble persons. If denied that, these persons will feel they have no freedom left.</P>
    <P>I love the Parliamentary Question as a great instrument of human liberty, but I can see in the day-to-day administration matters of these companies it is not the appropriate instrument and, if it is to be set aside as being impractical for that purpose, I think we should devise some alternative instrument which will leave with simple people the conviction that there is nobody in this country powerful enough to walk on the fundamental rights of simple citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see very much more that has to be done and, on that point, I should like the Taoiseach to give some indication of the additional functions which he proposes to assign to the new Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did so very fully, yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have completely misunderstood but I took it that there were certain functions outlined in the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;the marine service, harbours, inland transport, civil aviation, power&mdash;and then certain additional functions which it might become necessary to assign in the future, and that that could be done by Government Order.  I would like to know what those are because, having regard <Col N="1206" /> to the Taoiseach's refusal, or at least his inability to give an assurance that this Bill would not mean a furtherance of State enterprises, I must say that I remain perturbed on the one hand, for the same reason as Deputy Dillon has given&mdash;that the individual is powerless against a monopolistic institution such as any of these bodies now in operation, or any such similar board in contemplation&mdash;and, on the other hand, because the extension of such State enterprises is at all times, having regard to our experience, something which will be, irrespective of success or failure, a perpetual drain on the fiscal resources of the country.</P>
      <P>No Government, whether it be the present Government or a Government over which somebody else might be Taoiseach, can afford to let any State enterprise fail for want of State contribution voted through Parliament. It is all very well to point to the success of various boards but could they have succeeded if they were run on a basis of private enterprise without the knowledge that, whether they went short of money or not, it was there for the asking, for simply the political reason that no Government can afford a failure? Having regard to what has already been said I do not see the necessity for a new Minister when telecommunications have already been covered, and telecommunications are substantially the Post Office.  They could be amalgamated with this and a whole new system worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the new Minister simply going to be asked to keep an eye on the policy operations of the various State bodies, and will his only function be to report back to the Government and say: &ldquo;The people in the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna propose to do this.  I do not think they should.  What do you suggest I should do?  Let us consider what should be done.&rdquo;  Then he goes back to the company and tells them they cannot do whatever is in question. If that is to be his only function it will be a waste of time, and unless the responsibility for administration, to some extent, is given to him he is not really answerable to Parliament at all for anything because policy, as operated by any Minister is, in my opinion, Government policy <i>in toto.</i><Col N="1207" /> Therefore, I deprecate the tendency of this Bill to increase expenditure without any profitable results and to increase the tendency for the furtherance of State enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to speak only because of what Deputy Lindsay said.  I hardly think that what he has said is a fair appraisal of a number of our State-sponsored bodies.  I think Irish Shipping is a first-class body.  It was brought into being because of the unusual circumstances created by the war.  Private enterprise could never have undertaken to provide these ships. It was not within the capacity of private enterprise to do so and, therefore, Irish Shipping was born and I think we are all glad to-day it has made such a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on what Deputy Lindsay said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of airlines nobody would have done the pioneering work were it not for the State.  The State goes in, and Aer Lingus is created and has built up a very fine reputation for itself.  Financially, it has been a success.  Nobody would think tomorrow of dismantling Aer Lingus because, again, it is a first class success in the field of public enterprise.  We can go on to electricity generating. Here, too, private enterprise was not capable of measuring up to national requirements in respect of electricity production on a national grid.  The E.S.B. was brought into operation through legislation passed here.  The E.S.B. now has a capital investment in the vicinity I think of £90,000.  It is a first class undertaking.  In the electrical field it has been able to give us something we never had through private enterprise and possibly never <Col N="1208" /> would have attained if we had to rely exclusively on private enterprise as it exists in a country where the financial resources are limited such as they are here.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if we had not State undertakings in respect of railways we could walk today because only the State has been able by legislation and money to try to maintain the transport system. At the same time it has maintained the transport system for the benefit of the community and if C.I.E. loses money it is doing so because it is subsidising transport and the loss in the balance sheet is the benefit which finds its way into the pockets of the railway users.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what I want to say to Deputy Lindsay is that I do not understand the point of view that because we have a State-sponsored body the Minister's job is to take a grandstand seat and have a look at how the State-sponsored bodies do their work.  I do not think I would make State-sponsored bodies absolutely independent.  I do not think Parliament should abdicate its powers to State-sponsored bodies or should say to a State-sponsored body: &ldquo;It is your job without interference from Government or Parliament to run the particular industry in any way you like.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, air development, power development, turf development and development of shipping are all aspects of Government activity and are part of national activities.  These are therefore the channels through which <Col N="1209" /> a Government&mdash;any Government; I am not talking of the present Government&mdash;must develop its plans but of course, if the body is omnipotent and can close its ears to the views of the Government then what we have done is to create a Frankenstein.  We have created a State-sponsored body so independent that it will refuse even to listen to the Minister who is the mouthpiece of Government policy.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must always have the authority in the field of shipping, the field of air development, the field of turf development, the field of power and in every other field to say to these State-sponsored bodies that were created as agencies of national development that the stage has been reached in our development when the Government desires that this, that or the other should be done.  In so far as it needs legislation the Government has to come to the House; so far as it can be done by executive action, not alone do I not see anything wrong with the Minister saying on behalf of the Government: &ldquo;We think you should fan out in this or that direction,&rdquo; but I think it is highly desirable that should be done once in a while in order that there should be a satisfactory scheme of progress and development undertaken by the body itself.</P>
    <P>So far as the day to day administration of State-sponsored bodies is concerned, I think there is only one way of dealing with that problem.  I think we should appoint a Board with a competent executive staff to do the job. If they do not do it, sack them and get another Board.  So long as they are there they would do the day to day administrative work.  My point of view is that the Board should be receptive to instructions from the Government in the field of expansion and development.  If we do not make Boards receiving organisations for that kind of advice I think we run the risk of those Boards becoming a government unto themselves.  In our stage of development I do not think that is desirable either from the democratic or the development point of view.  I think it is not something that a Government could contemplate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to Section 2 of the Bill.  Deputy Norton has spoken with effect and led himself to the point of saying that the danger was that if autonomy were conferred on those bodies we might construct a Frankenstein.  Let us be reasonable. There is no danger of any Frankenstein confronting this Parliament. Oireachtas Éireann can do anything within the Constitution other than make a man into a woman or a woman into a man.  No Frankenstein can long confront us in Parliament.  We have the means of dealing with any Frankenstein because we are the Parliament of the Irish people and within the Constitution we can control any rival authority that challenges us. The ultimate authority rests in this Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Frankenstein is a word to be used in the relationship that may come to exist either between the executive and the citizen or between one of our creatures and a citizen.  That is the correct context and that is the very point Deputy Sherwin and I have been trying to make.  Here is the danger of creating a Frankenstein.  If we content ourselves by saying that so long as the Minister can give a broad policy direction to any of these Boards and so long as those Boards are prepared to receive docilely his instructions and directions, all is well.</P>
      <P>I want to sound a note of caution. That is not enough.  That is the very danger I see in the present situation crystallising in these agreeable exchanges between the Taoiseach and Deputy Norton.  I think both Deputy Norton and the Taoiseach have that much of a streak of authoritarianism in them that they have the feeling that there are limits beyond which reasonable men ought not be asked to go.</P>

      <P>Then it has not passed and I may be allowed to proceed.  I <Col N="1213" /> am trying to make the case that neither Deputy Norton nor the Taoiseach is correct in saying that, once you have required these bodies to accept direction from the Minister, that is enough. It is not enough.  I wish other Deputies would associate themselves with me in saying that they do not agree with Deputy Norton and the Taoiseach in feeling that we have done our duty if we insist on that and do not ask for more.</P>
      <P>I am not in the slightest degree apprehensive that any of these bodies would ever become a Frankenstein <i>vis-a-vis</i> Oireachtas Éireann, but I am extremely apprehensive that, in a desire to streamline procedure and out of a false loyalty to efficiency, we shall open the road to Frankensteins trampling on the rights of individuals.  I believe, if we but reflect on this and dwell on it, in time that socialist as I believe the Taoiseach and Deputy Norton to be, they have not gone quite that far yet.  I do not want them to stumble into accepting that principle inevitably.  I believe we could get substantial agreement on all sides of the House; but I want to get it and I do not want to have Deputy Norton and the Taoiseach nodding to one another and saying &ldquo;We say ditto to that,&rdquo; without fully appreciating the reaction of their words.  I want to say emphatically that I do not say ditto unless and until Deputy Norton and the Taoiseach are prepared to qualify that declaration by saying &ldquo;but, in addition to this desirable relationship between the Minister and these bodies, we shall also resolve to repudiate emphatically the doctrine that you cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one point.  While agreeing to some extent with Deputy Dillon, I think public representatives have more authority and weight than he gives them credit for.  From personal experience I can say that when one approaches one of these omnipotent bodies, they are generally listened to&mdash; and we still have <i>vox populi</i> to fall back on.  As long as we have that, we need not worry about Frankensteins. However, it is a difficult problem&mdash; and the Taoiseach appreciates it&mdash;that <Col N="1214" /> with the growth of these bodies there is a danger that the little man will be pushed to one side.</P>
      <P>There is one relevant point in regard to the efficiency of these State bodies. I do not mean efficiency in the sense of the outlook of the planners, but that these bodies will not become a burden on the community.  Everybody has spoken so far in praise of Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna and the E.S.B.&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;but there are other instances where State bodies have not been efficient and have been, in fact, a burden on the community in that they have received substantial sums of money through the Oireachtas and these moneys have not been well expended.  Because of vested interests and because of the social requirements of the industries concerned, the Oireachtas has had to go on giving money to keep them alive.</P>
      <P>There should be some way by which a State sponsored undertaking could be measured by some independent body, whereby it would be possible to tell the Dáil that such-and-such an industry was operating efficiently in the interests of the community, or whether it was making a profit or a loss.  In theory at least all a monopoly has to do is to raise its charges and recoup its losses from the public.  But there should be some means of comparing its operations with efficient industries, either private enterprises or public enterprises in other countries.  I would be very concerned with that facet of this development, that we should, as the necessity arose, be able to call on somebody to give an experienced and competent report on operations of our State sponsored bodies to the satisfaction of the public, who, after all, supply the money for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>More than anything else I am concerned with the rights of Deputies to ask Ministers Parliamentary Questions.  Deputy Dillon said that he had not come up against any of these Boards in matters of policy.  I have.  It is very unsatisfactory for a Deputy to put down a question and then be told by a Minister that he has no function in the matter at all.  But, when the Budget comes round, we are <Col N="1215" /> responsible then and we are called on to vote the money.  Since we are called upon to put up the money, Deputies should have the right to question the policy of these Boards, because, if we allow these various State bodies to carry on in their own sweet way, they can make mistakes just as well as anybody else.</P>

      <P>Under this, we will have a figurehead Minister supposed to be responsible to this House but unable to say a word should we ask him a question about any of these bodies.  Some citizen, or group of citizens, may have a grievance and, one of these days, we will have a Minister over there; if we put down a question to him about this grievance he will blandly tell us that he has no responsibility.  The Electricity Supply Board grew up on its own.  So did Aer Lingus.  Now we are to have a Minister to look after these.  If we are to have a Minister for that purpose, then he should have some authority.  He should be in a position to interfere&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;if necessary on behalf of any citizen, or citizens, if a complaint comes before this House. The Minister can judge for himself as to whether or not that complaint is justified.  The legislation proposed here puts this Minister in a position in which he has no authority to right a wrong or even investigate a complaint. If it is proposed to appoint a Minister, then let him have the power and authority he should have over State-sponsored bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as any other Deputy that there should be an expansion of State-controlled industry in the economic life of our country.  I want to see both the Socialist type and the capital investment type of industry expanding.  I am sorry the Minister has not made some attempt in this to come to grips with the real problem of parliamentary control of State-sponsored bodies.  I do not subscribe to the suggestion that a Minister should be answerable by way of <Col N="1216" /> Parliamentary Question for the day-to-day activities of a State-sponsored company.  That would be neither feasible nor desirable.  If it were feasible, it could only be done at the sacrifice of the efficiency of the State corporation.  Much as one might like to be in a position to question the activities of a State corporation, I think it would be very wrong to ask such a body to operate under those circumstances.  No private enterprise concern would agree to work under such conditions.  I do not think State Companies should be asked to do so either.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach's general policy statements are implemented and there is greater investment in both State and private enterprise concerns, obviously the day-to-day activities of such concerns could not be subjected to Parliamentary interference.  They must be independent.  As a Socialist, I approve of State enterprise.  I should like to see a much greater expansion of State enterprises.  In its own interests such an enterprise should not permit itself any possible misrepresentation in relation to authoritarianism, or needless bureaucracy, or avoidable red tape.  I have some sympathy with Deputy Dillon's concern for the small man, but it should not be necessary for a Deputy to interfere on behalf of a citizen so far as these State companies are concerned.  It should be possible for a citizen to get justice on his own.  The fact that a Deputy can at the moment get a satisfactory solution to problems that arise in the day-to-day activities of State corporations is a great credit to these bodies. At the same time, there should be some mechanism whereby the citizen will be enabled to maintain his position as the person who pays and consequently the person who should have a reasonable right to question the activities of these corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as general policy and control of these State corporations is concerned, we have that control because we control capital.  If capital is required, the Dáil must be asked to vote the necessary moneys.  We have, therefore, the final say.  It is we who decide whether or not these State companies will expand their activities. <Col N="1217" /> There is, therefore, a safeguard.  So far as the small man <i>vis-a-vis</i> the State company is concerned, there is scope for some machinery to establish his rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> such a company. I could not agree with Deputy Dillon's suggestion, however, that State companies should be answerable by way of Parliamentary question. That would not be feasible at all.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. is a social amenity and, because it is a social amenity, it must of necessity operate at a loss.  It must be remembered that the private enterprise organisations which preceded it were virtually bankrupt.  Whatever case there may be for running transport through the medium of a State corporation no case exists for running it as a private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider setting up some form of Parliamentary commission to consider the whole question of State bodies and State corporations generally in the hope that some machinery might be devised to make these bodies answerable in some way to Parliament without, at the same time, imparing their efficiency?  Many other Parliaments are concerned with this problem at the moment.  It is one we ought to treat seriously, particularly those of us, who, like myself, have a Socialist outlook in these matters and who are anxious that the efficiency of these bodies should not be impared by giving them, so to speak, so much rope that they may be in danger of hanging themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible not to sympathise with the objection which Deputy Dillon has in mind.  At the same time, I am afraid that, if he gets what he wants, he will get the shadow and not really the substance of the scheme of reformation he desires.  The Deputy's suggestion is that a Public Relations Officer should be established, with some kind of independent functions in relation to all State subsidised bodies, and that he should occupy in relation to these bodies the kind of power which the Comptroller and Auditor General occupies in relation to the nation's accounts.  Let us visualise a situation of that kind.  Suppose the Taoiseach were to announce tomorrow <Col N="1218" /> that he had found a wizard who would fill that role and whose function in future would be to investigate any complaints made in respect of State-sponsored bodies.  I do not know how many complaints it is visualised would reach that functionary each year.  If everybody knew he was there for investigating grievance, I would imagine that he would never be out of work and it is conceivable that before many months would pass he would require an augmented staff to investigate all the complaints.</P>
      <P>I have a fear that while that person, when new, might have all the zeal of the convert, that, as time went on, because of the nature of things and his status <i>vis-a-vis</i> Mary Murphy from the west of Ireland, he would, gravitate towards the outlook of those at the top level in the State-sponsored body and ultimately would assimilate the point of view of those who were his social and financial equals and, in fact, would not provide the effective remedy which Deputy Dillon has in mind and on which he relies so much in his suggestion for such an appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a better remedy.  At least, there is one available which ought not be scrapped in preference to that which Deputy Dillon advocates.  There are 146 Deputies in this House, 146 effective, functioning Deputies.  Each of them can be a watchdog for any person who has a grievance against a State-sponsored body.  Each of them has a relationship with the complainant because of his geographical location, which is much better than the relationship that can exist between Mrs. A. and the highly placed public relations officer in Dublin.  I think it is better that Mary White should see Jack Black, the Deputy, and say to him, &ldquo;I have a grievance against the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna&rdquo; and tell him the grievance.  Jack Black, the Deputy, is likely to do a good deal more on behalf of Mary White, the constituent, than Mary will get in service from this highly placed Public Relations Officer in Dublin.  The Deputy is a good weapon from the point of view of the aggrieved constituent.  If he is a competent Deputy and has experience, he <Col N="1219" /> can devise ways and means by which reasonable grievances, not adjusted by the State-sponsored bodies, can be raised in Parliament.  There is a safeguard there that I do not see in the appointment of a public relations officer.</P>
    <P>In addition, so far as State-sponsored bodies in general are concerned, I do not think they look for complaints. When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce I used to receive occasional complaints.  If I put them to the chairman or top level people in the State-sponsored bodies, the anxiety always was to remove the complaint.  Frequently it was mentioned to me: &ldquo;We do not like these complaints.  We try to adjust them and lean back in our efforts to adjust.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is, of course, complaint against the E.S.B.  It is a perennial complaint but that has arisen out of an economic malaise rather than any studied discourtesy on the part of the E.S.B. officials.  That is a general problem. That problem can only be solved by putting more money in the people's pockets and giving them regular employment. That is an economic problem. In general, State-sponsored bodies do not go out of their way to look for trouble.  They are not needlessly brusque with persons with whom they are dealing.  My experience whenever I had to make representations was that they said, &ldquo;There is our case.  We think we have a good case and you have to test that against the case of the complainant&rdquo;.  I have found many cases in which, for the sake of good public relations, they have adjusted complaints of that kind.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the point that I do not think you can allow a State-sponsored body, operating in the interest of the people, democratically recruited, with directors responsible to a Minister, to be made the subject of a whole variety of nagging questions every week in Parliament on administrative matters.  That cannot be done. If there are grievances, the Deputy is there as the first line of defence so far as the public are concerned.  I think he is the best line of defence as I see the situation to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> There may be a case for creating&mdash; I do not think a public relations officer &mdash;but some kind of Parliamentary committee which would examine the activities of these bodies and which perhaps, could be a filtering organisation for grievances which were felt to impose hardship and rigour on sections of the community or a group of persons who had relations with the State-sponsored body but, in our effort to get reasonable protection for the citizen, we must not make the mistake of making the administration of State-sponsored bodies impossible by constant nagging Parliamentary Questions which can only have an impeding effect.  As I said, perhaps some consideration should be given to the question of creating a Parliamentary body which would maintain contact with certain State organisations with a view to ensuring that their administration is of a character that gives maximum service and promotes maximum concord between themselves and the citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem to me that a buffer between the general public and any Department is the elected Deputy.  The Government introduce a Bill creating a Minister for Transport and Power.  As I see the position, practically the entire administration of transport and power is by State or semi-State bodies.  Our position as Deputies in relation to these bodies is that we are unable to put Parliamentary Questions to the Minister to have some matter considered that we, as public representatives, consider has not been sufficiently noted by the body in question.  If we are to have a Minister for Transport and Power, who is concerned with all these bodies, I do not see what function he will serve.  It will put extra expense on the State, to start with, to have an extra Minister.  If we have an extra Minister, let us hope that we will get some benefit from it.  At present, if a Deputy wishes to discuss State-sponsored bodies in Parliament, he can only do so on the occasion of the annual Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in this House for quite a few years.  I have heard many discussions relative to public bodies.  I <Col N="1221" /> have heard references to the E.S.B., Aer Lingus, the Tourist Board, and so on, made on the appropriate Estimate every year.  Very often, a Deputy will speak at considerable length and make very good points.  I do not say in every case but, in many cases, he gets no reply; he gets no satisfaction for the case he has made. It may be that the body concerned read the Official Report and take note of what Deputies say.  The Minister is the defender of the democratic rights of the people, between the Civil Service, the administrators, and the public as a whole.  It is possible, if you do not get satisfaction, to put down a Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>Practically all our transport is State or semi-State controlled and many other concerns are State-sponsored to some extent.  One gets up here each year, when the Estimate comes on, and makes a case relative to the fuel and power of the country but one cannot say anything about it for the next twelve months.  Is it possible for the Minister and the Government, in this Bill, to change that state of affairs?  Deputy Norton says that these Departments would be constantly nagged by questions by Deputies.  I do not agree.  The average Deputy has a high sense of responsibility and he will not bother a Department unless he has good reason to do so.</P>
    <P>Occasions do arise when these bodies may feel for administrative reasons, or because they think it too costly, or because they do not want the trouble, that a question should not be answered.  The Deputy concerned then comes into this House and raises the matter.  My own experience is that I have often raised a question and got a negative answer but a short time later what I had asked to be done was done by the particular Department concerned, probably on the instructions of the Minister.  I suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach, who is sponsoring this Bill, should take this opportunity to ensure that the ordinary Deputy's democratic rights are maintained so that he may be able to make himself fully effective as the instrument elected by the people to look after their interests.</P>

      <P>If there was a Public Relations Officer or some other arrangement for dealing with these matters, I do not think we would have such speeches as that which Deputy <Col N="1223" /> Sherwin has just made.  A Public Relations Officer for the E.S.B. would demolish the statement that it is the practice of the E.S.B. to cut people off on a weekend.  It is not their practice. I thought Deputy O'Malley might be here today as he is reported in the papers as saying that the E.S.B. is dictatorial.  I do not think they are; I do not think that such an attitude could be maintained in this House if there was some way of letting the public know the answers to the various problems.</P>
      <P>The general line of division as regards these public bodies is that general administration and detail are left to the body itself and that policy is laid down by the Government or by a particular Act.  The difficulty is to find some way of giving answers to the complaints that are abroad.  There is a widespread belief that these bodies are acting in a dictatorial way.  I do not agree with that belief.  The record of these bodies is very good.</P>
      <P>In 1948 the first Inter-Party Government was faced with this matter. There was a wide feeling throughout the country that the Government-sponsored bodies were inclined to hide too much behind the cloak of daily administration and that they were hiding things from the public.  There was a threat, which I myself voiced, that we would pull up the blinds on the darkness that shrouded some of these concerns.  The very talk of doing that led to a number of them presenting a much better picture to the public.  They did come out in various ways and gave a great deal more publicity to their doings from 1948 onwards.</P>
      <P>There is no easy solution to this problem.  One method of dealing with it was suggested by a prominent member of the Labour Party in England and that was that a small number of members of the Public Accounts Committee should devote itself to the affairs of one of these bodies each year. That had the disadvantage that it was only an annual business and that each body would be dealt with only about once in every four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Scandinavian procedure in regard to this matter whereby a <Col N="1224" /> section of the Parliament is established to deal with complaints in connection with Government-sponsored bodies.  They bring the complaints to the particular body and see what answers are given.  It is done through the channel of communication between a citizen who feels he is not getting a fair deal and the Board which he accuses of having done him some wrong.  In the Scandinavian procedure, at the end of each year, instead of having Public Accounts Committees which are composed of Parliamentary Deputies and which take the evidence given by Parliamentary Officers, the public is allowed access and their complaints are examined in an open manner outside Parliament altogether.</P>
    <P>Something between these two methods will have to be found because there is that view, though it may not be borne out by the facts, that bodies are reluctant to answer questions and to give certain information, which is a cause of objection amongst citizens. The alert Deputy is probably the best weapon of attack, but he cannot go too far because of the fact that the Minister responsible can always say whatever is in question is a matter of day-to-day administration for the particular body concerned.  I feel that the complaint most commonly made to me is that there is too great an acceptance of the Minister's view of what is day-to-day administration.  There are many times when the dividing link is narrow and, when such a point comes up, I think the Minister charged with the responsibility, or associated with some of these bodies, ought to be critical of himself in raising, as between himself and the Department, the shield of day-to-day administration.  He ought to be more liberal as long as it is not interfering with policy.  He ought to give the elected representative of the public more satisfaction than he gets at the moment.</P>
    <P>Failing that, it would be best to have the public relations type of officer who would be nominated as such and who would have a group of Deputies, interested in a particular subject, allied with him.  That would provide a narrow but clear channel of <Col N="1225" /> approach between the citizen and the State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>On this matter of the new Department, I am more interested in the question of general policy.  The Taoiseach was asked last night would he give us an assurance that there was not going to be more and more Government interference in connection with these bodies.  He said he could give no assurance.</P>

      <P>He stated there was going to be more and more State enterprise but, so far as Departmental control is concerned, is there going to be any further falling away from the situation created by the E.S.B. Act? I think that the E.S.B. has been very seriously weakened in administration. There has been considerable Ministerial interference and I refer particularly to the provision of electricity. Many years ago, at a time when the present Minister for Health was temporarily taking over the duties of Minister for Industry and Commerce, he made the case that it was necessary for the Government to interfere with even a body like the E.S.B., and outside the terms of the E.S.B. Act, in order to ensure that whatever was new Government policy, or adjusted Government policy from time to time, would be followed by a particular board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the pamphlet <i>Economic Development</i> in which Chapter 20 deals with electricity.  It is the most critical chapter in the whole pamphlet and I believe that the Taoiseach knows that.  It deals with investment in electricity and ancillary services.  The capital investment at the time this was written was £100,000,000 of which £23,000,000 was for rural electrification.  Then there is further development over the next five years, <Col N="1226" /> estimated to require £26,000,000, and of that £15,000,000 will have to be found from internal resources and the balance from the recent £5,000,000 public stock issue, leaving a further £11,000,000 to be raised.  Therefore, from the date this was written, and looking five years ahead, the capital of the E.S.B. was deemed to be in the region of £110,000,000 to £112,000,000.</P>
    <P>There is a third paragraph which deals with the magnitude of the investment, and then this critical comment follows:</P>
    <P>The development programme, as outlined in a White Paper published in 1954, was based on an estimated annual average growth in demand for electric current of 13.4 per cent., i.e. on an expectation that demand would double itself every five and a half years.</P>
    <P>The year 1954 was one in which there was a change of Government and that estimate was made out by nobody other than the present Taoiseach.  It was his estimate that the demand for electricity would double itself every five and a half years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have interrupted the quotation to make that comment. The pamphlet says that the programme was based on an estimated annual average growth of 13.4 per cent, that is, on the expectation that demand would double itself every five and a half years.  My comment is that it was the present Taoiseach who was responsible for that estimate.  It was based on a misconception because some O.E.E.C. documents talked about the demand for electricity in various countries doubling itself every five and a half years.  The Taoiseach took the optimistic view that that would happen here, forgetting that the growth in demand in other countries covered by O.E.E.C. was based on the development of heavy industries.  He forgot that there are no heavy industries here.</P>
      <P>The pamphlet continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was related to experience in the pre-war and early postwar years.  The expectation of <Col N="1227" /> such a rapid growth was not realised and early in 1956 the generating programme was revised downwards on the basis of an annual growth of nine per cent, but this has again been too optimistic.  In 1955-56 growth was only 7.6 per cent. and in 1956-57 only 4.7 per cent.  It has risen to 7.7 per cent in 1957-58 (equivalent to a doubling of demand about every nine and a half years) but this rise may have been exceptionally stimulated by the severe weather conditions in the March quarter of 1958.</P>
    <P>That has surely been proved and that 7.7 per cent increase is not likely to be realised in years ahead.</P>
    <P>The pamphlet goes on to say:</P>
    <P>As heavy demand cannot be expected from the bulk of the new consumers remaining to be connected (i.e., persons in the poorer rural areas) and as there is severe competition both in town and country from oil and gases, there is no good reason to suppose that there will be a greatly increased rate of growth in the near future unless a rapid expansion of the economy occurs.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In recent years the provision of generating capacity has run ahead of the country's requirements, and the E.S.B. has surplus capacity, over and above a reasonable reserve for contingencies, which would enable it to supply current of 400-500 million units a year in excess of the present demand of about 1,775 million units. This alone would suffice for almost four years of growth of demand at last year's rate.</P>
    <P>May I interject again that that is the rate of 7.7 per cent increase, not likely to be realised, and even at that rate there was surplus capacity sufficient for almost four years of growth of demand at the exaggerated rate for the previous year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two sentences to go:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The period of excess capacity will be prolonged by the completion of new generating stations now under construction.  The heavy excess investment in plant adds to fixed charges and represents a deadweight burden on the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Who was responsible for that?  Was it not the Taoiseach entirely?  The Minutes of his Department showed it when we examined them.</P>
    <P>They showed that the E.S.B., as a technical body, refused to accept the Minister's estimate with regard to growth of demand, and they were told he would supply the demand.  They were told to go ahead and provide these generating stations and even at a later stage, when the programme was to an extent cut down, the Minister insisted that this excess capacity generating plant should be provided.  We object to this disillusionment of the people.  You have the figure of an independent Electricity Supply Board but in the background there is a Minister interfering, and making them do things which the minutes of Board meetings show they did not want to do, and which having regard to the governing Act, he should not have asked them to do.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to continue on that line I think the sooner we get a radical change and get back to the old idea of the independent Electricity Supply Board the better&mdash;always with this reserve that if any Minister wants to induce the Board, or force the Board, to accept some policy which is more consistent with something that can be done nationally they should come to this House and declare that. Then the Board can protect itself by saying: &ldquo;We did not do this on our own.  This is a matter which is being done, not as a technical matter, but we are doing this now in answer to a national programme.&rdquo;  Then, if there is any failure in the revenue of the particular concern everyone will know where to place the responsibility.</P>
    <P>Last year was, I think, the first year since the formation years, outside the period of five years allowed by legislation for the Board to make its way, in which the E.S.B. showed a deficit.  That is a year in which they were labouring <Col N="1229" /> under a deadweight burden caused by heavy excess investment in plant.  They have not got out of that period yet.</P>

In fact, it is a proposal to expend public money for the purpose of bailing out two or three old Fianna Fáil henchmen around Ballina and North Mayo but it is our duty to examine this proposal in so far as we can with detachment in the light of the report of the Committee set up on the Glenamoy Grass Meal project.  If you turn to paragraph 58 of that report on page 35 you will find it says:&mdash;</P>

    <P>As against a demand of 7,500 tons to 8,500 tons of grass meal, production by the existing factory is expected to reach 11,000 tons so <Col N="1230" /> that there will be a surplus of from 2,500 tons to 3,500 tons.</P>
    <P>That is a surplus for which there is no export market in Great Britain but there is a pious hope expressed that there may be an export market for it in Northern Ireland.

Does the Minister himself believe that there is an export market available for the production of this factory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, because they have this detestable passion for making beggars of our people.  When I was faced with the problem of Glenamoy I cast round to find employment for our people in that area in the enjoyment of which they could hold their heads high and say to all their neighbours that for every penny they earned they gave more than the money's worth.  We established a research station there to carry out work of incalculable value and every man who earns a day's pay on that work is in a position to say that there is nobody in the State giving better value for the money they get.  That is the kind of employment I would like to see my neighbours have in Mayo or in any other part of the congested areas of the Gaeltacht.  But Fianna Fáil's plan always is either to provide them with relief works digging holes and filling them up again or else put them growing grass on bogs to convert it into grass meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why have they got that mentality? Why do they always want to introduce relief schemes into the lives of their own neighbours?  Have they got obsessed with the idea that nobody living west of the Shannon can earn an honest day's pay?  That is not true. What the people of that part of the country want is an opportunity to work for wages and give full value for the wages they get.  There are means&mdash;and <Col N="1231" /> it is our job to find them&mdash;of providing the people with that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister adverted to this? There is one charge that none of the costings in this report appear to have taken into consideration.  There will be pretty substantial transport charges for bringing the men to this work.  I do not know how many it is hoped to see employed in this enterprise but if any substantial volume of employment is provided they will have to be carried over some considerable distance to the site where this project will be put in hands.  I think a considerable number of those working at the research station have to come out from Ballina every day to their work because there is no housing accommodation in that area and you cannot ask men, in that kind of countryside, to cycle eight or ten miles to work every day.  That is going to be an added cost on the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister made any estimate of the available labour supply in this area?  When he has made provision for the labour requirements of the Bord na Móna work in association with the E.S.B. in that immediate neighbourhood, will there be labour available within reasonable distance of this enterprise to man whatever work has to be done in connection with this project?</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to ask the Minister this question.  The whole of this project is so fantastic and grotesque that it is hard to treat it seriously at all. There is in existence in this country at present a considerable number of private firms who bought their own equipment and, without any financial assistance from anybody, established themselves in the business of grass meal.  At present they are producing 25 per cent. more grass meal than the domestic market is in a position to consume.  We know that in Great Britain, where there was a considerable market for this product immediately after the war&mdash;largely in the preparation of compound pellets for feeding fowl in backyards when eggs were extremely scarce&mdash;the market has collapsed. We know that, prior to the date of this committee taking evidence, four plants had closed down in Great <Col N="1232" /> Britain.  We know that since that report was compiled several more plants have closed down.  We know that the demand for grass meal as a constituent of compound feeding stuffs is fading out and its place is being taken by alternative sources of protein and synthetic vitamins.  We know that, as the demand declines, the competition for whatever residue of trade remains will become more and more acute.  Therefore, the tendency for the least economically circumstanced grass meal plants in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and here to go to the wall is growing.</P>
    <P>It is at that stage that we propose to retire to a site 25 miles west of Killala to grow, on blanket bog, grass to be converted into grass meal, the ultimate point of consumption of which, we hope, will be Northern Ireland where we know they are already producing their own grass meal and where they have unlimited access to a grass meal industry in Great Britain whose domestic market is shrinking away to the point that plants are closing down.</P>
    <P>And all this against the background of a programme for economic development where we are told nothing but the highest efficiency holds any prospect of success for any economic development in this country.</P>
    <P>This kind of daftness demoralises the whole community.  How you can go to farmers and tell them they must bring their activities up-to-date, how you can go to any section of the community and tell them they must give up restrictive practices or increase production by increased efficiency and, at the same time, sponsor a project of this kind, even on the basis of the terms of this report&mdash;which leant backwards for the purpose of giving the Government some grounds on which they could revive this idiotic proposal&mdash;is a mystery to me.  This is a pure political stunt for the useless expenditure of public money in a restricted area of North Mayo to prop up the fading fortune of a small group of Fianna Fáil supporters in that area.</P>
    <P>In the name of public decency, may I make one petition?  A Board of Directors will be set up to run this yoke.  Would they at least have the <Col N="1233" /> decency to function in an honorary capacity?  There would be some salvage of public decency if the local persons interested in this enterprise would make a gesture of public service and say:&mdash;&ldquo;Our prime concern is to get employment for our neighbours in Mayo and we are very willing and anxious to function in an honorary capacity.  We do not want any of the boodle for ourselves.&rdquo;  If they are not prepared to do that, may I suggest to the Minister that no Board should be set up but that it should be run by some responsible civil servant in his Department?</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous, it is a public scandal, it is disreputable to take a group of five or six old hacks from North Mayo and furnish them each with a couple of hundred pounds a year for acting as directors of this fraudulent enterprise. If there are some old warriors down there who want to swagger about as directors of the grass meal plant, let them swagger, but not at the expense of the public.  If they are not prepared to do their swaggering in an honorary capacity, then tell them they are not wanted.  We ran the research station at Glenamoy very effectively from the Department of Agriculture, and it involved a great deal more complicated work than this piece of codology will ever require.</P>
    <P>If the public spirited gentlemen in Ballina are not prepared to work in an honorary capacity as directors of this, then I urge strongly on the Minister that he should appoint two or three civil servants of his Department and let them run it.  It will probably involve a lesser loss of public money if two or three conscientious civil servants are running it than if you get local people to act as directors.  But, in the name of public decency, do not let us have them functioning for what they can get out of it.  That would be the last step in degradation, that we should promote a Bill in this House for the provision of five jobs for five Fianna Fáil hacks in North Mayo.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dillon wants to describe them as lunatics, I cannot help that.  It is my privilege to know two or three of that committee. They are as decent, as upright and as honest as any to be found anywhere else in the country.  I do not mind what opinion Deputy Dillon holds.  The people of North Mayo will be able to form their own opinion as to whether or not these are good people or bad people.  Equally they will be able to form their opinion as to the relative merits of the sanity of these people and that of Deputy Dillon.  These good, sensible people are vilified because Deputy Dillon thinks it would be a dreadful thing to grow grass in Glenamoy for the purpose of making grass meal.  Deputy Dillon boasts about Peatlands.  Peatlands would never have gone into Glenamoy were it not for the fact that Fianna Fáil had started the grass meal project there.  Deputy Dillon discovered that certain work had been done by the grass meal people.  He set up his committee in 1954 or 1955 and they reported back that there was no market for grass meal and that Glenamoy was unsuitable for the production of grass for conversion into grass meal.  Now that Fianna Fáil are restoring the grass meal project Deputy Dillon adopts the same attitude.  I am proud to stand up here as a member of Fianna Fáil, the Party responsible for the restoration of the grass meal project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grass meal project will be of tremendous benefit to the people in the area.  These people are as deserving of employment as those in other areas. There is no hope of migrating the people because the cost of migration would be in the neighbourhood of <Col N="1235" /> £3,000 per family.  The Grass Meal Committee are quite confident that grass can be grown and that that grass is suitable for conversion into grass meal.  They are also quite confident they will get a market for it.  If they are satisfied I do not see why Deputy Dillon should have ground for dissatisfaction because of the restoration of the project.</P>
    <P>The 1958 report says that after a period of five years it should be possible to get 2½ tons of grass meal per statute acre.  Similarly, after a period of five years that should be produced without the aid of subsidy.  That is the committee's opinion.  We, in North Mayo, will be delighted to have this grass meal factory.  We have been told that there will be no difficulty in getting an export market.  I have travelled the area on various occasions and I know that the grass set there in 1954 is still there today.  I was in the Dooleeg area eight miles from the bog and I saw the grass growing between the tracks on the railway line. It was really amazing.  I do not understand why this grass would not be suitable for conversion into grass meal. I am glad Fianna Fail has decided to go ahead with the project.  This is one of the poorest areas in Ireland.  The farms are small.  The establishment of this factory will be a boon and a benefit not only to the people of Glenamoy but to the people of North Mayo as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the report of the committee on the Glenamoy grass meal project.  Two years ago this committee were given the task of making inquiries.  Their terms of reference included the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whether grass meal can be produced competitively from grass grown on reclaimed bog land without a continuing subsidy;</P>
      <P>Whether a market over and above that catered for, or likely to be catered for, by existing grass meal producers would be available for the output of such project;</P>
      <P>If the revival of the project is considered to be practicable on an economic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I submit that, on those grounds, the project cannot possibly stand.  We all subscribe to the sentiments voiced by Deputy Calleary about the necessity for providing employment in Mayo, and in many other parts of the country as well, including my own constituency; but, if we are to approach his project on the ground that it is to be an economic proposition, catering for an existing or potential market, I do not see how it can possibly succeed.</P>
    <P>This committee, which accepted its terms of reference two years ago as including the establishment of the grass meal project on an economic basis without a continuing subsidy, finished by including in their recommendations a recommendation that an independent statutory company should be established to operate the project and that that company should be provided with a sum not exceeding £165,000 by way of a non-repayable free grant to defray capital expenses and a further sum of £30,000 in the form of share capital for working capital&mdash;that is £195,000, or almost £200,000 altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think I am correct in saying, proposes to finance this by a somewhat different method.  He is not giving the £165,000 by way of non-repayable grant.  He is making up to £200,000 available by way of share capital, by taking up that amount of shares, if necessary, in the company. I think that is a difference without a distinction.  It means the company will start with accommodation up to £200,000.  They will not be called upon to pay a dividend or interest, I assume.  Therefore, to all intents and purposes, they will have a continuing subsidy of at least £10,000 or £12,000 a year, if one accepts the normal bank interest rates for this substantial sum.</P>
    <P>If the plan is to produce 1,000 tons of grass meal per year that will be the equivalent of a subsidy of £10 or £12 per ton.  If the output is 2,000 tons that will be the equivalent of a subsidy of £5 or £6 per ton.  On that basis, I think the company could possibly carry on although, for reasons which I propose to mention shortly, I think, even with that very substantial assistance, the project could not hope <Col N="1237" /> to succeed or establish itself on a permanent basis, with conditions as I see them.</P>
    <P>This whole business, as the committee pointed out in their report, began by the establishment of the original grass meal board under the Grass Meal Production Act, 1953, which set up Min-Fheir Teo., and gave it a share capital of £100,000 with an opportunity to get grants, as mentioned in the report, of £165,000.  As Deputy Calleary mentioned, when the inter-Party Government came into office in 1954, they set up an inter-Departmental committee which issued an interim report in October, 1954, advising the suspension of development and the continuation of bog reclamation to maintain the existing labour force.</P>
    <P>This inter-Departmental committee issued a final report in February 1955 recommending the abandonment of the grass meal project, that part of the land at Glenamoy should be acquired by the Department of Agriculture for experimental purposes and that the remainder should be acquired by the Forestry Department of the Department of Lands for afforestation.  That was the development which was proceeding and which, I presume, is still proceeding in this area.</P>
    <P>Up to 1958, again according to the Committee's Report, some 600 acres were under various experiments such as grazing, planting of shelter belts, etc. and some 480 acres had been fenced and planted by the Department of Lands under the afforestation project, so that some work, evidently, has been done there and has given good local employment, and it appears to be the type of work that could reasonably be regarded as giving permanent employment.</P>
    <P>There are two points on which I should like particularly to comment. One has already been mentioned by Deputy Dillon, that is, the question of the market for dried grass meal, which is covered extensively in the Committee's Report on pages 30 to 32, and certainly the Committee have given a very factual and very fair picture of the actual and potential market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> To sum up the position briefly, as I see it, the present grass meal manufacturers, of whom there are eight or ten in the country, can, without addition to their present plant, manufacture the entire current requirements and likely future requirements of the Twenty-Six Counties as regards dried grass meal. It is estimated that the requirements of the Twenty-Six Counties are in the nature of 7,000 to 8,000 tons of grass meal per year and these plants are in a position to manufacture some 11,000 tons of dried grass meal.  That means, in effect, that they must of necessity depend on an export market to get rid of the current surplus production and, up to date, that market has been provided by the Six Counties, which has taken from 2,000 to 3,000 tons of dried grass meal annually over the past couple of years.  If anything should happen to that market it would mean that there would be surplus production in the Twenty-Six Counties of some 3,000 tons of dried grass meal.  I do not think it is impossible to visualise that something might happen to that market in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are about 1,000 tons of dried grass meal manufactured each year in the Six Counties by local manufacturers.  They import about 3,000 tons, as I have stated, from the Twenty-Six Counties and the balance is made up by imports, mainly from Great Britain.  The expansion that has taken place in the Twenty-Six Counties drying plant has been largely encouraged by the fact that this market existed in the Six Counties but if another producer comes into being within the next few years with a capacity, as has been suggested in this report, of 2,000 to 3,000 tons, it is sensible to visualise that a very serious situation could arise for the existing producers if a surplus of several thousand tons of dried grass meal were thrown on the market.</P>
    <P>In England, the State encouraged the manufacture of dried grass meal and when the slump came some few years ago, when the demand for dried grass meal dropped from about 250,000 tons a year to about half that amount, the State-owned dried grass meal factories dumped their production on the <Col N="1239" /> market, causing considerable distress to the privately-owned plants and putting some of them out of production.</P>
    <P>The fact that the English manufacturer has not taken a more active interest in the Six County market is due to several reasons, again mentioned in the Report.  One is the fact that, generally, the demand for dried grass meal from the manufacturers of feeding stuffs has fallen substantially but a further consideration, also mentioned in the Report, is that for the past two or three years the seasons for growing grass for the dried grass meal plants have been unsatisfactory. It is reasonable to assume that they will not continue to have unsatisfactory weather in England and that, sooner or later, a substantial crop of grass for drying will be produced and that manufacturers in the Twenty-Six Counties can anticipate active competition with manufacturers in Great Britain for the Six Counties market.</P>
    <P>In saying that, let me make my position quite clear.  I am not afraid of competition and I am quite satisfied that the manufacturers down here, provided they are given a fair opportunity, can compete with their counterparts in Great Britain but the trouble is that they may not be given a fair opportunity and there may be restrictions put on them with regard to the export of their dried grass meal into the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to consider some of the economics of this grass meal production, particularly with regard to the question of costs.  Costs are referred to in the Committee's Report, again in great detail, which are certainly very interesting, on pages 22 to 28.  The Committee refer to several costings which they received, some which they got from the previous inter-Departmental report, some they acquired from manufacturers both inside and outside the country, and some which they got from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about these figures is the variation between the different sets of costings.  The costings given by the original company, Min-Fheir Teoranta, in 1954-55, were about £22 per ton.  These have gone up <Col N="1240" /> until we get the figure of about £28 per ton, not including freight.  I do not know what reason the members of the Committee had for stating so categorically that the drying of the grass meal grown at Glenamoy would approximate closely to that grown elsewhere.  The existing dried grass meal producers had considerable experience in the early days of their operation and lost considerable sums of money before getting their plants on an economic basis.  I think it is only fair to assume that any new plants starting off now will go through the same teething troubles.  The project on Gowla Bog by the Irish Sugar Company also ran into considerable difficulties.  We have proof that this grass meal project is a very difficult and highly technical business that only experience over a number of years can solve.</P>
    <P>I wonder does anybody know whether the grass grown at Glenamoy can be dried and made into satisfactory dried grass meal.  Grass grown on good mineral soils can be manufactured into high and medium grade dry grass meal but the Government now proposes to jump into a new project to manufacture dried grass from a raw material on which no previous tests have been made, as far as I am aware. Any manufacturer who wants to start a new type of industry will first of all make some experiments to find out if he is tackling a practical proposition. No suggestion appears to have been made, however, that this should be tackled on other than a substantial scale.  Before proceeding to that degree of expenditure some tests should be made either by a pilot plant, some of which already exist in the country, or with the co-operation of some of the existing grass meal driers.  Their co-operation should be sought to test the grass but not in a plant costing £25,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that before embarking on this project some experiments should be conducted at a smaller initial cost to the taxpayer. Why not try making the grass into silage for use for feeding in the winter?  Considerable employment could be given if the present activities <Col N="1241" /> were extended.  There would be much useful employment for farmers and others living in the area.</P>
    <P>The question of the social value of this whole project cannot be overlooked. Although this was not one of the terms of reference of the Committee I notice that they have referred to it in their report.  I do feel that a more permanent type of employment could be given by concentrating on existing projects for the growing of grass, for the drainage and maintenance of the bogs and that the question of going into the business of dried grass should be done in very slow stages.  As I have already said, it is a highly technical industry and one in which we ought to go very slowly.  Otherwise we will find that we shall spend a considerable amount of money, give employment to quite a number of men and then, in a few years, find that the Minister has to come back to the House to look for more money to keep the industry going because so many men are employed there.</P>
    <P>That is an appeal that no Dáil could refuse but in the general interests of the taxpayer it would be far better if the whole project were considered at much greater length and in much greater detail.  Personally, I do not feel that it will be an economic project.  I feel that ultimately we shall be faced with a surplus on the market and that the existing privately-owned plants would either have to go out of business or not be able to pay their way.  The Minister will agree that we do owe it to men who have put capital into an undertaking that we should leave them in business and not compete unfairly with them.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to be critical of this project because I sympathise with the sentiments of Deputy Calleary which are my own sentiments as far as Limerick is concerned.  Having regard to the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach with regard to the necessity to become more efficient, to produce more and to set one another an example of hard work, I think it would be better if the Minister thought again about the whole project.  I think it would be bad policy to start something <Col N="1242" /> that may not show a substantial return and that may not be permanent.  It would be better not to start it at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would do well to consider carefully the neutral appraisal of this scheme which has just been given to the House by Deputy Russell.  Deputy Russell must be regarded as one who speaks completely neutrally on a matter of this kind.  He has approached the matter sympathetically from the social point of view and he has approached it equally critically from the business point of view.</P>
      <P>I know as surely as I am speaking at this moment that whatever I shall say in relation to this proposal will be twisted and misrepresented by my political opponents with their characteristic fraudulent ingenuity.  That gives me no cause for worry.  I am not perturbed by the flamboyant phrases of Deputy Calleary who says that he is proud to be a member of Fianna Fáil and proud that Fianna Fáil is starting this business again.  Far from being perturbed, I am equally confident that these flamboyant phrases will not be as successful as they formerly were in deluding our people.</P>
      <P>This project was originally started in this area as a grass meal project, designed not for the conversion of grass into grass meal, but to capture a vote that was lost in that area, and has remained lost ever since.  Therefore, in that capacity, in its initial stages this project failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was examined in the later days of 1954, or 1955, by an inter-Departmental committee who made recommendations that it be discontinued, not because it was started by Fianna Fáil but because nobody could hope that, economically, it would survive and, faced with economic failure in the absence of repeated subsidies, one would be quite justified in regarding it as a social failure too.  Any project in the experimental course of which the people employed there had been apprehensive from season to season&mdash;as they were during the course of the initial grass meal operations in that area&mdash; could not be regarded as healthy, could <Col N="1243" /> not be regarded as something which would give to them that stability of residence for which they hoped, and for which we all hoped.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me, representing this area, to decry any effort made by any Government to give employment, but I do not think even the people themselves would welcome employment which to them was, at least, in a rickety condition and which from year to year gave rise to apprehension as to its continuance.  During those initial years, while this project was being conducted on an experimental basis in that area, the maximum number employed, apart from executive staff, reached 23.  That figure may, or may not, be exactly correct but at any rate the number employed was in or around that figure.  Within a very short time of the change-over from that political scheme to the practical scheme, fostered by the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands, the labour content rose threefold in a very short time. In addition, the work carried on by Peatlands and the forestry people, was of special value from the point of view of teaching the people how to use that particular kind of bog by way of reclamation, without having to go through the old system of cutting turf practically to the gravel beforehand.</P>
    <P>Peatlands is an excellent institution, excellently run, giving excellent, permanent work.  Deputy Russell says it is something of which he does not claim any personal knowledge but it is something of which I can speak with personal knowledge.  This is a scheme which can be extended, and should be extended with the money now being set aside for the purposes of alleviating political pique.  I am sure that if I, or the two Deputies representing Fianna Fáil in North Mayo, were given £200,000 to relieve the unemployment situation in that area, I am certain that not one of the three of us would choose to set up a company, in the first instance, and start on a scheme of which we already had nearly two years' experience prior to its discontinuance and of which this committee says, on page 37 of the Report:</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the project would be <Col N="1244" /> experimental to a certain degree in the early years; while the Irish Sugar Company's work at Gowla provides very valuable information regarding the production of grass meal on reclaimed bogland, it is doubtful if it provides answers to all the problems which may arise on the different type of bog at Glenamoy.</P>
    <P>Following on the experience gained at Peatlands, why cannot the Government benefit from that?  Speaking of Peatlands, it is interesting to note that on next Monday, in spite of the fact that it is in operation since 1955 or early 1956, the Minister for Agriculture will travel all the way to Glenamoy to open Peatlands officially.  It is a political ramp but I shall be there, please God, and on some future occasion I shall be able to give the House my assessment of the value of his visit and the purposes for which he made it.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is before the House, I think in Committee Stage, an Undeveloped Areas Bill under which the Government proposes to abandon the areas scheduled under the 1952 Undeveloped Areas Act, but here we have them going blindly ahead with the full experiment to restore a scheme, the soundness of which has not been determined.  I am not impressed by a report which says in five years they should be able to go ahead without a subsidy, particularly in relation to its reference to exports.</P>
    <P>On the question of exports, it would appear to me from the point of view of demand generally, that the home market is already adequately supplied. On page 32, paragraph 52, we find the Report saying:</P>
    <P>The Six County market, however, seems to offer the only worthwhile export outlet.  Occasional lots of grass meal have been exported to Britain and the Far East, but there is little prospect of developing any regular trade.  The most that can be hoped for in Britain is that there may be periodic shortages, as any likelihood of a continued shortage would possibly encourage the reopening of plants there which went out of production in the last 3 or 4 years; and in regard to the Far East, <Col N="1245" /> the high cost of trans-shipment and the availability of meal at low prices from other sources, make the export of grass meal from this country to such places as Singapore impracticable. The position on the Continent is that there is a surplus of production.</P>
    <P>That paragraph alone justifies Deputy Russell's neutral appraisal of this project.  Grass can be grown on blanket bog&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;just as it can be grown on land that is nurtured from reclaimed bog. It is all very much the same; it is a question of depth.  But is it the kind of grass suitable for conversion into grass meal?  Has it the quality and substance requisite for conversion profitably and is it marketable profitably, apart altogether from the fact that there might or might not be a market for it?</P>
    <P>Two hundred thousand pounds is a lot of money and this, of course, is only the begining; we shall be back for more.  That sum would give a lot of employment on very necessary drainage all over this area.  It would contribute a great deal toward the reclamation of individual holdings.  Instead, £200,000 is to be put into a bog for the growing of grass for conversion into grass meal at a time when the small holders in this area have been denied the benefits of Section B of the Land project.  The whole thing does not make sense.  There is fishing over all this area in the different villages and in villages quite close to Glenamoy, but nothing is done to develop the fishing industry.  I can recall in one area where a very necessary slip costing £1,400 was sanctioned in February in 1957 by Deputy Sweetman, then Minister for Finance.  It has not yet been provided because it is situated, quite by accident, in an area that is predominantly Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Who are likely to be the members of this company?  We know who they were before and we know what their qualifications were.  They had simply one qualification&mdash;to have given long and valuable service to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Of what possible degree of competence on a board such as this, <Col N="1246" /> of a Company such as this charged with the growing of grass on a bog for conversion into grass meal, would a garage proprietor be?  What purpose could be served by having officials of a local authority as members of this Board?  And, as Deputy Dillon put it, they are not honorary; the charge in director's fees is to follow in due course.  If, under the guise of doing a service to the people of an area, money is to be spent by this Government to pay the Party followers then you are not doing a service; you are only holding the Government up to ridicule.</P>
    <P>Anybody who wishes can watch. This Bill, of course, will go through the House; nobody can stop it.  Let us watch with interest the composition of the Board of this company.  Let us watch with equal interest the solicitors who will be chosen to form this company. Let us watch with further interest to see who will be appointed secretary to the company locally.  Then we have the start again of something that obtained before, which does not obtain in Peatlands now or since its inception&mdash;that to get a job on this grass meal project you will have to have a note from the secretary of the company, carefully selected, or from some one or two of my colleagues in North Mayo.  That was the situation before and there is no reason to expect any change.</P>
    <P>If this Government have money to spend in this area there are other ways in which it could be done, ways which would ensure greater benefit to the people and to a greater number of people.  Extend the Peatlands; do the necessary drainage and the necessary reclamation on individual farms; extend the fishing facilities all over the North Mayo coast.  Give a lead to the people of the area and give them a new life instead of embarking upon a project such as this designed to catch votes, a project which cannot fulfil its stated objective but which may, for a little time at any rate, fulfil the fraudulent objective of Party advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give Deputy Breslin credit for genuinely misunderstanding what this Bill will do.  None of us would disagree with his sentiments that it is desirable to do what we <Col N="1248" /> can to ensure that the people in western areas have employment in those areas and that proper projects in those areas are preferable to migration. But, frankly, I do not think that Deputy Breslin knows or understands what is involved in this project.</P>
      <P>Some six years ago the Minister, when he was a Parliamentary Secretary, first brought the grass meal scheme into the House.  I do not know whether he has changed any of the views he held then in respect of the objects of this proposal.  He did not tell us that he had, and so we must assume that he has not.  He did not tell us either whether he still likes dancing over the bog, chasing the medicinal herbs, on which he gave us a treatise on that occasion.  But neither he nor anybody else has found those herbs since.  As far as that was concerned, it was entirely a will-o'-the-wisp.</P>
      <P>Any proposal put forward must be treated under three separate headings:&mdash; firstly, the usefulness of the product to be made and its saleability; secondly, the employment that will be given in the making of that product; and, thirdly, what will be left after the raw material has been taken away.  As far as the product of the grass meal factory is concerned, I do not believe there will be a market for it except by displacing the products of other similar projects already in operation here.  Nobody can deny that the home market for grass meal at present is already amply filled.  Some grass meal is being exported to the Six Counties. But the export market, such as there ever was, has already collapsed disastrously in Britain during the past three years.  That is bound to have its repercussions on the export market in the Six Counties.  It is not referred to in the last report of the Committee, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that when the inter-Departmental Committee was set up and when they interviewed the directors of the former grass meal project, the chairman of the then company was asked a specific question. He was asked whether they had any intention of entering the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Scanlon, the then chairman, replied by saying that they had not considered that point but he saw no <Col N="1249" /> prospect of exports.  He gave as a reason that the price of grass meal in England was £22 per ton.  That is not referred to in the printed report.  But it is a fact, and it was one of the facts before me at the time the decision was taken by us in 1955 in relation to this project.  Reference to the notes and the minutes available of the various meetings of that inter-Departmental Committee will show that the statement I have made is correct.  I want it to be quite clear that, in making any reference to the inter-Departmental committee, I am not trying to shelter behind the view of any civil servant. The decision was taken by us as a Government.  It was our decision and not a Civil Service decision.  Civil servants were used, as they should be used, for the purpose of assimilating facts upon which Ministers can take decisions in relation to policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to this project, irrespective of what may be suggested, there will be no prospect of selling its products except by depriving existing concerns of their existing markets.  I do not see any advantage to the national economy in taking people from one place and putting them into employment somewhere else if, at the same time, people are put out of employment in another part of the country.  That is crazy economics and will not get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any knowledge of the operations of existing grass meal concerns.  They will tell him that they are put to the pin of their collar to try to sell their output and that, in many cases, they are finding it difficult to dispose of their output.  Here, it is proposed to provide taxpayers' money.  With that taxpayers' money we shall subsidise another grass meal project, a project which will have the effect of taking away the business certain taxpayers already have.  I cannot see where there is any benefit to the economy in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is axiomatic that grass produced on bog will be dearer for the production of grass meal as against grass produced elsewhere.  Grass meal is not an end product.  It is one of the raw materials of agricultural development. If it is the intention to build <Col N="1250" /> our agricultural development on increasing the price of the raw materials for that industry, then we shall in consequence get shut out of our end product.  That is one of the lessons drawn clearly and concisely in the grey book&mdash;<i>Economic Development.</i>  It cannot be cheaper to make grass meal on blanket bog as against grass meal produced on mineral rich soils.  Even with the provision of £200,000 by way of subsidy, it will still be physically impossible.</P>
    <P>When the Minister brought in his Bill in 1953 he told us he had got a great deal of advice in the matter.  It may interest him and the House to know that when, in the fullness of time, it became necessary for me to look for that advice on the files of Government Departments, I and my colleagues failed to find it.  I do not know whether the Minister is merely standing now upon this committee's report or whether he wants to justify what he said before.  Certainly any advice he got did not come through normal Government channels.</P>
    <P>As regards the product, we have a situation which is clear beyond question. The market for grass meal is declining.  Existing concerns are more than able to cater for the present home market.  Grass meal produced from a bog area must be dearer, even with a free capital subsidy, than grass meal produced in other areas.  If we increase the price to enable this concern to operate without a subsidy, we shall increase the cost of raw material for agriculture and we may considerably affect, therefore, some of our end product trades which might use grass meal.  The grey book committee's report&mdash;I call it that to distinguish it from the Departmental committee's report&mdash;made it clear that they were considering the possibility of its being necessary to make it compulsory for people to use the grass meal provided in this way, notwithstanding the price, notwithstanding modern development in relation to the provision of vitamin in this way or, indeed, in relation to the provision of carotin as well.  I cannot see any prospect of success in relation to the first part.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second part, I <Col N="1251" /> should like now to remind the Minister of what he said when he was introducing this project originally.  He made it clear at that time that the purpose was not primarily one of providing employment.  I think the employment provided on a grassmeal plant would be very small indeed.  Speaking at column 1000 of the Official Report, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, I think, was fairly accurate in assessing the cost of drying the estimated output of grass.  However, we must realise the drying end of it is really very secondary.  As regards the employment content of the whole scheme, the actual number engaged on drying will be very small....</P>
    <P>I think that is still the position to-day. The number will be trifling.  The project will have no impact at all on unemployment or on the social aspect of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not worry.  The grey book committee, in dealing with the social aspect completely misconstrued&mdash;in some cases possibly deliberately, though not in all &mdash;the potential employment on the grass meal project.  I shall come back to this again.  Let the Minister not be in any anxiety.  I shall quote the remainder of his remarks, but they relate to the third aspect of the project and not to the second aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual factory employment is of no consequence at all.  I think the numbers were quoted at an earlier stage.  The Parliamentary Secretary said at the time that employment was not the primary purpose.  We have a situation then in which it is clear beyond denial that the project will not be satisfactory from an economic point of view.  The employment will be negligible.  There is then the third point.  It is of importance that we should understand exactly where we are travelling in this regard, namely, <Col N="1252" /> in finding some method of utilising blanket bog on a permanent basis. When dealing with employment in 1953 the Minister, deliberately in my view, tried to confuse the employment given in the factory and the employment given on the blanket bog.</P>
    <P>The employment that will be given on the blanket bog for the provision of the appropriate amount of bog for the production of grass meal is equally almost negligible.  As I said a second ago, his quotation was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As regards the employment content of the whole scheme, the actual number engaged on drying will be very small, that is, in relation to the number of men who, first of all, will attempt the drainage and the cultivation of the bog, the fertilising of the bog and the cutting of the grass.</P>
    <P>Even on his own admission, the grass meal section of the project has virtually no employment content but there is something that could be done, and to do which steps were being taken, that would produce an employment content that was really worth while in the blanket bog of the West.  There is something that would solve the problem of which Deputy Breslin spoke a few minutes ago, and avoid the necessity for emigration, that is, to utilise and to find a method of utilising the vast expanses of blanket bog that there are in the West for the purpose of agriculture.</P>
    <P>This scheme is going to deal with what?  At the best, 1,500 acres.  I would be surprised if, in fact, it ever deals with anything like as much as that, even with the amount of the subsidy that is being made available here.  Fifteen hundred acres of blanket bog is a drop in the ocean of blanket bog in the West of Ireland and to suggest, as the Minister in his then capacity of Parliamentary Secretary tried to suggest at that time, that this scheme would have some impact on what was necessary in that blanket bog country was&mdash;shall I put it charitably? &mdash;entirely erroneous and showed complete lack of understanding of the problem.</P>
    <P>The biggest thing that has been undertaken in relation to the West of <Col N="1253" /> Ireland in recent years has been the Peatlands Experimental Station at Glenamoy.  Let me give this crumb of praise to Fianna Fáil in respect of it&mdash;that when we were thinking about it before, it is possible that it might not have come quite so fast from us except that it was a desirable way to provide at once scope and employment for the people who were going to be disemployed as a result of the termination, and the correct termination, by us, of this crazy scheme.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Fianna Fáil Party at least that little piece of credit.  They are entitled to that crumb of credit that perhaps the crazy scheme that they produced and the necessity to deal with the small number of employees that were involved did bring on the Peatlands Experimental Station by some six months or so.  But anybody who imagines that there is going to be any real end result from the grass meal station in relation to solving any of the problems of the West is either a child or a knave because it is obvious that the tinkering that there would be on 1,500 acres could not possibly have that result.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the work that has been done on the Peatlands Experimental Station&mdash;it was done by Dr. Walsh when he was in the Department of Agriculture and in charge of the study group on that and it will be continued, I am glad to say, by him now as a Director of the Agricultural Institute&mdash;has shown that there are possibilities in that respect.  If it was desirable to sink another £200,000 in some type of work that would improve the lot of the people in the western areas, it would have been far better, from every point of view, from the point of view of employment, from the point of view of the future, from the point of view of the national economy as a whole, that a similar area would have been taken, say, in Kerry and another area in another part of the country where there is blanket bog and that there would be real development from the Peatlands Station at Glenamoy, rather than that the money should be sunk in this way, which will not be a success, which will cost the community heavily and which will put people out of employment in <Col N="1254" /> other parts of the country.  For every man who is put into employment here, another man in another part of the country will go.</P>
    <P>All the forecasts by the people who were backing this Glenamoy scheme, in relation to the home market, in relation to price, in relation to sales, in relation to export markets&mdash;every single one of them has been proved to be wrong in the years that are gone.  Not one single one of them has been right.  Indeed, ask anyone&mdash; ask the members of this &ldquo;grey&rdquo; committee&mdash;shall I call them&mdash;to make a similar report today and they would have to come back and tell the House that since they reported, since they got their figures, about a year ago&mdash;and their figures were not quite up to date then&mdash;the position has still further deteriorated.</P>
    <P>I cannot see this as anything except an obstinate, pigheaded attempt by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues to try to justify something that was done before by them and that is not justifiable. They would have been far more honest and would have got far more political credit if they had been open about it and said, &ldquo;We want to do something for the western areas. The development of blanket bog for proper agricultural uses does show some chance of success.  The work that has been done in that regard in the last two years, in building rafts on which farm buildings would be erected, in the method of draining, in the method of fertilising, in the method of utilisation, from an agricultural point of view, shows some promise that, if it is brought to fruition, will mean something very, very big for the West, and therefore we are going to utilise funds for that purpose and, if we achieve that purpose, we can make a real indentation on the social and economic problems of what we are terming, in another Bill, the undeveloped areas in Mayo&mdash;West Mayo, particularly&rdquo;.  But, they have thrown away that chance and, instead of being big enough to admit that, as everybody knows, they made a mistake in relation to end utilisation of the bog, they come to the House, merely to justify themselves, for political ends, <Col N="1255" /> without any real thought or real feeling for the people who will be involved in the West.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman have reminded me of the passage of the principal Act through the House when I was a Parliamentary Secretary.  I could not help thinking of going back a few months before the introduction of that Act and Bill, when I had just been appointed a Parliamentary Secretary with special responsibility for the western areas, and visited some parts of the West and went to the bog in the Glenamoy area.  As I said during the course of the debate in 1953 I was amazed at the extent of the waste land that I saw there.</P>
      <P>When I returned from that visit, in my lack of knowledge of the type of bog there, I inquired whether Bord na Móna could not be induced to extend its operations over that part of the bog which is now being utilised in connection with the Peatlands research station.  I was told that it was a particular type of bog which was too shallow for widespread turf production but which might be used for agricultural production at a later stage, given the proper drainage and other treatment. Subsequent to that I visited the Gowla bog which is of a type different from the Glenamoy bog.  I saw there certain reclaimed lands in full production which I was told had been a vast damp waste for generations prior to that.  I am not suggesting that I got the idea of producing grass on Glenamoy straight away but it was suggested by a number of people that the best utilisation of Glenamoy would be for the growing of grass for grass meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the introduction of the measure setting up Min-Fhéir Teoranta it was stated that one of its purposes was the production of grass meal but that it was also intended to bring that bogland back into production for agricultural purposes.  The intention was that having drained the bog and cut grass on it for a number of years the Company would use other portions of the same bog for similar purposes. <Col N="1256" /> That is the underlying thought behind this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is true that following the winding up of the Company upon the decision of the last Government in 1955 the lands there, which had been drained to a considerable extent, were taken over for the purpose of peat land research and forestry experiments. They had the advantage that a considerable amount of drainage had been done at a much lesser cost than had been anticipated.  That scheme is still in operation and has not been stopped.  I am glad to know that it has progressed to the extend that a formal opening is taking place next Sunday.  I do not know anything about that.  I do not know why it should await this stage of operation for a formal opening unless it is that An Foras Taluntais is taking over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming down to the present situation, the Bill is before the House as a result of a recommendation by this committee.  When the last Government decided to abandon this scheme they brought in an inter-Departmental committee.  Before that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman were vehement and vociferous in their denunciation of the scheme in general. They spoke then as vehemently as they have spoken to-day.  One would have wondered, in those circumstances, what the necessity was for an inter-Departmental committee?  Nevertheless, such a committee operated and presumably examined the then existing operation extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an inter-Departmental committee and, as such, was not in a position to publish its report.  In the debate that followed, on the scrapping of Min Fhéir Teoranta, one of the reasons advanced for that action was an alleged statement by the Chairman that he saw no prospect of an export market.  We were not then in a position to refute that statement as we were in Opposition and had not access to the committee's report and did not know the veracity of what was being said.  Ultimately, the Chairman publicly <Col N="1257" /> stated that he had been, to say the least of it, misquoted or misrepresented by the inter-Departmental committee. Subsequently, he said, and it is included in this report, in paragraph 49, page 31:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to state specifically that the Directors at no time stated that there was no prospect of an export market.  We did not look for an export market, not because we feared it did not exist, but because we were certain, and I personally still am, that the expanding home market would still be a long way from being satisfied, even with maximum production from us.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the change of Government an outside committee was set up, a committee that would be expected to bring in a report which would be published over their names. The names of the members are <Col N="1258" /> contained in the report and they are all men of wide experience in business, in agriculture and in engineering.  They are men who would not lightly make a recommendation of this nature unless they had examined the matter in the closest detail.  Secondly, they were convinced of the possibilities of what they were recommending.</P>
      <P>As I said, the report is available for anybody who wishes to see it and they treat of the whole subject in what I consider a most objective fashion.  Again, I want to repeat that I do not know who these civil servants were.  They were set up by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon and they were very well aware of the attitude of Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon to this whole project.  It is hard to blame them if they had a certain bias, by reason of the fact that these were two very important Ministers, towards their examination&mdash;perhaps an unconscious bias to the project that they had before them.</P>
      <P>However, Deputy Dillon quoted fairly extensively from the report.  He quoted parts of it which, perhaps, were not favourable to the revival of the project but both the Deputies opposite me know that, when a document is put in evidence, the whole document is the subject matter of evidence from there on.  I would like to refer to certain aspects of the report that may not be so favourable to the case put up by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman here today.  As I have said already, in the first place the whole project was not confined to the commercial production of grass meal.  There was, in the background, the huge social problem of relieving, to some extent, the uneconomic conditions that existed in North Mayo.  That was the motive that motivated me in bringing this legislation before the Government at that time, and it is still the motive that I have in reintroducing it here before the present Dáil.</P>
      <P>I quote from Page 10 of the current report in a reference to the inter-departmental committee, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason, the committee felt that their function was, not so much to assess the desirability of the <Col N="1259" /> social objectives... but rather to review the economic and financial effects likely to flow from an attempt to attain these objectives by continuance of the company's activities.</P>
    <P>I think it would be appropriate if I read all of paragraph 13 in which that passage occurs.</P>

      <P>It is page 13, paragraph 17 and it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our opinion, the inter-Departmental Committee limited themselves in the scope of their investigations both in the matter of the possibility of the manufacture of grass meal at Glenamoy as an economic proposition and on the question of market outlets.  In 1952, a group composed of technical officers of the Departments of Agriculture and Lands and accompanied by an officer of Bord na Móna as adviser on peat classification, visited a number of European countries to study peat reclamation.  Although the report of this group was available, and presumably was fully considered by the Government before the Glenamoy project was initiated, the inter-Departmental Committee seemed to have relied almost entirely on that report and on the evidence of Department of Agriculture witnesses, who were members of the group, regarding matters of reclamation procedure and costs, and the likely results in the growing of grass on cultivated bog for grass <Col N="1260" /> meal production.  The evidence of the Irish Sugar Company who were then manufacturing grass meal from grass grown on bogland at Gowla, County Galway, and the submissions of Mín Fhéir Teoranta, conflicted with the evidence of the Department's witnesses, both as regards methods and cost of reclamation and costs of production of grass meal, but no independent evidence was called to assess the merits of the conflicting views.</P>
    <P>That is slightly out of context with what I meant to say but, however, it is worth noting that the inter-Departmental Committee members, even though independent evidence would have been available to them, nevertheless relied only on the Department of Agriculture witnesses and, at some stages of their report, it is stated that the Department of Agriculture witnesses who appeared before the &ldquo;Grey&rdquo; Committee, as Deputy Sweetman called it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>By &ldquo;Grey&rdquo; I do not mean anything insulting.  I mean purely the book cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the Deputy's point.  It stated that evidence that they had put before the inter-Departmental Committee was now, in the light of subsequent events, not quite right.  For example, a Department of Agriculture witness said to the 1957 Committee that the period between opening of drains and the commencing of drainage was now proved to be shorter than had been suggested to the inter-Departmental Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 32 of the report, it states that while the inter-Departmental Committee were advised that re-seeding was necessary every second year, and that a yield of two tons per acre was possible, a Department of Agriculture official doubted the view that was then given, and was satisfied that 2½ tons production per acre was not unrealistic.  In support of this, a Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann witness who had considerable experience of grass meal production, was very emphatic that 2½ tons per acre was realistic and stated that they often averaged a much greater rate of production at Gowla. <Col N="1261" /> With regard to re-seeding in general, it has been established now that certain grasses suitable to grass meal production, grown on bog, need re-seeding only every seven years.  There have been other illustrations of the quality of grass grown on bogland, not only of the length for which it can stay growing without re-seeding and without drainage having to reoccur, but also grass grown on bogland has been shown to be as good as grass grown on mineral soil.</P>
    <P>An independent witness named Mr. Gamble, a former Land Commission inspector, gave similar evidence and stated that grass grown on reclaimed bogland was every bit as good, in every respect, as grass grown on clay land. That may dispose of the point raised by Deputy Russell as to the suitability of this grass for grass meal production. I take it, however, that the experiments which had been carried out over a number of years by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann provided sufficient proof and justification that grass grown on bogland is suitable for production into grass meal.  In fact, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann were able to export a considerable part of their output from Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard they had a lot of trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they had trouble but I am satisfied, from the various reports and from the observations in the report of this committee, that grass produced on bogland is as good as grass grown on mineral soil, as it states, and on clay land, as the report also states.  You might observe also, with regard to the question of re-seeding and draining, that it is stated in paragraph 24 that grass that was laid down in Glenamoy in 1953 was still in good condition in 1954.  It goes on to say in the same paragraph:</P>
      <P>After necessary tillage and cultivation the quantity and quality of grass on bog is as good as that on mineral soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee had some reservations about the possibility of getting into such grass and <Col N="1262" /> cutting it at appropriate times.  Apparently, there are appropriate times having regard to the size of the leaf, and the protein content etc. but the 1958 committee said that they did visit some of the bogs and found that on one occasion after a particularly wet season&mdash;a period of three weeks&mdash;cutting was in fact in progress and was no problem.  This has been borne out on several occasions by the experience of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister because he was most courteous in listening to me, but do I understand him to be making the case that grass grown on Glenamoy will be cheaper than grass grown on mineral or clay soil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not at all trying to forget that certain preliminary work has to be carried out that would not be necessary in the case of mineral soil but I want to repeat that the type of work that would be and will be carried out is intended to put that land into good heart for agricultural purposes and in the long run will assist in putting on the land as many families as is possible in that part of the country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into all aspects of the report; it is fairly extensive and specific where the necessity arises.  The protein and carotene content of the grass is extensively dealt with.  The cost of production and the possibility of consumption at home and the possibility of export is also extensively dealt with and is summarised in the final paragraphs of the report&mdash;I think I might read these in order to round off this part of what I have to say:</P>
      <P>On the basis of estimated cost of production, grass meal can be produced competitively, in relation to current market prices, from grass grown on reclaimed bogland without a continuing subsidy after a period of five years from the commencement of reclamation, provided the rate of production is 2,000/2,500 tons a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of the potential home and export trade, a market, over and above that catered for, or likely to be catered for, by existing <Col N="1263" /> grass meal producers, should be capable of development to provide an outlet for the output of a plant at Glenamoy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Russell expressed some concern about the existing producers.  The existing producers represented I think by the Irish Crop Driers Association appeared before the 1958 committee and they did not appear to express the same concern. On the contrary they offered the utmost co-operation with the new project. Their only concern was that the subsidisation of this project might price them out of the market.  Against that, the committee here recommend&mdash; and I have no doubt the recommendation will be put into effect&mdash;that there should be the closest degree of co-operation in the home sale and in the export of grass meal when the new company is in full production.  I have little doubt that will be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon expressed another doubt about the availability of labour for any project that would be set up as a result of this Bill.  The Committee went into that aspect of the matter also and they got the unemployment figures over a period of four years from 1954 to 1957 inclusive in the Glenamoy and adjoining districts of the electoral division.  These are the figures: 838, 728, 638 and 655 respectively.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We understand that a large number of men find it necessary to emigrate to England each year for seasonal agricultural work.  The grass meal scheme, even on the reduced scale suggested by us, would be of considerable value from the point of view of national development of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I want to repeat that during our consideration of this development we must keep the social and national aspects in mind.  Added to that, we must remember the ultimate utilisation of this land.  We have the experience that has been gained in the Ballina research station over the past three years.  We have the experience gained there.  It is interesting to note that the estimated cost of that work by the <Col N="1264" /> Inter-Departmental Committee has been exceeded in the event.  The estimated cost at this stage was in the neighbourhood of £36,000.  That figure may not be correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an allocation from the National Development Fund.  I do not think that figure is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Committee's report at page 40:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will be seen, therefore, that in a little over three and a half years nearly £168,000 will have been spent as compared with the sum of about £36,000 which would be expended on the basis of the Estimate of the Inter-Departmental Committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The actual figures are, in fact, in excess of that.  The cost, as between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands, was, as at the 31st March, 1959, £187,000.  I will not doubt the value of the work done there.  We have to take it that it is valuable and that it will contribute to the national economy.  The number of people employed by both projects&mdash; the peat land experimental station and the Department of Lands&mdash;was 60 as at June.  That compares with the number disemployed as a result of the winding up of Min-Fhéir Teoranta which was 31.  Again, the Committee's estimate of employment by Min-Fhéir Teoranta was 150 men at peak periods and 75 men in the valley periods of production.  That would be for seven months of the year roughly 150 men, and an average of 75 over the remaining period of five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. The figures and the reason are all set out very adequately in the report.  Any Deputy who wants to make himself familiar with these figures, the cost of production and the possibility of markets will find all that readily available in the report.  Unless we are prepared to act with imagination and even at some risk, for the economic development of the West, we might as well turn our backs on them completely.  It has been suggested here that the introduction of the Undeveloped Areas Bill <Col N="1265" /> was turning our backs on them; but, as I said in reply to that debate that Bill was merely an extension of the Industrial Grants Act, although, at the same time, limiting it in its application. The Industrial Grants Act was introduced in 1956, and if there was any turning of backs on the West, it was done by the last Government.</P>
    <P>We owe it to the people in the West to do our best to provide not only immediate employment but a basis of living for the future.  We believe the Grass Meal Project will provide immediate employment for a reasonable number of people and that it will justify the expectations of the inter-Departmental Committee.  Even if it did not, we will have the satisfaction of having put over a number of years thousands of acres into a state of productivity they otherwise would never have reached.  Therefore, I am confident that, in the long run, the value of this project will be apparent, and that the forecast of this independent Committee will be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The principal object of the Bill is to authorise Aer Rianta to raise additional share capital.  I should, perhaps, explain to the House that Aer Rianta is the parent or holding company through which capital for the air transport companies is provided. The present authorised share capital of Aer Rianta is £2 million, the full amount of which has been issued and paid up.  All of the £2 million, with the exception of the directors' qualifying shares, has been subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  The Aer Rianta capital has been used by the company for investment as to £571,194 in Aer Lingus and £1,425,000 in Aer Línte.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta now require additional share capital to meet the current and future needs of the two air transport companies.  The main requirement is to provide an amount estimated at £5,868,000 net, to finance the purchase of jet aircraft for Aer Linte and to develop the transatlantic service.  As the House is aware, the Government have decided to authorise Aer Linte to place an order for three Boeing jet aircraft. These aircraft are now on order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other capital requirements of Aer Rianta include the payment of £655,500 due in the year 1961 to British European Airways Corporation arising out of the 1956 revision of the Air Transport Agreement with Great <Col N="1267" /> Britain; and the repayment of £798,500 borrowed from Aer Linte for the purchase of shares in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes to meet the new capital situation by increasing the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta from £2 million to £10 million thereby enabling the Minister for Finance to provide additional share capital for the air companies as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus will require further share capital, but the precise amount has not yet been determined.  The Bill provides a total of £9,500,000 for additional share and loan capital to Aer Rianta. The immediate requirements which I have mentioned amount to £7,322,000. There is, therefore, a balance of £2,178,000 to provide for Aer Lingus requirements and contingencies.  That amount should, I think, be ample for some time ahead even allowing for the continued growth of Aer Lingus traffic and the extension of their services.</P>
    <P>Section 75 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee, without limit as to total amount, such debentures as may be issued by Aer Rianta to secure borrowings.  Already the Minister for Finance has guaranteed debentures issued by Aer Rianta in respect of commercial loans totalling £3.5 million.  The present Bill proposes to put a limit on the amount of borrowings which may thus be guaranteed, which would be in accordance with normal practice.  Section 3 of the Bill accordingly provides that the aggregate amount of such debentures which the Minister for Finance may guarantee will not, at any time, exceed £5 million.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that Sections 2 and 3 of the present Bill together provide that Aer Rianta would have access to £9.5 million additional capital made up of £8 million share capital and £1.5 million guaranteed debenture borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Aerlinte service has now been in operation for over a year and I have seen traffic statements and provisional financial results for the first 11 months, ending March 31st, 1959.  In general, it can be said that the estimates of <Col N="1268" /> passenger and cargo traffic and of revenue and expenditure which Aerlinte prepared during the early months of the service, have been substantially realised.  There were some exceptions, as, for example, in the case of freight, the revenue from which amounted to less than the estimated figure.  Revenue from passengers and mail was somewhat higher than the forecast and expenditure was generally lower than had been anticipated.</P>
    <P>It is usually understood from the experience of air transport companies in all countries that it takes three years as a rule to get a new air service &ldquo;out of the red&rdquo;.  It was originally estimated that development expenditure to be charged to capital account during the first three years of the Aerlinte operation, including the deficit on revenue account, might amount to something between £1,000,000 and £1.2 millions, the assumption being that the charges under that heading would be about £800,000 in the first year, £200,000 in the second, and nil in the third.  These estimates look like proving correct for the first two years, but the position which may exist in the third year is still, of course, somewhat difficult to forecast.  It is clear that the introduction of jet aircraft on the North Atlantic route has affected the competitive position of the operators who will still be operating next year the slower piston-engined aircraft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the balance sheet show a deficit of £800,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All that development expenditure, which is anticipated in this first year, will be charged against capital.  I shall explain the matter in a way that will be generally understood, I hope.  I said that, for the next year&mdash;the third year of operation&mdash;the company originally estimated that they would break even. They are now disposed to qualify that estimate with the important proviso that they may in that year experience more severe competition from additional operators using jet aircraft.  On the other hand, experience in the United States of America has shown that the introduction of jet aircraft on any route has brought about a substantial increase in the total air traffic and that has enabled the operators with propeller-driven equipment to hold their own even where exposed to jet competition.  I have seen it stated in the case of one important operator of propeller driven aircraft, that aircraft which they had grounded had been brought back into service because of that expansion in the total traffic available.</P>
      <P>In the case of Aerlinte, however, the estimation for 1960 is further complicated by the absence of any precise knowledge at this stage of the extent to which they will in fact encounter competition from pure jet services on direct flights from the United States to Ireland.  It was obvious all the time that 1960 would be a difficult year, but I find the Aerlinte management now much less perturbed about the outcome than at an earlier stage when the full effects of pure jet competition were even more uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aerlinte's own jets, as I think is known, will go into service early in 1961.  From that on, the company expect to earn a revenue surplus.  Their estimate of the annual surplus of revenue over expenditure ranges from £46,000 in 1961/62 rising to £287,000 in 1965/66.  They expect, therefore, to pay off all their development outlay in due course.  Although these estimates have been very carefully and, indeed, conservatively compiled, I feel I ought <Col N="1270" /> to emphasise they are necessarily of a conjectural nature, being based upon what is really an unknown quantity at present, namely, the Aerlinte share of future transatlantic operations.</P>
    <P>I can, however, give the Dáil the basic information to which the Aerlinte management relate their estimates.  Air traffic over the North Atlantic is growing steadily.  In 1958, 1,195,500 passengers travelled by air over the North Atlantic routes as compared with 968,500 in 1957, 783,750 in 1956, and 506,500 in 1953.  In other words, the total traffic over the North Atlantic routes has doubled in the last five years.  There is also the fact that the Irish share of that traffic has also grown steadily.  It was 4.7 per cent. in 1956, 5.25 per cent. in 1957 and 5.5 per cent. in 1958.  By that I mean that the proportion of the total number of North Atlantic air travellers who started or terminated their journeys in Ireland tended to increase in the manner which I have indicated.  These figures are rather remarkable in view of the fact that the total population of this country is less than 1 per cent. of Western Europe at a whole.  With less than 1 per cent. of the total population of all Western European countries, Irish traffic on the North Atlantic represents about 5.5 per cent. of the total.  The number of transatlantic air journeys originating and terminating in Ireland in 1958 was 63,300.  Of the total number of persons travelling to Ireland across the Atlantic by sea and air, 75 per cent. come by air.  That figure has also shown a steady increase year by year.</P>
    <P>The general estimates of the growth of air traffic over the Atlantic, on which all transatlantic air operators are basing their plans, assume a continuing expansion, with the total number of passengers rising to 2.4 millions by 1965.  If our percentage of that traffic remains at its present level of 5.5 per cent. the number of passengers to be catered for by all the air transport operators servicing this country should, by 1965, reach 132,000. The Aerlinte management estimate that they can hope from their experience to date to obtain about 40 per cent. of that traffic.  If that expectation is realised then there need be no doubts <Col N="1271" /> about the commercial success of their operations.</P>
    <P>Apart from these very real prospects of commercial success, the Government are satisfied that an Irish transatlantic service is of vital importance to this country, and in particular, to the tourist industry.  It is abundantly clear that the performance of jet aircraft will make it possible for transatlantic airline operators to overfly this country at will and it is clearly to their commercial advantage to give preference to customers who want to travel the longest distance.  In these new circumstances, this country would, without its own transatlantic air service, be entirely at the mercy of foreign airline operators in relation to an important element in our tourist trade, namely, the American tourist.</P>
    <P>Over the past eight years the number of North American visitors disembarking and embarking at Shannon Airport has increased five fold.  Our rate of increase has been greater than for Europe as a whole and that significant fact highlights the great potentialities of that trade as travel inconveniences and delays are reduced by faster and better flying equipment.  That increase in our American tourist traffic has been brought about by the availability of regular air services between Shannon and North America.  If we are not merely to retain the American tourist traffic which has been built up by air transport but to exploit its potentialities for expansion in the future, we must be prepared ourselves to provide an attractive transatlantic air service. By doing so, we will not only guarantee the availability of a service with satisfactory frequency for passenger traffic between Ireland and North America, but, at the same time, the competition which this service will generate will, we believe, require the airlines of other countries in their commercial interests to route services into Shannon and make greater use of that airport than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>A further important consideration is the question of time.  Air transportation is, by reason of the introduction <Col N="1272" /> of turbine-powered aircraft, undergoing a radical transformation and it is our considered view that an Irish air service must not delay any further in attempting to gain a satisfactory foothold in the North Atlantic region as the prospects of doing so will diminish sharply with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill and the policy which it implements will commend themselves to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the most laboured utterance that the present Taoiseach has given, either as Taoiseach or as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is good reason why it was laboured.  If a chairman of a board of directors had presented a real picture of a service in such a desperate plight as this one is, he would probably resort to the same type of evasions as the Taoiseach has resorted to in this particular matter.  The amount of time he spent at the end in telling us of the prestige in the tourist side of this service does not certainly breed any great confidence in the commercial side of it.</P>
      <P>We are told that it is very important, if we are either to retain or even increase the number of American tourists that come here, that we should have bigger and better and more expensive services.  Of course, that founds back upon what has now been discovered to be a definite illusion with regard to the tourist business here.  The American tourist does not count so much at all.  It is the tourist from England, the tourist from Northern Ireland, the tourist of our own type coming here for a holiday and the tourist from Western Europe, who are not merely better in numbers but, I think, much better spenders than the American who comes here, so that if the Minister has to throw in as a make weight, as he did now, the advantage to be gained by our retaining certain American tourists, it seems to me to expose the weakness of his argument on the commercial side.</P>

    <P>It is rather peculiar to have him introducing a sort of incidental remark that airlines have the power or will get the power and will operate that power <Col N="1273" /> to overfly Shannon Airport or any landing ground here.  I do not know whether, supposing that becomes an important matter, if we have to overfly with our own planes, we have any way of landing these planes of ours at other airports.  I do not know if there has been any development along those lines.</P>
    <P>We are told, also, that it is an important thing that we have a sort of prestige value.  The prestige value has not been accounted for yet, except to the tourist, to any great extent.  In the end, our calculations are based upon that we have arrived at what is apparently regarded as a considerable achievement of getting 5½ per cent. of the passenger air traffic and that it is hoped either to maintain that or to increase it.</P>
    <P>In most of the developments in this country there has been something in the way of expert examination and appraisal of, say, the expenditure and of the likely results in respect of it. The Taoiseach took refuge in the phrase so often used about this that the results are not as bad as were anticipated.  That is all founded on this, that in the first year of operation it is expected that there might be a loss of £800,000, but that could be reduced to £200,000 in the second year and that we would not lose in the third year.  But Deputy Norton has asked already, and I want to repeat his question, are we going to get a balance sheet; are we going to get the details shown; will there be a return; will that return be published by some sort of commercial auditor, or is this going to be something based on expectations, put very low so that there could be a boast that the pessimistic view has not been borne out by the results?  If there is no balance sheet, of course, everybody will regard this as merely an effort to put over by a series of evasions something which never should have been started and which certainly now, as far as its first couple of years of operation is concerned, rather bears out that contention.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Taoiseach in the effort to discover the likely returns and the likely increasing expenditure, is there anybody regarded <Col N="1274" /> as an expert in the commercial side of aviation, who at any time encouraged the Taoiseach to go on with this venture?  I do know of one person who has exposed himself to the public, who would be regarded as a bit of an amateur as far as flying is concerned but who might be expected to know something about the Departmental view of a venture of this sort and it always has been a thing remarked upon in my hearing that that individual was not so enthusiastic about this matter that he would risk £100 of his own money or encourage any bank with which he has any influence to embark even £1,000 on this venture, and I think that is right.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is based, of course, upon the production of Government money and, as far as I see, with the exception of one individual who made a speech on an occasion when he might be expected, so to speak, to show a certain amount of enthusiasm, that is to say, the start of the inaugural flight, I know of nobody who could be counted an expert economist, an expert viewer of the trend of aviation, an expert in regard to the development, or an expert in the sense of a man who would have any foundation knowledge which would enable him to produce a prophecy or a forecast as to expenditure and as to revenue.</P>
    <P>Have we got anything in the nature of an agreed figure?  We are told that it is £200,000 but the only figure that I can find is a quotation from a report in the official organ of the Workers' Union of Ireland in which it states that union officials who met Mr. Dempsey were told that there was an anticipated loss of £300,000 for the year 1959-60.  It was also stated that that anticipated loss might be reduced by £250,000 only by the laying off of staff or by the non-recruitment of staff.</P>
    <P>I know that Mr. Dempsey is the General Manager of Aer Lingus and I understand that he occupies much the same position in Aer Linte.  In that connection it may be that the figures relate to Aer Lingus but in connection with Aer Lingus we never understood that there would be a deficit of <Col N="1275" /> £300,000 which it was possible to reduce only by sacking staff or by not recruiting staff.</P>
    <P>That is the only figure we have and it is from an outside source.  Surely it must be possible to give us exact figures and not to talk in terms of estimates that may be aimed fairly low so that the result will come out better than is expected.  What was the loss for the first year?  The Minister has mentioned a figure of £800,000.  Is that the total of the loss or how bad was it really?  There must be an accurate figure some place for it.  The actual loss must have been discovered by this time and we are entitled to know what it is.</P>
    <P>The management of Aer Lingus generally manages to show a good balance sheet by writing off certain services performed by the State as a State debt.  Is there any question, in this instance, of writing off the cost of the three jets and is that to be treated as a State subscription?  Is the £800,000 mentioned by the Minister an operational loss?  To cover the cost of each flight a certain number of passengers must be carried and is the figure of £800,000 the difference between the cost of the flights for the year and the amount of the fares paid by the passengers?  The Taoiseach should be able to clear that up but I would rather see a balance sheet produced by the Company, a balance sheet investigated by an outside auditor and not something made up by Departmental officials.  Such a balance sheet would let us know what the financial position is so that we could explain the matter fully to our constituents.</P>
    <P>We are told that under this Bill Aer Linte will be given access to capital to the extent of £9,500,000 and the amount to be given to Aer Lingus will be £7.4 million.  I do not know how much of that is for the purchase of jets.  I think I heard the figure of £5,000,000 mentioned for that.  Where is the remainder amounting to £2½ million to be expended?  The phrase has been used that it is generally understood that it would take three years to get an air line out of the red.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> If there is any prospect of getting out of the red in three years, there will be a great sense of relief on the part of the taxpayer.  Of course, we do not know how far we are going to get out of the red in that time but surely by this time it should be possible to see how far all these hypotheses can be converted into something that we can stand on.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also referred to the fact that the 1960-61 estimates are difficult to make up because of the effect of competition.  One significant international development has taken place within the last six months in which the Air Companies of the Common Market countries have come together to pool their resources and share expenditure.  They feel that their losses will be so extreme if they stand on their own that the prospects of their development might break down.  In face of that action, I cannot see how we can afford to be so optimistic about the effect of competition on ourselves. We, apparently, are to go along on our own incurring an annual loss of between a quarter and a half a million pounds.</P>
    <P>The main reason for that seems to be an endeavour to attract a certain type of American tourist.  It is stated that we can, by flying into Shannon, give a landing place to those Americans who want to land there.  We all know that there is a growing tendency for Americans to go further afield and how many Americans are we going to catch by landing at Shannon?  It is not easy to ensnare the Americans with their views with regard to Europe and the historical traditions of Europe which have such an attraction for them.  I do not know what grounds the Minister has on which he bases his hopes of retaining American tourists here by offering them the advantage of landing at Shannon instead of over-flying. There are so many Americans who do not want to see either this country or England.</P>
    <P>A balance sheet is the answer to all these questions.  It should be possible by this time to produce a balance sheet and let us know if there is some foundation for the optimism expressed at the starting of this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister may have delivered his speech in a rather pessimistic strain I think he was able to assemble some figures for the purpose of the speech which seemed to be seasoned with optimism.  This is an undertaking in which I feel that a certain amount of optimism is valuable from the point of view of encouraging people to fight against difficulties and obstacles but at the same time I would not fall for the optimistic hopes so expressed.  The Minister did not tell us what were the Aerlinte losses in the first year.  He said that Aerlinte had assumed they would lose £800,000 in the first year, £200,000 in the second year, and that there would be no losses in the third year.  He says that these estimates were pretty largely realised so, if that is so, I take it, though the Minister did not say so, that Aerlinte losses for the first year were approximately £800,000, which included development costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it appears that they lost approximately £800,000 in the first year.  I think that is to be expected. We cannot get into the air from scratch and make a profit in the first year nor, indeed, in the second year, but what I do think is that we should have some real appraisal of what it is going to cost us to maintain a transatlantic service.  We know they lost £800,000 in the first year, and the anticipation is that their second year's operations should cost approximately £200,000.  Perhaps the third year, which it was hoped would be one in which there would be no loss, would now prove to be a much more difficult year than originally anticipated.  However, according to the Minister, in 1965, when there are new aircraft in the air, there is a prospect of having a surplus of some £287,000.  With <Col N="1278" /> all due respects to the Minister, and with all due respects to the calculators in this case, I would not give twopence for these estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You might as well spin a crystal ball around on a table, look at it as intently as you can, and conjure up some figures of this kind, as to tell us that in 1959 somebody is able to say that in 1965, in the field of air traffic, we will make a surplus of £287,000.  It may happen that that will work out but, frankly, I do not believe it will, nor do I believe that the human mind to-day is capable, in the field of air traffic, of making anything beyond the most fantastic guess as to what air traffic will be operating in 1965.</P>
      <P>I would approach this problem entirely differently from whether or not these figures were realistic figures, figures on which we could rely.  I think it is a matter on which we have got to take a calculated risk and I would be prepared to take that calculated risk for a number of reasons, without regard to these estimates, which I think are fantastic and for which, as I said, I would not give twopence. There are a lot of difficulties to be considered in connection with air transport and air traffic, and probably the most sober reflection which we could permit ourselves is to look, as I did recently, at a summary of the financial position of the S.A.S. Company, the Scandinavian air system, for last year.  They carried 1,500,000 passengers and their income was approximately £38,000,000, yet at the end of the year there was no surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us keep that in front of our minds and remember that we are not going to carry anything like 1,500,000 passengers and that our takings will be microscopic compared with the £38,000,000 taken by the S.A.S. Company. Let us remember that they had nothing to give away out of their £38,000,000 and their 1,500,000 passengers, and they have the advantage of long hauls on most of their flights and, for quite a period, they had a monopoly on some of their flights. <Col N="1279" /> Bearing all that in mind, is it not rather reckless to give an estimate in 1959 of what our earnings are likely to be in 1965?</P>
    <P>What does anyone know what the pattern of transatlantic flight will be in the future?  What does anyone know how long the new jet aircraft will hold in the skies?  On the basis of past experience, it may be possible that these new jet aircraft should run a course of about ten years, because it probably will not pay to change them in the meantime.  You do not know even how far that is a wise calculation because somebody may appear on the scene, with something entirely new in the field of aeronautics, and may put on the market something which again will revolutionise air transport.  In the face of all this, any forecast of what the situation is likely to be six or ten years hence must be conjectural, even in the widest estimates.</P>
    <P>The problem is further complicated by the consideration that many of the major European countries, very heavily capitalised, with a long flying tradition, have been complaining for some time that the costs of air operations, particularly with the winter time sag, is imposing a very heavy burden on them.  They have been saying to one another that they are compelled to keep offices open here, there, and elsewhere throughout the world and that they have got to keep separate handling staffs and separate services at different airports.  Recently, arising out of the Common Market development, consideration is being given to the possibility of establishing a merger of air services in Europe, under which these companies will probably operate in pool, and in that way they could regulate flights, regulate time tables, regulate the method of staffing and regulate services on the different routes, eliminating competition and, in that way, probably cheapen their costs and get better and more economically rewarding flight loads in the future.</P>
    <P>If Aerlinte were confronted in the transatlantic field with that kind of development from Europe on the one hand, paralleled by perhaps something <Col N="1280" /> like it from America on the other hand, and that they were to try to exist as a separate operator, one could not tell what the finances of Aerlinte would be.  It is possible to visualise that there will be a merger of European air companies.  I think that is clearly coming.  The companies themselves are talking about it in optimistic terms and, though the American pattern has not yet been revealed, I imagine that the establishment and operation of a European merger will probably encourage American companies to think likewise, so far as the operation of American services are concerned, in order to hold their place competitively in the skies.  In the face of those possible mergers, among companies with enormous resources, I think it would be difficult to estimate what would be the financial position of Aerlinte if it were compelled to compete, as it may well be, with merged companies of such stature and prestige in the air world.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the main point is: are we prepared to take a calculated risk in the operation of transatlantic air services?  The question which we must ask ourselves is: are we going to stay in the skies, as a nation, between Ireland and the United States of America, or are we going to get out of the skies?  Quite clearly we cannot stay in the skies with the present type of aircraft.  They would be superseded for long hauls by the new type of jet aircraft, and the type which Aerlinte has at present would, in the course of a couple of years, be regarded as providing second or third class travel.  If we are going to stay in the skies we cannot stay there by using planes, which in the light of modern developments in aeronautics, would be regarded as second or third class planes.  We can stay there only if we have first class planes.</P>
    <P>I think that brings us inevitably up to the question of whether we are going to buy the latest and most modern planes for the purpose of staying in the skies between Ireland and the United States and thus providing the people of the U.S. with a method of direct transport to this country.  It is quite conceivable, of course, that when <Col N="1281" /> these new jet aircraft come into existence, aircraft which will take people from America to Paris in six hours, the tendency will be to overfly Shannon unless there is some insistence by the passengers that they want to get off at Shannon.  How much insistence there will be is another matter.  Many Americans come to Europe or come east, but they do not necessarily spend all their time in Ireland.  Many of them go to Europe and it might very well be that with high-pressure advertising in America for an air trip involving a stay in the air of five hours, many of them would fly direct to Europe.  Certainly, they would be encouraged to do that unless we could provide an alternative service whereby they could fly into Shannon and unless we could manage by press advertising to induce them to fly to Shannon with a view to getting to Europe ultimately by our services which are flying to the Continent.</P>
    <P>A decision as to whether we shall stay in the skies with modern aircraft involves a decision as to whether not merely will we do so for air transportation purposes but whether we will do so in order to maintain and possibly develop our existing tourist traffic with the United States.  If a situation developed whereby the large companies in Europe and America decided&mdash;and we cannot influence them otherwise&mdash; that they would overfly Shannon and we had no aircraft in the air it might very well be that a situation would be created in which no person would come direct from the United States to Ireland unless that person first went to Britain or Europe and took in Ireland on the return voyage.</P>
    <P>No matter what the cost is so long as it is tolerably within reason I do not think that we can contemplate with equanimity a situation of that kind. I think if that situation were likely to develop we would be in a position in which passengers to Europe might look down on Ireland when passing over but if there were no planes to Ireland from the United States I think we would be bound to lose heavily from the point of view of maintaining or developing our tourist traffic with the United States.  Therefore, I think if we are to stay in the skies between here and the <Col N="1282" /> United States we must get the most modern aircraft.  I think if we are to have regard to the possibility that Shannon might be overflown by these other companies and that we could not provide an air service at short notice to take up the passengers who would want to stop over on a direct flight from America, we must provide a service for them not when a crisis is upon us but we must have the service available all the time.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, if there is to be an air merger either in Europe or in America, it may very well be that it will pay us to fit into that somewhere but if we have no aircraft in the skies or no service between Ireland and the United States it will be of very little avail to us to say: &ldquo;We are interested in an air merger in Europe or America&rdquo; when, in fact, we have no planes on the Atlantic route.  Therefore, there ought to be planes&mdash;and decent planes &mdash;on the Atlantic route so as to give us an opportunity of considering whether, from a financial and tourist point of view, it would pay us to go into an air merger either in Europe or America so long as this air merger made use of Shannon as a stopping-place or means of depositing tourists here.</P>
    <P>That is not an easy decision for any Department or air company to take but I think this is a case where you have to take a risk.  If for the reasons I have mentioned an air service between this country and America is essential then I think you have got to take that risk.  If I were the Minister I would not rely on these figures.  In replying, I would underline the necessity for treating them with caution.  I think what we can do is take a calculated risk and carry out the project that has been envisaged and hope that by the exercise of business acumen and ingenuity and the utilisation for what it is worth of our special connections on the basis of kinship in America we can maintain an air service between the two countries which will not impose too great a burden on our taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in agreement with the comments of Deputy Norton.  I think that his estimation <Col N="1283" /> of the air transport business as a calculated risk is the correct one and, like Deputy Norton, I am inclined to doubt, not the figures, but the possible outcome of the estimate which the Taoiseach read out a few moments ago.  Already, as he has admitted, after 11 months we now find that due to possible developments which may eventuate in 1960-61 the estimate of no deficit for that year may have to be substantially revised. Instead of carrying out our first three years' operations on a deficit of £1,000,000, the figure is likely to be substantially larger.  The air transport business in passengers and goods could be described, I think, as one of these businesses in which you either get into it and stay in it or else get out of it, and in calculating all the risks involved, particularly the amount of capital required, I feel sure the Taoiseach has had regard to the overall economic position of the country.  The terms of this Bill, as he has said, make available a considerable amount of new capital for both Aer Linte and Aer Lingus.  I think he said £9½ million for Aerlinte and £2½ million for Aer Lingus.  Those are very substantial figures for a small country like ours and I feel sure that if the Taoiseach was not convinced that the money had to be expended and that the country's future in aviation warranted that expenditure he would not ask the Dáil to pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already we have expended a very considerable amount of money in getting into the air, in the establishment of Shannon Airport and in the recent launching of Aer Linte on the Atlantic route.  It is quite certain that the extra £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 about which we are talking now will have to be revised in a few years' time. I think the Taoiseach will agree that there is no certainty in the air transport business that any estimate you make today will not be completely invalid in a few years' time due to development in aircraft in the interim. It is up to us ask ourselves as we know the country if we can keep on voting millions of pounds every few years to stay in the air.  Once we are in, I think we have a duty to stay in, <Col N="1284" /> having invested this money and having built up a magnificent airport at Shannon were approximately 2,000 people are employed at high rates of salaries and wages.  That has meant a tremendous amount to the contiguous towns of Limerick and Ennis and other areas.</P>
    <P>Any interference with that employment would be a tragedy, particularly for Limerick City.  As has been said without exaggeration, Limerick would be a ghost city if anything were to happen to Shannon.  That reinforces my own support of Deputy Norton's view that we must take this calculated risk.  If we could go back 10 or 12 years and review the situation in prospect, whether we would be right in getting into the air with our own aircraft is a matter open to very strong views both for and against.  But the fact remains we are in it and we have only two choices.  One is that we stay in it and vote this money for which we are being asked, or else that we get out.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fact that another development would be the greater use of Shannon Airport. Naturally, I was very encouraged to hear that because it is not so long ago, when talking in this House about the Shannon Airport Development Company, that he mentioned that the number of aircraft going through Shannon was likely to decrease and that, in order to provide greater use for the airport and give employment to those working there, it was proposed to set up a special authority to encourage industrial development in the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained&mdash;and nothing I have heard this afternoon has changed my opinion&mdash;that Shannon is primarily an airport and any funds we can afford to expend on it should be to keep it primarily as an airport, to encourage planes of all types to land there and to attract tourists to come through it.  The entry of Aer Linte into the transatlantic route must naturally be to some extent at the expense of the other companies using Shannon.  Is there any danger if these companies lose Irish passengers that they may not have the same desire or necessity to land at Shannon as if <Col N="1285" /> they had the minimum number of passengers justifying a call?  I am sure that facet was considered by the Taoiseach when it was decided to establish our own airline.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that, notwithstanding all the good wishes which I know the Taoiseach has for Shannon Airport, factors outside his control are continually at work to concentrate more and more of Irish air activity in Dublin.  I cannot help feeling, if that trend is allowed to go on, we may find ourselves in a very invidious position in Shannon due to future developments. Already, in reply to a recent question of mine, the Taoiseach indicated that the maintenance of these new jets will not be done at Shannon.  I do not know what the procedure will be when these new jets are in active operation. At present we have this arrangement whereby the Constellation plane lands at Shannon, some passengers get off, and the plane goes on to Dublin. Having regard to the high cost of operating jet planes&mdash;I believe the dearest thing is to get them into the air&mdash;I cannot visualise how a similar arrangement could possibly be managed between Shannon and Dublin in regard to jet aircraft.</P>
    <P>This more than ever reinforces the view of those who feel that the transatlantic route should be from Boston, New York, Chicago, or wherever it is on the American side, to Shannon and that any passengers carried thence should be carried by the ordinary aircraft of Aer Lingus.  One essential development, and one that was in effect up to some years ago when it was scrapped, was the direct service between Shannon and London.  If this were re-introduced it would be another factor towards making greater use of Shannon.  It is possible in the years ahead that Aer Linte might fly on from Shannon and that its route may not be New York to Shannon and then stop but that it may continue to the Middle East or even the Far East.  A development like that might have to be visualised at some future date.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Norton's suggestion that at some future date we might consider the question of a merger, if this idea of a merger of <Col N="1286" /> airlines is forced on European countries in general.  It is something on which we should keep an open mind. But, when it does come, I hope we will be in a sufficiently strong position, both financially and from the point of view of the number of passengers carried, to make a good bargain. I should not like to feel we had arrived at a stage that somebody had to take us over or we had to go out of business.  The Taoiseach will appreciate from his experience that it is always easier to negotiate from strength.  If any question of a merger arises, I hope we will be in a strong position to get the best possible terms for this country.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach every success with this Bill and I trust that the hopes he holds out for Irish air transport, and in particular for the future of Shannon Airport, are realised in the years ahead.  I have no doubts about the difficulties.  I know there are strong views against the whole idea of this small country going into air travel.  Many of them are very good reasons but I feel we are in now and we have got to stay in; and, that being so, we must expend money on these new planes.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the very excellent technical advice which the Taoiseach has at his disposal. Whatever about the financial advice, in regard to Aer Lingus and generally in regard to aircraft development in this country, the Taoiseach has at his disposal first-class advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to me, from the information the Taoiseach has given us, to be largely a conjectural Bill.  As Deputy McGilligan said, he has not been able to give us any definite statistics as to whether this company has to date really justified its existence.  It is fair to say from this side of the House that we have always opposed a transatlantic service.  The Minister is introducing this Bill because he finds himself, in the changing circumstances that exist in air transport, in the position that unless some step is taken on behalf of Aer Linte, he may as well close down this company.  He finds himself in a desperate situation; <Col N="1287" /> it is really a sort of gambler's throw.</P>
      <P>He had originally at his disposition £2,000,000 for the purpose of establishing this air service.  Because of over-flying, which is only in its early stages at the moment, in the near future most of the planes now grounding at Shannon, bringing tourists in large numbers to Europe, will overfly Shannon and land directly in Europe.  Anyone who goes to Europe, no matter what city he visits, finds it full of Americans. American tourist traffic to Europe is enormous as compared with similar traffic to Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>We are being asked to vote public money, the people's money, for this service.  We must assure ourselves that we are justified in doing that.  If we intend to continue an air service with modern planes two things are necessary. We must be assured that we shall be able to bring sufficient people here to fill our planes.  If we cannot do that and, if we bring in people merely in an effort to compete with the other transatlantic services, we must be assured that we can bring those people to their ultimate destination.  Put it this way: the natural inclination of tourist business concerns is to take a load to Europe.  If we bring in tourists to Shannon in our own planes, have we the facilities then to take them to their destinations?  Have we the facilities to land them in Europe, if that is their wish?  If we have not the facilities, we shall be competing at an unfair disadvantage with the bigger air operators.  It is no use shutting our eyes to facts and I should like the Taoiseach to clarify the position in that regard when he comes to reply.  I know there are all sorts of difficulties because of international agreements, and so forth, in getting certain facilities. I wonder has the Taoiseach sought those facilities.  I wonder are the facilities available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we intend to compete we must be assured of traffic.  Indeed the Taoiseach ought to have assured us that the existing services are justifying themselves. The Taoiseach talks in grandiose fashion about the percentage of traffic, the number of people crossing <Col N="1288" /> the Atlantic now, and the number likely to cross the Atlantic in five or six years' time.  He says glibly that we shall get such and such a percentage of that traffic potential.  We have no real evidence to show that we are even getting our proportion of all the traffic at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable risk involved in this.  Originally the Minister was ill-advised in inaugurating the service. Having done so, I do not suppose he has any real alternative except to come to Dáil Éireann now and say that he was wrong and that he should never have inaugurated the service.  Instead of that, he comes back and asks us to vote money.  In all conscience we, on these benches, cannot agree to that.  He has not put up any case to justify this service.  To prove his case, he will have to give the House much greater detail and much more conclusive facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan very correctly said the company has produced no definite statement of account.  We do not know if these planes are flying in, full or empty.  There is another factor to consider.  The tendency to-day is towards amalgamation.  Only the other day it was stated publicly in the Press that the Common Market countries are contemplating amalgamating their air services.  The Scandinavian airways give an excellent example of what unity can achieve.  Can we, a small country, stand up to these big combines? Are we able to compete with the wealthy American and British services?  Will we be able to continue to compete if we find ourselves face to face with an international combination of aeronautical services?  The seven countries which are now negotiating may reach agreement.  We do not know what the position is because we have no observer and no one to report on the discussions that are taking place.</P>
    <P>All these factors must be considered. I do not know if it is necessary to have this Bill immediately. It might have been better and more beneficial to our aeronautical trade as a whole had we waited a little longer to see what is likely to happen. The Minister proposes to put three jet planes on order.  He did not tell us when he is likely to get these <Col N="1289" /> planes.  With the risk of amalgamation on the part of the bigger air services there is a possibility that a more up-to-date type of plane will be in existence by the time we get delivery of these jets and we may find ourselves in the position of having spent a considerable sum of money with no commensurate return.</P>
    <P>I think it would have been more advantageous had we turned our eyes in the air towards Europe instead of America.  We can be proud of the air services we are operating to the mainland of Europe at the moment. I have travelled in British Viscounts, in French Viscounts and in Scandinavian Viscounts.  In my opinion, no plane compares for service and comfort with those operated by Aer Lingus.  Although we provide a better service and although we have a record of which we can be proud, with practically no accidents, we are still competing with vested interests.</P>
    <P>Bookings depend on tourist associations. Tourist associations are interested in big business.  We are a small country and we cannot always get the tourist bookings that these big combines can get.  Only yesterday I was talking to a South African who is doing a three months' tour of Europe.  When booking she found she could not get to Ireland because it was not included in the tour.  She and five or six others refused to take the tour unless they could see Ireland. The plane flew from Johannesburg to London and this lady and the five or six others had to be put on a separate tour at their own request in order to see this country.  I tell the House that in order to apprise it of what is going on in the tourist world to-day.  That is the kind of thing with which we have to compete.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has his majority&mdash; the strong majority about which we heard so much over the months&mdash;and he will get the money.  Is it not a fact that all the factors I have mentioned may bring the Taoiseach back here again in a few years time looking for another £10,000,000 to keep us in the market?  There is only one argument in favour of this.  It was mentioned by <Col N="1290" /> both Deputy Norton and Deputy Russell.  Everywhere to-day it is a matter of negotiation, and the fact that we stay in may give us better terms if we have to get out or better terms if we have to amalgamate with some of the big organisations.  The tendency in the world to-day is, not for countries to stand alone, but to join in big combines as far as possible I should like to remind the Taoiseach that you cannot join big combines or avail of the facilities of big combines unless you send representatives there to know what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are embarking on a programme for which we are appropriating £10,000,000.  We may not spend it all now but there one thing arises, as Deputy Esmonde says, that possibly when we are involved in this business the planes we have will prove to be obsolete.  There is only one thing certain in air transport, that is, the day you put the airplane in the air it is obsolete; there is another in process of design and ordinarily it is on order to keep the fleet up to date.  I think I am right in saying, am I not, that Italy cannot face the burden, France cannot face the burden, Belgium, Holland, Sweden cannot face the burden, much less Norway and Denmark.  All these national airlines have entered into mergers with one another for the simple reason that they say they cannot finance the cost of jet aircraft and the prospect of the cost of keeping jet air fleets up to date.  An out-of-date jet aircraft is just as useless for modern competition in transatlantic air transport as a turbo-prop is once jets have started to ply regularly on the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I surmise that the Taoiseach may be in this difficulty that he contemplates an amalgamation or an entry <Col N="1291" /> into an amalgamation on the basis of equality with Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, say, and that yet he does not want to declare that publicly but feels that unless we have jet aircraft flying we have no basis on which to make that approach.  Well, there is within the general machinery of Parliament a means of dealing with a situation of that kind so that confidential information can be exchanged if it is in the national interest that it should be so exchanged but, in the absence of any confidential information of that kind, the situation we are confronted with here today is that we are asked to appropriate £10,000,000 to finance a programme to be inaugurated for the purchase of three jet aircraft.  The Taoiseach himself is not prepared to say with certainty what the ultimate financial obligations are going to be.  He is probably conservative in his estimate.  Perhaps I am unduly pessimistic in mine but I do not think I am being unreasonable when I say that, if there is one thing certain in air transport, it is that the aircraft put in the air today is obsolete the day it leaves the ground.  The moment you get into this dialectic of matching your services with world services you have to keep abreast of modern progress.  Only last week, the Chairman of B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. made an impassioned appeal in the papers, for Heaven's sake, not to force him into the position of undertaking unrestricted competition with any American competitor who chose to take the field with supersonic aircraft and he sounded a note of caution.  &ldquo;If you get into that competition,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will all bankrupt ourselves and we will all become a chronic charge upon the public Exchequer.&rdquo; I do not know if Deputies saw that in the paper but it gives you an indication of the dialectic into which we are moving.</P>
    <P>I regard it as all mad&mdash;crazy&mdash;quite crazy and quite unnecessary.  I have consistently supported the programme and policy for Aer Lingus.  I think that is a practical proposition and, in any case, I think it is reasonable to say that contact with the outside world, Great Britain and the Continent of <Col N="1292" /> Europe, by air, is a necessary adjunct of our position as a sovereign State but I think it is fantastic to say that it is a necessary adjunct of our position as a sovereign State to be in the transatlantic air transport system because it is manifestly untrue.  I can sympathise with the sentiments that initiated Irish Shipping on the ground that an island country such as ours must have its own contacts, which it is in a position to control in all circumstances, with the outside world and cannot for ever remain dependent on foreign shipping. It must always have a reserve of its own shipping over which it has dominion but that does not apply to transatlantic aircraft.</P>
    <P>There remains the argument that a direct transatlantic air service with the United States of America promotes tourism.  I think that argument is extremely inapplicable but let us accept it as a valid argument and I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that it is not an effective one.  I want to make a suggestion to the Taoiseach that our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> transatlantic air travel and the international airlines is not at all as weak as some Deputies seem to consider.  I do not think that we are in a position of mendicants <i>vis-a-vis</i> the great international airlines. I think our geographical position and the fact that we have an air base at Shannon means that if we are moved to call anybody's bluff, we can turn them into mendicants.  I do not think the international airlines flying across the Atlantic can afford to do without Shannon.  We have seen every year a considerable number of aircraft avail of the facility of Shannon in emergency. Some of these aircraft would never have survied if they had not Shannon to come to or certainly would have moved into indescribable peril. Aircraft are no longer small vessels carrying ten or 12 people.  You may have in modern Russian versions of jet aircraft 250 passengers, exclusive of crew, in great peril 200 miles off the west coast of Ireland.  The difference between their survival and their loss may be the existence of facilities at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I hear people talking continually about our being overflown.  Of course <Col N="1293" /> we will be overflown and it is fantastic to imagine that we will not be overflown. It is ludicrous to say that if you reduce the passage from New York to London to a matter of five hours, which is highly likely within the next decade, these airplanes are going to come down at Shannon just for the purpose of getting a breath of fresh air.  The cost of getting them down and getting them up is very substantial and I am told that it is extremely difficult in so short a journey as, certainly, from Shannon to Dublin to get a jet aircraft up to the appropriate level at which it can fly at all economically; it is virtually impossible. I am convinced that we will be overflown and I have believed for a long time that it is inevitable that, in the ordinary course of American-European travel, this country will be overflown. That does not mean that those who overfly us can do without us.  I think that we have always under valued that immensely important element in the value of Shannon as an airbase.  At present Shannon costs us £250,000 a year to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the figures and Deputy Haughey has them also.  He is my colleague on the Committee of Public Accounts.  Shannon and Dublin costs us a pretty steep sum annually. I often wonder why we go on paying out that money.  I think we are in a position to say to the transatlantic air fleets that if they wanted the amenity that is provided by Shannon they ought to pay a sum sufficient to ensure that it will cost us nothing to maintain it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are you going to do with the jets when you bring them into Shannon?  Do you propose to fly them from Shannon to Dublin?  They would not be able to get up to the height needed to fly properly and I understand that if they were going to land in Dublin, they would require to start <Col N="1294" /> coming down before they got to Shannon.  Is it on the programme to get them to land in Dublin?</P>
    <P>The real truth is, and we all know it, that the Taoiseach has gone into this up to the neck.  He is a gambler and is going to go through with it now. What is it all about?  What is it all for?  What are we going to get out of it?  How is it going to advantage this country?  We have an admirable air service to London, Paris, Germany and Scandinavia.  How does it advantage us to fly aircraft from here to Shannon if we are going to make an operational loss out of it?  I might understand it if the alternative were to close down Shannon.  I do not want to close down Shannon and I do not think that is the alternative.</P>
    <P>I think we would get a favourable reaction from all the transatlantic companies if we tell them that we shall continue to provide the service at Shannon but that we do not want to do it at a loss.  If we approached TWA, Pan-American and the two or three Continental companies, and told them that we want a guarantee of a minimum number of landings at Shannon in order that the facilities there will not cost us anything, I think we would get a favourable response.  I am certain that the fact that we ourselves are not operating a jet service does not necessitate the closing of Shannon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell made the point that people will not fly into an area unless there is a direct link from it to the country from which they come.  I think he is quite wrong.  We are always inclined to compete with Paris, London and New York.  We have no attractions in this country in that category at all.  The attractions we have here are the attractions of restfulness analogous to those of Majorca, Sicily and the Ionian Islands to which there is not the ordinary flow of tourist traffic. We get the Irish who wish to come and see their own country but the other kind we get are those who like hunting, fishing and rural amenities. We have those in exceptional quality and at a low cost.  The type in search of that kind of amenity are the type who like to travel to London and Paris and then to come here by <Col N="1295" /> Aer Lingus.  I do not believe that direct contact between this country and the United States by our own jet aircraft is an essential to bringing tourists from America.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the value of Shannon in inter-continental air traffic is such that no combination of lines would likely look for its disappearance and I believe that that puts us in a very strong negotiating position.  I am frankly appalled at our embarking on a programme the initial stages of which invole the expenditure of £10,000,000 in the next three or four years.  That sum is, in itself, formidable but where are we going?  I think it is folly to enter into competition with the great nations of the world in the light of the warning posted on the walls of the international airports everywhere.  The Chairman of BOAC has cried out that he recoils with horror from the prospect of the cost that is likely to eventuate in maintaining up-to-date air travel amenities in the jet age.</P>
    <P>We began the day by introducing a Bill to manufacture grass meal in Glenamoy.  We are going to end the day by voting £10,000,000 to fly our own jet aircraft across the Atlantic with the understanding that, having landed them at Shannon, we are going to lift them again and land them at Dublin which I submit is an impossibility, unless we fly them via Tory Island.  The Taoiseach has more experience in these matters than I have and he must agree that it is impossible to get a jet aircraft into the air at Shannon and land it at Dublin unless a wide detour is made.  I think the whole idea is crazy and I have no experience of anyone embarking on this crazy enterprise except the Minister.</P>
    <P>When we came into office we found a project for a transatlantic air service. We very wisely then said that the results of that did not permit this country effectively participating in transatlantic air traffic and that ultimately, if we attempted to stay in this business, we would become involved in financial commitments that <Col N="1296" /> would cripple us.  In the event that has proved to be abundantly true.</P>
    <P>I think if you asked anybody in 1948 whether jet aircraft would be flying across the Atlantic to the exclusion of propeller aircraft within ten years they would have said: &ldquo;You are daft.&rdquo;  We are now told that it is within the range of possibility that within the next five years the Atlantic will be crossed by supersonic aircraft.  At the moment there are aircraft flying in the sky, as part of the normal equipment of the British Air Force, which fly at twice the speed of sound.  They are normal equipment of certain air divisions of the British Air Force.  Picture our position if, in five years' time, the transatlantic air companies are equipping themselves with supersonic aircraft of the type at present being used by the Russian air company which recently landed Mr. Kozlov or whatever his name was, in New York.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why Deputies themselves do not see the crazy dialectic into which we are moving.  I am apprehensive that the reason we are moving into it is that the Taoiseach thinks he must redeem his reputation by showing that his plan of 1957, or 1946, should be persisted in.  I do not believe he has any clear vision of what the end of this is going to be and, in default of that, I think it is very wrong to ask for this money, more especially when I reflect that if we grant this money now, instead of having to take a decision hereafter to wind up something which has the limited commitment of £2 millon involved, we will be facing the problem of dealing with something in which, perhaps, £10 millions or £20 millions is involved in a few years' time, and will be that much more vulnerable when we have to take a decision whether to go on or turn back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it true to say that in five years' time the aircraft which we will have in the air, the aircraft which will become available at the end of next <Col N="1297" /> year, or whenever they are delivered, will be virtually unsaleable.  Many air companies are discovering at the present time that propeller aircraft are unsaleable because nobody wants to buy them when jet aircraft have become the normal equipment of air travel.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can look on these developments in isolation.  This is going to be operated as a charge on the resources of this country.  We are not all that &ldquo;riding on a rainbow&rdquo; at the moment.  Our exports are going down and our imports are going up and incidentally these aircraft are going to represent pretty substantial imports.  We are virtually isolated in our trading relations.  This is a time when we have quite considerable difficulties to contend with, not insuperable difficulties, but formidable difficulties.  It is a time, in my judgment, when we should not undertake a burden of £10 million with the prospect that it will grow, with a pious hope that after losing £800,000 in the first year and £200,000 in the second year we may break even in the third.  We all know that we have been listening to that pious hope about C.I.E. for a long time, and the longer we wait the less close we are to breaking even.</P>
    <P>Does anybody in this House honestly believe that in three years' time we shall be earning a profit on the transatlantic air route?  I do not believe anybody does.  If we do not, do not let us fool ourselves, now that we are called upon to decide what best to do in regard to this, by pretending to believe that we think we are going to earn a profit in three years' time.  We shall be making a loss and, if the trend continues as it is proceeding in the world today, the loss will tend to grow.  Is there an airline in the world today operating on the transatlantic route which is making money?  I doubt it.  Perhaps the Taoiseach knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear which of them are doing that.  Why are all the airlines in Europe amalgamating? <Col N="1298" /> Is it for love of one another?  That is not my information. My information is that it is because they could not make the money to pay their overheads.  I am practically certain T.W.A. is in the red.  I do not know about P.A.A. but we are going into this business with three aircraft and the prospect of replacing them as time rolls by.  Does anybody believe we are going to make money on this?  I am seriously apprehensive that we will put Aer Lingus into the red too through the association which exists between Aer Linte and Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach were a prudent man, and morally courageous, he would drop this whole business.  He would use the valuable amenity of Shannon to secure for this country such transatlantic landing facilities as may be required, and he would concentrate on such resources as we are in a position to deploy to improve and develop the existing admirable service provided by Aer Lingus between this country, Great Britain, and the Continent of Europe.  On those lines there is a prospect for sustained and profitable development.</P>
      <P>If I saw the slightest hope of success I would be very glad to join in the good wishes to the Taoiseach for this enterprise, but it would be the sheerest hypocrisy to say he has my best wishes when I do not believe in it.  I believe this enterprise to be misconceived, to be reckless, and to partake of a character of a wholly improvident gamble with the resources of this country.  For that reason, I must strongly urge the Minister to mend his hand and to dissociate himself from a departure which may be a disaster for us all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The transatlantic air service has been such a controversial subject over the last ten years that I want, briefly, to put on record my opinion about it.  We are at a certain disadvantage inasmuch as the Taoiseach had not, or did not, give us a full report of the activities of Aer Linte over the eleven months up to the 31st March of this year.  I think he himself will be the first to admit that the reports he gave, in the nature of <Col N="1299" /> prophecies for the future, do not constitute a good case on which to build his plea to this House for a further substantial sum of money for the purchase of three jet aircraft.  He could not be pinned down to specific figures possibly, as he said, because he had not got them.  He did say vaguely that our hopes of Aer Linte in regard to freight were not realised but that they were realised in respect of passengers and mail.  What the overall position has been, taking the loss on freight with the profits&mdash;let us call them&mdash;on passengers and mail, we do not know.  We have the assurance that in three years Aer Linte should be&mdash;to use the Taoiseach's own words &ldquo;out of the red.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no particular experience or knowledge to speak on air travel but, like Sir Anthony Esmonde, I have made air trips now and again.  It seems to me that Ireland is now being asked by the Taoiseach to participate in an air race and a pretty keen one.  I certainly would not hold out my judgement against that of the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only concerned about traffic between the U.S. and Ireland.  It seems to me that not only are we trying to &ldquo;keep up with the Joneses&rdquo; but that we must keep up with them.  So far as the transatlantic air service is concerned, I can only judge it in one way.  If I had a substantial amount of money to invest I <Col N="1300" /> would say very quickly that I would not put one penny of it into a transatlantic air service.  That is the only criterion by which I can judge the extension of this project as suggested by the Taoiseach tonight.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any use in comparing Aer Linte with any other State concern such as Bord na Mona, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the E.S.B. or even with Irish Shipping.  In Bord na Mona we are concerned with the home market for the consumption of turf and the use of turf in the production of electricity.  In Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann we are concerned with the home market.  Investments in a project like that could not fail because there is a virtual monopoly in so far as the production of turf is concerned and there is certainly a monopoly in the production of sugar.  In the case of Irish Shipping it cannot be regarded as an absolute monopoly but it was a pretty good bet by anybody's standards that if the Irish Government set up a State concern and wanted to engage in shipping they would have a good chance of succeeding.</P>
      <P>Here, we are trying to attract a foreign market because it must be admitted that in that market the commodity happens to be people whom we want to attract to travel.</P>

      <P>That is why I say it is risky.  That is the point I make about it.  If we were dealing exclusively with an Irish market and with Irish people we would have a very good chance of success.  Some people might think that any opposition coming from this side of the House, from the Labour Party is unpatriotic. We have been told that before.  I am not saying the Taoiseach said it, but members of his Party described us as unpatriotic because we opposed in the first instance the establishment of the transatlantic air service.  That would not be my motive in opposing it.  If I thought it was going to benefit the country as a whole and be a good thing for <Col N="1301" /> tourism and for the economy of the country generally I would certainly support it.  I do not think it will be, but I shall be the first to apologise in this House if it is a success.  I hope it will be a success because as somebody else has said, we are in for a penny now and we must be in for a pound.  Either we must cut our losses and get out losing our money or throw in more money in a further gamble because I think it must be admitted there is a big element of gamble in it.</P>

      <P>In any case, I want to be brief.  There is a dual purpose in this measure, to earn money for this country through Aer Linte and to promote tourism, tourism, I assume, from the United States.  All of us will be pleased if the Taoiseach's ambitions, so far as attracting tourists from the United States are concerned, materialise. I doubt it very much.  Might I suggest to the Taoiseach, as I said at the begenning of my speech, that we are trying to attract in a market outside this country a commodity which in this case means persons.  Would the Taoiseach not seriously consider the establishment of an air service between the various parts of this country and Britain where there is a ready made market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These air services already exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not already exist.  I shall give the Taoiseach an example.  People from London who want to get to Waterford, Cork or Wexford invariably come right across England by train to get the Fishguard boat for Rosslare or Waterford to get to their homes.  In present circumstances if they are to fly portion of the journey they must go from London or Birmingham or Leeds to the centre of Dublin.  Then they must be transported by train or bus or car to Mayo, Wexford, Waterford, or Cork, or other parts of the country.  We have hundreds of thousands of Irish people in Britain who come here at different times in their lives, some of them three or four times in the year. Let the Taoiseach go ahead with his transatlantic scheme, but in regard to the investment of the other moneys the Taoiseach has, Aer Lingus would be <Col N="1304" /> well employed establishing airports in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in fact building an airport there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Galway, Waterford, Wexford and Athlone.  With the hundreds of thousands of Irish people in England who want to come home quickly, such a project by Aer Lingus would pay dividends very rapidly.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has seriously considered that, but it would attract quite a number of Irish people who have their roots in Britain to come home on short visits.  At present, it takes them two or three days to do so and it is not worth while. If they could board a plane in London or any of the other cities in Great Britain and get to various parts of the country in three or four hours, they would come home much more frequently. In any event, it is something Aer Lingus should be encouraged to consider.</P>
      <P>I disagreed with the initiation of this service and I am still against it.  Like other Deputies, I feel that, when we have it, we must either decide to stay on or get out.  I suppose it is only reasonable that we should give the project this other chance.  But I doubt very much whether it will succeed, in view of the fact that air travel and aeroplanes are changing so very rapidly.  It is possible that in another one, two or three years, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may come in and say he wants another £10,000,000 or £20,000,000.  And that would be a different story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going into the development of the transatlantic air service in the confident expectation of making a cash profit as well as conferring other benefits directly or indirectly on the country.  Our expectations are based upon estimates prepared by very shrewd people who know this business thoroughly and who rarely have been wrong in similar estimates before.  Deputy McGilligan said I had justified this development on grounds of prestige.  I never mentioned the word &ldquo;prestige&rdquo;.  I have no interest in prestige in this regard. The decision to proceed with this transatlantic <Col N="1305" /> air development, which had been pressed on me by the Board of Aer Lingus, was taken on hard, cold commercial facts and nothing else.</P>
      <P>The expectation that, after the initial development period has passed, a substantial cash profit will be realised is based upon a conservative calculation of the traffic available.  It is a very satisfactory thing that we can visualise a development which can confer indirectly very substantial benefits on the national economy, which will provide not inconsiderable employment of a very high calibre for a number of our people and, at the same time, make a profit in doing so.  The indirect benefits are not to be ignored. Deputy McGilligan, and I think Deputy Dillon, were inclined to speak disparagingly of the American tourist trade.  The American tourist trade is, of course, less important to us than the British tourist trade.  But it still is very substantial and is growing very rapidly&mdash;more rapidly than the American tourist trade to Europe as a whole.</P>
      <P>The potentialities of that trade are enormous.  When the difficulties and inconvenience of air travel across the Atlantic are very substantially removed, as they will be with the advent of the new aircraft, one could hardly attempt at this stage to calculate what the full potentiality of that trade may be.  We have based our calculations of the traffic that will be available for air companies operating services to this country upon the overall calculations as to the increase in transatlantic air traffic generally and not upon any special inducement which we may have to offer to American tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there is the very important question of the future of Shannon Airport.  It is perfectly true that with the new jet aircraft Shannon Airport is no longer required by any air company on the North Atlantic route for operational reasons.  In the early days of Shannon every company operated through there because their planes could not fly further.  They had to come down to refuel.  The business of Shannon Airport was built upon that transit traffic.  That phase is past.  There are aeroplanes now <Col N="1306" /> flying that do not require to come to Shannon for operational reasons.  They will come in there for traffic reasons, to put down and take on passengers, but for no other reason.  I am talking of the first class traffic.  There is no doubt a continuing business for Shannon in the charter flights that are increasing in number across the Atlantic; and in my view there is a considerable future in the air freight business. But, confining our observations to first class passenger traffic, that is the situation we have got to face.</P>
    <P>While we all know every foreign company operating a transatlantic service will seek to fill its 'planes with the maximum number of passengers travelling the furthest distances, they are interested only in traffic to Shannon to the extent that they are induced by the competition of the Irish airlines to provide a service into Shannon.  If that service is not there it is certain that these great companies &mdash;P.A.A., T.W.A., the British company and the European companies&mdash; would say to anybody who wanted to travel to Ireland: &ldquo;We will put you down in London.  You can then get an Aer Lingus flight from there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will put you down in Paris and you can get an Aer Lingus or an Air France flight from there.&rdquo;  Their commercial reasons for providing a service to Shannon will turn entirely on the certainty that otherwise Aer Linte will get the bulk of the passengers who want to travel to Ireland.</P>
    <P>All this talk about Russian aeroplanes, about a combination of European airlines and about the possibility of supersonic 'planes and space travel has nothing whatever to do with this.  Aer Linte is operating from New York to Shannon and the only competition they are interested in is from the other operators flying from New York to Shannon.  They can fly their supersonic jets or their big aeroplanes on any other route they like. If they are not on that U.S.-Shannon route, they are not in competition with Aerlinte.  All these possible developments in civil aviation to which Deputies have referred have nothing whatever to do with this.  It is the extent to which Aerlinte can hope to develop trade on that route <Col N="1307" /> that matters when we try to estimate its commercial prospects.</P>
    <P>As I said, their calculations assume that the growth in the total of transatlantic air passengers flying on all services will be as estimated by the international bodies which, with expert advice, have published their conclusions in that regard, and of that total number of passengers flying by air over the North Atlantic, Aerlinte will continue to get the same percentage as at present.  First of all, that the number who want to travel to Ireland will be the same percentage in future as it has been in the past and, of that number, Aerlinte will get the same percentage as it has got up to this.  Is not that a reasonably conservative basis of estimation and, on it, the experts available to the board of management of this company have calculated that they will make a substantial cash profit?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, of course, members of an international organisation which determines the fares and they will charge whatever fares are set by that organisation and charged by other operators on the route.  We shall have another look at these calculations later.  Let me try now to clear up any misunderstanding that may exist about the information available concerning the outcome of Aerlinte operations to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are available to me provisional estimates of revenues and expenditures for the first year, which was only an eleven-months year for the company really.  That is the financial year which ended on 31st March last. These provisional accounts will be checked and finalised by the auditors and published at the annual meeting of the company which, I understand, will be held at the end of this month.  Charged against revenue in that first year is a considerable amount of initial outlay.  As I said, this was inevitable in the first year of operation <Col N="1308" /> of any air service.  Offices had to be opened at the traffic centres of New York, Boston and so forth.  A great deal of publicity had to be embarked upon to let people know there was an Irish airline operating.  Not a great deal as yet, but certainly a considerable amount in the future will have to be spent upon crew training.  In many directions the outlay in the first year was considerably higher than would normally be anticipated.  Of course, the business available to the service must also be expected to be well below what they could normally hope to get.</P>
    <P>The experience of every airline shows that it takes three years to get a new service &ldquo;out of the red.&rdquo;  A substantial loss in the first year, with heavy development expenditure inevitably arising, a much smaller loss in the second year and practically level in the third year is the established pattern, and into profits then in the fourth year.  That has been the experience of Aer Lingus.  It is the experience of most airlines.  It is assumed it will be the experience of Aerlinte.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the accountants and experts of the company sat down in advance to calculate what the receipts and outlay would be.  Up to the present they have been shown to be extraordinarily accurate.  I was at one time disposed to contest the reliability of their estimation.  I have certainly withdrawn from that position.  They have shown themselves to be able to forecast these matters with considerable skill and accuracy.  It is these same experts who, projecting their calculations into the future upon the assumptions I have given the Dáil, have given us this expectation of a cash profit which will enable them, over some period, to repay these initial deficits and then commence to earn profits.  These calculations assume the complete writing-off of the investment in the aircraft in a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>There has been reference here to the Dáil providing money and to taxpayers supporting this service.  All we are asking the Dáil to do now is to change the law which says that Aer Rianta must not have more than £2,000,000 in <Col N="1309" /> share capital so that, in future, Aer Rianta will be permitted to have £10,000,000 in share capital.  I have not even said, because it has not yet been decided, that that share capital will be provided by the Minister for Finance.  There is certainly no suggestion of asking the taxpayer to contribute anything to the development of this service.  The expectation is that the company will, as its service grows, be able to repay the deficits of the earlier years and clear these items out of their accounts, ultimately paying a dividend upon the moneys invested in it.  From the point of view of the development of the country and the benefits which this service can secure for the country as a whole, I think we should contemplate a position in which any funds that may become available to it out of its own resources would be used to develop its services rather than to remunerate the investment. I can, however, appreciate that if the Minister for Finance finds the whole, or any part, of the capital he may take a very different view.</P>
    <P>For what does Aerlinte want capital? First, there is the purchase of aircraft. Secondly, there is a rather substantial item for the training of the crews and the personnel who will service them.  As the House well knows, we are now operating on chartered aircraft, the crews for which are provided by the charter company and the servicing of which is done on the other side of the Atlantic by the same company. With jet aircraft we shall be utilising our own crews and our own servicing personnel.  These have to be trained.  It is quite a substantial business to train personnel to the very high level of proficiency required before they can be entrusted with the operation of expensive and intricate equipment of this character.  With the advent of the jets, there will be occasion for a considerable new outlay-upon publicity and advertising generally. Some figure&mdash;we estimate about £250,000&mdash;will be required for working capital purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One aircraft is spare.  The expectation is that the service which will meet the full requirements <Col N="1310" /> of this country and carry the full traffic available to Aerlinte can be operated with two aircraft, but there must always be a spare.  I do not say there will be one plane just standing idle, waiting to be used, but three will be so operated that one will always be spare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But you must carry a stock of spares as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly there is a substantial investment in spare parts. Deputies have suggested that these aircraft may become obsolete before we are able to recover in the depreciation allowances the moneys we have invested.  This is a matter we have had to consider before.  In 1948, when the original Aerlinte transatlantic air service was contemplated with Super-Constellations, we were able to satisfy ourselves, by consultation with technical experts and advice from the aircraft manufacturing companies, that that type of aircraft could be regarded as stabilised for a 10-year period and there was no prospect of any major technical change in the design or performance of aircraft for a period of ten years.  That proved to be correct. It is only now, in 1959, that another major advance in technical design and performance of aircraft is taking place.  Once more, we have been able to satisfy ourselves in the same way that no further technical change in the design and performance of aircraft in commercial use is likely to take place for a 10-year period.  It is technically possible, I am told, to build an enormous aircraft to travel at supersonic speed, but it would be so uneconomic to operate on a commercial service that it does not come into the picture at all.  In 10 or 12 years from now there may be another major change in the design and performance of commercial aircraft.  It is fortunate for us that we are able to take this step at this time in the history of the development of aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the financial difficulties of some Continental air operators.  These financial difficulties arise very largely from the fact that they have in use at the moment propeller-driven aircraft which <Col N="1311" /> they have not fully depreciated and that they have to incur new investment in jet aircraft before they recover their original investment.  We are not in that situation.  Once again, we are coming into the transatlantic airfield with some advantages over other operators and, therefore, are all the more entitled to believe that we can maintain ourselves successfully there.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to the basis of our calculation, according to the estimates which have been prepared by the highly competent technical people who have gone into this matter with great thoroughness, in 1960, next year, 87,500 people will want to fly from America to Ireland or, to be more accurate, I should say will want to engage in flights over the North Atlantic which will either start in America or in Ireland and terminate in the other country.  We know we have a problem in 1960.  In 1960, we shall still be operating the propeller-driven Super-Constellation aircraft which Aerlinte have chartered.  Therefore, we have to ask ourselves how are we likely to do in that year.  If it is likely that 87,500 people will want to fly to Ireland or from Ireland across the Atlantic in that year, how many can Aerlinte get, operating these propeller-driven Super-Constellation aircraft?  If the original Aerlinte estimate that they can get the transportation of 40 per cent. of that number proves correct, there is no question that Aerlinte will break level on its accounts in that year and, indeed, I think it will be able to show a not inconsiderable revenue surplus.  We do not know at the moment to what extent it is reasonable to calculate that they will get 40 per cent. of the available traffic because we cannot say the degree to which they will be in competition with jet aircraft on that route next year.  We do not know.</P>
    <P>We have had consultation with other companies before we took our decisions in this regard and we found no company operating on the North Atlantic route that was prepared to give us an undertaking that they would provide a service with jet aircraft into Shannon and, as I said, the expectation <Col N="1312" /> that they will in future operate with jet aircraft into Shannon is based upon the belief that the commercial competition that they will experience from Aerlinte will force them to do so, will make it in their interest to do so, just as, in the absence of the Aerlinte service, it would probably be in their interest not to come to Shannon at all.</P>
    <P>That fact which I have mentioned emphasises difficulty at this stage of calculating the extent to which they would be prepared to operate services into Shannon with jet aircraft next year.  If they do not, Aerlinte can reasonably hope to get the 40 per cent. of the total available traffic that they have got up to now, to carry the 35,000 passengers that that would represent, and make a profit in that year. If they are up against jet competition, then the total number of passengers they get that year is likely to be less but how much less one cannot say.  It will almost certainly be more than their total carryings this year.</P>
    <P>Again I want to emphasise the experience in the United States of America, when jet aircraft went on to the internal air routes.  With the advent of the jets, there was brought about an enormous increase in the total number of people who wanted to travel by air, such an increase that, not merely were the jets fully occupied by air travellers, but all the propeller-driven aircraft on the same routes were also fully occupied and companies who, fearing the competition of the jets, had grounded their propeller aircraft had to bring them back into service.  The belief is that with this new major development in the technique of air transport operation, more and more people in the United States of America are deciding to take a holiday in Europe next year, coming here by air, and that there will be such an increase in the traffic potential that most of the operators still compelled to use propeller-driven aircraft in that year will be able to attract a growing volume of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is finished with that aspect, will he clarify this for me: If the Taoiseach is right in believing that he will make a profit, then, of course, we would all agree <Col N="1313" /> with him.  The difference between us is that some of us think he is going to make losses.  He thinks he will make a profit.  If it is a profitable transaction, manifestly, he is justified in taking it but, if it is a profitable transacton to operate into Shannon, why did T.W.A. or Pan-Am or one of these others not provide these services themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the question.  One does not know what factors may have operated in the minds of the management of those companies. I cannot even say that they would not have provided the service. I think it is extremely likely that, if we had given an undertaking never to come into competition with them, we could have arranged with some company to provide a service into Shannon but one would not like to think that all the potentialities of that trade to the country would depend solely upon the goodwill of a foreign company and its capacity to make profits out of it.  May I say this, however, that the estimates I have given as to the outcome of this operation are not my estimates?  They are those given to me by the management of Aerlinte and represent their conservative calculation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan asked me had any expert advised me to get on with this transatlantic air transport development. When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1952, resuming after the first Coalition Government, the Aer Lingus Board came to me and expressed the view that the future of the Aer Lingus services required the establishment of a transatlantic service.  They urged me then to plan for the development of transatlantic services on the lines which we had contemplated in 1948.  In the financial circumstances of that year, I had to tell them that we could not undertake it and, while Deputies will know that we attempted to reorganise the transatlantic air service and to get it going with chartered aircraft at that time, because of certain difficulties that emerged, we did not succeed.</P>

    <P>When I resumed office in 1957 the Aer Lingus Board came to me again <Col N="1314" /> and said that it was essential to the future success of Aer Lingus that there should be a transatlantic air service. Deputy McGilligan asked me what expert advice I have.  What other advice should I look for?  That decision to come to me and to press that policy on the Government was based upon their expert calculation and, indeed, it is worth mentioning that, up to date, an average of 20 per cent. of the passengers who travel eastward on the Aerlinte service are booked for destinations further in Europe and carried to these destinations by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell spoke about the possibility of Airlinte operating from New York to Shannon and then on to some other destination in Europe.  That would be an ideal situation.  There would be no question about that being profitable&mdash;it would be a veritable gold mine.  But that would be the type of facility which it is extremly unlikely that other countries would be willing to give us.  It is known as the sixth freedom right&mdash;the right to operate from one foreign centre to another and it is very rarely granted.  Deputies will have seen that the United States Government quite recently refused that facility to Britain's BOAC.  That happened within the last couple of months. I do not think that we can hope to get that facility.  I agree that Aer Lingus should give serious consideration to traffic potentialities between Shannon and European destinations.  These possibilities must be there and they may certainly develop when the Cork airport is in operation and there is a further pool of traffic to be tapped in the operation of such services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon misunderstands the position in regard to Shannon airport. I do not know what information was given to the Committee of Public Accounts but the revenue surplus of the airport last year was £100,000.  I might make a calculation based upon a return on the capital investment and provision for depreciation, which might show a different result.  I am talking of the cash account which shows an excess of income over outgoings of £100,000.  There was a deficit on the operation of Dublin airport but the <Col N="1315" /> overall figures for the two airports show a cash surplus.</P>
    <P>Certain information has already been gathered by Aerlinte as a result of its operations to date.  One piece of information is that the pattern of traffic over the North Atlantic has become much more seasonal in character than it used to be.  There is a heavy flow of traffic from West to East, say from the beginning of May to somewhere around the early part of July.  Then there is a slack period which is followed by a heavy flow of traffic in the other direction.  One of the advantages which Aer Lingus envisages from the availability of jet aircraft is that that hiatus in the middle of the transatlantic season can be used by putting the jet aircraft on European routes.  They contemplate the efficient utilisation of some of these aircraft on some of their European services which tax their existing equipment during that period.  In that way they can get a more profitable utilisation of all their equipment over the whole year.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  I do not know the answers to details of that kind but that possibility of making additional use of the jets during the high summer season is much in the mind of the company.  It is to be assumed that the volume of traffic during the winter months will be much smaller and during that period the overhaul and redecoration of the aircraft will be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I know that in this matter we cannot come to the House with a guarantee of success.  It is not the same thing as calculating for the production of turf briquettes against a known demand.  To a large extent the business which this company will secure will have to be generated by itself but there is no reason, in our experience and in that of other operators and on the information available to us, to assume that it will not develop along the lines I have indicated to the point at which it will be collecting a cash profit as well as giving to the country the other considerable advantages which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Aerlinte have been getting 40% of the number of passengers who want to travel to Ireland. The other 60% are carried by other air companies that run scheduled services into Shannon.  It is assumed that the number will continue to expand on all lines but that Aerlinte will still have only 40 per cent of the traffic and the other 60 per cent.  will continue to go to the other companies. If Aerlinte did not operate that route the companies which now carry that 60 per cent of the traffic might decide to drop them in London, letting them travel on to Ireland by other means. It is the knowledge of the availability of Aerlinte services flying into Shannon that is I believe going to force these other companies to continue to operate their own services into Shannon so that in that way they may retain their 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>I cannot give precise information but my recollection is that what Deputy Briscoe has stated is correct.  Some American companies found themselves last year in the financial difficulties which I have mentioned.  The fact is that they now have to incur very substantial outlays upon the purchase of new jet aircraft before they have written off the obsolescent propeller-driven aircraft.  Any financial difficulties I heard of arose out of that and not out of the inability to make profits on the operations of their services across the Atlantic..</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,081,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1953; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951; etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net Estimate for 1959-60 amounts to £9,576,000 being a gross total of £10,133,401 less Appropriation-in-Aid of £557,401.  The net provision represents an increase of £476,740 on that shown for 1958/59. On the other hand, the increase of revenue we expect should somewhat more than offset our extra expenditure. However, it is the Commercial Accounts we must turn to for the real picture of Post Office working.  On <Col N="1318" /> this occasion last year the acting Minister forecast that the small profit made in 1956-57 would be followed by a somewhat bigger, though still a relatively modest profit, in 1957-58.  As shown in the Commercial Accounts published last December, his forecast was quite accurate.  We made a modest profit also in 1958-59 and, so far as anyone can dare to predict the position at the end of the current year, we should also be on the right side then. So I am happy to say that, for the present at least, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is in a reasonably satisfactory financial position, a welcome change from the long succession of years when it was a burden on the Exchequer.  However, I shall deal at greater length with this point later on.</P>
    <P>There is a slight complication in making detailed comparisons between the provision asked for and that actually voted in 1958-9 which I should first explain.  At the end of Part II of the Estimate&mdash;the middle of page 281 of the Estimate volume&mdash;an amount of £260,000 is shown in the 1958-9 figures under the heading &ldquo;Increase in Remuneration.&rdquo;  This represents that part of the total extra Civil Service salaries and wages voted by Supplementary Estimate which relates to the Post Office and is thus shown as nominally transferred to the Posts and Telegraphs Vote.  To get strictly comparable subhead figures for 1958-9 this £260,000 should be divided up and added to the original provision under various salary subheads.</P>
    <P>The subheads affected and the amounts proper to be added in each case are:&mdash; A.1 &mdash; £15,000; A.2 &mdash; £45,000; A.3 &mdash; £169,000; A.4 &mdash; £7,000; I.1 &mdash; £24,000.</P>
    <P>Taking account of these amounts the comparisons between 1958-9 and 1959-60 should now become:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> A revised arrangement for payment of rates has led to a transfer of £1,000 from Subhead L. 3 to the Vote for Rates on Government Property but the figures shown in the printed volume of Estimates take account of this change.</P>
    <P>The more substantial variations&mdash; those of £10,000 or more&mdash;occur on the following subheads adjusted, where necessary, in the way I have described:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subhead E.4 &mdash; Packet Services.  The increase of £10,100 is due mainly to greater use of direct shipping services between Irish and North American ports and to increased traffic.  The extra charge is more than offset by benefits to revenue.</P>
    <P>Subhead E.5 &mdash; Conveyance of Mails by Air.  The extra £11,000 is needed because of increased traffic which will be reflected in increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.1 &mdash; Stores (other than Engineering).  To facilitate the speedier completion of the Appropriation Account a revised procedure has been introduced.  This will mean that our credits from other Government Departments for whom we buy stores will be reduced by about £10,000 for this one year only.  Increased purchases owing to the exhaustion of reserve stocks, partialy offset by reduced purchases of mechanical transport, make up the remainder of the total increase of £19,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead I.1 &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Engineering).  An extra provision for labour and normal increments for staff, the dropping of the provision for additional force and an increased relief from Telephone Capital Funds are the most significant items in the net increase of £18,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead K.&mdash;Engineering Materials. The replacement of the obsolete equipment at Valentia and Malin Head Coast Radio Stations, increased purchases of stores and motor transport replacements, the altered procedure for credits from other Government Departments to which I have already referred and a reduced relief from Telephone Capital Funds account for the increase of £108,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead L.2&mdash;Contract Work.  The <Col N="1320" /> increase of £29,000 here is mainly due to further provision needed for the work at Valentia and Malin Head stations.</P>
    <P>Subhead M.&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments.  Money for development of the telephone system is provided by issues from the Central Fund.  These issues have to be repaid by annuities extending over periods not exceeding 25 years.  This subhead contains full provision for the annuity payments to be made during the year.  The increase from year to year (the present figure is £85,353 more than 1958-59) is a natural consequence of the expansion of the telephone system&mdash;an expansion which in its turn leads to increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Subhead N.1&mdash;Superannuation Allowances, etc.  The total increase of £18,100 is due mainly to the anticipated higher payments of pensions and marriage gratuities.</P>
    <P>Subhead O.2&mdash;Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless &mdash; provision and installation of equipment, etc.  The provision of radar installations at Shannon Airport, teleprinter equipment at Ballygireen and navigational aids at Cork Airport account for the increase of £152,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead T.&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid. The extra £29,863 in receipts is the net effect of a number of increases partly offset by some few decreases.  The principal sources of greater receipts are sale of stores (both Engineering and non-Engineering) and the payment from Savings Bank funds for the work performed by the Department.</P>
    <P>In comparison with the previous year, letters posted increased by approximately 12 millions or 4% and in fact postings during the Christmas period 1958 were the highest on record. Parcel traffic about held its own.  This was a welcome change in trend as it had tended to decline steadily since 1956.</P>
    <P>Mail services generally worked satisfactorily during the year.  Further progress was made with the reorganisation of rural postal services with the object of giving a standard 6-day frequency of delivery and a better all-round quality of service.  Since this <Col N="1321" /> time last year the head office districts of Ballina, Carlow, Castlebar and Claremorris have been reorganised and the remaining portions of Limerick, Mallow and Waterford completed. Proposals for reorganising the Portlaoise and Westport districts are far advanced and will be implemented shortly.</P>
    <P>There have been several developments in the foreign post services. Transmission of parcels by surface routes to twelve European and overseas countries has been speeded up by a revised system of forwarding in closed despatches which eliminates intermediate handling.  The feasibility of applying this new system is dependent on the traffic for the particular country of destination; where the volume is small or the traffic infrequent it cannot economically be employed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have already read about the new small packet service which has been introduced in the foreign service as from the 1st April, 1959.  The advantage of this service is that it gives the public the benefit, at an attrative price, of having packets of goods not exceeding 2 lb. in weight transmitted by the quicker letter post service.</P>
    <P>The air parcel post service, which is at present confined to postings to the U.S.A. and Canada, will shortly be extended to a number of other countries.</P>
    <P>To comply with the terms of the Universal Postal Convention, certain foreign post charges had to be raised with effect from the 1st April, 1959. The Universal Postal Convention, which is revised every five years, lays down minimum and maximum limits for foreign letter post rates.  In contrast with the great majority of postal administrations the level of our foreign service charges has for many years been related to the lower rather than the upper limit permissible under the Convention.  The Convention now in force made it obligatory to raise the minimum letter rate to 6d. and to adjust proportionately the charges for other categories of mail.  At that, the charges of no other postal administration are lower than ours and we are <Col N="1322" /> among the tiny minority who charge no more than the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>A new International Parcel Post Agreement has now come into force which requires a world-wide increase in charges for foreign parcels. To comply with this agreement most of our charges for parcels sent abroad have had to be raised as from 1st July, 1959.</P>
    <P>Special postage stamps were brought out during the year to commemorate centenaries of Thomas Clarke and Mother Mary Aikenhead and the twenty-first anniversary of the coming into operation of the Constitution.  As already announced, a new stamp will be issued shortly to commemorate the first Arthur Guinness.</P>
    <P>During the year ended the 31st March last, about 1,960,000 telegrams were handled, which indicates a decline of about the same order as in the preceding 12 months.  There was actually a slight increase in foreign telegraphic traffic but this was insufficient to offset the fall in internal telegrams and in telegrams exchanged with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>With the decline in traffic it has been found possible to reduce the loss on the service.  According to the latest figures available, the loss for the financial year 1957-58 was £178,000 as compared with £195,000 in 1956-57.  This has been achieved by further progress in reorganisation on the basis of transmission by teleprinter and telephone and thus economising in staff costs.</P>
    <P>Various old telegraph agreements which had governed the relationships between the Post Office and railway companies for more than 50 years were replaced last April by a new simplified Railway Telegraph Agreement to the mutual advantage of the Post Office and Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Telex system continues to expand.  During the year the number of subscribers increased from 63 to 85 and the number of messages rose from 72,000 to 126,000.</P>
    <P>Turning now to deal with the Telephone Service, in 1958 the number of local calls was 104.2 million and the number of trunk calls was 15.4 <Col N="1323" /> million representing increases of 9 per cent. and 6 per cent. respectively over the 1957 figures.  A record number of 10,550 new subscribers' exchange lines was installed in 1958&mdash;this is 1,570 higher than the 1957 figure. Applications for new telephones during the year reached the record total of 10,500, nearly 1,000 more than that in the year before.  Over 5,500 miles of trunk circuits were added to the trunk system in 1958.  A satisfactory standard of trunk service was maintained&mdash;some 95 per cent. of trunk calls being connected within 10 minutes of booking.  Six manual exchanges were converted to automatic working and 140 other exchanges were extended and/or modernised during the year.  Forty new telephone kiosks were erected.</P>
    <P>It had been hoped earlier on, that the waiting applicant list would be cleared by the end of March 1959, but with the increase in demand for new telephones during the year it has not been possible to achieve this.  Nevertheless, some reduction in the waiting applicant list has been achieved&mdash;excluding telephones in course of installation the total number of waiting applicants has been reduced from 1,950 at the end of February 1958 to 1,700 at the end of March 1959.  The reduction would have been greater were it not for the fact that during the year a back log of deferred long lines in rural areas was cleared.  The main hold up in the Dublin area is in the Dundrum exchange area (over 230).  These will all be given service towards the end of this year when the new automatic exchange at Dundrum is brought into service.  The capacity of the automatic exchange at Cork has almost been reached and in addition, the cables serving the Douglas and Western Road areas are almost fully utilised.  In order to conserve the remaining terminations and cable spares in Cork to cater for business and priority applicants it has been necessary to defer applications for all ordinary residence lines pending the erection of two new automatic exchanges in the Douglas and Western Road areas in about 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>Just over 2 years ago (March 1957) <Col N="1324" /> facilities were provided at Athlone which enabled Athlone subscribers to dial their trunk calls direct to Dublin and several other places.  The results were encouraging and it was then decided to extend the experiment to a larger exchange.  Cork was chosen for the purpose and Subscriber Trunk Dialling facilities were introduced there last December.  Additional diallin facilities were also provided at Dublin, and Dublin subscribers can now dial calls direct to automatic exchanges within 20 miles radius of Dublin such as Greystones, Naas, Celbridge, Maynooth, etc.  That these dialling facilities are appreciated by the subscribers concerned is evidenced by the fact that almost 100 per cent. of the calls that can be so dialled are being dialled by the subscribers.</P>
    <P>So much for the past and now a few words about the future.  A comprehensive survey of telephone development is at present in hands.  We have made an analysis under &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; of all our existing 87,000 telephone subscribers and a detailed survey of prospective development in every exchange area in the country has been made. Plans for future development will be based on the results of this survey.</P>
    <P>The success of the subscriber trunk dialling facilities introduced at Athlone and Cork points the way to providing similar facilities at Dublin and the larger provincial centres and it is hoped to be able to provide these facilities in a number of centres within the next two years.  The promotion of subscriber trunk dialling on as wide a scale as possible is the best way of ensuring a highly efficient service and of keeping down costs and the ultimate goal is subscriber trunk dialling on a national scale.  Although it will take many years to complete national subscriber trunk dialling we have been actively engaged in planning for it.  As indicated last year, we had the assistance of an international expert under the United Nations Technical Assistance Programme for some months to study the problems here and to recommend the most suitable and economic means of introducing a national subscriber trunk dialling scheme.  In addition, one of our engineers was sent to <Col N="1325" /> Holland for a few months.  We have since been planning on the basic recommendations of the expert's report.</P>
    <P>As a first step in the new plan a revised system of charging is required. Deputies will be aware of the new system which was announced on 24th June and will be brought into operation on 1st August next.  I may perhaps mention the principal features of the changes which are that the area covered by local calls will be greatly extended so that some 5,000,000 calls a year now charged at 6d. or 10d. or more will in future cost 2d.; the scale of trunk charges will be simplified and the maximum charge reduced; and an increase will be made in the night rates for certain cross-channel calls so as to achieve a better balance between night and day traffic.</P>
    <P>Concurrently with the introduction of the new charging system two important rental concessions are being made; farmers will be supplied with telephones at the residence rental rate instead of at the business rate as heretofore, and the standard telephone rentals will apply up to 3 miles (instead of 2 miles) distance radically from exchanges.</P>
    <P>The total cost to the Department's revenue of the various changes will be £125,000 a year.</P>
    <P>One other important development worthy of mention is our entry into the field of trunk circuiting by means of radio links. A contract has been placed, and the system is scheduled for completion by May 1960, for a multi-channel radio link between Galway and Athlone where the circuits will join up with the existing co-axial cables. Tenders have been invited for another radio link system to provide circuits for Sligo&mdash;Bundoran&mdash;Ballyshannon&mdash; Donegal and estimates are being prepared for a multi-channel radio system to link Waterford with Wexford and Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>In the Post Office Savings Bank, deposits during 1958 amounted to £15,399,000, an increase of £257,000 on 1957; withdrawals amounted to £14,573,000 an increase of £67,000. However, the withdrawals include an amount, estimated at £600,000, which <Col N="1326" /> was withdrawn for reinvestment in Exchequer Stock, Savings Certificates and Prize Bonds.  Estimating the interest for the year at £1,872,000, the total balance due to depositors at 31st December, 1958 was £78¾ million approximately as compared with £76 million at 31st December, 1957.</P>
    <P>Deposits by Trustee Savings Banks during the year amounted to £860,000, an increase of £256,000, and withdrawals amounted to £430,000, a decrease of £156,000.  The balance to credit of the Banks, including interest, at the end of the year was approximately £12½ million.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates in 1958 at £2,688,000 were £556,000 down on last year's sales.  The decrease is attributed partly to a decline in the appeal of the 6th issue as it grows older&mdash;a feature common to all issues &mdash;partly to the attractions of alternative forms of investment and partly to a decrease in transfers from earlier issues.</P>
    <P>The decrease in sales was, however, partially balanced by a decrease in repayment which amounted to £2,607,000, principal and interest, as against £2,663,000 in 1957.  Approximately £130,000 of the amount repaid was withdrawn for investment in Exchequer Stock, Prize Bonds, and E.S.B. Loan.</P>
    <P>In regard to Remittance and Agency Payment Services, the total volume of business in 1958 was slightly higher than in 1957, though there was not a uniform pattern of increase.  The main factor in the growth of business was a rise of some 4% in both the number and the value of Postal Orders issued. The popularity of this service with the public has led us to decide to extend the range of values by introducing new orders of £3, £4 and £5, the commission in each case to be 6d.  In 1953 the maximum was raised from 21s. to £2 and the additional denominations then introduced have fully justified their existence.  I am confident that the new values will prove equally popular, particularly as the commission will be 3d. less than on Money Orders of equivalent value.  It is hoped to have the new Postal Orders on sale in about 3 months' time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> In regard to Buildings, during the past year improvements have been made in the Post Offices at Castlebar, Donegal, Loughrea and Nenagh.  New telephone exchange buildings were completed at Dundrum and at Still-organ Road in Dublin, at Skerries in County Dublin, at Galway and at Midleton, County Cork.</P>
    <P>The new post offices in course of construction at Galway and Letter-kenny are expected to be completed this year.  Work is in progress on a new post office and telephone exchange at Droichead Nua, and on new District Sorting Offices at Crumlin and Churchtown in Dublin.  The erection of the buildings for the two new automatic exchanges in Cork, which I mentioned already, has commenced.</P>
    <P>The sketch plans for the new Central Sorting Office in Dublin have been approved and the Office of Public Works is considering the type of structural design best suited to requirements. The undertaking is an outstandingly big building project and the preparation of contract drawings, etc., will necessarily take a long time.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the question of staff.  The number of staff provided for in the estimate is 16,179.  In making a comparison it has to be remembered that a lump sum of £50,000 was included last year under Subhead I (1), which is not repeated this year, to cover the employment of additional men on telephone development and that, to this extent, an addition has to be made to the heads, specifically provided for last year.  In fact, there is a small reduction of 15 in the total number of staff employed.</P>
    <P>A good measure of agreement was secured in matters discussed at the Departmental Conciliation Council and the Sub-Postmasters' Consultative Council.  I think I can claim confidently that, not merely the Administration, but the Staff Unions and Associations regard the existence of these Councils as doing a great deal in promoting good relations in the sphere of pay and conditions of service generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> The search for improvement in organisation has gone on with unabated vigour.  Noteworthy during the year was the completion of the reorganisation of Inspectors' Districts in the Engineering Branch and the provision of a construction depôt on the south side of Dublin City, both of which contributed materially to an expansion of telephone development.</P>
    <P>The holding of Conferences between Headquarters officials and Postmasters has been a feature of the work of my Department over the past ten years or so.  At these conferences, questions arising out of the administration of the whole range of Post Office services are discussed; Departmental policy is explained to Postmasters, and they, for their part, have an opportunity of putting forward their difficulties or suggestions for improving the services.  In this way, the essential link between Headquarters and the local managers in the field is maintained and strengthened.  This year, as an experiment, a conference of the residential type was held in Bray and, in line with modern ideas, the proceedings mainly took the form of group discussions.  I am happy to say that this type of conference proved to be a great success and that the advantages deriving from it are likely to be long lasting.</P>
    <P>In view of technical advances in telephone equipment, the Engineering Branch has developed courses for training of technicians on 12-circuit carrier systems and rural automatic exchanges of types not previously covered.</P>
    <P>On the financial position, as Deputies are aware, the Commercial Accounts for 1957-58 which were published towards the end of last year, showed a profit larger than that for 1956-57, though modest in relation to the size of our business.  It was stated in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 6th May that we had not sufficient information to prepare Commercial Accounts for 1958-59, but that on such information as was available it was estimated that we would make a net profit of about £200,000.  We have not yet got all the data necessary to prepare an Account for 1958-59 and the forecast of 6th May still stands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The result of last year's working is all the more satisfactory when it is remembered that we had to meet a considerable addition to our wages bill as a result of the general increase in Civil Service pay.  Moreover, the only rate increase made during the year was on foreign telegrams and then it was to offset the increase in payments to foreign administrations and operating companies.</P>
    <P>So far as can be seen at this stage, we will be also on the right side, in the financial sense, at the end of the current year.  The basic reasons for this are the steady growth in postal and telephone traffic and the fact that we have been able to handle a higher volume of business in our stride. While the telegraph service is a losing service and one which it is quite impossible to run at a profit, we have been able to reduce the loss on it down to something in the region of £160,000 for the last few years.  A factor in this has been the success of the Telex service, which is very much appreciated by commercial and industrial concerns. Growth of traffic is, of course, dependent on many factors not within our control, but I think I can claim that the high standard of the services we provide for the public and the relatively low rates we charge for them has been an important factor in stimulating the demand for them.</P>
    <P>The sound position in which the Department now finds itself is, as I have said, due to the increase in its volume of traffic; but it would not have been possible to handle this economically without the zealous and efficient <Col N="1330" /> service which has always been given by the personnel of the Post Office to the public.  To all grades of the staff I should like to express my appreciation of their service during the past year.</P>
    <P>I should also like to add some words of appreciation of the Minister who immediately preceded me.  When the announcement was made here in the House, that Deputy Ormonde did not wish Ministerial office and had determined, for health reasons, that he would no longer serve as a member of the Government, I was very pleased to hear the good wishes and tributes paid to him by Deputies from all sides. The fact that such tributes and good wishes were extended to him was very much appreciated by me also.  I hope that Deputy Ormonde will be with us for many years to come as a Deputy for County Waterford.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We all hope that Deputy Ormonde will be restored to full health.  May I say also that I only wish that the new Minister could energise the postal deliveries from Dublin to Naas at the same rate as he read his speech?  Then we would have some results.  We shall have more about that tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10,30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16th July, 1959.</P>

      <P>The following is the text of the communiqué:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Talks took place in London today between the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, and the President of the Board of Trade, Sir David Eccles. Mr. Lemass was accompanied by Mr. Patrick Smith, Minister for Agriculture, and Mr. J. Lynch, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Mr. Vaughan-Morgan, Minister of State, Board of Trade, and Mr. Alport, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, took part on the British side.</P>
      <P>The Irish Ministers were concerned with certain trends and prospects in trade.  The British Ministers recognised the importance of these problems in view of the desire of both Governments to maintain and strengthen the special trade relationship between the two countries.  The Irish Ministers suggested possibilities for improving trade between Ireland and Britain.  It was agreed to put in hand a study of these suggestions, which will be submitted in fuller detail and in the first instance to senior officials of the two Governments who will in future meet regularly to examine other economic questions of common interest.&rdquo;</P>
