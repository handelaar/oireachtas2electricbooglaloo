      <P>No reliable estimate is available for the total number of persons who emigrated during the year 1957-58.  I have on several occasions explained in reply to questions by Deputies that it is not possible to prepare reliable estimates of total annual emigration in advance of inter-censal data and I have stated the reasons why this is so.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputies Russell and J. Murphy on 12th February, 1958, in which I drew attention to a series of previous replies on this subject.</P>
      <P>The number of Irish nationals who emigrated by sea to countries outside Europe and who travelled through ports in the State was 3,472 in 1957 and 2,005 in 1958.  The corresponding number of Irish emigrants who travelled through ports in Britain and the six Counties during 1957 was 2,116.  These data are not yet available for 1958.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the numbers of emigrants who travel by air are not compiled. In this connection, however, information can be given of the numbers of passports issued to persons going to employment or permanent residence abroad classified by intended mode of travel.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving these data for the years 1957 and 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach does he propose in future to advert to the figures given by the Minister for Labour in the British House of Commons setting out the number of new applicants for social security documents in Great Britain who have been born in Ireland and, if so, does he advert to the fact that the most recent figure speaks of their numbers amounting to approximately 50,000 in the year under review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures given up to the present&mdash;I do not know to what extent they include new entrants as well as re-entrants&mdash;are not a reliable guide in that they took no account of those who came back to this country and we know that a large number come back.  They go and come, go and come.  The British figures have not taken account of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach under consideration any method by which we could measure emigration figures accurately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Statistics Office several times about that and they have considered various ways, but none of them has been completely satisfactory.  Short of an actual census, I do not know that there is any way in which it can be done with real accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach on what figures he has <Col N="4" /> based his remark here that large numbers have come back?  Does he mean come back to stay or come back on holidays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a constant flow, as much, I think, as nearly 50 per cent. in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that when an emigrant returns to this country and then goes back to Britain, he retains the same social security card as he originally had there and would not be a new entrant such as described here to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I started my explanation by saying that I was not quite sure to what extent that has been taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach also aware that the people who he suggests come and go are described by Bord Fáilte as tourists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so, of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some would be like that, but it is quite obvious that there are people, and even generations of people, who have been going and coming like that for seasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received an application for a minor relief grant for the repair of a bridge in the townland of Stranakirka, Carrick, County Donegal; and if, owing to the urgency of this work, he will make a grant available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the bridge to which the Deputy refers is that situated at the Straleel-Stranakirka townland boundary on the accommodation road which runs northwards from the end of the county road near James Hegarty's house by Pat Harkin's house to Charles Boyle's house.</P>
      <P>A grant for the repair of this bridge was sanctioned in the 1958-59 programme of minor employment schemes for County Donegal.  The county engineer has been asked to have the work put in hands as soon as a favourable opportunity presents itself.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the implementation of this suggestion would require amending legislation which I do not propose to promote, for the present at any rate.</P>
      <P>I may say, however, that Section 50 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, provides for the making of police regulations for the keeping of accounts and other records in relation to lotteries and the furnishing of returns and information to the police.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will consider amending the law so as to (a) abolish capital punishment for murder, and (b) distinguish in such cases, for the purposes of assessing degrees of guilt, between conditions of reduced or diminished <Col N="19" /> responsibility which are medically believed to exist in certain of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The law in relation to murder has been considered by me and my predecessors at various times, both generally and as respects the specific matters referred to in the question, but I am not satisfied that it is desirable to alter the existing law with respect to either matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is a British invention and that, under the Brehon Laws, it merited that, a fine, since we are so found of quoting antiquities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister will not reconsider the question of capital punishment.  Does the Minister not agree that to the rather unsatisfactory device of a recommendation to clemency and mercy, some alternative should be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest safeguard which any of these people on a capital charge have is the fact that the jury are listening to the case, hearing the evidence, and in making their decision they are all reasonable people and in their own good judgment, they make a recommendation to mercy if they deem that desirable. From my own experience, I know that the Government take that recommendation into serious consideration and I think that is as good a safeguard as is possible and necessary to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The general position regarding the purchase of property in this country by non-nationals was set out by the Taoiseach in reply to a previous question by the Deputy on 21st November, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> As regards the purchase of land, including tracts of arable land, by non-nationals, the position is that the Land Acts make no distinction as to nationality and, for the purpose of these Acts, non-nationals are and must be on the same footing as all other landowners.  As far as the Land Commission's powers of acquisition and resumption are concerned, the same considerations apply to non-nationals as in the case of native owners.  If a non-national purchases land in this country and fails to use it in a manner suited to national production needs, then the existing powers of the Land Commission can be effectively used to acquire that land and to use it for land settlement purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the reply that non-nationals are on the same basis in regard to land as congests? May I take it that is what the Minister means when he says non-nationals have the right to purchase large tracts of arable land in the State, while we have so many congests in the country whose needs have not been met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the reply given by the Taoiseach on 21st November, 1957, he will find that a reasonable and acceptable decision was made on the position and there is no need for me to repeat it here.  What he said, in brief, was that there must be some reciprocity in regard to purchases by nationals and non-nationals, and he went on to say that should the amount of land purchased by non-nationals begin to constitute a problem, then there could be further examination of the matter.  I have been advised over recent years that the amount of large tracts of land purchased by non-nationals has been absolutely negligible and not such as to warrant any investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way: where there is an area in which congestion obtains and a large farm in that locality is purchased by a combine of non-nationals, does the Minister consider that is just, in view of the fact that the smallholders of the locality will thereby be deprived for all time of an economic holding?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures on output on forestry operations on a regional basis as requested by the Deputy are without any real meaning since the costs of any individual operation will vary widely under the influence of ground conditions and other factors.  Moreover, such figures could not be extracted without excessive consumption of staff time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incentive bonus scheme has not yet been applied at any forest in County Waterford.  Up to the end of December, 1958, the scheme had been applied at eight forests in County Tipperary. The total of bonus earnings at <Col N="30" /> these forests in the period was £4,363, representing an average bonus of £1 1s. 9d. per week for each of the men concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a quick freezing plant at Dingle is a matter for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and is receiving the constant attention of the board in the light of the landings of fish at Dingle and elsewhere. It must be left to the board to decide when to proceed with the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to wait until there are sufficient landings of fish at Dingle to justify the erection of a deep freeze plant, because that suggests that the fishermen must dump <Col N="31" /> fish to rot at Dingle for a protracted period before the plant will be constructed? Are we to ask them for six months to encumber the pier at Dingle with a rotting mass of mackerel in order to carry conviction to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that if there were a deep freeze plant there, the mackerel would not rot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure An Bord Iascaigh Mhara would take action long before there was any question of the constant dumping of large quantities of fish.  However, during the year 1958, on account of weather and other conditions, there was great difficulty in supplying fish both here and also by near water and inshore vessels operating off certain parts of the British coast.  Therefore, the question has not arisen, but it would be the policy of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara not to await a situation such as the Deputy has described.</P>

In response to the housing authority's request, I expressed the opinion that if, as seemed to be the case, the applicant derived his livelihood mainly from the pursuit of agriculture, his application should be dealt with under Section 9.</P>

      <P>Sanitary authorities who have by-laws regulating temporary dwellings in their districts may prosecute for breaches of these by-laws.  They may take similar action under the antilitter by-laws to which attention was drawn in a recent circular letter issued by my Department.  Sanitary authorities frequently invoke their powers to secure abatement of nuisances at itinerants' camps and they can also exercise some control over the use of land for temporary dwellings.  These powers of sanitary authorities are not, of course, restricted to offences by itinerants.  The general control of itinerancy is outside the scope of the sanitary services code.</P>

      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I shall reply to Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Director of Broadcasting received one complaint regarding expressions used in the programme mentioned by the Deputy.  The admissibility of one of the expressions (a religious one) depends greatly on the context in which it occurs, but on this occasion its use, and the use of the other expressions referred to, was due to a misunderstanding among the persons concerned, and it is regretted by the Director of Broadcasting and myself. Great care is taken by the director to broadcast only such material as will be welcomed in Irish homes, but, of course, late-evening broadcasts are intended for adult audiences and are scheduled at hours when it is not normal for children of tender years to be listening.  The question of giving prior notice to parents before individual broadcasts should, therefore, not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the Provisional Order set out in the Schedule, i.e., the Borough of Wexford (Alteration of Boundary) Order, 1959, which was made by the Minister for Local Government on 16th January, 1959.</P>
      <P>The area of the Borough of Wexford at present is 505 acres.  The Provisional Order proposes to add to the borough a contiguous portion of the county health district amounting in all to approximately 68 acres.  The purpose of the extension is primarily to facilitate the carrying out of the corporation's housing programme.  It is reasonable that the houses built by a local authority should be within the area over which it has jurisdiction but the building land remaining within the present borough boundary is insufficient for the purposes of the corporation's housing programme.  The corporation have already acquired most of the land proposed to be added to the borough and have constructed houses on approximately half of that land.  Plans have been prepared for the construction of further houses on the remaining half of the land and financial, engineering and administrative difficulties could arise if the land involved were to remain outside the area of jurisdiction of the corporation.</P>
      <P>The whole question was discussed at a public inquiry held at Wexford on 29th July, 1958.  The Wexford County Council was represented at that inquiry and raised no objection to the proposal.  Three private landowners affected by the proposal did not attend the inquiry and, presumably, do not object to the alteration of the boundary.</P>
      <P>The Provisional Order contains provision for the adjustment of property, rights and liabilities by agreement between the county council and the corporation. Should they fail to reach agreement the adjustment will be made by a person appointed by me. Other usual provisions included in the Order relate to the preparation of maps, valuation lists and the registration of electors.</P>

      <P>It may be too late, and it may be useless, to protest at this stage, but, in order to safeguard the position in the future, not alone in regard to Wexford but also in relation to any other similar town in similar circumstances, I should like to protest now against the extraordinary delay that took place in dealing with this application for an extension of the borough boundary.  I do not say that in criticism of either the Minister or the Department, but, as far as I can remember, the extension was suggested about five or six years ago.  The real ground for my protest is that we had local government elections in 1955 and hundreds&mdash;hundreds is not an exaggeration&mdash;of people were deprived of a vote in those elections.  I suggest that is a very serious matter for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the primary object of the Bill was to facilitate Wexford Corporation in the building of houses and in their building programme generally.  Their building programme has been so curtailed of late that I do not know that the extension of the boundary now will greatly facilitate them.  Any housing that is being done at the present time is being done within the old boundary.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to ensure that there will not be such a long delay in future.  It is a serious thing for voters to be deprived of an opportunity of exercising the franchise. That happened in the case of hundreds of voters in Bishopswater and Corish Park.  Now that this matter has reached a conclusion, I trust that these people will be able to vote in the local elections to be held next year.  There should be some quicker method of including in a borough area people who have been housed by the borough, in this case, Wexford Corporation.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Standing Orders of the Dáil and the Seanad relative to Private Business be amended as set out in the Schedule to the Report <Col N="74" /> (T. 165) of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business), dated 19th November, 1958.</P>
    <P>For some time past, it has been felt that the Standing Orders relating to private business should be amended in order to bring them into harmony with present practice and conditions. The Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business) considered the matter and its recommendations are embodied in the Schedule to the Report under consideration.</P>
    <P>The first amendment deals with Standing Order No. 20.  This Standing Order lists the Departments at which copies of Private Bills must be deposited. The purpose of the amendment is to bring the Standing Order up-to-date as regards the changes in number and nomenclature of the Departments since the Standing Orders were last printed in 1939.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 regularises present practice.  Departments are empowered to make reports on Private Bills which have been deposited with them and, as doubt has been expressed as to whom they should be forwarded, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that these reports are lodged in the Private Bill Office in the first instance.  Copies of the reports will, as a matter of routine, be sent to the promoters as soon as possible after receipt.</P>
    <P>The third amendment relates to the fees payable in respect of proceedings on Private Bills and Provisional Order Confirmation Bills.  These fees have not been altered since 1923 and the Joint Committee felt that, in present circumstances, they are unreal and should be increased.  Under the present scale of fees, an average of £90 is received in respect of a Private Bill. When it is considered that the cost of printing the last report of a Joint Committee on a Private Bill was £37, it will be appreciated that the amount received in fees does not adequately cover the expenses involved.  Accordingly, the Joint Committee recommends that all these fees should be increased by roughly 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 has been necessitated by the transfer of the Fisheries Branch from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> Amendment No. 5 is consequential on Amendment No. 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £987,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for payment of certain remuneration.</P>
      <P>In my Budget statement last April, I announced that I had agreed to extend the National Wages Agreement of September, 1957, to the arbitrable groups in the civil service and to certain other public servants.  This Supplementary Estimate makes provision for additional expenditure arising from that decision, account being taken of savings otherwise on the existing provisions for remuneration.  Since the original Supplementary Estimate was prepared, the Government have accepted the findings of the chairman of the arbitration board for secondary teachers on a salary claim made on behalf of the secondary teachers and a revised Supplementary Estimate, including the necessary provision, has accordingly been circulated.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached under the conciliation and arbitration machinery for increases to civil servants coming within its scope by reference to the 10/- a week increase set out in the National Agreement.  These increases date from 1st April, 1958, and the cost, without taking savings into account, is estimated to be £597,000 for the current year.</P>
      <P>Similar increases have been accorded to the Defence Forces at a cost of £195,000, and to the Garda Síochána, at a cost of £156,000.</P>
      <P>A claim by vocational teachers was settled by conciliation agreement on a similar basis.  A proportion of the increase falls to be recouped to vocational education committees by Exchequer grants, and the extra cost to the Exchequer this year is estimated to be £22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases accorded to national teachers are the result of a finding by <Col N="79" /> the arbitration board for national teachers.  The chairman of the board recommended new salary scales, with effect from the 1st September, 1958, and this recommendation has been accepted by the Government.  Its effect is, broadly, to increase the salaries of national teachers by 6 per cent.  The cost this year is £226,000.</P>
    <P>The increases accorded to secondary teachers likewise result from arbitration. The chairman of the arbitration board recommended new incremental salary scales, with effect from the 1st September, 1958, and this recommendation has been accepted by the Government.  Its effect is, broadly, to increase the salaries of secondary teachers by 6 per cent.  The cost this year is £56,000.</P>
    <P>Health authority employees, 50 per cent. of whose remuneration is paid out of State grants, obtained, in common with other local authority employees, increases similar to those granted to civil servants.  The cost to the Exchequer in the current year is estimated at £112,000 but, as sufficient savings are available in the existing Vote for Health, no provision is made for health staffs in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The 1955 pay settlement for the Civil Service provided that the increases on 1948 basic rates should be 37½ per cent. on the first £250 a year, 22½ per cent. on the next £715 and 17½ per cent. on anying in excess of £965. I have now agreed to allow the same percentage increase on pay above £965 as applies on pay between £250 and £965.  The officers primarily concerned did not receive the increases granted to the arbitrable groups but they are getting an increase of 5 per cent. on the portion of their pay in excess of £965.  This arrangement, which has effect from the 1st April, 1958, is estimated to cost £19,000 in the current year, and the necessary provision is included in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The figures of cost which I have given for the classes covered by this Estimate total £1,271,000.  By the <Col N="80" /> utilisation of savings, the additional money required has been reduced to £987,000, the figure set out on the face of the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate, which appears on its face to be for £987,000, should be considered in the light of what the Minister has said.  It is, in fact, a Supplementary Estimate for £1,250,000, offset by adventitious savings on other subheads. Now, it is the view of this Party that these adjustments in salaries and wages are equitable and fair, because they are consequential on the increase in the cost of living created by the positive act of the Government. However, it is no harm for the House to pause now and look a little more closely at the significance of this Supplementary Estimate.  This is one of the Minister's birds that are coming home to roost, consequent on this Government's decision to tax bread, flour and butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was young in politics and we discussed Budgets, we were always solicitous to differentiate between what were called hard taxes and soft taxes. It is true to say that, in one sense, no tax is a soft tax, but for comparative purposes, we used to say that a tax which affected only a luxury could be legitimately regarded as a soft tax, since it was open to those who used the luxury to forego its user, if they did not choose to pay the tax.  On the other hand, if you put a tax upon a thing like bread or butter or tea, that is a hard tax, because in the circumstances of our society, particularly in regard to the poor, many people have no alternative but to use tea, bread, flour and butter&mdash;except perhaps to sink to a level in their standard of living which this House has never sought to impose upon any of our people, that is to say, to bid them give up tea and to eat margarine instead of <Col N="81" /> butter.  Therefore, we were always concerned to avoid hard taxes, unless in extreme and dire necessity, because we felt that they bore heavily on the poor and those least able to bear them. That was the ordinary humanitarian approach of Oireachtas Éireann as long as I remember it.</P>
    <P>There was another consideration which always affected our judgment. If you taxed essential foodstuffs, you undermined economic stability by radically changing the cost of living for the people and there ensued, upon a decision of that kind by the Oireachtas, a perfectly legitimate agitation by those who were organised to protect themselves.  That agitation occurred for a corresponding adjustment in remuneration and the trade unionists offset the increase in the cost of living by getting increased wages. That happened 12 months ago, when the wages went up by 10/- a week for the Civil Service, the Army, the national teachers, secondary teachers, vocational teachers and the Garda Síochána.  They all lined up and they got their increase; and in this case it amounts to £1,250,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Then Oireachtas Éireann was confronted with the problem of the old age pensioner, the widow and the unemployed and was brought face to face with this fact, that the increase in the cost of living&mdash;which according to this Estimate required an adjustment of 10/- a week in the case of civil servants, the Defence Forces, the Gardaí and several other categories of persons, and of all trade unionists&mdash;was deemed to have been met by an increase of 1/6 in the old age pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A shilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A shilling.  I think the adjustments envisaged by this Supplementary Estimate are fair, but I ask the House to consider the feeling of the old age pensioners, the recipients of widows' and orphans' pensions and the recipients of unemployment allowances, who are far more dependent on bread, butter and tea than are the categories of persons mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate. <i>Vis-á-vis</i> all those people, <Col N="82" /> comparatively, in any case, who get 10/- a week to meet the increase in the cost of living consequent on the increase in the price of bread, butter, tea and flour, the old age pensioner who is practically living on these four comestibles gets a shilling to meet that charge.</P>
      <P>Ministers have their difficulties and Parliaments are inclined to deal with specific problems pragmatically, but we ought to try to bear in mind that if, by our act, we deliberately increase the chasm that is opening between the poor and the well-to-do in this country, we will undermine the whole basis upon which our society stands.  I believe in a free society, but if a free society is to survive, there must be some standard of justice between one section of the people and another.  I was reading recently a speech by Mr. Khrushchev, who says that he envisages the emergence of a society in Russia where there will be no taxes, a 40 hour week for everybody, guaranteed employment for 100 per cent. of the population, security from hunger, exposure and destitution.</P>
      <P>I can well imagine a lot of people, suffering under great stress, yearning for such a development and oblivious of the fact that it is to be found in the City of Dublin, by anybody who wants it&mdash;in Mountjoy Gaol.  There he will get three square meals a day, 40 hours a week employment, a secure roof and a warm bed.  Provided he is prepared to accept the conditions in Mountjoy Gaol, he need not travel to Moscow to enjoy the amenities promised by Mr. Khrushchev for his whole population.</P>
      <P>However, if by the positive act of this Parliament, we increase the cost of living on the people on a large scale, which imposes on us a duty to give every employee of the State 10/- a week extra to offset that increased cost, and if we go to the unemployed, the old age pensioner, the widow and the recipient of home assistance and say: &ldquo;You will get only 1/- and do the best you can on that,&rdquo; we are doing all in our power to make Mr. Khrushchev's alternative to freedom more attractive than it ought to be to free men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the end of the story, <Col N="83" /> Sir.  In addition to considering where this money is to go, we must ask ourselves where this money is to come from.  Of course the money which is to pay this extra remuneration, and a great many other charges, is to come from the taxes on butter, flour, bread and tea, or rather on butter, flour and bread, which the Government have drawn into the Exchequer by the decision taken when they removed the subsidies on these commodities.  That has several direct and readily identifiable results, but it also has some remote results as well.  I see a notice in to-day's paper that the rates in the City of Dublin are to go up by 2/- in the £ and that it is largely the result of increased remuneration made necessary to offset the increased cost of living.  The rates in every county council in Ireland are going up partly for the same reason, partly because the cost of maintaining people in county hospitals and other county institutions is increasing as a result of the increased cost of flour, bread and butter.</P>
    <P>Picture the feelings of a ten acre farmer in County Monaghan or County Mayo.  He eats bread; he buys butter if his family are to be maintained on a tolerable standard of living.  He sees every civil servant in the country, every civic guard in the country, every soldier, every teacher&mdash; secondary, national and vocational&mdash; every trade unionist in the country, every railway worker, everybody who has the protection of a trade union, getting an increase in his wages of 10/- a week.  The small farmer&mdash;and when I say a small farmer, I mean a man with less than 20 acres of land&mdash; who has to buy bread, butter, and flour, has to pay the extra price for these things which provides the money to meet the charges envisaged in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>When he asks: &ldquo;What compensation am I getting to help me to bear this increased burden,&rdquo; he is told: &ldquo;You get no increased compensation at all.  Far from it&mdash;you will get less for your creamery milk, less in the guaranteed minimum price for your grade A pigs, less in the guaranteed minimum price for your barley, and <Col N="84" /> less in the guaranteed price of your wheat, if you grow any.&rdquo;  He asks the question: &ldquo;Am I going to get any more income, from any source, to meet these increased costs?&rdquo; and the answer is: &ldquo;No, but, in so far as you are paying rates on buildings, you will have to pay more rates as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder the population is simply disappearing from Mayo, Galway, Donegal, Roscommon, Leitrim, Clare and Kerry?  I warn this House that they are wiping out the population of the West of Ireland; they are creating a situation in the West of Ireland to-day in which the whole system of land tenure is breaking down because the society built on the family farm is ceasing to be viable.  It used to be the case that on 20 to 30 acres an industrious family in the West of Ireland could maintain a very modest but tolerable standard of living, which they cheerfully accepted, because they preferred to be masters in their own home rather than to become the salaried employees of others.</P>
    <P>It is true that 100 years ago, Lord Lucan, the great exterminator, told them that they were wrong in desiring to own their own holdings, and that he would bring in Scotch overseers, evict them all into the Castlebar workhouse and, when he had consolidated their holdings, he would hire them, give them good wages and regular employment, and that they would not have to worry any more&mdash;they would be working for him. They rejected that ultimatum and they put Lord Lucan out of West Mayo. They became the owners of the land themselves and so they remained for close on 100 years, never rich, but comfortable, but we are creating a situation to-day in which the burdens created by Estimates of this character, and the legislation out of which the necessity for this Estimate arises, are making all these small holdings in the West of Ireland hopelessly and irremediably uneconomic.</P>
    <P>It is time the House paused and asked itself this question: was the policy of seeking to keep the cost of living down in this country, and maintaining stability on the basis of stable prices for essential commodities, a <Col N="85" /> better one than the policy of letting the cost of living go sky high, with consequent inflationary compensation for the well to do, and an effort on our part to close our eyes to the consequences on the poor of this decision? I do not profess now to be an authority on conditions obtaining in the City of Dublin&mdash;I knew as much as anybody did about them 30 years ago but now I am more familiar with circumstances obtaining in rural Ireland&mdash;but I am told that at the moment on some of the new housing estates around the City of Dublin, in West Cabra, in Ballyfermot and in Crumlin, there are families living in new houses who are on the very borders of destitution, and in which hunger has reappeared.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that 35 years ago in the tenement rooms of certain parts of the City of Dublin, hunger obtained. There were destitute people in them, and I always regarded it as one of the things of which this country could be proud that, for the first 35 years of this State's existence, no section of this House did rest easily so long as that continued to be the situation in the capital city, and any other part of this country, and that we were prepared to resort to any and every remedy requisite to ending destitution and hunger in any Irish home.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I believe the policy of which this Supplementary Estimate is born may include provision for compensation of the well-to-do, but it has completely ignored the consequences for the poor, and those for whom this House ought primarily to be concerned.  I see a number of Dublin Deputies here representing the people of Dublin, and I think it behoves them to say&mdash;Deputy Haughey and Deputy Booth&mdash;what is their knowledge of the conditions in Dublin. Can they correct me?  Am I wrong when I say that in a number of housing estates in this city at the present time, never mind the tenements, there are families who are hungry, who are not getting enough to provide their children with sufficient food and that that is in some measure due to the phenomenon referred to by Lord Rank at the meeting of the Rank Company last week in Limerick, when he said <Col N="86" /> that from the day the Fianna Fáil tax was put on bread, the consumption of bread suffered a catastrophic fall from which it has never recovered?</P>
    <P>A society has gone pretty far when the consumption of bread falls.  It is a characteristic of an immensely prosperous community if it means that the standard of living is getting so high that the people are eliminating bread and substituting cake, but I do not think anyone will argue that that is the problem here.  The problem here of a declining consumption of bread and flour derives from the fact that a great many people cannot afford to buy the bread necessary to give their families enough to eat.  Is that not a shocking thing, if it is true?</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady here is from Dublin and ought to know Dublin well.  He represents big housing estates in this area and I assume he has fairly comprehensive knowledge of them.  Are there families in these areas who are without the essentials?  This catastrophic decline in the consumption of bread, I believe, indicates in Dublin an inability on the part of the poor to buy the necessaries of life.  In rural Ireland&mdash;here I speak of things I know&mdash;it is an indication of the mass migration of the people.  I live in a rural area, in Ballaghaderreen, which, when the Congested Districts Board was established in 1898, was reckoned to be the second most congested area in Ireland.  More than 25 per cent. of the population have gone.  That decline in the population of the area of East Mayo has taken place substantially since the war and the shocking thing is that they are going now in numbers just as great or greater than they went before.  Heretofore, one felt justified in remonstrating with them that they were leaving something that was good to seek something, which if fully understood, was not at all as good, although its monetary reward might appear at first glance to be better.  I do not think we can make that case any longer. We have raised the costs of essential foods in this country to a level which makes it impossible for a family to live a reasonable life on a small holding in the West of Ireland now and if <Col N="87" /> we measure the increased cost per household by what it has been deemed fair and equitable to give to the civil servant, the teacher, the civic guard, the soldier and the trade union, will anyone argue that you would not be bound to give something in excess of that, if the small farmer is to be adequately recouped for the loss he has sustained?</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House that the dialectic which has been opened by the disastrous decision to shatter the stability which had been established by our decision to maintain the price of bread, flour and butter at a level price is very difficult fully or intelligently to anticipate.  I do not know where it will end ultimately but one of the great evils of that decision is that it is irreversible because, once you have made a change of that kind and introduced into the economic and social structure of our society the kind of adjustments that are envisaged in this Supplementary Estimate, you are leaving behind you a problem of poverty and destitution which I very much doubt we have resources in this country to handle.  Yet, can we all here sit calmly in the knowledge that there are families suffering from hunger in this city and have no means to get the food to feed their children? I do not think we can but the cost of adequately meeting that situation will be a burden on our resources which I am not at all sure our resources can meet.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt if any of the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have considered this question at all. Am I unjust to the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party representing the city of Dublin if I ask them what is their view as to what ought to be done in regard to the families who are hungry in this city?  Am I unjust if I ask the Deputies representing the congested areas of North Mayo what do they think ought to be done to meet the case of the small farmer who can no longer make ends meet, no matter how he works?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  To <Col N="90" /> my knowledge, things in those areas now are at least about 50 times better than they were in the dreadful winter of 1956 when the stagnation and despair and unemployment which were rife in Dublin city at that time led practically everybody in the city to the point of almost throwing in the sponge.  I can assure Deputy Dillon that, in fact, practically everybody who has considered the situation is agreed that the turning-point after that black winter of 1956 came with the 1957 Budget and that things have definitely and consistently improved since that time.</P>
      <P>My main reason for speaking is to appeal on behalf of a particular section of the community: I think this is the appropriate occasion.  The Minister has very many claims being made upon him and very many appeals are submitted to him.  He would need to have far greater resources at his disposal than he has if he were to meet them all.  Nevertheless, it is only right that I should put forward the case of Civil Service pensioners.  A considerable number of my constituents are in that category.  They have great difficulty in making ends meet on the fixed pension on which they have to subsist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what I want to say on this Supplementary Estimate would, I suppose, be more appropriate on the Vote on Account and therefore I propose to be brief.  I was amused by Deputy Haughey's reply to Deputy Dillon.  He talked about the gloom that pervaded this city in 1956 and then attempted to demonstrate how that gloom was lifted consequent on the 1957 Budget.</P>
      <P>I suppose it would not be in order to follow Deputy Dillon's line and plead for the old age pensioners and others.  I agree that these increases are justified to teachers, members of the Defence Forces, civil servants, Garda Síochána and the rest.  What strikes me is that the Minister now asks the House for a round £1,000,000 and, with a snap of the fingers, we propose to give him the £1,000,000. The Minister spent a short while, when introducing the Supplementary Estimate, in pointing out that the total cost would be £1,000,000.  It has often been pleaded here that the old age pensioners should get an increase of 2/6 a week.  The conservative Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, abetted by the Minister for Social Welfare, throws up his hands and says: &ldquo;Do Deputies realise that if we gave another 2/6 a week to the old age pensioners, it would cost £1,000,000?&rdquo; However, we do not seem to have any difficulty in finding £1,000,000 for the people listed in this Supplementary Estimate.  I suggest that the Government should bend their efforts towards getting some money to give an increase to people such as the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If gloom was lifted by the Budget of 1957, one might ask Deputy Haughey what the position is of some of the people living in Ballyfermot, Crumlin and West Cabra.  Has their position been improved since May, 1957?  The person who was on sickness <Col N="92" /> benefit in September, 1956, received 30/- per week and that is the sum he receives to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to some of Deputy Haughey's statements.  The old age pensioner who received 25/-per week in June, 1957, still receives 25/- per week, despite the fact that food has gone up in price by 12 per cent.  I do not think that Deputy Haughey can substantiate his allegation that things have greatly improved.  We still have these people in the same financial position and we still have something like 83,000 or 84,000 unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to keep from mentioning the unemployed and the old age pensioners on this Supplementary Estimate, because, as the last speaker said, we are being asked to vote £1,000,000 for certain people who have a fair income and we are seriously asked to agree to all this. It is very difficult for those who represent the poorer sections of the community&mdash;and I am one of them&mdash; not to say a single word about the people who are not to get £1,000,000. I shall not say very much as it is out of order, but I just want to refer to the statement by Deputy Haughey that there is no poverty.  The city estimate covering housing this year is up by several thousands because we expect a greater number of vacancies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate provides the House with the first opportunity for two months of saying anything on the economic situation of the country.  Before Christmas, the Government had such a meagre programme that Deputies were brought here for one day per week and then told to go home.  There were no matters of sufficient consequence to provide a Government programme of more than one day per week, but the Dáil was brought back at an unprecedentedly early time to deal with a measure intended to cost the Exchequer some £80,000 and it is only now that the House is being given an opportunity of coming down to bedrock and dealing with the fundamental conditions of the country as they exist to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a formidable sum that the <Col N="94" /> Minister asks the House to vote.  It is necessary, but it is necessary only because of the Minister's financial policy.  The recipients of every penny of this £987,000 will not be one penny better off when they get it than they were two years ago.  They will be worse off, because the independent gentlemen who sat on a tribunal examining the impact of the cost of living on the wage earners found that the impact on the ordinary household was not less than 15/- per week. The first to come to the assistance of those who were adversely affected by the Government's financial policy was the private sector of the community. Every day the people of this country tuned in to Radio Eireann, there was an announcement, repeated week after week for months on end, that such and such an organised labour body had secured an increase of 7/6d., or 10/-, or 12/6d. per week in their wages in order to meet the impact of the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Government who preceded this Government were fully conscious, and they were daily conscious, of what the impact would be on the Exchequer, what the impact would be in human suffering and in destitution, if some control were not maintained over the prices of the necessaries of life.  If that Government had no other point in their favour, nothing else to record beyond the fact that for the three years during which they were here in office, by no act of theirs did they spark off any single point increase in the cost of living, by no single action of theirs, or indeed by their entire policy, did they spark off a situation in which it was necessary for the private employer, necessary for the public authority employer, or necessary for the State as an employer, to come to the rescue of the people by giving them an increase in their incomes so as to combat something that occurred which was caused by that Government, they would have justified themselves.  In fact, they came to the rescue of the people&mdash;those classes for whom Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish appealed this afternoon&mdash;when they were adversely affected by conditions completely outside the control of the Government at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> The Government now in office cannot say that they were not warned. First of all, they had the experience of what occurred when they slashed the food subsidies in 1952, when the country had to bear, in the years that followed, a heavier impost in public expenditure and in private expenditure because of the slashing of the food subsidies.  The country was quick to record its opinion of the Government's policy in those days.  The people were warned but unfortunately they ignored the warning.  They did not heed it and they were warned that if the Party now in office got control of the Government again, not alone would they repeat what they did in 1952, with consequences similar to the consequences that ensued then, but they would completely wipe out the food subsidies.  That went home to the point that the Taoiseach took himself off to the West of Ireland, to Deputy Calleary's part of the country, and no doubt Deputy Calleary was sitting behind him at the time and nodding his head in approval when the Taoiseach announced that he would not remove the food subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but the Supplementary Estimate is necessary because the food subsidies have been removed.  That is the reason for the Supplementary Estimate.  It proposes to compensate State servants for the impact on their incomes in consequence of what the Government did in their Budget of 1957.  We warned the House and the Government that there were many thousands of our people on limited incomes, people in the category for whom Deputy Haughey appealed a few minutes ago, the retired civil servants who did not get anything to meet the impact on their cost of living in consequence of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  We know that throughout the country to-day there are many thousands of people, such as those on limited incomes, who are finding it extremely hard to face up to the difficulties they are encountering this <Col N="96" /> moment.  Reference has been made in particular to the old age pensioners and in recent weeks when the <i>Sunday Independent</i> made a case for a modification of the means test for old age pensioners and when it made a case for an increase in the old age pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to make it relevant.  If I am allowed to complete what I am saying, I shall make it relevant. What I am leading up to is that the Minister for Health&mdash;he did not say that these were not necessary, or that they were not just&mdash;said: &ldquo;Where would we get the money?&rdquo; He could get it where he is getting the £1,000,000 to-day.</P>
      <P>When this dramatic increase was deliberately sparked off by Government action, we warned the House that it was the people in the lower income groups who would be most seriously affected.  To-day we are asked to give £1 per week extra to those with a salary of £1,000 per annum.  There was a time when the Taoiseach said that no man in the country was worth £1,000 per year; he secured office on that assertion among others.  He now proposes this Supplementary Estimate to give a man with a salary of £1,000 an extra £50 a year to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man in the £1,000 a year salary class has meat three times a day; he is not interested in the price of bread; his wife or housekeeper never bought a stone of flour in her life and she does not care if it was 3/6 or 3/7 a stone as in the inter-Party days, or 7/9 a stone as it now is.  She is not interested in the fact that butter was 3/9 a lb. when the previous Government were in office and that it is 4/3 to-day.  The people who have lunch at mid-day and dinner in the evening are being provided with an extra £50 a year in this Estimate to meet the increased cost of <Col N="97" /> living, at a time when the Minister for Health says that it is impossible to come to the rescue of the old age pensioners, the blind, the widows or the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

I am making the point that they can find this £1,000,000; where are they getting it?  They are getting it, I submit, in various directions, from certain taxes or levies on certain unorganised sections of the community.  I shall point to one and I shall produce evidence of a tax that was unheard of until last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We got fresh evidence from the Minister for Finance when he was introducing this Estimate.  We got information we did not have until he spoke and my remarks are directed to the consequences of the information he gave to the House.  He said not alone would we require £987,000 but that was not the entire impact on the Exchequer; that there had been considerable savings in various Departments and that money must now be added to the £987,000 bringing it to £1,271,000; and that, in fact, in some categories it was not for the entire 12 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the food subsidies were abolished, the Minister and the Government assured the House and the country that this expenditure was unnecessary <Col N="99" /> in our circumstances.  In fact, when the previous Government redeemed the award to the State servants which the Fianna Fáil Government could not see their way to implement, members of the present Government alleged that it was wrong to implement that award, that it would cause inflation and that unknown other evils would flow from what the Government in office then did.  We are entitled to ask what the consequences of this will be.  Surely, as public representatives asked to vote such a formidable sum as £1,271,000, which the State servants are entitled to receive, we can attribute the necessity for the Vote to the Government's financial policy, to the fact that they failed so miserably to protect the ordinary people from the impact of the increased cost of living.  They were warned, and ignored the warning, that this would be the consequence of what they were doing.  We were assured this was a strong Government that could withstand any pressure and that in the course of time the taxpayers would be relieved in consequence of not having to meet the cost of subsidising necessary foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>This proves that the State must, of necessity, follow the actions of the private sector of the community who were the first to adopt what the Government are now adopting at a late stage.  When the private individuals and companies awarded employees increased wages, they did so because it was necessary to protect their employees against the sudden and dreadful increase in the cost of living.  That was followed by the local authorities who gave their workers increased wages throughout the country and rate-payers at large are now called upon, as in Dublin City, to meet increased rates for the same reason as lies behind the introduction of this Vote to-day.</P>
    <P>There is also the impact on the Exchequer of the cost of running all our public institutions.  This is not a new Supplementary Estimate, but it is the largest we have met so far. Each Minister has had to come in here in turn and ask the House for more money for his Department because he <Col N="100" /> found the original Estimate insufficient in consequence of increased wages and salaries these Departments now have to bear.  This is merely a continuation of what this House has experienced ever since the Government took that fatal step and since they sparked off round after round of wage increases, increases which were bound to follow their action in causing the cost of living to increase.</P>
    <P>Not alone did the people expect that the cost of living would be kept down; not alone did they expect that our public servants would be sufficiently rewarded for their services to the State but they were led to believe that the Government proposed to reduce the cost of running the Civil Service.  Many civil servants believe that if that could be done, they would secure better incomes and better conditions.  What do we find?  Far from this being met by economies in the Civil Service, despite the assurance by the Minister in his Budget Statement that he would effect such economics, and despite the fact that that was followed by repeated articles and statements that the Minister was burning the midnight oil in his efforts to reduce the running cost of the Civil Service, we now find that he could secure only a fraction of the cost of meeting this arbitration award by economies and that he is now compelled to ask this House to vote almost £1,000,000 for this purpose.  Furthermore, we are asked to do it without inquiring where the money is coming from.  The first to inquire, I allege, was the Minister for Health when he was forced to make a case as to why the Government could not come to the rescue of the people who are more adversely affected at this time.</P>

      <P>All the Deputies on the Government side&mdash;and I am sure many of them must be quite familiar with the conditions that exist at the moment&mdash;agree with us that the Garda, the teachers, the Army and the Civil Service are fully entitled to what we are giving them here to-day, but those Deputies will never secure from their Government justice and equity <Col N="101" /> for those who are worse off among us if we are to have the type of contribution which Deputy Haughey made here this afternoon.  Deputy Haughey informed us that in consequence of the Minister's 1957 Budget, the people of Crumlin, Finglas and Ballyfermot are 50 times better off to-day, that the old age pensioner who got 1/- to meet the increase in the cost of flour, butter and bread is 50 times better off than he was before these increases took place.  Will anybody on the opposite side support that contention? What hope have they of impressing upon this Government the desirability of doing something and doing it quickly to assist those people when we have statements of that nature being made?</P>
      <P>As the Chair has reminded us, we shall have other occasions to bring this point home, but surely we could expect that, in consequence of the situation which forced the Government to introduce this Estimate, they would realise, as the first inter-Party Government of 1948 realised, that the first concern of that Government should be the more needy sections of our people.  At that time, the inter-Party Government came to the rescue of the old age pensioners and the poorer classes who needed additional means of sustenance.  They were the first people they thought of and after that they provided the arbitration machinery which makes it possible now for State servants to secure legitimately, without having to resort to what State servants have to resort to in other countries, what they are entitled to as a result of the Government's deliberate policy, as well as the Government's failure to control the cost of living for the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will we come to the end of the litany of Supplementary Estimates and of the permanent charge in the years to come like the permanent charge on the Exchequer in years gone by in consequence of the reduction of the food subsidies in 1952? Deputy Dillon pointed out what Lord Rank had to say last night about the reduction in the consumption of flour and bread in the country.  In my constituency, <Col N="102" /> it was brought home more forcibly to us when a big mill had to close down and when some 40 employees in the town of Mallow were dismissed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I should like to make my remarks relevant by saying that when we approached the Department of Industry and Commerce to look after those people who were dismissed, we were informed that the millers could not maintain that industry because of the reduction in bread consumption.  In the dairying industry, we know what has happened in relation to butter consumption, and that as a result of the Government's policy, the consumption of a cheap substitute for Irish butter has been noticeable.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might come to the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  We agree that this Supplementary Estimate should be passed by the House, but we say that many among the recipients are not as adversely affected by the cost of living as other sections of the community.  This is a large sum of money, the expenditure of which will not put one man or woman into employment, the expenditure of which will not save one boy or girl from emigration.  It is merely an additional impost on the Exchequer in consequence of a rash action and one of the greatest mistakes made by any Government since the State was founded in sparking off round after round of salary increases and leaving the recipients no better off than before the Government took that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, this is no surprise to us in Fine Gael, because line by line we challenged the Government, when they introduced that Budget of 1957, as to whether they would secure the reduction in expenditure they said they would produce by cutting the food subsidies.  We are adding on thousands <Col N="103" /> of pounds to the local authorities and hundreds of thousands on to the private sector of the community who are able to pass that on again to the consumer, 1d. on one thing and 2d. on something else.  They are able to recoup themselves within a matter of months, so that what is reflected in the actual cost of living does not fully indicate the impact on the public in consequence of the spiral set up by the Government's action two years ago.</P>
    <P>They should wear sackcloth and ashes when they ask the House to vote this sum of money.  The Minister for Finance blandly said that it is desirable that we should do this, that in fact it is necessary that we should do this. However, it was quite understandable that he did not go into any details and did not submit to the House any reason for it or advance the circumstances that made it necessary for the Government, whom the dustmen of Dublin brought to their knees, to ask us to give them this £987,000, with the country howling out that something be done in relation to unemployment and emigration and that something be done for the poorer sections of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in asking the House for this £987,000, is merely doing bare justice to the classes that will receive this remuneration; but when all is said and done, the real reason for this Supplementary Estimate is, as other speakers have said, the action of the Government.  It is due to the fact that, two years ago, they went back on promises made in the election a short time before, principally that the food subsidies would not be touched.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made these promises&mdash;one in Belmullet, the other in Waterford&mdash; a few days before polling took place.  I am sure the Government realise now it was bad management.  The few million saved on food subsidies cost much more, if we take into account the impact it had on local authority officials as well as Government officials. Nobody would  the Guards, the teachers the Army and the civil servants&mdash;all doing an excellent job in <Col N="104" /> their own fields&mdash;a fair and just remuneration.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister can pay one penny of this sum, he must get the permission of this House.  I submit it is not good enough for the Minister simply to ask the House to give £987,000 without any debate.  It is not the Minister's money nor the Government's money.  We must consider two classes: those who receive it, and those whose pockets are being picked to provide it.  On the question of those who are to receive the money, as I have said, I agree they are fully entitled to this remuneration.  The blame for this heavy expenditure must lie on the Government's shoulders.  It is because of their bungling and particularly because of their fraudulent going back on election promises two years ago.</P>
      <P>Not alone must we consider those who will receive the money, but we must consider those being bled to provide it.  There are many classes in the community who will not get any remuneration or assistance in meeting the increased cost of living that has made this Supplementary Estimate necessary. It is because certain classes are organised&mdash;and more power to them for it &mdash;that they are able to get these things. But it is most unfair and unjust to blister people who are not organised and have little or no chance of raising their voices against this imposition and other impositions like it due in the next week or ten days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the people at the receiving end, we do not hear anything about them emigrating; but we hear about those who are being blistered and whose pockets are being picked to provide this money.  We see them leaving in train loads every day of the week and every week of the year. Apart from the fraudulent promises which brought about the necessity for this Supplementary Estimate, it was shockingly bad management.  The last speaker, Deputy O'Sullivan, said those who are now receiving this increase will not be 1d. better off than they were when the inter-Party Government were in power.  That is a perfectly true and accurate assessment of the situation.  The people receiving this remuneration are merely getting bare <Col N="105" /> justice, but the number of people covered by it are small.  The remainder of the people must bear the cost of it. Neither the Government nor the Minister has private funds to meet an Estimate like this.  It is for those at the paying end, the &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; end, that a voice should be raised.  Those who cannot raise their voices effectively and are not organised deserve to have somebody raise a voice for them here. I would be completely out of order in mentioning the old age pensioners and certain other classes, but I shall have another opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on a statement made by Deputy Haughey when he referred to the &ldquo;black winter&rdquo; of 1956 and the &ldquo;bright spring&rdquo; that came when the present Minister for Finance introduced his Budget in 1957. Does Deputy Haughey think that the people here are all fools or that his own constituents are fools?  He calls the winter &ldquo;black&rdquo; at a time when bread was only half the price it was after the Minister for Finance removed the subsidies.  If that is the kind of brightness Fianna Fáil have brought to Dublin, it is the same brightness Deputy Calleary has brought to North and South Mayo and all the West of Ireland, and we do not want any more of it.  If bringing in a bright ray of sunshine means increasing the cost of living by 12 per cent. and doubling the price of butter and bread&mdash;two staple items in the diet of the people&mdash; if that is their idea of dispelling the gloom of a &ldquo;black winter&rdquo;, to quote Deputy Haughey, then God preserve us from such rays of sunshine as he describes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I welcome the increases granted under this Estimate.  In fact, they are belated, if anything.  But I think it is only right that we should look at the need for this Estimate as well as the fact that it is being given.  Most of us are aware that when the proposal to abolish the food subsidies came about, those of us connected with the trade union movement warned that we would, by the might and force of our organisations, secure for our members the right to be compensated.  It is well known that private industries and the trade union movement met <Col N="106" /> together in a national effort and agreed on a formula for a wage increase, amounting to 10/-, to offset the increased cost of living.  All credit to the trade union movement and the private industries for making that effort to prevent the country's economy being totally upset at the time.  There was grave danger of such an upset because of the removal of the food subsidies without any warning and without any time being given for adjustments to be made.  All credit to the trade union movement in Dublin, which forced the Government to recognise the right, both of local authority employees and Government employees, to a national wage concession. I welcome the fact that it is now being given to the civil servants.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why it is considered necessary that certain female employees in the Civil Service do not get the full award of 10/- but get 7/6d.  I would suggest that, at the direction of the Government, that is being followed in local authorities and that certain female employees are getting only 7/6d.  As this is a cost of living award and not a wage increase, it is only right that whether these people are adult male or female or juvenile male or female employees, they should receive that remuneration to meet the increased cost of living, irrespective of what scale they are on or what grade they are in.  It is unjust to have this perpetrated on our local authority employees at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having referred to the duty of trade unions to fight for their members' rights, it would be unfair for me, irrespective of whether the Chair feels I am right or wrong, not to mention that a number of the poorest people in the country were left without protection.  At that time, we appealed to the Minister for a concession for them.  That concession was given in the form of a modest shilling, which is very different from the 10/- increase for adult workers which private industries agreed to as compensation for the increased cost of living, following the Government's abolition of the food subsidies.  This was being done at a time when our industries were being appealed to to prepare for <Col N="107" /> an export market.  I protest that this wage increase, this bonus which is being passed on, much as it is deserved, is not being passed on to those who most deserve it, namely, those within the social welfare groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, agree to the passage of this Vote.  For my part, I do not agree with any wild acclamation.  I agree to its passage with what I hope to show will be a logical measure of protest.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate is yet one more of the many blows being struck not at our economic stability, important in its own way in the life of the nation, but at the stability of public morality, without which no nation can endure and without which people despair. Once that degree of despair is reached, hopelessness impels the people to leave; some will leave a situation in which perhaps they see no future and no hope of an adequate reward and others will leave because they see no future of any kind before them.  That is the kind of result which follows on the weakening of public morality and the weakening of the faith of the people in the utterances of public men.</P>
      <P>This Estimate is necessary by reason of the fact that the Budget of 1957 brought hardship upon all sections of our people.  This Estimate selects certain sections of our people for compensation to help them over difficult times.  It is by reason of the selectiveness, the justice of which I do not question, that I want to register a protest.  As a result of unexpected and ruthless changes of policy, particularly in relation to the years 1952 and 1957, moneys must now be made available through the medium of this House to meet eventualities directly attributable to that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The civil <Col N="108" /> servants were awarded a 10/- per week increase.  The national teachers got an increase of 6 per cent.  Might I suggest to the Minister that, when he is considering the financial situation in relation to these groups, he should consider the general application of a 6 per cent. increase, thereby avoiding a perfectly justifiable demand for a seventh-round wage increase?</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey with what I can only describe as the characteristic hardihood of members of the Fianna Fáil Party told us that the people were 50 times better off to-day than they were in the winter of 1956-57.  He did not substantiate his claim in any detail. I do not think his statement can be described as anything other than an attempt at political barracking.  I agree with him in his reference to the necessity of helping Civil Service pensioners. He was ruled out of order on that.  I hope on another occasion to join with him when he makes the suggestion again that the Minister should keep these people in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister where the savings to which he referred come from.  As a result of budgetary provisions on the part of the Government, we find it necessary now to help certain classes in the community. This Vote of approximately £1,000,000 will be distributed all over the country to civil servants, members of the Defence Forces and teachers&mdash; primary, secondary and vocational. Every citizen, directly or indirectly, will be making his or her contribution towards this sum.  I do not really understand the selective nature of this provision.  I do not understand why small farmers should be omitted.  Some of these small farmers have to supplement their agricultural earnings by migration or by fishing.  It will come as little consolation to people in certain parts of my constituency to know that the local social welfare officer is getting an increase of 10/- a week and that it is possibly because of that increase of 10/- per week that, with full Government approval, he will ruthlessly pursue to the very limit his examination into the means of small farmers, fishermen and others in <Col N="109" /> receipt of social welfare benefits generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, in common with other Deputies, to draw attention to the effects of the policy which has made it necessary to introduce this Supplementary Estimate. When the Government reduced the food subsidies in 1957, it was argued that, in principle, subsidies were bad and that a good case could be made for charging the economic price for the commodities affected.  At that time, some small increases were provided for the weaker sections of the community. One shilling a week, I think, was given to the old age pensioners, widows and orphans and other social welfare recipients.  Now that the full effect of the decision to withdraw the subsidies is being felt, it is right and proper that we should examine what has happened and see where we are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree that we should give justice and fair treatment to all sections of the community, but it seems to me, from this Estimate and from others which may follow, that those sections of the community who are organised or able to protect themselves are those which come best out of the decision to reduce the food subsidies.  Civil servants, other State employees, organised workers, members of trade unions, all have received or will receive an increase in wages or salaries as a result of this Supplementary Estimate.  When the cost of food and other commodities increased as a result of the Budget of 1957, the organised workers, in consultation with the Federation of Employers or through other means of negotiation, agreed on a formula of <Col N="110" /> 10/- a week and so far as their interests were concerned, their position was safeguarded as a result of that agreement.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate more or less applies that formula, with, probably, certain variations, to State employees, to members of the Civil Service, the Defence Forces, teachers, the Garda Síochána and so on, but what I want to ask the Minister about is the serious position in which the weaker sections of the community find themselves.  It is not sufficient to say that we can ask the country and the House to provide a sum of almost £1,000,000 for a limited section of the community without taking into account the greatly worsened circumstances of the other sections that have been mentioned here, such as old age pensioners, widows and orphans, and leaving these aside, retired persons or those on fixed incomes, persons employed by local authorities or others on small pensions or dependent for their livelihood on fixed incomes of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>I asked a question here on 16th December last and I got in reply the cost of certain items included in the Consumer Price Index between February, 1957, and November, 1958, which was the latest available date.  It shows a staggering picture which can be seen in column 2198 and subsequent columns of the Dáil Debates of 16th December, 1958, Volume 16, No. 171. Taking just a few items which, as a result of deliberate Government policy, were increased in price, I find that bread increased by 58 per cent., flour by 79 per cent. and butter by 15 per cent.  If you relate that to the 2 lb. loaf and 1 lb. of butter, it transpires that the 2 lb. loaf increased by 5½d. between those dates and butter increased by 7d. a lb. so that in the case of the old age pensioner who, in 1957, got an increase of 1/- a week, and those other social welfare recipients, leaving aside the whole category of other increases, these two items of food alone absorbed entirely if not exceeded, that increase of 1/- a week&mdash;and a 2 lb. loaf and 1 lb. of butter would not go very far even for an old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>Some time ago in reply to a question <Col N="111" /> in the House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce adverted to the fact that the drop in consumption of bread and flour was indicative of a rising standard of living and he quoted O.E.E.C. sources as an authority for that view, that the consumption of bread and flour had dropped not merely in this country but in other countries.  I have here an extract from the report of Ranks (Ireland) Limited, for the year ended 30th August last which was published on 23rd of this month.  Having pointed out that they had a trading loss of £2,018 for that year compared with a profit of £55,481 in the previous year, and that the ordinary dividend was reduced from 20 per cent. to 7½ per cent., the chairman pointed out in his review that the demand for flour and bread, which fell very steeply after the subsidies were lifted in May, 1957, never recovered and the full effects of this were felt during the whole of the year under review.  The chairman said that the drop in consumption is believed to be due to the fall in population in the areas where the company has always traded.</P>

In order to meet that increase the Government have introduced this Supplementary Estimate.  How much more serious is the condition of those people for whom up to the present nothing has been done at all, who have no Civil Service organisation to argue their case, who are not members of trade unions or who are members of small unions employed in small concerns, who have received no recompense except the recompense I mentioned of 1/- a week which was entirely absorbed by two items alone?</P>

      <P>It is strange that the &ldquo;50&rdquo; coincides with the increase in the price of bread, which is 58 per cent.  I have no desire to labour the point unduly, but what I have a duty to do, and what I believe the House has a responsibility to see, is to see that justice is evenly distributed.  Another section who were in a position to make their case and to secure increases, were transport workers.  They secured an increase and the company, in turn, unable to meet it from any other source, had to pass it on to the public and the public have had to pay more in bus fares and transport charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Included in that category are the local authorities, who have been obliged to pay more for food for local authority institutions and who, as a result, will have to raise more money from rates in order to meet that extra demand.  What I want to ascertain is why it was considered desirable or <Col N="113" /> necessary to reduce the food subsidies I have mentioned, and then in two days, according to this Supplementary Estimate and a sheaf of Supplementary Estimates which were introduced here to-day, to ask the House to raise a sum of over £3,000,000, to meet only a fraction of the commitments which will arise out of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  Indeed, it will cover a wide variety of interests far less needy than those who were so severely affected by the rise in the cost of living and, may I add, by the continued rise in the cost of living over the past two years.</P>

      <P>I came into this House as a result of the 1952 Budget and I think the people of North Mayo realised the necessity for the 1952 Budget.  For some time, I looked across and saw the members in the Opposition Benches.  They all belong to the legal profession and these are the Deputies who come in here and tell us that Fianna Fáil were responsible for putting this burden on the taxpayers. We had this question well aired in North Mayo in 1952 and the people in North Mayo were quite satisfied that there was no alternative left to the Fianna Fáil Government but to introduce that harsh Budget, or else they would have to put very heavy taxation on something else.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy from Belmullet had to resume his seat, since it was down there that the Taoiseach made his promise that the subsidies would not be cut and it was on that promise that the Deputy headed the poll and got his seat in this House.

      <P>This is wrongly described as the result of arbitration.  I should like to mention that there are six groups covered in this.  Three of the groups are an independent matter, as regards what is being given to them.  As a result of arbitration, the chairman of the Arbitration Board made a particular finding under which civil servants would get a 6 per cent. increase. As far as the others are concerned, this was not a result of arbitration. If my memory is correct in the matter, at one time, when the civil servants had put forward their right to arbitration, the Minister denied them that right and said that if they did go to arbitration and if they got an award in their favour, he would come into the House and ask the House to refuse to honour the award. I think I am right in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about this figure which is appropriate to the top three classes.  The civil servants did not get arbitration and the other two groups, the Army and the Gárdaí, are related to the Civil Service and had their moneys voted to them here, dependent upon what was offered to and accepted under duress by the Civil Service.  I suggest that the argument Deputy Lindsay put forward shows the correct way in which this should be considered, that is, the Minister should think again about the difference between the 10/-offered and accepted under duress and the 6 per cent. which was undoubtedly the lowest that the civil servants, the Army and the Gárdaí would have achieved, if this matter had gone in the ordinary way to arbitration.</P>
      <P>Arbitration was a wise solution for a lot of these difficulties and arbitration was established, first of all, in the days of the first inter-Party Government. It is now not being honoured correctly.  An effort was made previously not to honour arbitration awards, in this House, and even when they were, certain arrears were cut off. I am glad to see, however, that we have decided to give this measure of imperfect justice, as far as three of the groups of the six covered here are concerned.  The civil servants, the Guards and the members of the Army have not got what they were entitled to get and, if the Minister thinks the attitude which he has coerced them into taking is a sound one, he should let the matter go to arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be suggested by Deputy Calleary that that would be a bad thing because it would set in motion another series of demands by groups who are not covered by arbitration. It is good to have this brought home at this time.  Deputy Calleary holds, and thinks that it was right, to have the subsidies slashed to the end, but I remember when it was first stated by Deputy Kyne and his colleagues that they would use their industrial <Col N="117" /> strength to see wages were raised to meet the increased cost of living, caused by the cutting of the subsidies, a chorus came from the Government Benches saying it was a conspiracy, and that we were doing something deliberately to try to wreck what they termed the forward progress of the then new Government.  It was stated that it was something of a sabotaging of the national effort.  Apparently that view that any effort to readjust wages to meet the increased cost of living amounts to a conspiracy has now disappeared.</P>
    <P>We are voting something short of £1,000,000 to cover these increases for a limited period of the year.  So many calculations have to be made regarding the time that it is not easy to calculate what they would cost over a full year, but £1,250,000 is my calculation of the cost over a full year. In any event, that is the sum demanded and it is the consequences of the ill-advised step of cutting the subsidies in the way it was done in the 1957 Budget.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to refer to is this: to some degree these payments relate back&mdash;the Estimate is paying off arrears.  I remember the time when the inter-Party Government decided that there was an arrears payment to be met of something like this sum here, around about £1,000,000, and the chorus that came from the then Opposition, now the present Government, was that it would trigger off new demands for wage increases and, eventually, we were told that was what caused inflation, with the consequences that ensued in 1955. I hope that those things are still remembered and that the Minister will be able to assure us that there is some change in the political and economic system which will not trigger off an inflation at the present time.</P>
    <P>I suggest the matters referred to here with regard to the cost of living, particularly the impact of the reduction of the subsidies on the prices of bread and butter, are quite germane and appropriate to the discussion. The Tánaiste told us, when there was a discussion on the consumption of bread&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are told that less money spent on bread, flour and butter was a sign of a rising standard of living.  Ranks know better.  Ranks have claimed a loss of £2,000 compared with a profit of £55,000 the year previously.  They attribute this to the demand for flour and bread falling steeply after the subsidies were removed in 1957, and the sale of flour never recovered, and secondly, the decline in consumption is due to the decrease in population in certain areas.  I wonder if people are aware that out of every three persons born in the country now, one will die abroad?</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is introduced as a result of the 1957 Budget.  It has been, if you like to describe it so, the delayed action of that Budget.  It was pointed out in 1957, when the Budget was being debated, that it would be necessary for the civil servants and every class in the country to seek compensation for the rise in the cost of living.  The ordinary conditions of employment which apply to civil servants assure them that they are entitled to an increase as a result of that rise in the cost of living, but we have a situation where, in fact, they are not getting in full the compensation to which they are entitled, having regard to their conditions of employment.  However, I assume that arrangement has been made between the Minister for Finance and their own representatives.</P>
      <P>It is well known that a large number of civil servants are not satisfied with the manner in which their just claim to an increase has been met.  This is the second time that the public servants have had to request a Fianna Fáil Government for an increase in their remuneration, directly resulting from the Budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil. On the last occasion, the 1952 Budget put a similar load on the civil servants and the Government refused to honour their claim.  We remember that Fianna Fáil refused to pay the amount which the civil servants were entitled to.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir; we are being asked to approve of this Estimate. It is the logical outcome of Government budgetary policy which affected the cost of living of the people and the classes who are concerned in this Estimate.  We have a situation here where a number of civil servants, earning around £1,000 a year, will be entitled to an increase of about £1 a week to meet an increase in the cost of living resulting from the Budget of 1957.  We remember that 1/6 a week was given to old age pensioners and destitute classes to meet the same rise in the cost of living.  This Estimate is to offset increases in the price of bread, increases in the price of butter and increases in the price of flour and other essentials.  Surely the case is not made that the essentials normally consumed by civil servants cannot be consumed by the various distressed classes who get a total increase of only 1/6 a week to meet the same rise in prices?</P>

They are justly entitled to what they are getting and to more if it were given to them.</P>
      <P>We read in the newspapers a statement by a representative of the civil servants in the last day or two showing that the Government had not honoured in full the conditions of employment which existed between the Government and the civil servants, so far as the adjustment of salaries is concerned.</P>

The Minister for Finance and the Government should honour their contract with the civil servants and give them no more and no less than they are entitled to in this Estimate. They are giving them less than they are, in fact, entitled to.  So far as I am concerned, I am agreeable to the Estimate going through but, even at this stage, I would ask the Government not to ignore the fact that the persons <Col N="122" /> who are to benefit as a result of this Supplementary Estimate are not, in fact, getting what they are entitled to get.</P>

      <P>One or two Deputies in talking to this Estimate gave the impression that there was no trouble in getting money for this purpose, while it is very hard to get money for something else.  I can assure the Deputies that it is just as troublesome to get money for this purpose as to get it for any other purpose and the provision of £1,000,000 or £1,250,000 is sure to cause us trouble in any case.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, in talking about this Estimate, made some mistakes.  I am not surprised at that, of course, because I do not expect complete accuracy from Deputy O'Sullivan.  The item concerning the higher Civil Service, as it is called, has nothing to do with this award at all.  It is a hangover from the 1955 agreement, the agreement made by our predecessors in office, and it is giving the 5 per cent. which they all the time claimed they should have got at that time.  That case, of course, was made very much stronger when the arbitrable groups, as it were, got the last award because it meant that the arbitrable groups had got two awards, while those in the higher groups got nothing.  It was for that reason that the 1955 agreement was extended, as it were, to those in the higher groups.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, of course, naturally, having the Fine Gael mentality will always agree to give something to a big group like the civil servants.  Naturally, they will not object to their getting it.  Every Opposition speaker started off by saying that he agreed with the Estimate and that the money should be given, but proceeded to make some objection or another in another way.  It is grand to be all things to all men.  It is like the man trying to cross the water with the ass. When you try to please everybody, you please nobody, and Fine Gael should realise that when they count up their successes at the polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These classes are entitled to the award, of course.  Fine Gael are right in that.  But why should certain Fine Gael speakers, like Deputy McGilligan <Col N="123" /> and Deputy Rooney, try to create trouble?  Why should they, as it were, encourage the civil servants by suggesting to them that they have not got enough and should go for more? They are quoting from a statement made at some meeting or other.  I do not know whether it was right or wrong, whether there is any substance in it at all or not, but, if Deputies are to take their position in this House seriously and are to be responsible for the raising of taxation&mdash;and taxation is hard enough to raise&mdash;and for the expenditure of that taxation, they should not try to create trouble by pretending that they have read a statement, that it is right on the civil servants' side and wrong on the Government side and that the Government have not done enough.  At least, let us wait until we see what the position is before making statements of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Sullivan who talked about the big round of wage increases in 1957-58 when this Government came in.  I do not think there was ever a quieter two years than the past two years.  I do not know whether the Deputy was complaining that there were not more wages given or complaining that there were too much.  I am dealing only with the fact.  The fact is that when the Coalition Government came into office in 1955-56 there were many more rounds of wage increases during that time than there were in 1957-58 and if a demand for more wages means discontent and, as Fine Gael speakers tried to point out here to-day, if it means that the Government have made a muddle of things, causing a demand for increased wages, on that argument, the Coalition Government in 1955-56 certainly made a very much bigger muddle of things than we made in 1957-58.  Of course, it was possibly due to the fact that the Fine Gael Party in the 1954 election promised better times for everybody and when they came into office, the people generally demanded those better times and looked for increased remuneration, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Kyne who <Col N="124" /> made some complaint about women in the Civil Service being treated worse than men.  Of course, although it works out that way, it is not a case of men and women; it is a case of married men and unmarried men and women.  Women are in the unmarried group.  An unmarried man is treated the same as a woman and gets only 7/6, whereas a married man gets 10/-.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate, I said that it was about £1,250,000, but, on account of savings in various Departments, the amount I was asking for was something under £1,000,000.  I was asked where the savings came from.  Every Department has a saving or over-spends. Where it over-spends, we ask for a Supplementary Estimate in order to give them more money.  Where the Department has a saving, the saving is taken into account within the year and goes as a saving against the Budget.  I would not be able to say in any particular case what the items are, but there are items of savings in various Departments.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan has said, I did, as a matter of fact, say in the Financial Statement of 1957 that I was very anxious that there should be no demands for increased wages. The reason I said that at the time was that I felt it was necessary to try to put the country on its feet.  It is a very different question now because the country is on its feet and the Government are able to pay their way, able to pay their liabilities, and so on &mdash;a very different position from that which obtained in 1957.  For that reason, we are able to face those items of increased wages or increased salaries, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>It was assumed by every Fine Gael speaker that this demand was entirely due to the abolition of the food subsidies. In fact, every one of the staff organisations, whether it was the teachers, the civil servants or anybody else, made the claim on the increased cost of living between autumn, 1955, and autumn, 1958.  Remember these dates because in every one of their claims they were stated.  As a matter of fact, the cost of living in mid-August, 1955, was 128.  In mid-August, <Col N="125" /> 1958, it was 143.  But when Fianna Fáil came in&mdash;that is, in early 1957&mdash;the cost of living was actually at 135.  Therefore, whatever demand the Civil Service may have made over these three years, half the increased cost of living had arisen under the Coalition Government and the other half under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I would advise Fine Gael Deputies who took such delight in their speeches here to-day in pointing out that it was due entirely to the Fianna Fáil Government that these increases occurred, to read these speeches and say to themselves: &ldquo;We will be half responsible and Fianna Fáil were responsible for the other half,&rdquo; because that is the position according to the figures.  I am sure it would serve this country very much better if the speakers on the Opposition Benches would say: &ldquo;We are half responsible and you are half responsible.  We cannot help it.  Let us do something, the best we can, to meet our liabilities in other ways..&rdquo;  It would be very nice if one could get a Fine Gael Opposition to talk like that, but I have no great hope that we ever will.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Opposition Deputies, including Deputy Dillon, that the Coalition Government had agreed not to abolish the food subsidies. I do not want to go into that question now: I am not sure if it is strictly in order.  I would advise Deputies to read my winding-up speech on the 1957 Budget and weigh the evidence there and then make up their minds on whether or not the Coalition Government, if they had come back again in 1957, would have abolished the food subsidies.  There is no doubt that they would have done it.</P>
    <P>All this talk about Fianna Fáil abolishing the food subsidies and that the Coalition Government would not have done so, all this talk about Fianna Fáil being responsible for the increased cost of living, is simply not true.  We have wasted three hours to-day on such talk and, at the end, we find that Fine Gael were just as responsible for the situation as Fianna Fáil.  If they had said at the beginning: &ldquo;We are both equally responsible and we must pass this Estimate,&rdquo; we could have saved those three hours <Col N="126" /> and devoted them to discussing something else.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment on the Committee Stage and withdrew it in order to enable the Minister to give some consideration to the principles underlying it.  Its purpose was to have a ballot paper that would give some guidance and information to the voter in the difficult circumstances which <Col N="127" /> would confront that voter at the taking of the referendum poll.  Apparently the Minister decided not to do anything about it.  I do not suppose there is any use in my pressing the amendment.  The Minister does not even think it worth a single word of comment.</P>

      <P>In deference to the Deputy's wishes, I will say that, in so far as his wishes and the wishes of the Opposition on the Committee Stage of this Bill are concerned, it is not correct to say that I have done nothing or taken no cognisance of those wishes as expressed in the earlier amendment.  I feel I have gone practically the whole way towards meeting their wishes.  It is not in any sense of ignoring their expressed wishes that I come here now and do not subscribe to the idea as outlined in the amendments proposed on this stage by Deputy J.A. Costello.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.&mdash;(1)  Whenever the polling day at a constitutional referendum is also the day on which the poll at an election of a person to the office of President of Ireland or at a general election is taken, an authorisation under Section 3 of this Act, as well as operating to authorise the person to whom it is given to vote at the poll at the referendum at the polling station specified in the authorisation, shall also operate to authorise him to vote at the poll at the election at that polling station, and that polling station shall, for the purposes of (as may be appropriate) rule 7 of the rules contained in the First Schedule to the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, or <Col N="128" /> rule 16 of the rules contained in the Fifth Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1923, be deemed to be the polling station allotted to him.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 28 of the Referendum Act, 1942, as well as applying whenever the polling day at a constitutional referendum is also the polling day at a general election, shall also apply whenever the polling day at a constitutional referendum is also the day on which the poll at an election of a person to the office of President of Ireland is taken and, for that purpose, references in that section to a general election shall be construed as including references to an election of a person to that office.</P>
    <P>The law relating to Dáil elections provides that a person must vote at the polling station allotted to him in the polling scheme.  There is a provision, however, under which persons employed by a returning officer at a Dáil election who are prevented by the circumstances of their employment, that is, persons such as presiding officers and poll clerks, from voting at the polling station assigned to them may be authorised by the returning officer to vote at another specified polling station in the constituency.  There is no power to enable a similar authorisation to be granted in the case of a referendum or Presidential election.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill, however, proposes to grant these facilities to persons employed in connection with the referendum.  The first part of the amendment provides that an authorisation given by a local returning officer at a constitutional referendum under Section 3 of the Bill as well as operating to authorise the person to whom it is given to vote in the referendum at the polling station specified in the authorisation, will also operate to authorise him to vote at that station at a Presidential or general election the poll at which is held on the same day as the referendum.  The rules referred to in the first part of the amendment are those which provide that in the case of a Presidential election or a Dáil election a person shall vote at the <Col N="129" /> polling station allotted to him in the polling scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Referendum Act, 1942, includes provisions designed to secure uniformity in the case where the poll at a constitutional referendum and a general election are held on the same day.  The second part of the amendment extends the provisions to the case where the poll at a constitutional referendum is also the day on which the poll at a Presidential election is taken.  The provisions referred to deal with the employment of the same persons in the taking of both polls, the use of ballot boxes and the use of the same official mark for ballot papers.  There is also provision that the ballot papers at the two polls must be of different colours.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not provide that the poll at the referendum and the poll at a general election or a Presidential election shall be held on the same day.  It merely lays down the procedure to be followed in the event of two polls being held on the same day.  The Taoiseach referred to the possibility of the poll at the constitutional referendum and the Presidential election being taken on the same day.  He stated that circumstances could arise in which the two polls would fall to be taken about the same time and that in such circumstances the interests of public convenience and of economy would obviously be served best by holding the two polls on the same day.  The reference is Dáil Debates, Volume 172, No. 4, columns 441-442, 14th January, 1959.</P>

Is it not to be taken as a necessary inference, from the putting down of this amendment on the Report Stage, that the Government intend to have the two polls taken on the same day, namely, the referendum and the Presidential election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is now engaged in so much pretence and shadow boxing, because he knows perfectly well that it is intended to have the Presidential election and the referendum on the same day.  If he looks at his brief, he will see that he as much as said so when moving the amendment and I do not propose, by my vote, to facilitate the holding of the election for the Presidency of Ireland with this referendum.</P>
      <P>We have been told by the Taoiseach how important is this question of the Third Amendment of the Constitution. We have been told that it is supposed to be above politics that it will bring about a remarkable change in the country, both economically and socially.  We are told it will be the cure-all for all our ills.  If it is so important&mdash;as indeed the Presidency of Ireland is&mdash;I do not think there should be any confusion about the two of them.  I do not think that, on the one hand, people should be asked to vote either for Deputy Seán MacEoin or Deputy Eamon de Valera for the presidency, and in the same election, to vote on the three issues which will be contained in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Opposition were abused in regard to the vote on the Constitution in 1937.  If there was confusion on that occasion, if there was a certain direction given to voters, nobody was to blame for that confusion, and the directions which were given by politicians on that occasion, but the Government then in office, the Fianna Fáil Government.  Whilst I was not in politics in 1937, I think it was wrong to confuse the Presidency of Ireland with the political issues which there <Col N="131" /> were in the general election and it was difficult for any politician or any candidate on the one hand to say: &ldquo;Vote for the candidate of Fine Gael, or Fianna Fáil, or Labour&rdquo; and then attempt to give another direction as far as the Constitution was concerned, the Constitution sponsored by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>We must have the Presidential election in, I think, the first or second week of June of this year.  As far as the Presidency is concerned, I have my own view about that.  We had&mdash;let us call them&mdash;politicians, or men actively engaged in politics, as contestants in the last Presidential election and it looks as if we are to have men who have been politicians all their lives, and closely connected with politics, as candidates in this election.  The referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, in my opinion, need not be rushed and I wonder what is at the back of the Taoiseach's mind, or the Government's mind, in desiring the holding of this referendum so quickly, in view of the fact, first that they have such a large and comfortable majority, and secondly, that the next general election is not due until February or March, 1962.</P>
    <P>Do the Government intend to hold an election immediately after the referendum, or what is their view?  This referendum which is being rushed through, with what I describe as indecent haste, could be held in 12 months' time, in 18 months' time or in two years' time.  Why the two of them have to go together, we do not know, but we have our ideas.  As I said on another occasion, the Government, believing that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill has not such bright prospects, now want to put on this horse, called the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, what they consider to be the best jockey they have, the Taoiseach, Deputy Eamon de Valera.  Many people have a great regard for him, but I do not think his name should be used on the day of the referendum in order to try to force the referendum through, in order to try to colour it. The Presidency of Ireland is too important <Col N="132" /> a position to be thrown in with the referendum and I should say vice versa, that an amendment of the Constitution is not something that should be thrown into the arena in a fight that will be between politicians.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I oppose this amendment and I ask the Government, through the Minister for Local Government, to decide now that the Presidential election and the referendum will be held on different dates and on dates that will be widely separated.</P>

I am merely providing, and I am only concerned with providing, certain machinery, if they should fall on the same day.  Then certain machinery would be put into operation that would facilitate all concerned. That machinery would be first, that persons who would be employed as returning officers at stations other than the station in which their names appear on the voters' list would have the facility of voting on both issues and, secondly, that the presiding officers, polling clerks, polling stations, the official mark for the ballot papers and the ballot boxes and all that paraphernalia, should, in fact, be used for both purposes on the same day at the same place.  That is merely and solely the purpose of this amendment, and it has nothing to do with the fixing of the date for the taking of either of those polls that we are talking about now.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of discussion in this House is to see the business of the country transacted in the most efficient and harmonious way.  When, at this particular stage, we are asked to discuss amendments to the Referendum Bill that has been introduced for the purpose of dealing with the referendum that is to take <Col N="133" /> place in the immediate future, and is to take place at a time when a Presidential election is due, and when, in these circumstances, an amendment is brought in to provide that the election for the Presidency can take place on the same day and make the necessary arrangement for that, what are we to do?  What are we doing?  Are we before a blackboard dealing with some theoretical problem in higher mathematics or are we dealing with the practical affairs of the nation?  We must consider that the holding of an election for President and a referendum on the same day has all the undesirable features about it that Deputy Corish spoke about, particularly in circumstances in which the referendum to be held is intended to dislocate and wipe out all the natural, organically-grown political organisation and to attempt to burst up every piece of political development in the country, except two large Parties that will fight with one another as two massed Parties in opposition, taking us back to the old days of cockfighting.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that we are brought back to consideration of the cockpit by some speeches made on Government Benches.  That is one thing; but what I consider a greater enormity than even contemplating a thing like that happening, is that here we are considering an amendment to the Referendum Bill, providing that the Presidential election and the referendum may take place on the same day and that after that, within the next couple of months a referendum will take place and a Presidential election will take place, and the Dáil is not to be told whether both will be held on the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government says he is here purely in that capacity dealing with electoral machinery matters and he has nothing to say about all this.  We are reminded, and even chided at times, about the collective responsibility of the Government, but we in the Opposition remember what the Dáil is, and that it is the Parliament of the country and that it should be treated with respect.  We want to see that thought is streamlined as far as possible and we want to cut out confusion and <Col N="134" /> difficulty and ensure that we be as clear as possible as to what lies before us so that we shall be able to get confusion and disorder out of our minds in approaching whatever work has to be done.  The Minister for Local Government says that he is purely and simply Minister for Local Government and cannot go into those things.  Does he not realise that he makes us feel as if we were standing in front of a thimble-rigger at a fair and from the point of view of doing practical business we are trying to find out under which thimble is the vote on the referendum and under which is the vote for the President, or are they both under the one thimble. I suggest the Minister for Local Government is treating the Dáil in the same way as it was treated by the Minister for Agriculture when we were discussing the wheat levy, when the Minister sat there for a whole night with his mouth shut, giving no indication and no encouragement to Deputies to expect anything and then made his announcement outside the House a day or two later.</P>
    <P>What difficulty is there in the approach of carrying on the practical business of the country, either for the voters or for the organisers, for the referendum or the Presidential election and what difficulty is there from the technical point of view in understanding the matter in the Dáil to prevent the Minister for Local Government from telling us now whether the election for the President and the referendum on the Constitution Amendment Bill will take place on the same date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Without doubt, we shall have a Presidential election this year, because it is due.  Here we have an amendment to the Referendum Bill.  We know that a Presidential election must be held before next June, or at least about the beginning of that month; we also know that the Government have a majority to enable them to run their full term and on every opportunity the House has had, this Bill or the Bill abolishing P.R. has been before it.  I submit there is much more urgent legislation. The Road Traffic Bill is long overdue; an amended Intoxicating Liquor <Col N="135" /> Act is due.  When we were in office, motions were put down urging the Government to introduce such legislation but instead of doing that now we find the Government taking every spare moment in the House to discuss the Bill abolishing P.R. and there is a rush at the last moment to amend the Referendum Bill for the purpose of holding the referendum and the Presidential election on the same date.</P>
      <P>If the referendum is not to be held on the same day, why the urgency in regard to the Referendum Bill?  There is plenty of time to give the country an opportunity of studying the implications of abolishing P.R.  The people could be allowed to study it for the next year or two until some time before the Government go out of office and then we might have the amendments to the Referendum Bill.  If we were to do that, we would be doing something good and we would not be throwing in the referendum and the Presidential election on the same day.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the reason for this is to enable the Government to hold the referendum and the Presidential election in the same year and to play what they consider the joker in this particular election.  I do not mean that in any way disrespectful to the Taoiseach; I mean it as the trump card.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that this is purely a machinery amendment, an amendment to change the system governing elections, so that in the event of a referendum taking <Col N="136" /> place on the same day as the Presidential election, it will be possible, without the inconvenience which would occur under the present system, to have these matters dealt with by the public on the same day.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister implied that we and possibly the members of his own Party, also, as elected representatives, must be lacking in intelligence and ability and lacking in all the qualities of evaluation when he naïvely suggested that the purpose of this amendment is to deal only with a problematical situation.  At the beginning of June this year, the Presidential election must take place and there is no difficulty about that under present electoral practice.  If a President is to be elected, at least the citizens should be afforded an opportunity of examining the merits and demerits of the candidates and deciding whether they wish to support a particular candidate or candidates.  The examination by the ordinary citizen should be as objective as possible. Candidates going before the electors for the position of President of Ireland should get the support of the people on the basis of their service to Ireland, of their ability to carry out the duties of the post, and so on.  Certainly, a situation should not be contrived in which the candidates would go before the people as protagonists or antagonists of a constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being less than fair in suggesting to this House&mdash;and in the light of collective responsibility, the Government are being less than fair in allowing the Minister to do so&mdash;that this amendment is meant to deal only with a situation which might arise, but might not arise for a long time.  If it is the intention of the Government&mdash;and it appears to be clearly their intention &mdash;by whatever means lies in their power to force a Presidential election and a constitutional amendment referendum to take place on the same day, they should at least have the honesty to send the Minister for Local Government in here to say: &ldquo;Yes, that is our intention.  That is what we propose to do.  We propose, if we can, to hold this election on the same day as the referendum so that the personality and <Col N="137" /> the record of the Taoiseach, standing as a candidate for the Presidency can be utilised to try to draw support for the constitutional amendment.&rdquo;  The Minister merely says here: &ldquo;I do not know what the intentions are.&rdquo;  There is no indication as to whether that is the intention or not, but I want to ask this House to make provision that if, accidentally, the situation develops, the machinery of election will be telescoped and it will be made easier, particularly for the people organising the election, to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself must know that the election of the President and a referendum on a change in the Constitution cannot occur, at least during the term of office of the present Government, unless the Government determine it shall occur on that date.  There would be nothing accidental about it. As far as the Presidential election is concerned, that is fixed, but as far as the proposed referendum is concerned, it has not been fixed.  The only body that can fix it is the Government, and it is a little naïve on the part of the Minister to say here that if, by accident, a referendum should take place coincidental with a Presidential election, it would be very nice if provision were made for the machinery to make it possible.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make any argument as to whether the referendum should take place in July or August of this year, next year or the year after.  I would be wastting my words because the Government are determined to have a referendum and seeing they have such a large majority in this House, they must eventually get their way.  However, let them, through the Minister for Local Government, tell this House what their intentions are and whether it is their intention to use the Taoiseach as a stalking-horse for a change in the electoral system.  It would be no credit to any Presidential candidate who went to the Phoenix Park after a Presidential election in which the candidates were strong protagonists on one side or the other of a constitutional change.  If we are expected by the Government or by this House to have any lingering regard for the <Col N="138" /> office of President, we should at least make an effort to take the election of President away from the political campaign which must take place in connection with the proposed change in our electoral system.</P>
    <P>Many people feel there is considerable waste in having the expense of the Presidential office and a growing number of people express in the streets of the cities and country towns criticism of the Article in the Constitution which provides for the office of President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, I want to draw the attention of the House to what I have already said in my statement on this amendment.  I want to repeat that in this amendment we are not trying to make obligatory the holding of these two elections on the same day.  The purpose is that if they should be held on the same day, certain things should follow.  I cannot and do not intend to follow the arguments which have been made here as to why they should not be held on the same day, or to advance reasons why they should be held on the same day.  That is rather outside the real scope of what this amendment is concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is being asked&mdash;<Col N="139" /> pressed, in fact&mdash;as to whether I will state that it is the intention to have both of these on the same day.  The question might be quite straightforward, but again I do not see why it should be tied to this amendment.  I shall repeat the position as outlined by the Taoiseach in answer to a question in the House some time ago about this matter.  The Taoiseach referred to the possibility of the polling in the constitutional referendum and the Presidential election being taken on the same day.  He then stated&mdash;and this is some weeks ago&mdash;that circumstances could arise in which the two polls would fall to be taken about the same time and that in such circumstances the interests of public convenience and of economy would obviously be best served by holding the two polls on the same day.</P>
    <P>One of the matters confronting me as Minister for Local Government in regard to this is that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill has not yet become law.  But assuming that it did become law at the next meeting of the Seanad and that there were none of these difficulties in regard to this Bill we are discussing here to-night and that we were to go ahead and hold the referendum as quickly as possible after the passing of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas, it would not be possible&mdash;and again I am talking about the mechanics of the operation of taking a referendum&mdash;to have that referendum taken earlier than the first week in April.  There is a significance about the month of April as far as elections are concerned because the new voters list comes into operation on the 15th of that month each year. Assuming that we were in a position to have the referendum as quickly as possible, I assert, from the point of view of the mechanics of holding it, that it would not be possible to have it before the first week in April.  Then we find ourselves within a week of the coming into operation of the new voters list; and I do not think that anybody would seriously suggest that we should hold either a referendum or an election so close to the introduction <Col N="140" /> of the new voters list without waiting for it.</P>
    <P>When that new list comes into operation on the 15th, I understand it would not be possible to have the referendum the day after.  In fact, my information is that it takes a considerable length of time&mdash;again because of the mechanics of the taking of any vote&mdash;to get out the new lists and make voters' cards available and so on.  So it would be a few weeks after the 15th before it would be possible to take a poll on the new register. That would be getting us on towards the end of May.  The Presidential election must be held between the 25th April and the 24th June, but for various reasons, in order to facilitate the incoming President and so on, it is usually held around the middle of June or somewhat earlier.</P>
    <P>If we now find ourselves in the position&mdash;as we will find ourselves no matter how this is dealt with&mdash;that the earliest we could possibly have this referendum and bring in new voters would be towards the end of May, are not those facts possibly bringing about the circumstances referred to by the Taoiseach some weeks ago: that, for the sake of economy and in the interests of the public, when these two polls fell to be taken at nearly the same time, they would be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish with this point.  It has been suggested there is no real reason why this referendum should be taken now, or why it should be taken in a manner the Opposition regard as hurriedly.  I dispute the word &ldquo;hurriedly&rdquo;.  It is suggested it could be left for six months, a year or a couple of years, for the reason, as was stated by Deputy Corish, I think, that Fianna Fáil as the Government enjoy a substantial majority at the moment and that no general election would be due normally for a number of years.  Undoubtedly, both of these statements are correct; but here is the other side of the picture&mdash;the reasons why I see this referendum being taken not six months from now or two years <Col N="141" /> from now.  The first point is that under our present Constitution a revision of the constituencies is obligatory in November of this year.  If there is no change in the constitutional law in this matter, that will have to be done.  We would be carrying out this revision, with all the discussion and time it entails, and a short time afterwards, it would be completely nullified if a referendum changing the whole system were taken and passed.</P>
      <P>I might point out that it would not be possible, assuming the people accepted the proposals in the referendum and leaving out the question of the revision of the constituencies obligatory under our law, to have an election based on the single member constituencies shortly after the referendum. Such an election will take a considerable time, not so much in the revision of the boundaries, which will be to a large degree, I should imagine, natural or existing boundaries for one purpose or another, but because it will create quite a problem in the revision and breaking up of registers by the returning officers in the different constituencies as we now know them.  It would not be possible to let this drift up until almost the eve of the departure of the Government from office or to hold it as a referendum, assuming they had to go to the country six months or 12 months after the coming of the new system.  Would it not be rather ridiculous if we had this referendum passed six or eight months before the next general election, the people having agreed to the change and, yet, because of the impossibility of implementing the various changes necessary, we would have to hold that general election on the old basis instead of on the new basis?  These are the general considerations that I see confronting me as Minister for Local Government.</P>

Is it not a fact <Col N="142" /> that, when the Taoiseach first announced to the House that it was proposed to amend the Constitution, he said he did not wish to have the issue clouded in any way and it would be his desire that there should be nothing else before the people.  He then discovered that the Opposition intended to nominate Deputy MacEoin for the Presidency and he countered immediately by withdrawing his original statement: he said it might be in the interests of the public to have the two on the one day, irrespective of whether or not he thereby clouds the issue in relation to the amendment to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given a good and valid reason why he, as Minister for Local Government, should try to rush this Bill.  He says a revision of constituencies is due in November next.  If he introduces a Bill here and leaves the Second Reading over, he will comply with the law. Now he cannot have the Bill passed in November.  The Seanad might hold it up for three months.  If he introduces a Bill&mdash;this is my recollection of the law&mdash;and leaves the Second Reading over until such time as the referendum has been held, and if the answer to the referendum is in the affirmative, he can then withdraw his Bill and revise the constituencies.  That is my reading of the law and that cuts across the argument put forward by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of mechanics, I can see his argument, but it will suffice if he merely introduces a Bill.  Why then this rush?  Why this anxiety to cloud an issue which the Taoiseach declared he did not want to cloud?  I cannot understand the position. Next year local elections are due. <Col N="143" /> Why could we not hold the local elections and the referendum on the one day?  I would not approve of that, but it could be done.  Why must we drag in these important issues, the Presidency of Ireland and the referendum, on the one day?  Both candidates will have their supporters and those supporters will have to vote, first for the President and then for the amendment of the Constitution.  If there were nothing to cloud the issue, they would not drag personalities into the issue; but if the retention of P.R. is tacked on to the tailcoat of the Taoiseach or Deputy MacEoin, the issue will certainly be clouded, so far as the public are concerned. I do not think the Minister should press this amendment.  He should do what the Taoiseach originally intended to do&mdash;keep the one issue before the public on the day the referendum goes to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly drove home his point with regard to the difficulty of holding the referendum in March, April or May.  He said practically everything, except that, in his opinion, the two should be on the one day.  He seemed to stress the difficulties in having the referendum quickly.  He talked about the register of voters and the time taken by the Seanad to pass a Bill, and so forth. All I ask him to do is to take his time. This referendum could well be held in 12, 18 or 24 months' time.  Even if he were concerned about the revision of constituencies, I do not think people would object to the holding of the referendum next August, September or October.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that there were two general elections in the year 1927&mdash;one in June and one in September.  I assume it was in the public interest to have those two elections in that year.  I am sure the Government at the time considered it in the public interest to have a general election in 1932, and another in 1933, one in 1937 and one in 1938, one in 1943 and one in 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question, either the Minister or the Taoiseach said that the holding of the referendum would cost in the neighbourhood <Col N="144" /> of £80,000; £80,000 has been spent in more foolish ways than it would be spent in holding the referendum and the Presidential election on separate days.  The Minister said it would be in the interests of officials to have the two on the same day.  He said it would also be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I am thinking about the public interest and the national interest.  I want to see a President emerge from this election who will have not only the confidence of the people but also the respect of the people.  I do not want to see a President emerging from a political battle, namely, the referendum. The present President first took office with approximately 50 per cent. of the people anti-Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, because he was Fianna Fáil and was mixed up in what was regarded as a political dog-fight.  We all know that his Excellency has been extraordinarily successful as President and has won the respect of all the people.  It is possible he did not have it for the first three months, the first 12 months, or the first three years, because he had been actively connected with the Fianna Fáil Party.  No disrespect to the Fianna Fáil Party, but they were opposed in the particular election by others&mdash;by Fine Gael, the Farmers' Party, the Labour Party and some Independents.  Out of all that, his Excellency emerged as President.</P>
    <P>After that particular example in 1945, when he was first elected, I thought that every subsequent Presidential election would be held completely on its own.  I had the notion that no active politician would become a candidate for the Presidency of Ireland because he would be associated for a long time with political Parties, and with the political dog-fighting of politics as we know them in this country. However, whether it is Deputy MacEoin or the Taoiseach who emerges as President but not in the political dog-fight that we will have with regard to this referendum&mdash;he will have more respect from more people more quickly if he is not elected either on the day of a general election or on the day of a referendum.  That is my interest in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> I have no quarrel with the Minister for Local Government on this amendment, except that he is aiding, abetting and facilitating the holding of the referendum and the Presidential election on the one day.  Not only do I think that is not in the public interest but I believe it is not in the national interest.  I do not think any other country in the world would hold an election for the Presidency on the same day as the voting on a political issue like a referendum, or as happened here in 1937, on the day of a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that has developed from this discussion is that we have drawn from the Minister for Local Government something approaching a declaration as to the intention of the amendment.  He was rather too naïve in introducing it when he said that he was more or less guarding against an eventuality.  He wants to make good in this Bill an omission of his predecessor in the original Referendum Act.  This is not the only occasion on which this measure has had to be amended in recent months.  That is an extraordinary thing.  I am sure that the Cabinet at that time gave grave consideration to that measure.  The Minister who launched it was an experienced man but now, without having any experience of a referendum under the Referendum Act, we have this succession of amendments and changes, and examining it in the light of what the people are being required to do in relation to the referendum, if so many amendments have to be introduced in relation to the holding of a referendum, a simple administrative action, surely we are entitled to question the copper-fastening of many far more important and fundamental matters in the very amendment of the Constitution itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel the Minister had his tongue in his cheek earlier on in the discussion, but the last time he spoke, from the arguments he advanced, it is quite clear that at least in his own mind, although he will not say it, it is practically certain that the two elections will be held on the one day.  He represents the Government in the House on this <Col N="146" /> amendment.  He is a senior member of the Government and he must be speaking with collective responsibility. There was a time when we heard all kinds of gibes from the Party opposite about the lack of collective responsibility in the inter-Party Government. The Minister is a member of a Government with a big majority from which we can surely expect collective responsibility.  Nobody in this House is so innocent as to think that this is merely a haphazard closing of a loophole in this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that everybody agrees&mdash;and the Minister might as well say it&mdash;that the Government have decided, for political reasons, to hold both the elections on the one day. In the hearing of members of this House, the Taoiseach said on two occasions that they would not be held on the one day, but circumstances changed that.  When the Government found that they were meeting with rough weather, something had to be done and so we have this sacrifice in an effort to deal with the situation, but it is a dastardly thing to cloud such a vital and important matter as an amendment of the Constitution with the issue of the personalities of the candidates for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The fact that an amendment of the Constitution should be kept apart from all other issues was recognised in the Constitution of 1937 which protected itself by requiring that a referendum relating to an amendment of the Constitution, should contain no matter other than the positive issue. The Government must not only observe that in the letter but they must observe it in the spirit, but they are not observing it in the spirit when they join a Presidential election, with all the discussions and controversy that will ensue, with what should be a clear and undisturbed examination of a matter which is vital to the future of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to considerable pains to explain why the referendum could not be held before June.  He could have saved his breath.  It is readily understood by everyone, but he was not on such sound ground when he went on to make the case for <Col N="147" /> the holding of the referendum as soon as could be after 1st of June.  After all in the case made by the Government it has taken 40 years to disclose the weaknesses they claim were in the system adopted by Arthur Griffith, enshrined in the 1922 Constitution and confirmed and enshrined even more effectively in the 1937 Constitution. With the passage of all that time and considering that it has been thrown open to the public for discussion and examination only within the past few months, we say to the Government and to the Minister that they have quite a lot of explaining to do to make clear what they regard as the urgency of this referendum.</P>
    <P>All the lengthy discussions in both Houses of the Oireachtas during the examination of P.R. and the straight vote system and all that they involve and all the discussions by groups far removed from politics show a healthy development.  However, these discussions are only getting under way and the young people who are examining this problem, are people who will have no opportunity of registering their vote in the ballot boxes.  Why the Government do not permit the boys and girls of 19 and 20 years of age to use their vote, when they come of age and are on the register, to determine what is as important to their future as it is to the future of those over 21 is something that the Government cannot explain.</P>
    <P>There is not the urgency the Government would like the people to believe there is for pushing through this referendum.  We accept their reasons why it cannot be held a week or a fortnight before the Presidential election must be held but if they persist in their present intention&mdash;and they should make clear what their intention is&mdash;it means, and all the indications are, that this amendment is introduced this evening because the Government have decided to hold both elections on the one day.  They should re-examine it and they should give some time for the people to examine it dispassionately, to weigh all the pros and cons of what they are asked to do in relation to the referendum, <Col N="148" /> and the more time they allow for it, the more satisfied the people will be with the outcome.  If they persist in what they are doing, in denying any detailed examination of the issues by their insistence on the urgency of the matter, then whatever the outcome, people will be less satisfied with the result because there will be people who will feel that more time should have been given for a fuller examination of the consequences and of all that is involved.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as Deputy Larkin has said and as the people throughout the country are saying, that if the Government persist in their endeavour to cloud what was becoming for them a difficult thing to get across, the desirability of a change in the electoral system, if they persist in clouding that with all that would be involved in the personalities of the candidates for the Presidency, they will be doing a very bad day's work.  It is indicative of their approach to the whole thing that here, in the enactment of this simple amendment, the responsible Minister is not permitted to come into the House and say candidly: &ldquo;This is what we intend to do and this is the reason we are asking the Dáil to accept this amendment.&rdquo; It is in the light of that that we criticise them for their lack of candour. We criticise them on the bigger issue for the fact that they are still insisting that this amendment of the Constitution is so urgent.  We insist that the Government think and think again and permit a more detailed and closer examination of all that is involved, so that when it comes to a result the people of the country will certainly be more satisfied with the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister that we are committed now to the dual election, the Presidency and the referendum, being held on the same day.  He has made a very tacitly convincing case and he is clearly critical of certain facts and dates, precedents from which he cannot escape. There is no doubt in my mind that when the Taoiseach said it was most undesirable to have these two elections on the same day, he reflected the feelings of most of us.  It is clear that the whole problem will be bedevilled and <Col N="149" /> the question of a cold and abstract consideration, as to whether the Constitution should or should not be amended, will be confused with feelings of personal loyalty or dislike, of sympathy or emotion, factors which should not be taken into consideration at all in the whole question of the decision to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in reply to a question asked of him when the Minister was speaking a few minutes ago, mentioned the question of expense.  Of course, it has to be taken in the context of the questions involved.  If the question of the referendum is confused in the people's mind, as it certainly will be confused, with the Presidential election, and if they take an unwise decision, then clearly there is no money which could reasonably be spent which would compensate the country or the people for that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main case made for changing the Constitution is that it is an attempt to ensure stability.  That is one of the reasons why I oppose it.  Stability in this respect means the stability of stagnation, the unchanging stagnation in the state of the country.  The Taoiseach, as one of his parting acts, wants to ensure that that stagnation will remain after he goes; and it is obviously one of the reasons most of us have had to oppose this amendment.  It means stagnation in the present conditions of emigration and unemployment, social services and so on.  That is the stability which I say is stagnation.  Consequently, if the people are confused, in the dual issue of the Presidency and the referendum, because of emotional factors brought in by the appearance in the field of two old protagonists in the old days, two one-time soldiers who will have behind them those emotions which make people think with their hearts instead of with their heads, the people may take decisions which will have effects reaching far beyond this generation, the men fighting the Presidency and our own children.  Consequently, I do not accept the suggestion by the Taoiseach that expenditure in the terms mentioned is a valid justification for holding the two elections on the one day.  The issue is very much too important and I am quite certain <Col N="150" /> that the people will be prepared to see it in that way.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we have been asked to change from P.R.&mdash;one of the rather offensive reasons&mdash;is that it was too complicated for the people, that they did not understand P.R. properly. These same people who cannot understand P.R., according to Government speakers, are being asked now to take these two issues together&mdash;one complicated by emotion and sentiment and the other complicated by its own special problem, the referendum to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In this House and in the Seanad, we have discussed this matter at considerable length and have dealt with the very complex and obstruse points, both for and against.  It is in itself a very complicated question, indeed.  That complicated question is to be taken in all its complications, and it is to be inextricably interwoven into a confused, emotional background, the battle to be fought out between two men who took opposite sides in the civil war, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think it is very wrong indeed for the Taoiseach to have misused our democratic institutions in this way. Probably there was never a time in the history of Europe, and never in the history of this country, when our democratic institutions, this Dáil and Seanad, were at a lower estimation in the public mind or the mind of the man in the street.  That is largely because they cannot understand why they form a deliberative Assembly of this kind, send their nominees here in order to run the country in an equitable, just and efficient way and then, over 35 to 40 years, we have created a totally decadent and nearly bankrupt society.  They feel that this Parliament does not work and that deliberative Assemblies are some kind of complicated fraud which they do not understand.</P>
    <P>I believe that the decision to hold this dual election on the one day is one of the most deliberate, well thought out, premeditated frauds or tricks carried out by the Taoiseach on the people in the whole of the past 40 years.  I say that for this reason.  The <Col N="151" /> Minister who spoke here a moment ago made his case in a very convincing way.  He instanced the reforming of the constituencies.  That raises our legitimate right to debate this in full. He is the prisoner of the date of the Presidential election and the other factors he mentioned all hem him in. In creating the position here, we must, as far as I can see, take these two separate questions at the one time, but surely these factors were all predictable factors?  They were all facts well known to the Government, well known to the Taoiseach when this whole very serious question of amending the Constitution was first mooted in the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has reassured us, on many occasions, that this question of a referendum to amend the Constitution and get rid of P.R. has exercised his mind over a number of years.  It did not just occur to him at a Press conference a few months ago.  He has assured us that it has been in his mind for a very long time and he must have well known, when he decided to hold the referendum, that there were certain facts which were there for all of us to know.  He knew of the ending of the Presidential term of office, and the necessity for holding a Presidential election.  He knew of all the factors mentioned here by the Minister, including the re-drawing of the constituencies, and he must have anticipated that there would be&mdash;if we were doing the job in Opposition that we should be doing, and I make no apology because I made very few contributions to the debate&mdash;a long and prolonged debate in the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>Consequently, that is what the Minister is now doing in his bland assured way, sheltering behind the protection of these facts.  These inexorable facts were there when the Government first took office some two years ago.  These predictable facts and factors and assumptions were all there, readily available to the Government and, if they wished to avoid the impasse in which the Minister now finds himself, they were sufficiently long in office and experienced in <Col N="152" /> politics&mdash;particularly the Taoiseach&mdash; to know that this position which the Minister is now trying to wash his hands of, was inevitable in the circumstances of the Taoiseach's late declaration to decide to amend the Constitution and go forward for the Presidency at practically one and the same time.  So, I say that our democratic institutions have, or are to be, misused, exploited, and abused again by one man, the Taoiseach, on this occasion please God, for the last time. This is his last time.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that we might have confined ourselves exclusively to what Deputy Dr. Browne referred to as the inescapable facts. Instead of that, he has insisted on wandering through possible motives which may, or may not, have influenced certain people and he has ascribed, without any evidence whatever, the entire responsibility for this decision to hold the referendum and the Presidential election on the same date, to the Taoiseach personally.  I think that we all know this is rather typical of his approach, but it is not conducive to a dispassionate appraisal of the merits of the whole situation.</P>
      <P>I remember very distinctly, in the early stages of the debate on this legislation, that the Opposition accused us as a Government of intending to incur quite unnecessary expenditure by holding a referendum and a Presidential election on different dates, and thereby doubling the expenditure.  It was pointed out by several Opposition speakers that such a procedure was quite unnecessary and that, if a referendum were found to be necessary in the same year as a Presidential election, it would be obvious that the public interest would demand that both should take place on the same day. The argument on our side was that we wished to try to keep them as separate issues.  Now, as Deputy Dr. Browne has said, the Minister finds himself the prisoner of facts.  He described them as inevitable facts, but my view is that the facts as we now find them, were not inevitable at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was ample time given for a full discussion of the Referendum (Amendment) Bill, and also the Constitutional <Col N="153" /> Amendment Bill, and that time was more than taken up by the Opposition speakers who went on giving the same speeches, time after time, and yet adding nothing to anyone's knowledge of the facts which were to be put before the people.  I was able to keep awake for a long period of that debate only by trying to get ahead of the speaker who had the floor, and by finishing his sentences before him, just as a form of exercise.  I found I was always able to finish the sentence well ahead and could easily start the next sentence and finish that one, too, because I had heard it so often.  There was no question of any restriction of debate whatever.</P>
    <P>What did annoy me personally was that the debate went on interminably on the same lines, and nobody could say anything new.  If that debate had been conducted by the Opposition in what I would consider a proper, constitutional way, the debate would have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It appears that it could be very likely that the referendum and the Presidential election must take place at least within a matter of a few weeks of each other.  Only a few weeks could possibly separate them, no matter what happens, and when it comes to that, it is obviously quite inexcusable to hold them on separate dates and, consequently, the Minister is making provision in this amendment to hold them on the same day.  Let it be perfectly clear that that was never our idea and that it would not have been necessary at all, if the Opposition had dealt with the matter in a more statesmanlike way.  It never was justifiable to ascribe the motives Deputy Dr. Browne has ascribed for the holding of the two polls on the same day.  It has been asserted time and again that that was not our intention, but now we are forced into the position of having to do it or of its being likely that we shall have to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, I support the amendment because it is the only solution to a situation which need never have arisen, but which I believe was deliberately created by the Opposition.  If it was not deliberately created, it was created through crass <Col N="155" /> ignorance as to what the result would be.  For these reasons, I have no hesitation in supporting this amendment. I hope that it will be dealt with as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>The last speaker, obviously, has not read the amendment.  It has no relation whatever to the holding of the referendum poll on the same day as the poll for the Presidential election.  It is a comparatively minor detail that is covered by this amendment&mdash;a provision to allow the officials in a polling booth to vote at that polling booth instead of somewhere else.  That is all that is in the amendment.  Whether this amendment is passed or not has no relation whatever to whether the two polls will be held on the same day, but, when we find an insignificant or comparatively insignificant amendment of this kind being rushed on the Report Stage, referring to a case where possibly the referendum poll may be taken on the same day as the Presidential election, then we are entitled to ask are we to infer from that that it is the intention of the Government to hold these two polls on the same date and that is the query that we on this side of the House have raised.  I have no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Deputies and the Government were very restive at the lengthy debates that took place on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill because it had this effect&mdash; whether Deputy Booth went to sleep or not&mdash;that it wakened up the country and now there is an interest in the country that the Government were afraid would have been aroused. We are very proud to know that we at least contributed our part to the awakening of interest in the provisions proposed to be enshrined in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and to the danger inherent in it and that is the reason why, when they wanted to rush it originally, they accused us of preventing the people from expressing their view upon it and that is the reason why they did not want any debate upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to ask, because of this insignificant amendment being put <Col N="156" /> in here, which has no relation whatever to, or no importance at all in connection with, the holding of these two polls on the same day, when there is a reference to the holding of the two on the same day, is it the intention of the Government to have them on the same day?  That query has not been answered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has misled himself into acceptance of the Minister's statement as to being prisoners of the facts.  Of course the Minister or the Government are not prisoners of the facts at all.  Facts have nothing whatever to do with this matter.  No matter when the Presidential election must be held, whether by virtue of the various provisions of the statute law and otherwise and the Constitution, providing for the holding of the Presidential election within specific dates, that has no relation whatever to the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Under the Constitution, a referendum to change the Constitution is to be submitted to the people in accordance with the law for the time being in operation, that is, the law at the moment, that is, the Referendum Act, 1942, as amended by the Act of 1946, and whatever amendment is put into it by this Bill, if it becomes law. There is nothing in any of the statutes at present dealing with the referendum providing any date or dates within which the referendum must be given to the people.  I would recommend Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to read their law, or to get somebody to tell it to them, before they make statements such as those we have listened to to-night.  The Minister is not the prisoner of the facts of this matter at all.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is legtitimate for the Minister and the Government to say that it is convenient to have them on the same day.  I can understand that argument, if it were put forward as a legitimate argument&mdash;that it is convenient and, possibly, it would save expense.  If these were the real arguments, of course, I would listen to them, but we know perfectly well, and I am very glad to know now that the country knows perfectly well, that the real reasons these two elections will be <Col N="157" /> held on the same day have nothing whatever to do with convenience or with the saving of expense, that it is the last effort to try to save the Referendum Bill from defeat by throwing the personality of the Taoiseach into the arena at the last minute and to have the voters going in there voting, as they hope, for Mr. de Valera as President and then, because it is his last act, they are asked: &ldquo;Do not let the poor old man down; do not let him down now by voting against him on the Referendum Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what is at the back of this. In principle it is wrong.  I do not believe it will succeed.  I endeavour, so far as possible, to make no prophecies, having laid down the principle that there is no such thing as the foreseeable future, but I have no doubt that the purpose behind the holding of the two polls on the same day is to introduce the personality of the Taoiseach as what is believed to be, or thought would be, an influencing factor in connection with the holding of the poll for the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in principle; I do not think it will succeed; but it is an indication, certainly, to us of the fears of the Government, well-founded fears, that all is not going as well as they had thought with the referendum and that they are not going to have as big a walk-over as they thought they were going to have when they initiated the proposals to a startled public.</P>

Deputy Booth would almost lead one to believe that the lengthy debate on this measure stood between the Government and the enactment of a hefty programme.

      <P>Quite so.  In that respect, the Deputy seeks to advance a contrary viewpoint.  He expresses it as though, if it were up to himself, he would wish that this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill were examined apart from the Presidential <Col N="159" /> election.  In that, we concur, but he will have to state again, and with greater clarity if he wishes to put it across, that despite that being his desire, there is some more abiding necessity which overrides his preference for having the elections considered distinctly and on separate occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asks the Minister to think and think again on the matter.  A short time ago, the Minister gave us all the evidence necessary that they had been thinking, thinking, thinking, and that there was no aspect of the position they had not thought about.  He showed us that as far as this amendment is concerned, its operation could not be set in motion until some weeks after 15th April; that the readiness to proceed with the referendum would not be there until the end of May and the necessity to go ahead with the machinery for the Presidential election would be all there in the begining of June.  He practically said that, unless unexpected circumstances arose, it was the intention to have the referendum and the Presidential election on the one day.  Everything he said brought the discussion down to that point.  It is important that this House be told what is in the Government's mind in the matter.  What the Minister for the Gealtacht said with regard to the Bill in the Seanad has nothing at all to do with the argument in respect of dates, and so on, that the Minister for Local Government went through&mdash;and I would ask the Minister for Local Government to let his colleague know that.</P>
      <P>Why can we not be told here, in the light of the information the Minister for Local Government has put in front of us, that the Government have decided that unless some unexpected circumstances arise, the two will take place on the one day? It is important that the Minister should think on that matter! From the point of view of the dignity of this House and from the point of view of the dignity of the Minister's position in this House, it is important and desirable that he give us that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> In putting this matter before us, the Minister appears to be of the opinion that, unless unexpected circumstances arise, these two elections will take place on the same day.  Why is it necessary for the Minister to treat us as youngsters at a fair looking at the thimble-man and wondering under which thimble the pea lies?  The Government, through the Minister, are treating this House in a most insulting fashion.  What is it that prevents the Minister, in the light of the information he has given us before with regard to Presidential election dates and the possible referendum dates, from saying that, unless unexpected circumstances arise, it is the intention of the Government to have the two on the same day?</P>

      <P>As an addendum, is the Minister even prepared to say whether or not the Government have considered the question of holding the two elections on the same day? If they have considered that, is the Minister prepared to give the House the benefit of whatever conclusions the Government have arrived at?  It seems to me that it would be quite out of the question that, at the end of the month of February, when the Government are proposing to hold a referendum within a matter of months and when the Government must hold a Presidential election within a matter of months, some very urgent consideration should not have been given to this question, particularly having regard to the views expressed by the Taoiseach earlier.  I would ask the Minister to accept the invitation extended to him by Deputy Mulcahy to tell the House quite bluntly whether or not the Government have come to a decision on this question and what the decision is.</P>

      <P>Far from there being any suggestion that I have been unfair or misleading to the House, I feel that, in summing up the various conclusions presented to me, I have been more than fair in setting out things, as Minister for Local Government, in regard to the holding of these elections in the coming year.  In so far as inviting me on this amendment in Committee to state what is discussed at Government meetings is concerned, I <Col N="161" /> do not think that is quite the question that should be asked.</P>
      <P>Let me put it this way.  The circumstances surrounding the holding of these two polls&mdash;I have in mind now, in particular, the referendum&mdash;have been changing as time elapsed.  I am not going to the point of saying to the House that, because of the Opposition's tactics, these circumstances have come about that I have summed up to-night.  I am not saying that or accusing them of that.  I am not suggesting that they brought that about, or otherwise.  However, it has been a changing circumstance.  The timing of the whole thing has depended, and still depends, on the time this matter is completed in this House and in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>If I had been asked at the time this Bill was introduced, and I was disposed to give an answer, when this referendum poll would take place or if it would take place on the same day or in the same month as the Presidential election&mdash;if I had been asked back in November that same question and if I were to answer it truthfully and honestly at that time&mdash;I would have said that, in my opinion, it was most unlikely that they would clash or come so near together that circumstances would bring about a situation in which the two could be held conveniently together.</P>

      <P>While accepting that the Minister is trying to be as helpful and as clear as possible, and accepting that he is not able to see as clearly into the heart of things as Deputy Booth, I take it that I have to be content with the way he led up to the situation and with my own interpretation in regard to the unexpected circumstances arising that both are to take place together.  May I be a little helpful in clearing from the Government's mind any of the things which they think might be exceptional circumstances?  I think the sooner we are told the dates on which both the referendum and the Presidential election are to be held, the better it will be for the general political dignity of the country and of this House.  To help them to try to make up their minds, I would tell the Minister, and the Government, in relation to suggestions emanating from the Fianna Fáil Party that the Taoiseach should be allowed to go to the Park unopposed, that that would be quite unthinkable.  With the political experience which the people have, and with this proposal by which they are asked to discard their political freedom and liberties, then to contemplate the unopposed return of the author of this proposal to the position of <Col N="163" /> President is quite unthinkable and no more time need be wasted even on propagating an idea like that, or considering it.</P>
      <P>The Government should get ahead with this work, in so far as this work is work they consider important, and get ahead with it in the straightest possible way.  Evidently, they have made up their minds that they are going to have this referendum at the earliest possible moment.  They would have pushed it through in December or January, if they could have done so.  Having made up their minds that they are going to push it through, let them make a statement as early as possible as to whether or not the two events are to take place on the same day and let us get away from the loss of dignity of this House and of Ministers and of Government, because apparently they have made up their minds and they will not say what they have in mind.</P>

      <P>I just want to intervene for a few minutes and make what I hope will be my last contribution to this debate.  I do not want anybody outside the House to be left under any impression, from what has been said in this House, inadvertently or otherwise, that there is any connection in law, and the Constitution, between the holding of the referendum and the Presidential election.  There is no connection between them.  The Minister for Local Government is the Minister who appoints the date on which the poll for the referendum is to be taken and there cannot be any doubt whatever about that.  Equally, there is no doubt that there is no time in the Referendum Act of 1946, or any amendment to it, within which the Minister must make that Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the Act of 1942 provides that the Minister is to make the Order when the Bill for the amending of the Constitution is passed, or deemed to have been passed, by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister is then given power to provide, by Order, the date for the holding of the referendum. There is no time limit imposed on him in that, or any other statute, and therefore there is no connection whatever <Col N="164" /> between the holding of the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and the Presidential election. I want that to be clearly understood outside this House.  As I say, there might have been an argument based upon convenience or the saving of expense by the holding of the two together, but no such argument has been put forward because the Minister has declined to say whether or not the two are to be held together.</P>
    <P>We are not children in this matter and there is not one person in this House, or outside it, who does not believe, or is not firmly convinced, that both these polls are to be held on the same day and we must approach it on that basis.</P>

      <P>All that having been cleared out of the way, I want to make this last remark.  In the particular circumstances of these two proposals&mdash;the proposal to amend the Constitution and the proposal to appoint a President in this particular year&mdash;it is quite contrary to principle that they should be held on the same day.  Everybody knows that the one man behind the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is the Taoiseach, that he is the sole activating force behind it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is his personal enthusiasm&mdash;wrong-headed enthusiasm&mdash;that is at the back of all this.  We know that there is nobody outside this House who has any notion other than that it is the Taoiseach who is at the back of this. He is the man who brought this proposal forward, pressed it forward, and the man who, we are told, is to be a candidate in the Presidential election. It is quite wrong that he should endeavour so to influence a matter of <Col N="165" /> such vital import as an amendment of the Constitution by holding the election for President on the same day as the referendum on the change in the Constitution.  It is wrong in principle.  I believe it is a matter of expediency by the Fianna Fáil Party. It is a matter of expediency and they think they will get something out of it.  It is my view, and I repeat it, and I am sure there are others who hold the same view, that there is the clearest evidence that terror has stricken the hearts of Fianna Fáil as to what is to happen to the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and the Minister are treating this House in a rather contemptuous fashion by getting the Minister for Local Government to come here and express the point of view, in the course of the discussion on amendments to the referendum, that he does not know whether or not the Presidential election and the referendum will be held on the same day.  Have we not listened to the Taoiseach's statement that, irrespective of what will happen, the two elections will not be held on the same day?  The Taoiseach committed himself to that in no uncertain fashion.  Now, the Minister for Local Government says that circumstances have changed.</P>
      <P>What are the changed circumstances? In my opinion, it is quite easy to see what the change in circumstances is.  The change in circumstances is that many people, including some Fianna Fáil supporters, are not so happy about the abolition of P.R. as Fianna Fáil thought they would be last November.  As pointed out by Deputy O'Sullivan, the continued discussions in this House and in the local authorities have brought home to the people that it would be unwise to abolish P.R. and the Government Party and the Taoiseach, bearing that in mind, have now decided it would be rather dangerous for them to have the referendum on the abolition of P.R. and the Presidential election held on separate days, in case public opinion might be against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are taking advantage of the fact that the Taoiseach is a Presidential <Col N="166" /> candidate and they hope, by having the two decisions made on the one day, that they will be able to get the people who are doubtful about the advisability of abolishing P.R. to vote in favour of the abolition, seeing that they would be voting for the Taoiseach at the same time.  This wave of indignation against the Government's move in seeking to abolish P.R. is the main change in circumstances and not what was mentioned by the Minister.  They hope to retrieve the situation, but I have no doubt they will not be able to do so, by holding those two elections at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government have gone back on very definite statements they made: they have gone back also on public opinion, and now we have the Minister for Local Government coming along in the latter part of February, two or three months before the election, with the indefinite statement that he does not know whether or not the two elections will be held on the same day.  It is a most contemptuous way to treat the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government may be assured that we will meet them and beat them on both issues, if they decide to have it that way.  It is obvious that they have decided to use the Taoiseach as a pawn in the political game to carry the proposed electoral system which has aroused so much opposition in the public mind.  Fianna Fáil are well aware that there is generally great opposition to the proposed change in the electoral system.  Therefore, they have decided to bring in this clause, which is really only optional.  They are afraid to come out and tell the people: this is the plan.  They leave it as an optional arrangement whereby if a Presidential election and a referendum should take place on a certain day, the presiding officers under a certain section will be permitted to exercise their vote in respect of the Presidential election as well as in respect of the proposed change in the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair that the Minister should admit that it is planned to use the Taoiseach now as a candidate, in an effort to carry the new electoral system, but in spite of their best intentions, I feel they will be beaten on both <Col N="167" /> issues, even if they have the election and the referendum on the same day, as provided for here.</P>
    <P>The public should not be treated in this manner.  They are required to make a decision in respect of a very serious issue affecting the freedom of the individual in regard to his right to elect a representative to the Dáil.  It is now proposed to use a candidate in the Presidential election for the purpose of making a change in the electoral system which the people have operated for the past 40 years.  Surely that kind of trick&mdash;it can only be described as a trick&mdash;must be exposed and the public must be made aware that the purpose of this amendment is to carry a step further the plan to take from them the right they have at present to select and elect any candidate they wish for any policy of their own choice.</P>

    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX</P>
    <P>The following Summary of the principal proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, is circulated for the information of voters:</P>
    <P>At present, members of Dáil Éireann are elected on a system of P.R. for constituencies returning at least three members, each voter having a single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to abolish the system of P.R. and to adopt, instead, a system of single member constituencies, each voter having a single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill to set up a commission for the determination and revision of the constituencies, instead of having this done by the Oireachtas, as at present.</P>
    <P>If you APPROVE of the proposals in the Bill, place an X opposite the word YES on the Ballot Paper.</P>
    <P>If you DO NOT APPROVE of the proposals in the Bill, place an X opposite the word NO on the Ballot Paper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> A copy of the full text of the Bill can be inspected and purchased at all Post Offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the circulation to voters of a summary of the principal proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958; for the display of the summary as a notice at polling stations and for the reading of the summary by presiding officers at polling stations to incapacitated voters who fail to understand the import of the prescribed question: &ldquo;Do you approve of or do you object to that Bill becoming law?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement set out in the appendix of the amendment is the statement agreed to by the parties in the House and read out by the Minister in the Dáil on 27th January, 1959.  (Dáil Debates Volume 172, No. 8, columns 1110-1111).</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1946, provides for the issue to voters of polling cards giving the voter's number and polling station.  The summary will be included in these cards.</P>
    <P>The cards are required to be issued by local returning officers at such time that they will be delivered in the ordinary course of post not later than the third day before polling day.</P>
    <P>Normally, polling cards are not sent to postal voters.  At the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, the local returning officer will, however, be required to send the cards, including the summary of the principal proposals of the Bill, to postal voters at the same time as ballot papers are being sent to them. The polling cards for postal voters will not state the voter's number or polling station since voting in these cases will be by post.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (3) to (6) of Section 4 of the 1946 Act provide for the arrangements with the Post Office for the delivery of the polling cards (sub-section (3)), the expenses of the local returning officer in issuing the cards (sub-section (4)), that a referendum shall not be invalidated by reason of <Col N="171" /> the failure of the local returning officer to send a polling card to any elector or by reason of the non-delivery of a polling card or of any error or misstatement in a polling card, (sub-section (5)), and that no action or other proceeding shall lie against a local returning officer in respect of any error or misstatement in any polling card (sub-section (6)).</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) of the amendment deals with the questions which the presiding officer may ask an incapacitated voter who applies to have his ballot paper marked in the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958.  Under the provisions the presiding officer reads out to the voter the Short Title of the Bill and asks &ldquo;Do you approve of or do you object to that Bill becoming law?&rdquo;, marking the voter's ballot paper in accordance with his answer. If the voter fails to understand the import of the question the presiding officer is required to read out the summary of the Bill as set out in the Appendix of the amendment and ask &ldquo;Which do you wish to do&mdash;to vote in favour of the proposal?  or to vote against the proposal?&rdquo;, marking the voter's ballot paper in accordance with the answer.  A request made by a voter within four hours before the close of the poll to have his ballot paper marked for him may be refused by the presiding officer, if in his opinion, having regard to the number of voters coming in to vote, his acceding to such request would interfere with the proper discharge of his duties or would unduly obstruct the voting of other voters.  (Rule 18 (2) of First Schedule to Referendum Act, 1942.)</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the Second Schedule to the Bill is not being touched.  It will deal with constitutional referenda generally.</P>

      <P>I think it is rather inept that we should be turning into our statute law the statement that was approved by all Parties in the House as being an appropriate statement to be issued with the card sent by the returning officer to each voter.  The proposal in this amendment, <Col N="172" /> as I understand it, is to put into an appendix what was agreed to between the Parties in the House.  In other words, every time there is a referendum if that procedure is to be adopted in future, there must be an <i>ad hoc</i> agreement in the House and then a special Act of Parliament passed to give legal effect to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in this amendment and the appendix is really <i>ad hoc</i> in relation solely to this referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  That is what I was objecting to and that is what I said was inept.  In accordance with parliamentary procedure, all Parties in the House agreed that a certain form of statement should be approved of and issued.  Now it is intended to give that the force of law. Perhaps it is convenient, but at all events this is merely <i>ad hoc.</i>  In any future referendum, all the procedure must be gone through again.  There must be a Bill passed through this House and the Seanad and enacted. That seems to me to be the height of absurdity and ineptitude.  I cannot see the reason for it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the amendment in my name and which, on the Committee Stage of the Bill, I withdrew, in order to enable the Minister to consider it.  I was endeavouring to provide a statutory procedure by which something like what was achieved by agreement would be the statutory requirement for all future referenda.  What we did succeed in reaching agreement upon was a simple, concise statement containing a summary of the principal provisions of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  We succeeded in achieving that through the machinery of this House, through consultation and conference. I do not see why something like what I have put down in my amendment should not be made the general law of the country instead of leaving it to an <i>ad hoc</i> statute every time there is a referendum.  We make ourselves rather ridiculous by accepting the procedure suggested in the ministerial amendment here.  I would commend to the Minister the suggestion I <Col N="173" /> have made which, I may say, was a <i>bona fide</i> effort to try to meet the situation for all future referenda, and had no sinister meaning behind it.  If the Minister or his colleague thinks that because I put it down, there is something sinister in it, I should like to disabuse his mind of that notion.  This is only an effort on my part to try to deal with the situation in general, so that what was done by agreement would have the statutory ratification of being, as I called it, a statement in simple and concise language of the principal proposals of the Bill.  I think that would be a better procedure.  It would not hamper any future referenda that might be held and would be much more dignified and in accordance with the general procedure of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the things on which we differed fundamentally when we discussed this Bill originally, but subsequently it is one of the things on which we agreed.  We went a fair distance towards meeting each other on this, but Deputy Costello is perfectly right: while we have achieved what we set out to achieve in the first place, it is a fact that every time a referendum is held, there will have to be a special Act of Parliament to provide for the wording of the summary of the amendment of the Constitution on which people will be asked to vote.</P>
      <P>I would agree to a very large extent with the amendment in the name of Deputy Costello, but I think he ought to have gone a little further to provide for the type of thing we did in regard to the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution, that is, to include some words to the effect that the summary to be submitted to the electorate would be a summary in words to be agreed upon by the various Parties or members of the House.  The Minister cannot at this stage change it, but I would suggest that he ought to amend it in such a way as to leave in his own proposal in the form of amendment No. 3, but also to embody in the Bill amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Costello, with the change I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to what he described as an electoral regulation <Col N="174" /> whereby those people who could not vote and whom we usually describe as illiterates, may be refused information which the ordinary electors get in the summary, four hours before the closing of the poll.  That could be a hardship.  We have not so many illiterates at the present time as we had in years gone by, but virtually closing the polls to people who cannot read the summary, assumes, in effect, that illiterates do not work.  Four hours before the closing of the polls would be five o'clock.  I appreciate the difficulty there might be with illiterates at 8 o'clock or 8.30 at night when queues of people are there waiting to vote. It would be difficult for the returning officer to read out then the summary contained in the appendix.  The Minister ought to consider changing the regulations to provide that the reading of such a summary need not be made three hours before the closing of the polls or extend the closing of the polls to ten o'clock at night.</P>
    <P>In recent elections, the experience all of us have had is that there is a very low poll up to six or seven o'clock.  The bulk of the voters come between seven o'clock and nine o'clock.  I am sure anybody who works in a general election or has to man booths on election days knows how boring it can become between nine o'clock in the morning and about seven o'clock in the evening, apart from a short break for lunch.  The times are not at all suitable for the majority of voters.  For that reason, the Minister should try to ensure that the voting hours be changed from nine o'clock to ten o'clock, or from ten in the morning to ten at night, or better still, if there is no serious objection, to have the voting either on a Sunday or on a day that would be declared a public holiday.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are many hundreds, and even thousands, of people who during the whole of their lifetime have not had an opportunity of voting.  I have in mind particularly commercial travellers.  Elections are never held on Mondays and are rarely held on Fridays.  They are usually held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays.  As far as commercial <Col N="175" /> travellers are concerned, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are their busy days.  On such an important vote as the referendum, it is desirable that every citizen who possibly can should have an opportunity of voting.</P>
    <P>In that respect also, I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;maybe he has referred to it already&mdash;what people will be entitled to vote, what people will get these voting cards and what people will get this summary?  Will it be every single person included on the register?  Does it include the Garda Síochána, for instance?  I know it does include the Defence Forces.  I think the Minister ought to give consideration to some of those suggestions with the possibility that he may bring in such amendments or similar amendments when the Bill comes to be debated in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from this matter that the House is being asked to legislate now for a specific contingency. The reason for that is the fact that the Constitution as originally designed did not provide for a voting system which it is now proposed to ask the public to decide upon.  I am in favour of the suggestion that it is only fair to the country that this House should legislate in clear general terms within a recognised framework where the law or the regulation relating to it can be applied to various contingencies that may arise.  It is clear from this Bill that we are legislating only for the purpose of meeting the contingencies arising from the need here to have a decision on this referendum in regard to a voting system which is not provided for in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that arrangements are being made for postal voting. This matter of postal voting arises at nearly every general election.  It certainly should arise on a very important issue such as this.  The election takes place on a certain date.  As Deputy Corish has said, it is often found that people who have business outside their own constituency or away from their own polling districts, for one reason or another, cannot possibly exercise their vote.  They get the <Col N="176" /> opportunity of voting only on that particular day, and they are deprived of that opportunity because of the necessity of being away from the polling district on that day.  I am referring to such people as commercial travellers and people who might be on business outside the country.  Then there are the emigrants who have left the country to seek employment, but who have every intention of returning to the country as soon as possible.  Those people have no opportunity of exercising the votes to which they are entitled. In certain circumstances, the postal vote should be extended to cover these people.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to suggest that for trivial reasons people should be given the opportunity of exercising a postal vote, but this problem arises at every election where it is necessary for people to be away from their polling districts.  It would be helpful, even at this time, if the Minister or his draftsmen could consider seriously a set of circumstances in which any particular citizen would be entitled to exercise his vote.  For instance, take the person who is taken ill and finds himself in hospital on the day of the vote. Next day or the day afterwards, he is out again.  He has no opportunity of exercising his vote.  The people in hospitals and institutions who would be normally entitled to exercise their vote ought to be given an opportunity of having a postal vote.  I believe that at present the postal vote is reserved for members of the Army.  When we are considering this matter we should widen the scope of the regulations relating to postal votes, so that a larger number of the people, who for some reason or other cannot exercise their votes on the particular day, should be given that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a couple of points to make.  In paragraph (e), it says that &ldquo;copies of the statement referred to&rdquo;&mdash;the statement in the appendix&mdash;&ldquo;in paragraph (a) of this section may be displayed in or in the precincts of polling stations&rdquo;. That &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Would the Minister not consider it most desirable that there should be a copy of the appendix displayed in the <Col N="177" /> polling stations or in the precincts? I should like to ask him what is the implication of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and why should it not be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Then, with regard to (f) (I) and (f) (II), some rather penetrating mind seems to have been at work here. The proposal is to amend paragraph 3 of Rule 18 of the Second Schedule to the 1942 Act where incapacitated voters are being helped.  That paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In carrying out the provisions of this rule, the presiding officer shall observe and comply with the following directions, that is to say (a) the presiding officer shall ask the voter, &lsquo;Which do you wish to do&mdash; to vote in favour of the proposal or to vote against the proposal?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the question to be put to the person who wants to be assisted.  The presiding officer will then mark the ballot paper.  In paragraph (c), where the voter fails to understand the import of the question, the presiding officer shall read out to the voter the Proposal as stated, and then ask the voter: &ldquo;Do you approve of or do you object to the Proposal becoming law?&rdquo; Apparently some deep consideration has been given to that process and, under the amendment now proposed by the Minister, when a person wants to be assisted by the presiding officer, the question he will be asked is not the question provided under (a) but the question provided under (c) where he says that he does not understand the question.  If the voter does not understand what was No. 2 question, but will after this be No. 1 question, he will be put No. 1 question from the Schedule of the 1942 Act when he looks for further advice as to what the original question means.  These two questions have been transposed and I am wondering as to the mental processes which decided to make this change in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last point first, under paragraph (f) (2) (c) (1), which is, I think, the point Deputy Mulcahy is on, the presiding officer, in the case of a voter who fails to understand <Col N="178" /> the question whether he approves of or objects to the Bill becoming law, is required to read out to the voter such summary of the proposal as is contained in the statement set out in the appendix.  In other words, the lead-in and the tailend and the various questions tied on to that statement do not enter.  It is merely the middle part of the agreed statement setting out a summary of what is mainly contained in the Bill.  The word &ldquo;summary&rdquo; is used deliberately.  The presiding officer will not have to read out the lead-in and the tailend which appears on the agreed form we are circulating to voters in general.  I do not know if that answers the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  If the Minister looks at paragraph (3) (a) of Rule 18 of the 1942 Act, when the voter first looks for assistance, the presiding officer will ask him whether he wishes to vote in favour of the proposal or against it.  That is now being changed and the presiding officer will now ask: &ldquo;Do you approve or do you object to the Bill becoming law?&rdquo; That is the formula provided in the rules under the 1942 Act for the second question.  A person comes in and says he wants to be assisted.  The old rules provided for a particular type of question and, if the voter did not understand that, then a second question was put to him.  These two questions are now being reversed in the Minister's new regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy J.A. Costello in relation to the form of the amendment being an <Col N="179" /><i>ad hoc</i> provision and his assurance that his efforts were not to be regarded as being in any way mischievous, or anything like that, I can assure him that the Opposition's approach to this matter has been fully appreciated by myself and my colleagues inasmuch as we were able to get certain agreements which helped us to overcome difficulties that were regarded at one stage as insurmountable; and, as a result of those agreements, we are now in the position of being able to circulate to voters generally a simple formula setting out what the issue before them is.</P>
    <P>With reference to the application of that practice to all future referenda, which seems to be the Deputy's wish, I can only say that I still have the same objections as I had on the Committee Stage.  While we undoubtedly have got agreement in this instance, if we were to make this part of permanent legislation, governing all future referenda, we might not so readily, if at all, get agreement as to the form of the summary.  It is solely for that good reason&mdash;I consider it a very good reason&mdash;that we are leaving this as an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.  As well as that, we shall gain some experience of how this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement works.  As a result of that experience, we may possibly incorporate it as a permanent feature in this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to postal vote facilities, I have tremendous sympathy with the views expressed by the two Deputies on this occasion and on earlier occasions.  Giving effect to such a vote would be very difficult.  We would have to ensure that we would not find ourselves in a situation in which there would be ultimately more postal voters than voters actually attending the polling stations.  While I cannot see my way on this Bill, at any rate, to trying to find a way around those difficulties, I shall bear what has been said in mind because I am in full sympathy with the views expressed. I appreciate there are genuine and <i>bona fide</i> reasons for such a course.  Commercial travellers, for instance, may have to be away from home on the very day polling <Col N="180" /> takes place and cannot, therefore, exercise the franchise.  I am aware of all these things, but the difficulties are very great.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I might say that, even if we wished to bring in the Garda, it would have been too late at the time of the introduction of this Bill.  The lists have been finally checked and they are either in the printers' hands or are on their way to the printers.  We would have had the unusual position of legislation proposing to give the Garda votes and, while that Bill was in process of becoming law, the lists in relation to these two very important events have actually been completed and it would not have been possible, therefore, to put the Garda on them. We would have had the anomalous position of giving them a vote while, through lack of machinery, it would not be possible for them to exercise that vote.  Again in regard to Deputy Mulcahy's poser in so far as this change in the question is concerned, the change of the rules applicable to this case, I might say that the proposal will now be stated in the ballot paper by reference only to the Short Title of the Bill.  The rules were, in fact, drawn up so that the ballot paper would include a statement of the proposals.  In other words the rules that then applied must be changed somewhat in order to meet a change in the situation brought about by that particular aspect of things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The Bill provides for an increase in the authorised capital of Irish Shipping Ltd. from the present figure of £5,000,000 to £12,000,000; for an increase <Col N="183" /> in the maximum borrowing by the company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance from the present limit of £2,000,000 to £5,000,000; and for the repeal of the provisions in the Irish Shipping Limited Act, 1947, which empower the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay subsidies to the company.</P>
      <P>Deputies are, I am sure, familiar in some degree with what I believe we can fairly describe as the success story of Irish Shipping Ltd.  The company commenced operations in 1941 during the most difficult phase of the war with a capital of £200,000.  During the war the company acquired 15 deep sea vessels, which by peace time standards were obsolete and uneconomic. The company also later undertook war risk insurance and later extended their insurance business to cover ordinary marine and aviation risks.  The company's shipping business was very successful and, due largely to a very fortunate claims experience, their insurance business was phenomenally successful.</P>
      <P>The company's success in the insurance field served to place the marine insurance business in this country on a firm footing from which its success developed very satisfactorily. The company ended the war with very substantial reserves. After the war, the company set about replacing the wartime fleet with new and up-to-date vessels and now they possess a modern fleet totaling 140,000 tons dead-weight, consisting of 17 dry cargo vessels, one deep sea tanker and one coastal tanker.  In addition, a second deep sea tanker of 18,000 tons dead-weight has been launched and will be delivered later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. have grown to be a very considerable enterprise and play a considerable part in our economy.  The company now give employment to some 900 persons, ashore and afloat.  The scale of their operations may be deduced from the fact that in the five years ended 30th April last frieghts amounted to approximately £9 million.  The company are one of our major earners of foreign exchange and their freights <Col N="184" /> are an important factor in our balance of payments.  Irish Shipping Ltd. are in these respects directly comparable with an industrial undertaking of similar magnitude engaged entirely in the export market.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the programme of expansion and modernisation, the Oireachtas enacted the Irish Shipping Limited Act, 1947, which provided for a maximum authorised capital of £5,000,000 and for borrowing, with the guarantee of the Minister for Finance, up to £2,000,000.  These limits are now no longer adequate.  Expenditure on the present fleet including payments in respect of the tanker under construction have amounted to approximately £12,500,000.  Of this sum, Irish Shipping Ltd. have contributed from earnings some £5,750,000.  Five million pounds, being the full authorised capital of the company, have been contributed by the Minister for Finance in the form of share capital.  The balance of approximately £1,750,000 is covered by overdraft with the company's bankers.  This overdraft, which was arranged for the purpose of financing the purchase of the two deep-sea tankers, is guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>When a programme of expansion was embarked on after the war, the target aimed at was a dry cargo fleet of 250,000 tons dead-weight which was then considered to be the minimum size of fleet required to carry essential imports to this country in time of war. Because of increases in the size and speed of dry cargo vessels, with a consequent improvement in their overall efficiency, it is now considered that minimum emergency requirements could be put at a figure of 200,000 tons. The cost of an additional 80,000 tons required to bring the Irish Shipping Ltd. fleet of dry cargo vessels up to 200,000 tons will at present prices be of the order of £9,000,000.  The Government do not intend to limit the company's growth to this tonnage, but expansion beyond it will depend on the prospects for remunerative employment of the company's vessels.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. consider, and the Government agree, that the best shipping practice requires that they <Col N="185" /> should replace their vessels when they become relatively uneconomic to operate. Over the next ten years or so, a number of the company's vessels will fall due for replacement on this basis. As an alternative to early replacement, the company have undertaken the conversion to diesel propulsion of two of the older vessels.  They have informed me that the converted vessels will be of a size and speed particularly suitable for operation on the Atlantic and into the new St. Lawrence seaway. The cost of replacement vessels would, in the normal way, be met from the sale of the older vessels and from depreciation reserves and would not require any addition to the company's capital.  The cost of new vessels has, however, risen very considerably since many of the present vessels were built.  Moreover, the company's entire reserves have been applied, on Government direction, to the acquisition of new tonnage.  The cost of replacements, which will over a long period ahead amount to many millions of pounds, will therefore have to be met to a considerable extent from new capital.</P>
    <P>Outstanding commitments on the tanker due for delivery in the present year amount to about £420,000, and payment of the outstanding sums is expected to bring the company's overdraft at the bank to over £2,000,000. In view of the present shipping slump, the company will not be able to repay this overdraft from earnings in the relatively short time envisaged when the overdraft was being arranged and it may be necessary, eventually, therefore, to liquidate the overdraft by long-term borrowing or by payment from capital account.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd., like other shipping companies throughout the world, are not immune from the present severe slump in freight rates. The company have been fortunate in that a large proportion of their fleet is modern and relatively economic to operate and that a number of their vessels were on long-term charter at rates negotiated before the onset of the slump.  The company expect that in the present year they will about break even, the profit on some vessels <Col N="186" /> offsetting the loss on others.  Unfortunately, they have been forced to lay up two of the older and less economic vessels.  The company are unable, for the time being, to devote any portion of their earnings to the liquidation of their overdraft or to the acquisition of new vessels.  The extent to which they will be able to do so in the future will depend very much on developments in the freight market.</P>
    <P>There have been many attempts by economic and shipping experts to forecast the pattern and duration of the present shipping slump, but few have committed themselves to firm prophecies.  There are, however, a number of factors in the situation which suggest that the slump is not susceptible of a quick solution and that, in the absence of further international crises, there is unlikely to be any return to the extraordinarily high rates which prevailed only a few years ago.  That situation can now be seen in retrospect to have been a largely artificial one brought about by the successive stimuli of the Korean War and the Suez Canal crisis.  These events not only delayed the inevitable reduction in freights from the high levels which prevailed in the immediate post-war period, but served to inflate orders for new tonnage, while at the same time keeping obsolete tonnage in remunerative employment. This situation has been further aggravated by the relatively minor economic recessions in Britain and the United States of America, with their inevitable reactions on world trade.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of these factors has been to change what might have been a gradual adjustment of freight rates to normal competitive levels to a precipitous plunge to levels at which only the most efficient and modern vessels can meet outgoings and the bulk of existing vessels can operate only at a loss.  Since January, 1956, the dry cargo freight index of the British Chamber of Shipping rose from 144.3 to 189.4 in December, 1956, whence it fell to 62.7 in April, 1958. Since then, the index rose slightly and in December 1958, was 74.6.</P>
    <P>In the 12 months from July, 1957 to June, 1958, the world high seas fleet <Col N="187" /> increased by the phenomenal figure of 7.7 million tons, over 7 per cent., to a total of 114,000,000 gross registered tons.  In contrast, scrapping of old and obsolete tonnage was relatively very small.  This is due in large part to the fact that many obsolete vessels changed hands at very high prices at the height of the boom and the new owners are reluctant to face the heavy capital loss involved in scrapping them. The rate of new construction continued at a very high level and many ships continue to be delivered against orders placed prior to the slump.  At the present time, it is estimated that there are some 7,000,000 tons dead-weight of dry cargo shipping laid up and any increase in freight rates is likely to bring many of these vessels back into the market.  Fluctuations in tanker freight levels have been even greater than in the case of dry-cargo tonnage; from a peak index figure of 435 in December, 1956, they fell to a figure of 42 in May, 1958, and have risen only slightly since.  Over 4,000,000 tons dead-weight of the world's tanker fleet is now laid up.  In recent years, the world tanker fleet has grown rapidly, the net increase in the year 1958 amounting to 3.8 million tons dead-weight or 6 per cent.  As in the case of dry cargo tonnage, there has been relatively very little scrapping of old vessels.</P>
    <P>The present situation, therefore, is that there is a substantial surplus of both tanker and dry cargo tonnage, aggravated by a relatively minor recession in world trade, by a continued flow of new tonnage, and by the retention of old tonnage due for scrapping. In a normal international situation, the present position can be expected to right itself only over a fairly lengthy period in which an inevitable reduction in new building, accompanied by an increase in the scrapping of obsolete tonnage and an improvement in world trade, will bring about an adjustment to normal freight levels.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the picture is the fact that the world's population is increasing by about 1,000,000 per week, that world trade always tends to <Col N="188" /> expand in the long-run, and that more competitive conditions will eventually force uneconomic ships out of trade. A well-managed company with modern ships can hope to see a gradual expansion of its operations.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of these considerations that we must consider the prospects for the future trading and development of Irish Shipping Ltd.  I have every confidence that the company will, with wise direction and able management, ride out the present storm and, with the return of better trading conditions, forge ahead once more towards and, in due course, I hope, beyond, the target of our minimum national requirements.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in present circumstances to estimate with any degree of precision what the gross capital requirements of the company may be for a considerable number of years ahead, or what contribution the company may be able to make from earnings to future replacements and expansion.  Such estimates must depend, to a considerable degree, on developments in the world shipping market. The Government consider, however, that adequate statutory provision should be made to meet whatever developments may be found practicable and desirable in the light of future experience.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, that the maximum authorised capital of the company should be increased from £5,000,000 to £12,000,000.  This latter figure is, in any case, more in keeping with the present value of the company's assets which amount to £13,000,000.  It is also proposed to increase, correspondingly, from £2,000,000 to £5,000,000 the amount which the company can borrow with the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  Taking into account the prospects for a return to normal conditions in the shipping industry within some reasonable time, the provisions now proposed should be sufficient to meet the company's requirements on capital account for some years.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to repeal the provision at Section 10 of the 1947 Act which empowers the Minister for <Col N="189" /> Industry and Commerce to pay subsidies to the company.  When that Act was passed, Irish Shipping Ltd., were beginning to meet, for the first time in peace, the brunt of competition from established shipping companies. It was expected that competition would become more acute and that the company would have to face the discriminatory practices operated by some Governments to protect their own shipping, and unfair competition of some combines of private shipping concerns.  We were then, perhaps, too fearful for the future and Irish Shipping Ltd. have since proved beyond all doubt their ability to compete successfully in the international shipping market.  The provision for subsidy is therefore no longer necessary, and the retention of legislative powers to pay a subsidy could give rise to misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>Since 1947, also, Ireland has become a member of the InterGovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, known as IMCO, one of whose aims is the elimination of discriminatory and restrictive practices in the shipping industry.  While it is not to be expected that a consultative organisation such as this can succeed in eliminating these practices entirely, it is to be hoped that it can bring about some mitigation of them in due course.  In our particular circumstances, discriminatory action in favour of our own vessels would be impracticable, even if it were desirable. Our national interest, both from the narrow point of view of the success of Irish Shipping Ltd. as well as from the broader aspect of the freight levels which affect the cost of our imports and exports, is best served by supporting the abolition of discriminatory and restrictive practices in the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested, from time to time, that Irish Shipping Ltd. vessels should be used to a greater extent in the carriage of goods to and from Irish ports.  I am sure the company would be anxious to use their vessels as far as possible in this way. It would simplify the task of management and would, no doubt, be welcome to the crews.  I am sure the company have never missed, and <Col N="190" /> never will miss, any opportunity to trade profitably with home ports.  To compel the company to trade with home ports exclusively, or to any particular extent, would mean uneconomic use of vessels, with resultant heavy losses, unless, by compulsion or otherwise, regular remunerative cargoes were guaranteed.  Official measures to channel trade to our own vessels would involve a breach of the international principles to which we adhered when we joined IMCO.</P>
    <P>The international shipping market is one in which no tariff or similar means of protection are available to us, but it is also one in which we need meet no serious handicaps in fair competition with others.  The task of Irish Shipping Ltd. in peace time is to pursue an aggressive commercial and expansionist policy; it is in this way that the company will best be able to acquire the resources with which to serve the nation in any circumstances which may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement, on both sides of the House, on the policy of encouraging the development and expansion of Irish Shipping Ltd.  On that matter, there is no conflict of policy between the present Government and the previous one.  Both Governments have encouraged the modernisation and expansion of the shipping fleet and, as the Minister remarked, it is satisfactory that, despite the present worldwide slump in shipping, Irish Shipping Ltd. has probably been less affected than many other companies, because, in at least two cases, satisfactory charter arrangements on a long-term basis were made before the drop in freight rates.  It is sound national policy for this country to have a modern shipping fleet.  The fact that we are an island makes it obvious that we should have a shipping fleet of our own to meet our own requirements. Leaving aside ordinary commercial considerations, events like the Suez crisis of a few years ago brought home to all sections of the community the importance of having adequate shipping facilities and, in particular, adequate tanker facilities.</P>

    <P>However, in present circumstances, <Col N="191" /> in view of the very substantial drop in freight rates, I should be glad to hear from the Minister what the policy of Irish Shipping Ltd. will be, while these conditions exist.  In present circumstances, a certain amount of caution is necessary.  The company has displayed very considerable foresight and ability in running its affairs and I have no doubt that it will display those qualities in facing the present difficult situation.  It is well known to those who study these matters and it was clearly shown by the figures read by the Minister a few minutes ago that shipping generally is facing a difficult time.  That, also has been the experience for the past 12 or 18 months.  The fact that Irish Shipping Ltd. modernised its fleet enabled it to meet that situation on more favourable conditions than otherwise would be the case.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters I should like to raise on this measure. Could the Minister indicate what the prospects are of having ships for Irish Shipping Ltd. constructed in this country in future?  One ship was built for the company by the Liffey Dockyard Company.  I understand that that dockyard is capable of building ships of a certain size only.  Can the Minister say at this stage what the prospects are of ships being built in the new dockyard in Cork and is it possible to indicate now what State contribution will be made to that new venture?  On the other hand, apart from these shipyards, does the company consider the possibility, other things being equal, of orders being placed with the Belfast shipyards?</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like some information is the extent to which the company has considered entering the cross-Channel trade.  This matter was under consideration some years ago but, so far as I know, no definite decision was taken.  The other matter that arises in that connection is the question of providing passenger ships for the transport of passengers between this country and Britain.  At present, companies outside this country have a monopoly of that trade and while, in the main, the service is satisfactory, <Col N="192" /> very serious inconvenience has been caused on many occasions, at peak periods, particularly during the summer holiday period, to passengers returning to Britain after spending holidays here.  Efforts have been made by this Government and by the previous Government, through representations to the companies concerned, through the provision of better facilities at Dún Laoghaire for persons awaiting transport, but on occasion, all these efforts have failed to prevent hardship, disappointment, delay and unnecessary inconvenience.  For that reason, I should be glad if the Minister would indicate if the question of providing passenger ships has been considered.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, we welcome this proposal.  Irish Shipping Ltd. has been a very satisfactory undertaking. It is one of the examples of State enterprise succeeding where it would not have been possible for the development and expansion which have taken place to have been achieved by a company other than one operated through State auspices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill this evening, painted a somewhat gloomy picture.  He has told us of the very significant increase in the size and speed of dry cargo vessels. He has told us of the falling off in trade.  Even though the picture painted by the Minister is gloomy in this particular regard and at this particular moment, nevertheless, in the light of the record of Irish Shipping Ltd. since 1941 in building up a minimum national fleet that at one period was able to provide essential shipping and, in the event of some future emergency, would be capable of providing essential shipping, all sides of the House should agree with the Minister as to the desirability of increasing the capital of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that no expert of world standing has been able to indicate the duration of the present slump in shipping.  Nevertheless, if in the course of years, the situation was rectified and there was an increase in demand for this type of fleet carrier, Irish Shipping Ltd. would <Col N="193" /> require at that stage modern economic vessels.  Their fleet is growing old and replacements will be required.  I think we would agree with the Minister if he would say that you do not get replacements very easily in peak periods of demand for shipping: the cost of replacement is going up and the demand on the various shipbuilding yards is also there.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made by Deputy Cosgrave of the prospects of Irish Shipping breaking some new ground, so to speak, and he asked in particular whether or not the Minister could give the House an indication of the prospects of Irish Shipping Ltd. taking an active part in the cross-Channel trade.  I would echo his remarks in that regard, but I should be inclined to ask the Minister to deal in particular with the cargo trade.</P>
    <P>We in this country are very much aware of the difficulties which arise at peak periods&mdash;the Christmas period and the August period&mdash;when passengers experience extreme difficulty in travelling between this country and England.  One difficulty any shipping company would have if they entered the passenger-carrying trade between here and the neighbouring country would be whether, if ships were built for the specific purpose of carrying passengers, they would be in a position reasonably to ensure that the ships could be utilised throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Not even the most optimistic person would suggest that it would be a good venture, national or otherwise, to have passenger ships constructed if they were to be used and could only be used profitably for two or three weeks, or for two or three months in the whole year.  We should like to see Irish Shipping extend their activities. They have been successful in obtaining charters for carrying goods to various remote ports of the world.  We should be happy to see them extend their activities to the carriage of goods between our ports and cross-Channel ports.  I think we would welcome their incursion into the passenger-carrying trade, provided that was a practical possibility.</P>
    <P>Much as we might deplore the difficulties experienced by travellers at <Col N="194" /> the peak periods, I think we would wish to be assured that there was a possibility that, if the shipping company were thinking of entering that line, they would be able to keep up a regular scheduled service which would not result in a very severe financial loss.  Can the Minister indicate whether or not Irish Shipping, Ltd., have any programme in relation to entering a little more into the tanker business? For a number of years, the desirability of having some tankers in the ownership of Irish Shipping, Ltd., has been adverted to both inside and outside this House.  We have reached the position where there are two and, I think, one in construction.  We wonder whether it would not be advisable even to extend into that line in a greater measure.</P>
    <P>I should like to echo a point made by Deputy Cosgrave.  In the matter of repair, alteration or construction of Irish ships by Irish Shipping Ltd., will any very serious effort be made to endeavour to ensure that, where possible, contracts for the repair, reconstruction, or construction of ships for the company will be placed with Irish dockyards?  The Minister has indicated that employment is provided directly and indirectly&mdash;I think directly&mdash;for some 900 persons in all, both afloat and ashore.  I have no doubt that, where Irish Shipping, Ltd., place their orders for ship repairs and reconstruction or construction with Irish dockyards, the benefits to the economy are not inconsiderable.</P>
    <P>I feel this Bill should be approved by this House on the basis that, since its establishment, Irish Shipping's record has been good and, even in times of slump, it is possibly best to endeavour to build for the future and to try to ensure that if the position does improve, we shall not be left with out-of-date and outmoded ships flying the Irish flag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this Bill has the approval of the whole House.  From the establishment of Irish Shipping, Ltd., the idea was that we would have ships of our own to carry cargoes in times of war; in fact, the Minister said that here this <Col N="195" /> evening.  If that be so, then it did not matter whether or not Irish Shipping, Ltd., was a paying proposition. What mattered was that we should have the ships and maintain them.  It is creditable that Irish Shipping, Ltd., were able to earn £5,000,000, out of which they were enabled to build more ships.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policy of Irish Shipping, Ltd., I consider it is not good policy to build very large ships. About two months after I came into this House, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, how many ports in this State could accommodate a ship of some 10,000 tons fully loaded and dischargeable.  The answer was Dublin.  It is important that we should not have all our ships of a size that they can be accommodated only in the port of the capital of the country.  In time of war, it is very important that the cargoes should be spread out all over the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister should examine the possibility of re-entering the coasting trade.  I realise that there is great competition from the Dutch.  However, now that we have Dutch shipbuilders coming to Cork, I am sure they would be able to build the type of ship that would be suitable for the coasting trade here in Ireland and maybe other countries.  That type of ship would be a great reserve for us in time of war.  I would agree with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Larkin, and I am sure all will agree, that we should, if possible, build our ships in our own shipyards.  If we have to go outside our own yards for a certain type of ship, then we should give substantial preference to the Belfast shipyards and pay more than lipservice to this matter of being on good terms with our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I agree with the Minister that it is better to get out of ships before they get very old, just as it is with cars. He mentioned that diesel engines had been put into two ships and that they were particularly suitable for the Atlantic trade.  It seems to me that that is a policy which is being carried <Col N="196" /> out by most of the shipping companies throughout the world.  They are all switching over to oil.  If we are switching over to oil, we should bear in mind that the building of one tanker is not sufficient and the Minister should examine the possibility, when increasing the fleet, of having more tankers.</P>
    <P>To sum up, our target is 250,000 tons and 200,000 tons are the emergency requirements.  I say to the Minister that it is very important that not all of these ships be big ships, but that they be built to go into the main ports and the ports I have in mind are Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Drogheda, Dundalk, Wexford and Sligo.  I hope we will not live to see it happen, but if war broke out and all our ships were big ships, it would be a great expense for us to have all the cargoes discharged at Dublin and then sent by road or rail to the various centres all over the country, when they could be discharged at various ports here and there.  I welcome this Bill and I hope it is an earnest of something that we had hoped would be brought before the House.  It is a good thing to see a Bill being brought in for the improvement of Irish Shipping, Ltd. I hope the Minister will have more Bills like this in the near future which will be for the improvement of industry and commerce and the various branches of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping, Ltd. are to be congratulated on the advances which they have made in the few years since they started.  Unfortunately the bulk of our grain imports are still arriving in foreign vessels and fertilisers are also coming in in foreign ships.  I think that a timely word from the Minister to the importers is necessary in the matter of these imports being carried in our own shipping.  Some time ago, I had occasion to help one coaster which was looking for its share of the imports of grain and fertilisers which are coming in here and I shall send the correspondence to the Minister, because it is very enlightening.  The man in question was referred to an agent in Dublin and in turn that agent referred him to an agent in London.  He <Col N="197" /> ended up with an agent in Denmark. If instead of getting their goods f.o.b Cork, or f.o.b. Dublin or Waterford, the importers brought them in themselves, or hired the ships for those imports, we would do far better and get more trade.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave in connection with cross-Channel traffic. We have two services working in Cork in that line, but very little, if any, of the repair or overhaul work ever finds its way into an Irish shipyard.  Rushbrooke is passed up two or three times a year and when repairs or overhauls are to be done, they are done over in England or in Belfast.  The whole business of at least two of these vessels is at Cork, coming and going, and at least we might get some of that work. Unfortunately we are not able to &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; up those in charge of the harbour, the Cork Harbour Commissioners, to take any action in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that we are advancing in the line of getting more shipping and in that regard I hope that Cobh dockyard will be in a position to build some of those ships as quickly as possible.  I am glad that they are catering not only for repair work but also for building.  I hope that we will see a more prosperous period being enjoyed by our ship repairers and shipbuilders.  There is a big opening there and if we are to have ships, let them, if they can, be built in our own yards and repaired in our own yards.  We will then find employment for some of our people who unfortunately have to go abroad. I welcome any advance in that line and in the line of further Irish shipping being made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join other Deputies in expressing admiration and appreciation of the position of Irish Shipping Ltd., as indicated by the Minister.  All of us are anxious that Irish Shipping Ltd. should improve in every way.  It will aid the country materially in the provision of essentials for commerce and as well as that, there is the fact that employment will be given to Irish seamen, which is of the utmost importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> When people are put into well-paid employment, under the Irish flag, it is the same as if another factory of some sort had been established.  Because of that, any effort to improve the position is sure to meet with a welcome from the Party to which I belong.</P>
    <P>I would concur with Deputy Cosgrave in sounding a note of warning.  I am sure the Minister is aware that I have connections with shipping on the other side through my family, and only this week I received a letter informing me that one well-known shipping company, with its modern ships and lifelong connections with trade in Britain, is finding this the worst period in many years.  A charter has been secured for a particular boat in that company of a type that has not previously been handled as a means of keeping the ship going during the slump.  I know that Irish Shipping are to be trusted to foresee how long that situation may last, but it is well to sound some note of caution.</P>
    <P>I have been seeking an opportunity to pay tribute to the efficiency of the Mercantile Marine Section of the Minister's Department.  I had occasion to visit the section in connection with a boy undergoing an eyesight test before going to sea.  The courtesy, efficiency and kindness with which he was met and the assistance given to him by the Minister's officers to overcome various difficulties deserve special tribute.  It is well to see a service carried out as efficiently as that was done.  I welcome the Bill and trust that Irish Shipping will go from success to success.</P>
    <P>I should like to be associated with Deputy Lynch's remarks concerning the building of boats of a tonnage which would enable them to use lesser ports outside Dublin, such as those in my constituency, Waterford and Limerick and others.  It is a pity to see much business that could be done by Irish boats being secured by foreign boats coming into our ports.  It is important to have all our goods conveyed by Irish ships as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies who have spoken in support of the Bill.  The more we <Col N="199" /> have our national flag on the high seas, the better it is for national prestige and for any commercial ventures we undertake to assist our commerce.  It will help to put us before the world, one of the most desirable things for any country to do in the competitive world of to-day.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the aim of Irish Shipping appears to be to go in for the bigger type of ships.  That is a good idea and it is also good to have modern, up-to-date ships, because if you run your shipping on economic standards, you are better able to compete with world conditions.  You must bear in mind that at the moment there is a very heavy glut in the shipping world.  It is a fact that most of the big shipyards are faced with cancellation of orders and there is a great deal of unemployment in industrial shipbuilding areas in other countries, due to these cancellations and to lack of orders.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that our shipping tonnage should be kept steady.  I think we have something in the neighbourhood of 140,000 tons at present.  We have about 19 or 20 ocean-going ships&mdash;19, I think is correct.  We have a big tanker on order which will not be delivered for another 12 months.  Most of the ships envisaged in the Minister's speech seem to be the bigger type of ocean-going craft which, from our point of view when we have so many interests to consider, such as unemployment and other factors, have two disadvantages.  I think I am right in saying we are not able to build the bigger type of ship ourselves and&mdash;a matter referred to by Deputy Lynch&mdash; we have only three or four harbours in which big ships can dock because of the draught required.  Outside Dublin, Galway, Cobh and perhaps Waterford to a lesser extent, we are confined to a tonnage of some 2,000 to 4,000 tons or at the very maximum, in some cases, 5,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons given for keeping our shipping up to date was that we might be prepared to meet any emergency.  That is very desirable, but it makes it even more imperative that <Col N="200" /> ships of our fleet should be able to get into the smaller ports.  It would be very much easier in the event of any world conflagration&mdash;which we hope will not arise&mdash;to protect our shipping in isolated ports than in the major ports.  If we are to use only about three ports to bring goods into the country, we lay ourselves much more open to enemy attack.  For that reason, although it might possibly be desirable from an economy point of view to do otherwise, perhaps the Minister would give further thought to those boats we are to have built and perhaps it would be possible to construct them in our own harbours and provide a faster and lighter type of vessel from 2,000 to 6,000 tons.  These would, perhaps, be of greater service to the country than the big ocean-going vessels the Minister envisages.  I may be entirely wrong and may have misunderstood what the Minister said in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to passenger-carrying steamers.  There is something in that suggestion.  I doubt if it is possible for us to set up an individual link, operating as a shipping company over and above all those already existing, between ourselves and Britain where there is such heavy traffic, but I think if we had ships available that we could charter&mdash; naturally, with our own Irish crews in them to give employment afloat to our seamen&mdash;it would be worth considering. It is a fact that on the cross-Channel routes the shipping companies always maintain the delay and trouble caused to passengers is due to the fact that they are unable to procure replacement ships.  That state of affairs is largely paralleled in countries everywhere. It might be worth considering building passenger ships with a view to charter and use not only for cross-Channel work but also for other services when these are overburdened in the rush season in any part of the world.  I am suggesting something like one of those middle-grade coastal steamers up to about 5,000 tons.</P>
    <P>There is also a lot in the suggestion of one or two Deputies who spoke here with regard to our concentrating more on the actual shipping around our coasts.  We all know that <Col N="201" /> at the beginning of this century, we had quite a lot of cattle boats going out of this country.  In those days, say, 40 years ago, we had not our own Government and our own flag was not flying on the high seas, but those ships were leaving our ports.  I remember in my own constituency, at Rosslare harbour, the cattle boats went regularly with cattle to Britain. That is one of our major ports and it does seem wrong that most of our live-stock freightage is conducted by other shipping companies under other flags.</P>
    <P>That is a matter towards which Irish Shipping might direct their energies, to see if they can capture that trade.  The major portion of our exports is live-stock and even if these ships have to come back empty, it being a short trip, it would be economical.  There are ocean-going ships carrying goods to the Western Hemisphere even from as far off as Australia, and very often those ships are in ballast going back.  They have nothing to export from here.  Our ships should be directed towards where our exports are sent.</P>
    <P>In the Haulbowline Dockyard, we have one of the best repair yards in these islands.  There are always emergency shipping repairs to be conducted and we ought to concentrate&mdash; I am not clear how one does that but I think by advertisement and I suppose by an effort on the part of Irish Shipping&mdash;on securing all the repair work we possibly can.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister is raising the capital of the company to £12,000,000. I take it that is just for the general expansion of the shipping company as a whole.  I presume he does not intend to go into an extensive building programme, although I took a note of the beginning of his speech where he said they had envisaged that we should increase our dry cargo fleet&mdash;I presume that includes oil tankers as well&mdash;up to 200,000 tons. He also said that some of the money towards that increase in our production would be offset by sales of ships. I think he indicated that replacements would be made by sales of existing ships that had become uneconomic. <Col N="202" /> However, it might be a little bit of wishful thinking on the part of the Minister with the glut that exists at present.</P>
    <P>I am wholeheartedly behind the expansion of Irish shipping.  It is one of the things that for a variety of reasons, we have neglected in this country but I would sound a note of caution to the Minister.  We are passing this Bill and I am glad we are doing so.  It is very necessary and a step in the right direction, but there is no reason why, at this moment, although shipping is a long-term business, we should rush too far ahead.  We must bear in mind the fact that ships are being produced <i>ad lib</i>.  They are being produced up to and above the maximum demand.  It is difficult for established shipping companies and established maritime nations such as Denmark, Norway and Britain, who have been on the high seas for a great many years before us, to get trade.  Therefore, if we spend all the money producing new ships straightaway, it might be a rather risky policy.  We should concentrate more on the type of ships we can actually use ourselves.  As well as that, we should concentrate on trying to get, whatever way we do it, as much work as we possibly can in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the enterprise which Irish Shipping have always shown.  From a small beginning, they have built up a fleet of which we can be proud. This Bill proposes to increase the capital from £5,000,000 to £12,000,000. It may not be regarded as a very substantial increase, having regard to the very high cost of shipbuilding and repairing at the present time.  We have a total tonnage of around 140,000 and it is estimated that the target at which Irish Shipping should aim would be around 200,000 tons. That, I assume, on average, would mean a further eight or nine ships, in addition to the 20 vessels, or thereabouts, which are under the control of Irish Shipping at the present time. There is a tanker under construction of approximately 18,000 tons for Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> When we are considering this matter of shipbuilding and ship repair, we must take into consideration the capacity of our ports to handle ships of a certain size.  It was pointed out earlier by Deputy T. Lynch that it is unlikely that any of our ports would be capable of handling a very large ship.  I wonder whether, in fact, any of our ports would be capable of handling a tanker of 18,000 tons.  I assume that has been considered already, but the figure of 10,000 tons was mentioned by Deputy T. Lynch in this matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to building new ships and repairs we must look across the water to see the position there.  There are nearly 1,000,000 tons of shipping tied up in the docks, owing to a slump in the shipping trade.  However, as far as Ireland is concerned, we have a situation where we are importing <Col N="204" /> goods to the value of approximately £200,000,000 and exporting, I suppose, something around £125,000,000 worth. I believe Irish Shipping can direct their efforts towards carrying exports which are carried to a great extent at the moment by charter ships and also use their ships for the importation of goods to the extent of £200,000,000 in value. The market is there for Irish Shipping to that extent.  Possibly, when they have met those needs, they can consider the question of going into the international trade and competing there, but I think there is a greater opportunity for Irish Shipping, if they concentrate on setting up a repair yard in Dublin and Cork.</P>
