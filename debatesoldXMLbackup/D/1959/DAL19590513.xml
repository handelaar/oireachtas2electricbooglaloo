    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the position in regard to Limerick City is now becoming more invidious due to the extension of the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act to Ennis, which is quite close to Limerick?  Am I to take it that the Minister will not reconsider his decision to extend the provisions of the Act to Limerick?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Deputy will have noted, in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, the announcement that the Government are, in fact, reconsidering the legislation applying in that respect and that proposals for new legislation will be before the Dáil shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that statements have been made by prominent people that West <Col N="1952" /> Cork is virtually boycotted by the Department and An Foras Tionscal, so far as industrial development is concerned? Were not these statements made by prominent people in the public Press?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No allegations of that precise nature have been brought to my notice and, if they were made, they were entirely without foundation. It is obviously highly undesirable, from the point of view of West Cork, that they should be given publicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what proportion of the special grant for tourist development to Bord Fáilte Éireann will be made available for smaller tourist centres; whether such funds will be specially allocated to areas; or whether it will be left to the discretion of Bord Fáilte Éireann to make the disposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government decision announced in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, the special provision of £1 million for resort development grants will be devoted exclusively to the improvement of major tourist resorts.  The approved scheme of grants will be administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann on its own responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As Deputies are aware Bord Fáilte have an annual grant of £500,000 for their normal activities and they can use, at their own discretion, any part of these resources for the development of holiday accommodation.  But, over and above that £500,000 which was available under existing legislation, the Government decided to give them another £1,000,000 for major resort developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the major resorts are getting £1,000,000 would the Minister not consider the desirability of chanelling some of the existing £500,000 to minor resorts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the conversion of the special import levy on newsprint into a permanent duty, I received a copy of written representations which The Associated Irish Newspapers made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in May, 1957, requesting the removal of that duty.  I also received similar direct representations, oral and written, respectively, from that body in February and March last.  In accordance with my promise to the deputation which I saw in February, and which included representatives of The Associated Irish Newspapers, I gave full consideration to their representations when I was formulating my Budget proposals this year but as already explained to the House I could not see my way to revoke the duty in question.  With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question I am not in a position to supply details of all the newspapers represented by that body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this motion last night I was endeavouring to stress one point which I consider it is more important to examine carefully than any other.  I was trying to direct particular attention to the position, not as it may be after the next election&mdash; should this motion go through&mdash;and not as it may be in five years' time, but as it may be over the next 15 years. During the week-end the Minister for Lands said the next 15 years would be vital for our future policy.  I want to concentrate on that facet of this issue. The Taoiseach is most anxious that the people should change from the system of proportional representation to the so-called straight vote.  During the many discussions here members were inclined to over-estimate the volume of voting power there would be in each <Col N="1971" /> constituency under the proposed new arrangement.  The new constituencies would be areas containing populations of between 20,000 and 30,000 people. It is safe to assume that the average would be about 25,000.</P>
      <P>If we work out the actual number of voters in each constituency in ratio to the population, we get a figure of roughly one to three.  That means that if there are 25,000 people living in a new constituency, the number of people on the electors lists entitled to vote would be approximately between 8,000 and 10,000 people.  We know that it is an absolute impossibility to expect a vote of 100 per cent. in any one constituency.  The result would be that in these new constituencies the number of people voting would be anything from 7,000 to 9,000 people.</P>
      <P>Last night, some members said I was wrong.  Apparently, they could not understand that position.  Let us be more thorough in the examination of the position that will arise from the results in these constituencies.  In ten years' time, should these proposals go through, it is safe to assume that conditions will be more or less normal.  We may be in the position of having in each area a strong Government candidate, a strong main Opposition candidate and a candidate of a smaller group contesting the election.  As I mentioned last night, in the rural areas the changes will not be so noticeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the position that could arise in such a large industrial area as Dublin and, to a lesser degree, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or any large industrial area.  If there is a fairly close contest between the Government, a strong opposition and a second opposition, no one candidate can expect to get a large number of votes. What then is to prevent the introduction into the political life of the Twenty-Six Counties of a new, deadly dangerous factor&mdash;the coming forward of a Party under an ultra-patriotic name claiming to represent highly-advanced Republican ideals and to be more advanced than anyone else in their determination to secure better conditions for the people? It is easy to see that this can happen <Col N="1972" /> and that such a political Party, ultra-patriotic by name, would carry with it a false ideology completely foreign to our people.  But the people will not be told of the background and ideals of such a Party.</P>
    <P>A voting strength of 2,300 or 2,400 in a large constituency in these highly industrialised areas could completely swing the balance in favour of the candidate of such a Party.  At present it is imposible for that to happen.  We may differ in relation to our aims, but under proportional representation the people who vote for a Labour candidate would be perfectly willing to vote 2, 3 and 4 for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael after Labour, if they thought that by so doing they would help to keep out of this Parliament candidates of a reactionary Party.</P>
    <P>I will give credit to the supporters of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and say they would do likewise.  After voting for their own Party, they would vote 2, 3 and 4 for the other established Parties.  While we may disagree on economic principles and so on, we do not differ on the main issue.  But, under this proposed system, the people who would vote for Labour can only put an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in front of their candidate's name.  So also are the people who would be voting for Fianna Fáil tied down.  They cannot combine, even if they would wish to keep out the candidate of a Party who may carry false principles in relation to the ideologies we hold sacred in this country.</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach examined that situation?  Does he realise that in ten, or, at the outside, fifteen years, we may be placed in the position that, owing to the election of such type of candidate, of such type of Party, between Dublin, Cork and the other industrial areas, we may have in this Chamber anything from 20 to 40 members of a Party whose sheer determination would be to carry out a policy in accordance with the dictates of a foreign Eastern power?</P>
    <P>I am not accusing the Taoiseach of planning any such a thing.  God forbid I should ever do so.  I am not suggesting that any member of Fianna Fáil would wish for it.  I know they do not. I am suggesting that, in their ambition <Col N="1973" /> to secure power for their own Party, in following the Taoiseach on his present line of approach, they have completely ignored the fundamental danger in relation to this issue.  That is why I say, as a member of the Labour Party and as an individual member in this Chamber, that it is far more important for us to admit the right of the people to continue to vote according to a system they know and understand.  After giving their No. 1 or No. 2 vote to the Party they are interested in, they can decide, if necessary, to follow up by giving Nos. 2, 3 or 4 to any other Party or any other candidate.</P>
    <P>All I want is protection for the people, protection for the whole community. In the debate on this motion, that point has been completely ignored by the people who are so anxious to introduce a policy here which in other countries, we are told, worked so well. I am more interested in what may work well in the Twenty-Six Counties. I will not waste the time of the House by dwelling on whether it is good, bad or indifferent in England, America or elsewhere.  We know that even in the United States the system of the straight vote has brought with it a greater state of corruption than we ever knew in relation to any system of election in this country.  All the abuses that were said to have occurred long ago in the rural district councils, and so on, here, were honest in comparison with those under the straight vote system in some of the countries we hear so much about now.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Taoiseach to withdraw his motion.  I do not believe in doing such a thing.  However, I challenge the members of the Party supporting the Taoiseach, and himself, to prove where I am wrong in relation to this biggest danger-of all in connection with the possibility of the introduction of people and of members of a Party who, thanks be to God, were never able to show any strength up to the present owing to the fact that we had P.R. to protect us.</P>
    <P>Under normal circumstances, and even with things as they are, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Taoiseach.  Like all other members of <Col N="1974" /> my Party here, I have consistently opposed certain measures.  We supported the Taoiseach and his Government when we thought we were doing right.  We all know that, in political life, there is no such thing as the completion of a man's job.  We all know that anyone in public life who is anxious to do everything possible, who believes in an ideal and tries to put it into effect, cannot, when the time comes to retire, say: &ldquo;I have done all I wanted to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can understand the Taoiseach's difficulty.  He has been the chief architect and the builder of a strong national Party.  Over the years he, above everyone else, brought that Party to its present position of strength. Therefore, at the time of retiring, it is bound to be a problem with him as to whether or not the Party to whose success in the national life of the country he has devoted his life will in the future follow the headline he personally has set.  I can appreciate that difficulty.</P>
    <P>A bigger problem must rest with the Taoiseach.  He may see that, in the next five years, his close associates&mdash; those who hold Ministerial rank and who, over the years and back since 1932, have held Ministerial rank&mdash;can be depended upon to continue the line of policy he has set down for them. But time is not charitable to any of us.  I think it is safe to say that, within the next ten years, his successors must be moving on as he has to move on and as each one of us must move on, as time decides that we must be put on the sideboard of political affairs.  That is why I am so anxious to ask the following question.  Does the Taoiseach understand that, given what he asks for, the support of the people for this proposed system of election, within these ten years, if the Party are still in Government, power and control must, of necessity, be handed over completely to younger men who have not been tested as the senior men of his Government have been tested over the years?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat myself.  I pointed out already the biggest danger of all.  There is another danger and that is the tendency on the part of some of the younger members&mdash;but the men who probably would control the <Col N="1975" /> destinies of a Party and probably of a Government&mdash;to swing towards liberalism.  There we have the two deciding factors.  There we have the two opposing sections.  Within the next 15 years, with a tendency of government towards liberalism and the introduction of a new Party with tendencies towards Communism, who will be the sufferer?</P>
    <P>I am not offering my criticism in the sense of attacking a Government just because I am in opposition.  I could not change my views irrespective of what Party may be in Government.  Do we want to create a situation which, on one side of the House, will give a policy of liberalism and, on the other side of the House, 30 or 40 Deputies who, by their strength in the Chamber, will control to a certain degree the destinies of the people in the Twenty-Six Counties?  That is a question that I want answered.  It is the duty and responsibility of every Deputy, irrespective of the Party to which he belongs, to examine his individual conscience and to try to answer.  Are we prepared to support a motion which is likely to give these results within the next 15 years?  That is the matter on which the House has been divided.</P>
    <P>As an individual and as a member of a Party, I have no hesitation in saying that I am prepared to go under direction to cast my vote which, in its own small way, will be a clear indication that, as a representative of a rural constituency, I am not prepared to be a party to the passing of a motion which can give us liberalism, Communism and a removal of the true Christian principle in government which has been recognised by every Government that we have had, whether it was a Fianna Fáil Government, a Cumann na nGaedheal Government or an inter-Party Government.  That is one principle on which we never differed fundamentally.  All Governments have been on one plane in that respect.</P>
    <P>We can divide now and by the division can be forced into the position that the people will be asked, not what they think about P.R. or about supporting a new system of government, <Col N="1976" /> but whether they are prepared, having carefully estimated the results that may ensue in the future, to vote to retain P.R., whether they want to continue a system that has given representation to all Parties and which has been fundamentally safe for the protection of the people, or swing to a new system that may create a situation the consequences of which even the Taoiseach cannot foresee.</P>

      <P>In speaking in favour of the amendment, I should like to mention a few points.  Deputy Mark Killilea last night asked us on this side of the House why we were afraid to let the people decide the issue concerning the abolition of proportional representation. I can assure Deputy Killilea that we are not afraid to let the people decide.  If the Taoiseach and Government Deputies had their ears to the ground, they would welcome the amendment put down by Deputy John A. Costello and Deputy Mulcahy.  They would welcome the amendment at this stage in view of the fact that the Bill was rejected by the Seanad because, I believe, public opinion is against the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
      <P>There was no public demand for the abolition of P.R.  We are assured by the Taoiseach that he was approached by several responsible bodies throughout the country prior to the last general election who stressed that proportional representation should be abolished.  It is a strange fact that the Fianna Fáil Party made no mention of that amongst their various promises during the 1957 election campaign.  I can assure the Government that the people are very disturbed by the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government introduced the Bill in the Autumn of last year and the Dáil and Seanad have spent practically full time for the last six to eight months debating it.  At the same time, the Government have made no mention of the questions of unemployment and emigration which they highlighted <Col N="1977" /> as points of policy during the last election campaign, and have done nothing to effect any improvement in regard to those problems.</P>
    <P>There is a very important series of points which I should like to bring to the notice of the House.  One is the fact that, prior to the enactment of the Constitution, P.R., in the mind of the Taoiseach, was something that it was essential to retain.  In 1937, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The system we have we know; the people know it... ...we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of proportional representation here.  It gives a certain amount of stability,... you have fair representation of Parties.</P>
    <P>He said that if you take the countries where P.R. exists you get better balanced results than in other countries; that we get the benefits of P.R. here in reasonably balanced legislation. That was the opinion of the Taoiseach in 1937, when he introduced his Constitution. P.R. has been in operation here since native government was established.  It has been mentioned that the people of other countries where the straight vote system is in operation have regretted the fact that they have not had the opportunities of voting under proportional representation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Government speakers have referred to the question of stability in relation to the straight vote, which they are anxious to introduce. It is interesting to know that the average life of Governments in England is two and a half years.  It is also two and a half years in this country but the two inter-Party Governments that were in power here each lasted for three years.  In England, during the same period there have been eight Prime Ministers and ten changes of Government.  In the same period in the Twenty-Six Counties we have had three different Prime Ministers or Taoisigh.  It is obvious, therefore, that there has been more stability brought about in this country under proportional representation than there has been in England under the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the debate on proportional representation, reference <Col N="1978" /> was made to the effects of proportional representation in France.  I understand that France did not have proportional representation except in 1945 and 1946.  It is a strange thing that Fianna Fáil speakers have not cited France as an example for the last few months. In my opinion whatever argument we may have against the type of Government that exists in the Six Counties it is really an argument in relation to the system that operates there.  The system that operates there is the straight vote.  At some time or another, speaking at by-election meetings or general election meetings outside the church gate, every Deputy has referred to the gerrymandering that has occurred in the Six Counties.  Now, that gerrymandering can only occur under the straight vote system.  If it is agreed, and I think it is agreed, that the voice of the plain people should be heard, then opportunities must be granted to minority groups to gain representation.</P>
    <P>There is a move on foot now to abolish proportional representation for Parliamentary purposes.  That is the forerunner to abolishing proportional representation for local authority purposes and that is the worst aspect of this whole situation.  In the area I represent in the Dublin Corporation we have a Residents' Association representative; we have a Ratepayers' Association representative; we have an Independent; we have a Fianna Fáil representative, and I represent Fine Gael.  That is the wish of the electorate in relation to representation in No. 1 area, Dublin City.  Do the Government intend to deny the Ratepayers' Association, the Residents' Association and the Independents in that area the right to have representation in the Dublin Corporation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been argued by various other speakers.  However, I shall not dwell on the point but, if proportional representation is done away with for Parliamentary purposes, we shall have the straight vote system introduced for local elections throughout the country.  That is quite obvious, even though it has not been specifically mentioned.</P>
      <P>We have had people of all shades of opinion, all shades of thought and different creeds speaking on this Bill. I wonder what world opinion will be if we do away with proportional representation in face of all the criticism over the last 30 or 40 years of the Unionist Government in Belfast?  We have boasted of the fact that here in the Twenty-Six Counties we afford the greatest opportunity that any community can have for gaining representation in this House.  We offer the Unionist element, and the other minority groups, proportional representation to afford them an opportunity of raising their voices in the Parliament of the nation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea said last night that Opposition speakers had made no case against this Bill.  That is an expression of opinion.  It is the opinion of Deputy Killilea.  If he is right the onus is, of course, on the Government to make a case for the abolition of proportional representation. That they have not done.  We have had proportional representation here for 37 years and, as I pointed out, we have had a more stable Government here than they have had in Britain where the straight vote system operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Killilea said that in 1927 Cumann na nGaedheal were dictators. Again, that is a matter of opinion. Again, if he is right, the question arises as to why they were dictators. They were dictators because the people now sitting on the opposite benches <Col N="1980" /> would not come into the Dáil and form a healthy Opposition.  But that opportunity was there for them because the system of proportional representation operates here.</P>
    <P>Several examples have been given of the ill-effects of the straight vote system.  I shall just give two to strengthen the case I make.  In the South African election under the British system&mdash;the straight vote&mdash;the Government Party got 598,685 votes; they got 92 seats.  The Opposition got 608,165 votes; they got 43 seats.  The Opposition had 10,000 more votes but they got 49 seats fewer.  They got 50 per cent. fewer seats though they polled 10,000 more votes.  That is a perfect example of how a minority can get control of Government.</P>
    <P>In the Carnarvon Borough constituency in Wales, the Conservative candidate got 11,400 votes; the Liberal candidate got 11,100 votes; the Labour candidate got 10,500 votes; the Welsh Nationalist got 1,600 votes.  The Conservative with 11,432 votes gained the seat.  There were 23,300 opponents; 23,300 people did not wish the Conservative candidate to get the seat.  Under the straight vote system he won it.</P>
    <P>There was evidence during the last few days of a fairly good cross-section of British opinion, and British opinion in this instance is worth considering because the straight vote system has been in operation there since general franchise was granted.  The leading article in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> issued what amounts to a warning to the people here.  We were advised to hold on to what we have and not to bother about the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I forecast another major Bill introduced in the Dáil.  The Taoiseach received his first major political reverse in 1948; it was then for the first time he became dissatisfied with proportional representation.  The first major reverse since he introduced this Bill last autumn was when it was rejected in the Seanad.  I suggest that because of its rejection in the Seanad, after the next general election, the Taoiseach, whoever he may then be, if he comes from the Fianna Fáil Party, will have not 11, but 22 on the cricket <Col N="1981" /> team to ensure that any Bill which goes from here to the Upper House will be passed.</P>

      <P>I want to avoid mere repetition so far as possible.  This whole question has been discussed for so long that the public, as a whole, is well aware of the position.  I came across a few of the most perfect demonstrations of the kind of difficulties we believe will occur in the future, when the leaders of both sides of the House retire, and when the old traditions which divide the two major Parties have been forgotten by a younger generation.</P>
      <P>This is an extract from the <i>Netherlands News</i> which is published by the Royal Netherlands Embassy at Hyde Park Gate, London.  This is the May, 1959 issue.  It was written without political objective, and certainly the author of it had no idea that it could serve any purpose in a discussion of P.R. in relation to the straight vote, in this, or in any other Parliament.  It is simply a factual description of the kind of thing that can happen under P.R. when, as I have said, time passes and the great division of opinion that exists between the two major Parties ceases to have the same influence.</P>
      <P>The article refers to the fact that Professor de Quay was appointed by Queen Juliana of Holland as Formateur to convene a Government which failed to make any progress and that the caretaker Government that had been formed in the meantime had ceased to exist.  He then goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Under Holland's electoral law of proportional representation, there are eight different parties in the new States-General, with the Catholic People's Party (49 members) and the Labour Party (48 members) in the lead.  The coalition between these two in the old Chamber&mdash;when Labour had 50 members and the Catholic People's Party had 49&mdash;was strong enough, in its aggregate total of 99, to outvote all the other parties if the need to do so had ever arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But as soon as the possibility of Labour going into opposition had to be faced, it became necessary for the Catholic People's Party to have not <Col N="1982" /> only one but practically all the smaller parties firmly on its side to be certain of an enduring working majority.  Basically, this need for coalition is nothing new.  Netherlands governments have been coalitions for ages.  The new fact in the situation is the split-up between the two leading parties, which automatically increases the importance of the smaller ones.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that only the three Communists in the new Lower Chamber share the Labour Party's socialistic aims (though, of course, going much further in this direction than Labour), it would be child's play to unite all the other parties into a combination against Labour or Labour plus Communists.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, a mere anti-socialist combination that is needed but a coalition which has to govern, and therefore has to have a programme accepted by all concerned for the next four years, at least on all principles and all main headings. In practice, this calls for a sort of survey of the policy points of all the different political groupings. Where, in a two-party country, the man entrusted with the formation of a Cabinet has not party aims to consider except his own, and to cast around for the most suitable men to carry out departmental duties, the Formateur of a Cabinet in Holland has to find out, in the first place, the different parties' precise aims.  Next, he has to work out a policy plan to be submitted to each party in turn. He may find acceptance or refusal, or discover that certain modifications are necessary to lead to eventual agreement.  This in itself is a lengthy process, entailing dozens of interviews with political leaders. The final stage, still beset with more than one difficulty, is to find representatives of the parties which have agreed to the proposed Government programme who are both willing and competent to accept the particular Cabinet posts intended for them. There may be situations in which a Party is willing to &ldquo;come in&rdquo; but is not satisfied with the particular Ministry offered to them; there may <Col N="1983" /> be competition for&mdash;or aversion against&mdash;one Ministry or another; there may be nine-tenth agreement, and discord on the last tenth.  There may, it will be seen, be any one of scores of difficulties, minor or major.</P>
    <P>That is why Professor de Quay's efforts have failed in the end.</P>
    <P>It is true that this country is different from the Netherlands, that conditions may be much different in the future, but this statement made with absolute sincerity, simply as a report in the official issue of a publication by the Netherlands Diplomatic Service and, therefore, intended to be absolutely impartial and not to advocate, in itself, the elimination of P.R. in Holland but simply to state the immense difficulties under which they had operated for a number of years in forming Governments, seems to me to have some importance in relation to this discussion.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I want to deal with just one or two aspects of questions which require specific answers. We hear constantly from the Opposition statements to the effect that we are advocating minority Governments, that we are advocating the position in which if a Party secures, shall we say, 45, 48 or 40 per cent. of the votes, if the proportion of the votes gained by the other Parties is greater than that, then the Government are taking office as a minority.</P>
    <P>We, in Fianna Fáil, want to make it absolutely clear to Deputies, and to the people, that we do not accept that conception of democracy.  We say very definitely that the smaller Parties which together form a majority of the people have opposing policies, and it is not right philosophically to add their votes together and say they constitute a majority.  It is absolutely right to say if these Parties choose to form a common programme upon which they are prepared to govern and if at all possible before the general election, and if then they gain together a total majority of the votes, they can elect a Taoiseach who, in turn, will elect the members of the Government from whatever persons he desires or in relation <Col N="1984" /> to the consents that he can get from the Parties.</P>
    <P>Taking a specific instance, if the Conservative Government in Great Britain at the moment had 48 per cent. of the votes, the Liberal Party 9 per cent., and the Labour Party the remainder, and if the Liberal Party on many occasions votes with the Conservatives, so long as the Liberal Party declares that its policy is different from that of the Labour Party, we in Fianna Fáil wish to make it clear that we do not call that minority Government on the part of the Conservative Party.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to state that there may be various philosophic analyses of the whole position but we claim, and we believe, that the duty of each elector is not only to elect his local representative to represent his area and to make sure that the problems of his area receive consideration, but it is also his duty to elect someone capable of either forming a Government or else of forming an alternative Opposition.  We feel that the prime duty of the elector is to elect a person capable of forming a Government and we refuse entirely to agree that if Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael should gain something less than 50 per cent. of the total vote, that the Opposition Parties, having different policies even though they have an increased number of votes, constitute the majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>You would deem them to be the minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that they would be deemed to be a minority if they combine on a policy, but we would regard the Party with 48 per cent. of the votes as having the majority of the votes enabling them to form a Government.  We do not accept that the minority Parties with different policies can add together their votes and then declare that they form a majority. We do not accept that idea in any way whatever.  We do not believe that it makes for the formation of good Government or that it is a good political principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In quite a number of countries where the straight vote system operates there are, for long periods, absolute, complete majorities on behalf of the Government in office.  In the case of <Col N="1985" /> Great Britain, where there are three Parties dividing the poll, there are periods when the majority Party gains all but a fraction of half the total vote. The position corrects itself from time to time.  The existence of the straight vote system cannot prevent a new Party, with new ideas which are sufficiently practical to interest a large proportion of the citizens, from gaining office and throwing out a Party with a long traditional record of holding office, as was the case with the Labour Party in Great Britain in 1945 when they overthrew the Conservative Government and, for the first time, secured an effective over-all majority under the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with another point raised in this debate.  A number of speakers of the Labour Party have foretold the disappearance of the Labour Party if the straight vote system operates.  I would say, knowing some of them, that they are being grossly over-pessimistic.  If the Labour Party can devise a policy at an election which can interest all the people who hold trade union cards, and their families and friends, and if they can prove to the large majority of the workers that they have a policy, and ways and means of assisting the workers' interests which are so much better than those of Fianna Fáil, they cannot be prevented from playing a very preponderant part in the life of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If any member of the Labour Party will get up and tell the House the total number of people holding trade union cards, and the number of their families and friends, he will find that what I have said is true.  The fact is that a great majority of the workers have voted for Fianna Fáil and some of them for Fine Gael because they feel that their interests have been protected and advanced through our social welfare legislation, through the establishment of the Labour Court, through protection of industry and through the many measures passed through this House since 1932.  There is nothing the Labour Party need fear if they can produce the candidates and prove to the workers that Fianna Fáil has grievously failed; if they can do that they can gain support, under the <Col N="1986" /> straight vote system, of the most massive kind.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to accept that challenge for the future and to defend our own position in regard to the protection and advancement of the interests of the workers.  If we fail in that the Labour Party should then, if they have the men, the ability and the policy, meet great success in the future.  I feel that Fianna Fáil have consistently stolen the thunder from the Labour Party and that it is for that reason that the Labour Party is in their present position in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to Deputy Rooney.  I think that of all the Fine Gael Deputies he has shown the greatest pessimism in trying to foretell the future of his Party should the straight vote system operate.  He quite clearly indicated that, should the straight vote system operate in the country after the election, it would be 20 years before the Fine Gael Party could overthrow the Fianna Fáil Government. Underlying the whole debate is the fear that, although the Taoiseach is retiring from public life, Fianna Fáil is going to be provided with some miraculous powers so that for 10 to 15 years from now, when there will be threequarters of a million new electors on the register and conditions will have completely changed, they will be so perfect and so skilled in political life that there will be no chance of their being defeated under the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>That does not happen in democracy. The world is changing very rapidly and I myself would feel that, however successful we may be in the operation of our plan for economic expansion, time will take its toll of any Party governing this country.  I say this to all the people who are being deluded by the craven-hearted speeches of Fine Gael.  It would be better for Fianna Fáil if we had a strong Opposition.  A Government thrives on the work of its opponents. We would much prefer to see an Opposition with verve and vitality and to have people in Fine Gael who will say that &ldquo;whether you change the system or not someone will throw you out sooner or later.&rdquo;  A Government <Col N="1987" /> lives on a strong and active Opposition. A Government prospers when there is a strong alternative policy and a strong Opposition facing it from the Opposition benches.  It is not good even for Fianna Fáil to have this kind of craven-hearted talk going around the country as though we could never be defeated, though for the past 30 years the same people, on the same benches, have been saying that Fianna Fáil have been preserved over and over again from total defeat because of the miraculous effect of the personality of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that some of the people who have been confused in the last few months over this talk of dictatorship are just beginning to wonder what it all means.  I suppose that part of the fear expressed that the change of voting involves perpetual government for Fianna Fáil, however much circumstances might change, is due to a lack of understanding about the sort of changes in policy that are likely to take place in future.  I want to repeat what I said on a previous occasion, that unless some very extreme Socialist Party starts in this country, it would seem to me that the policy changes in the future are likely to relate, not to the sort of dramatic questions that we used to have in the past when there was the conflict over the Treaty, when there was the conflict over the economic war, the conflict when Fianna Fáil started a State development programme of social services, housing and industry&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the conflict is likely to take the form of arguments over highly technical questions.  For example, the programme for economic expansion has been generally well received in all parts of the House, however much individual Deputies or Parties might like to give emphasis, to a greater or lesser degree, to one or other aspect of that programme and that being the case it would seem to me the political changes in the future are likely to be on highly technical matters, on matters relating to the expansion of our economy, the amount of investment <Col N="1988" /> by the State and private industry, the amount of investment by banks and commercial financiers.</P>
      <P>Marketing questions in relation to cattle, pigs, and other products are likely to form the principal issue and, unless we can foresee the arrival of a strong Socialist Party&mdash;which at the immediate moment seems unlikely&mdash;I do not believe that there will be any major changes of economic policy for the next ten years.  I think the arguments there are going to be close knit, and I think it is essential that the people should be given a chance of a form of election in which if a number of Parties join they will have to make compromises with one another, in advance of the election.  They will have decided what their joint policy shall be, in order that there will not be confusion through a Government being formed as a result of the conflicting strengths of individual leaders and individual personalities, the conflicting strengths of Parties representing one point of view as against another point of view, the conflicting strengths of Parties representing the sectional interest of one group of people as against the sectional interest of another group of people.</P>
      <P>It is because, as I said, the economic programme has received a large measure of general acceptance that I feel in the future our arguments here &mdash;unless there is a crisis, unless some extreme Party forms&mdash;are likely to be based on details of technicalities, on matters of investment, on allocations of taxation and that, therefore, it is all the more important to ensure the stability of government in this country, to ensure effective government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to repeat that we are not a country with large mineral resources, and with a world trade, established over centuries.  We are not a country with so large a measure of development per head of our population that we can afford to have serious financial crises, balance of payments difficulties, serious disruption of investment through the invasion of some new Party which, by its membership in a coalition Government, can create an extreme lack of confidence in the people who tend to invest in the country <Col N="1989" /> and in those outside.  I feel that almost the major consideration that we face in the immediate future is the fact that all of our people instinctively wish to have the sort of standard of living that is available in the sterling area, that our resources are far less than those in the sterling area and that if we are to succeed, we must, within that condition, absolutely ensure that our courses of production in both field and factory are kept at a competitive level.  I am very well aware, from meeting people who wish to establish industries here, that their principal guiding policy is always: &ldquo;Well, Ireland is a pleasant place to live in and you have not got the labour difficulties that are to be found in highly industrialised countries, but what are your costs?  How much is it going to cost us to export the product?&rdquo; Exactly the same holds good for our native industrialists whenever they seek an export market.  They have to count up the costs, and one of the principal costs is the absolute remoteness from many of their markets and the extra freights they have to pay.</P>
    <P>The same is absolutely true of the agricultural industry.  There are a great many farmers who are taking advantage of the combination of the N.F.A. plan and the Government's plan for the subsidies for fertilisers, but who, all the time, are making calculations in their minds as to what the competition is likely to be in the product they are to sell.  The difficulties we will experience, for example, in the growth of the pig industry, where competition is very tough, are a clear indication of the necessity for almost extreme financial stability.  I cannot see the kind of negotiation you have taking place in Holland, which is a country with a long tradition of independence, with a world-wide commerce and a shipping industry, taking place here without disruption.  They may be able to take Government crises in their stride when forming Governments, but I cannot see us doing that under our present circumstances and it is for that reason we on this side are recommending a system which will make sure, if there are minorities, that they shall, as far as possible, compose their differences&mdash;if they wish to form a <Col N="1990" /> Government&mdash;in advance of an election.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to deal with another point.  It has been suggested many times in the course of this debate that in countries where the straight vote operates, the minority viewpoint is not expressed in the Parliaments of those countries.  That is sheer and absolute nonsense.  You have only to read the debates of the House of Representatives in the United States of America to know that in the two principal Parties in that country, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, there are people pressing for almost every conceivable minority viewpoint, having that viewpoint debated in their committees, and pressed far forward.  They may ultimately have Party discipline which may, on occasion, prevent a particular expression, a particular point of view, from becoming implemented.  They may get half-way and see at least part of what they are advocating adopted by the Government, but no one could possibly say that in the United States, any more than in England, minority viewpoints are not expressed under the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>In the United States, you have the freest expression given in the United States Congress and the House of Representatives to Prohibition; free expression given for the advocacy of a far higher rate of tariff than is now prevalent in the United States.  You have people advocating isolationism&mdash; that it would be better for America to withdraw from world politics.  You have people advocating penal reform; you have people advocating greater rights and privileges for women; and you have people, on occasion and when it is deemed necessary, expressing a particular religious view in regard to a moral problem in which the Government are involved, to mention a few examples of minority viewpoints freely expressed and, not only expressed, but considered by the major Parties.  Exactly the same thing could be found in any country where the straight vote system operates and where in those countries it so happens that the Opposition and the Government are confined largely to the two <Col N="1991" /> main Parties.  We could not possibly foresee, in this country, what would be the final result of the straight vote system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be that there will always be two main Parties. It might happen, for example, that there might be a Party largely representing the urban interests and a Party largely representing the rural interests with the same sort of general economic point of view who, in advance of the election, will decide and will make clear to the public what they will do, if together they get a majority.  You might have the same result occurring with two or three such Parties representing different interests but making quite clear in advance to the electors, so that they know when the election comes, what the united policy is likely to be.  It might be that the result will bring about the perpetuation of two major Parties where there will be plenty of minority expression and where the minority point of view, the special point of view, the point of view relating to new, untried policies, will have full expression and if they are worthwhile they will sooner or later gain their way in the course of the years.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is impossible for us to predict what the ultimate future will be.  I wanted to make these points clear and in particular to make clear our view with regard to minorities, that we do not add together the votes of minority Parties who together might have a majority of the votes.  We consider that as these minority Parties have different policies, it is the Party with the largest number of votes having a common policy that should constitue the working majority for the purpose of forming a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Minister for Lands the challenge of this side of the House is that Fianna Fáil want a minority Government and if he were to talk for another hour he could not convince us that Fianna Fáil want anything else.  I have here a pamphlet published by the research <Col N="1992" /> group of An Tuairim and if the Minister for Lands looks at page 12 of that document he will see where it gives an honest case for and against P.R.  He will find on that page an example in which it says that if an election was held and if A got 34 per cent. of the votes, B got 33 per cent. of the votes and C got 33 per cent. of the votes, A would be elected although 66 per cent. of the voters in the constituency would be opposed to him.  It says that therefore if there was a three-cornered fight in every constituency it would be theoretically possible for a Party with 34 per cent. of the votes to win every seat in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands stands up here today and says that Fianna Fáil does not want minority government. Surely if they succeed in abolishing proportional representation, they are looking for a minority government? They want minority government because they know very well they would have no business going before the people again under the system of P.R. in the hope of coming back here again as a majority Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have said so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have said so, and when the Minister for Lands stands up and asks: &ldquo;Oh, why do the Opposition not join together and have a policy?&rdquo; we may well ask what policy did Fianna Fáil put before the country in the last general election? What did they tell the people they would do?  For instance, what about the 100,000 jobs that the Tánaiste was to produce?  Where are they?  That was part of their policy&mdash;100,000 extra jobs.  They are in office now for over two years and, instead of providing extra jobs, over 50,000 people are rushing out of the country every year and there are as many unemployed as there were two years ago.  They have not provided one of those 100,000 jobs mentioned in their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister for Lands to say that there should be a united policy between Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Labour and all the other Parties.  Where is Fianna Fáil's policy?  How much of the <Col N="1993" /> policy which they promised the people at the last general election has been carried out in the last two years? Absolutely none of it.  Instead they have taken up the time of this House, time which could have been more usefully devoted to considering certain economic problems which confront us, with a proposal to change the electoral system so that they will have a chance to come back here as a minority Government.  It is their only hope.  The Minister says that they want vigour from the Opposition.  He says that the Opposition are not vigorous enough to help the Government. God knows someone would want to help the present Government. However, they are trying to help themselves by trying to force a Bill&mdash;&ldquo;rush&rdquo; is the word&mdash;through the House in order to get back as a minority Government, as they know that they would never get back with anything like the majority they got in the last general election because of the promises they made.</P>
    <P>They promised that unemployment would be reduced and they promised that emigration would be reduced. They promised £250 million for national development.  All that was damn nonsense and nothing else; they deceived the people in the way in which they got that majority.  Again, the Minister for Lands spoke about the curse of coalitions and the Taoiseach, or I suppose the ex-Taoiseach in a few days, also spoke in the same vein.  Are the people not entitled to vote for any Party, or any group, or any individual they like without any dictation from Fianna Fáil, from the Taoiseach or from the Minister for Lands?  Why should they have any dictation from anyone?</P>
    <P>In 1948 the Coalition Government came into office and in the following general election they were turned out, not by the voice of the majority of the people but by the voices of a few Deputies elected as their supporters. Then they turned over and gave their support to Fianna Fáil.  They were great people when they did that. Deputy Dr. Browne, now an Independent in this House, was the greatest man that ever lived when he did that <Col N="1994" /> but when they began to realise his position with Fianna Fáil it was a different matter.  If you are with Fianna Fáil and agree with Fianna Fáil and say that everything that they say and do is right, you are the grandest fellow in the world but once you disagree with them one iota you are as black as the ace of spades and not fit for society.  They believe that there is not a Deputy entitled to sit here unless he is a Fianna Fáil supporter. That is their view and that is what they are aiming at.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach to say, when he is winding up this debate, why he wants the single non-transferable vote to operate in only one type of election&mdash;in elections to Dáil Éireann.  Why does he not have it for the Presidential Election?  The transferable vote operates for the Presidential Elections and for local government elections.  Why is it that it is wanted so badly only for elections to the Dáil?  One reason is that by means of this non-transferable vote they expect to get the minority Government the Minister for Lands is trying to tell us they do not require.</P>
    <P>The guiding light of the 1937 Constitution, according to the Taoiseach, was P.R., in that any Party could go forward and people could elect whom they wished.  Now in 1959 we are seeking to extinguish that guiding light, to wipe out small Parties.  One time they say that is their intention and another time it is not.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Killilea here last night.  As in the case of the Minister for Lands, one would know his heart was not in it.  One knows when people are speaking against their will.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies know this is their death-knell and that they will never come back to this House.  Deputy Killilea reminded me of a child passing a graveyard whistling to keep up his spirits.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies and Fianna Fáil supporters throughout the country will not vote for the abolition of P.R. when the time comes because it does not suit them to do so. It was never the programme of Fianna Fáil but the wish of one man and one man only who is about to depart.  May I pay him this compliment: by going <Col N="1995" /> he is doing the first good turn he has ever done for the country?  In order to confuse matters the old warrior is throwing himself into the scales on the same day as the Presidential Election is being held so that as well as voting for the Taoiseach for President the people will also be inveigled into voting to abolish P.R.  In answer to a Question in the House he said the two would not be held on the same day. The following day he said here they would be held on the same day.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the time of this House has been taken up on this question.  When the Bill went to the Seanad and was rejected I thought the first thing we would have would be a motion to abolish the Seanad.  However, I suppose there will eventually be a change so that the Taoiseach will be able to nominate 22 Senators instead of 11 to make sure he will have a majority.  We all know about the six Professors who wrote a letter to the paper expressing their views as to the danger of abolishing P.R.  Of course they do not count.  It is &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; Corry and &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; Killilea who count.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Minister for Lands, since he is here, that there is a great deal of unrest in the country in relation to the policy which they were supposed to put before the people and which they said the other Parties should have.  However, Fianna Fáil did not produce the 100,000 jobs and they abolished the food subsidies they were not to abolish.  There is quite an amount of unrest in the country even in relation to the Minister's own Department.  People are taking the law into their own hands on account of the Minister's lackadaisical attitude in his Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister will get a shock pretty soon.  Something would want to be done quickly.  This is a very reasonable amendment in the names of Deputies Costello and Mulcahy.  It merely asks that a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad should be appointed to examine this question and report back not later than the 29th August next.  That is not a long period.  Even at the last moment may I appeal to the Taoiseach to accept that very reasonable amendment?</P>
      <P>The Government is rushing this legislation through.  Deputy Killilea said some people were afraid.  I never heard a speech from Deputy Killilea in which somebody was not afraid of something.  I know who is afraid; it is Deputy Killilea who is very much afraid.  He would not have spoken in the House were he not compelled to do so.  There was no great rush about this measure.  We have had P.R. for 40 years and it has worked very well.  It is unreasonable to rush to the people and ask them to decide this question and the other issue on the same day so that the decision will be in favour of Fianna Fáil.  I would ask the Taoiseach to accept the amendment so that this debate can conclude very soon.</P>
      <P>In order to prove further how wrong the proposed system is I should like to refer to this pamphlet of the Tuairim Research Group.  At page 16 it says in relation to England:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In 1945 the Labour Party got 48 per cent. of the votes; yet it won two-thirds of the seats and the result was a major landslide in favour of the Labour Party.  In 1951, following a general election, the Labour Party increased its total vote to 48½ per cent., but lost the election to the Conservatives who obtained a smaller share of the poll than Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a condemnation of the single non-transferable vote, it is that.  We need not go to Tasmania, where the Minister for Health went, according to <Col N="1997" /> to-day's paper.  In the 1945 general election in England, the Labour Party polled 48 per cent. of the total vote cast and won two-thirds of the seats.  At the following general election, they polled 48½ per cent.&mdash;they increased their total vote by another half per cent.&mdash;and yet they lost the Government to the Conservatives. That is the greatest condemnation of the single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>This is merely a gerrymandering job by Fianna Fáil and by the Taoiseach before he leaves this House.  They intend to go before the country and gull the people into voting for the Taoiseach and for the abolition of P.R. That is their game, but, in my opinion, it is the worst thing that ever happened this country.  At present the voter is entitled to give first, second, third or fourth preference, as the case may be, to any candidate to whom he wishes to give it.  I hope he will not throw away that right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have spoken in this House on this Bill. I have been trying to think of something to say that has not been said so far, and I can assure the House I am up against an impossibility.  From all sides of the House, views have been put for and against.  It is a pity the situation ever came about in which there was a necessity to have this discussion, over the past six months almost, on a matter that should never have arisen. During the past 40 years, we have been voting under a certain system.  It was first introduced in Sligo in 1919.  I heard the Minister for External Affairs state shortly after the introduction of the Bill that P.R. was imposed on this country by the British Government.  It was not.  The only system of election imposed on this country by the British Government is the one that Fianna Fáil wish to go back to, the single non-transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that all the libraries in Europe were ransacked to find out the situation in different countries, but it is easy to find out the reason why P.R. was introduced.  For some years prior to 1919, the Corporation of Sligo had failed to carry out its duties and the finances of that corporation were <Col N="1998" /> in a state of chaos.  There was only one Party represented on the corporation and they failed to enjoy the confidence of those who elected them.  A ratepayers' association was set up to see what could be done to bring about a situation by which the business of that corporate city would be carried out.  They tried several means.  They studied as far back as 1911, when the late Arthur Griffith advocated the system of election under P.R.  They also studied the recommendations made by the Proportional Representation Society of England.  They consulted the then secretary of that association and they asked their then Member of Parliament, a Mr. Scanlon, to introduce a Bill into the British House of Commons by which the members of that corporation would be elected under the P.R. system.  The Bill went through and the election was carried out under that system.  An English official came over to help them and to show them how the system should be carried out, the votes transferred, and so on.</P>
    <P>They elected a corporation that enjoyed the confidence of the people of Sligo for years afterwards and ever since.  In fact, so much so, that other municipal bodies asked that that system be introduced throughout the country.  It was incorporated in the Constitution of 1922 and in the Consitution of 1937.  The statement of the Taoiseach on that latter occasion has been quoted often in this House during this debate in which he praised the system and went so far as to thank God that the people of this country had such a system by which all sections of the community would be properly represented.</P>
    <P>If we go back to 1927, when Mr. Cosgrave was President of the Executive Council and when Fianna Fáil had not yet entered this House, we see that if Mr. Cosgrave had introduced a Bill to abolish P.R. in the 1922 Constitution, Fianna Fáil would not have entered the House at that stage and perhaps never since; but like the statesman he is, he did not do it because he was anxious that all sections of the Irish people should be properly represented in this House and because <Col N="1999" /> he favoured the entrance of Fianna Fáil, and so they came in.</P>
    <P>I do not see what objection the Taoiseach and the Government have to P.R.  During the past 40 years, did anybody ever hear any organisation or individual of any kind, at any Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Árd Fheis or at any trade union congress, raise any objection to P.R., until the Taoiseach got his brain-wave in September last and announced that a Bill would be introduced for its abolition?  It does not matter if Fianna Fáil say that its abolition is required for stable government. The people of this country are very wise.  They can judge for themselves. I am perfectly assured that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party recognise, too, that P.R. has worked well in this country as it has worked well in the various European countries that have been among the most prosperous not only in Europe but in the world&mdash;in small countries like our own such as Norway, Sweden, Belgium and Holland.  While their system may not be exactly the same as ours, nevertheless, their Governments are elected under P.R.</P>
    <P>Our electoral system was changed by the Taoiseach when he reduced the number of seats per constituency&mdash;the majority to three seats.  I am sure he did that, too, thinking at that time it would serve his Party.  We all know that.  We opposed it.  It did not have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may now think that, by abolishing P.R. before he leaves the political arena and introducing the single-seat constituency with the non-transferable vote, his Party will be in power at least during the period he expects to be at Arus an Uachtaráin so that he may still exercise the power he has exercised over his Party since, shall we say, 1927, when he entered this House.  I assure the House that the people of this country are very wise.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Killilea stated that we are a frightened people and a frightened Party.  We are anything but that.  I, for one, am not frightened of what will occur, nor did I hear any member of my Party or of any Party <Col N="2000" /> on the Opposition benches indicate they were feeling frightened even if P.R. is abolished.  The new system might act and probably will act as a boomerang on the Government who introduced it.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Carew said that the best way to settle this matter would be to have a general election.  I noticed that some members of the Government benches looked a bit scared at that suggestion.  Deputy Killilea said that Fine Gael are out of touch with rural Ireland.  If any Party is in touch with rural Ireland, it is Fine Gael.  I can foresee the time when it can be said with truth, even as it can be said now, that the Fianna Fáil Ministers and leaders all have urban ideas.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a good example.  He never bothers about agriculture.  All he is interested in is the advancement of industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go any further. I am referring to what Deputy Killilea said, namely, that we are out of touch with rural Ireland.  The Fine Gael Party always helped agriculture in this country.  We hold that it is the mainstay and the foundation of anything that makes the State prosperous.</P>
      <P>The lecture by the Minister for Lands was most interesting, really. Somehow, it seemed as if he were lecturing the members of the Opposition and perhaps the people of the country as a whole on how they should form Parties.  We have nothing to do with the formation of Parties.  The people will decide that.  It is their right to do it.  There is no compulsion on candidates from the various Parties, prior to a general election, to come together to form a common policy.  It is quite right that afterwards, if the combined Opposition Parties have a majority over Fianna Fáil, they would if they could agree on a common policy, form a Government because it is the business of the people to elect members to Dáil Éireann and that a Government be formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the greatest and most successful Governments of the various countries of Europe and outside it have <Col N="2001" /> been coalition or inter-Party Governments. Whenever a serious emergency arises in any country, that is likely to happen.  Suppose a war is declared in which Britain is involved.  Do all the Parties not join together there, or at least as many as possible?  The reason for that is that it has been regarded as the best means by which they can carry on the struggle and maintain the economic condition of the country.</P>
    <P>My experience of the two inter-Party Governments was that when the different Parties met and when various important matters were being discussed, there was a certain amount of compromise, just as there is within a Party itself, just as there is within the Fianna Fáil Party when they meet. Have they not all different views? Surely they are not all &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men? They put forward their views and come to a decision.  The only thing is that the people feel somehow that the Taoiseach rules the Party in a dictatorial manner.  I do not know whether or not that is correct.  The impression is abroad, anyhow.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is regarded as responsible for the introduction of this Bill for the abolition of P.R. to ensure, as he thinks, that his Party will be in power for a number of years when he relinquishes the leadership.  He may be right and he may be wrong.  Nobody in this country believes, and neither do members of the Fianna Fáil Party believe, that this Bill is introduced and hoped to be put into operation for the welfare of the country&mdash;in order to bring about stable government.  It is simply brought in, as the people know and as we have said from this side of the House and as I really believe, in order that, during the lifetime of the Taoiseach, when he expects to be President of the State, he will have his Party in office in this House so that he can still use his influence in connection with government because he is supposed to be a man who can never lose power during his lifetime.  That is what people think; that is what we all think here.  It is a perfectly honest view, whether it is right or not.</P>
    <P>Nobody can hold that a system of election which has been so successful for the past 40 years in this country, <Col N="2002" /> and under which there has been no case of instability of government, can be said to be faulty and that a change should be brought about now.  Nobody asked for the change.  Deputy Booth stated that it was not necessary or correct that any organisation or that the people should express a view that a change should be brought about, as it was the duty of the Government in office to introduce any Bill which they consider is for the benefit of the country and get it enacted.  That is a rather peculiar view.  It is a kind of dictatorship.  Any Party will try to carry out the views of the people who support them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach called this a straightforward vote.  There is probably something underlying that.  Innocent people would think that this is a straightforward vote, not the straight vote, so, of course, they would say that the Taoiseach is right, that he is always straight.  That is what his followers would say.  They would think that now he is doing something straightforward. The Taoiseach will not refer to it as introducing the English system of voting or the Northern Ireland method of voting.  That is really what it is.  If Deputies carry their minds back to the time when P.R. was abolished in Northern Ireland, they will remember that the Taoiseach was loudest in protest against it, and rightly so, and that all the people in Southern Ireland were astonished and disgusted at the abolition of P.R. in Northern Ireland. I need not tell Deputies what has happened there since then, where one Party is in power and will be in power.</P>
    <P>It was really too bad that the Taoiseach, at this time of his life, when he was inclined to move out of the political arena, should do anything like this, that is likely to cause serious trouble in the country in the future. If minorities are not represented in the House, where are they to go?  In a troubled world, when, in this country, there are people of extreme views and when they have no right of representation in this House, there is a likelihood and danger that they will go underground and create serious trouble for the Governments of the future.  Anything that would bring about such a <Col N="2003" /> situation, that would create unrest, is wrong.</P>
    <P>The people were quite satisfied with the system of election that has prevailed here for the past 40 years.  They have not asked for a change.  They were used to the system.  Now they are being asked to change it.  It appears to be ridiculous that on 17th June next the Taoiseach will have brought about the situation that, when the elector enters the polling booth, he will be handed two ballot papers, one for the election of President, the other for the referendum.  The President is elected under proportional representation.  On the other ballot paper, the elector is asked to accept or reject proportional representation. It is a most peculiar situation.  I believe that the two elections are being held on the same day deliberately to fool the people.  As Deputies know, there are some electors, especially in rural areas, who are more or less illiterate, although there are not many of them now.  Deputies know how such people can get confused.  In the case of the Presidential election, they have to put the figure 1 before the name of either General MacEoin or Mr. de Valera and in the case of the referendum, they must mark the ballot paper with an X.  Does it not seem rather cruel to ask people to vote under such confusing circumstances?</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, have asked for the appointment of a commission to examine this matter.  We do not mind whether the commission is comprised of members of the Dáil or Seanad or other experienced men. Such a commission could get all the information available on the various systems of election in other countries. Then the question could be considered as to whether the findings were acceptable or not.  Whenever any peculiar position arose, a commission has been set up.  There has been a Commission on Television.  There have been many other commissions during the lifetime of this Government.  There was a Commission on Vocational Education and on various other matters.  Why not have a commission in this case? Then the question could be put to the <Col N="2004" /> people.  Perhaps there would be a better system than either P.R. or the single seat constituency and the non-transferable vote.  Dáil Éireann could decide which system they would recommend to the people.  In that way, a great deal of trouble would be saved.  It would save long discussion in the House and Deputies could be doing something better for their constituencies and the Government could be dealing with the many problems they have to solve and to which I shall not refer now.</P>
    <P>It would be, perhaps, one of the greatest things in his life if the Taoiseach would accept the amendment, even at this late hour, or withdraw the Bill and let the system to which we have been accustomed be carried on until such time as a demand for a change came from the majority of the people, on the ground that the system of proportional representation had failed.  I do not think the system has failed.  It is a perfect system, giving rights to various minorities to be represented in this Parliament.  It is a system which prevents unrest and perhaps revolution in the country.  I am sure that, in the winter of his years, the Taoiseach would not wish anything like that to happen.  I hope that at this late hour he will do the right thing for the welfare of the people.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, as passed by Dáil Éireann be deemed to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, to which, of course, an amendment has been moved.  The House should not have much difficulty in approving the motion in face of the fact that the Bill was passed through all its Stages by a big majority of this House after long debate.  Then it went to the Seanad which, on Second Reading, passed and agreed to the general principles of the Bill, including, of course, the submission of the referendum to the people on the question of the straight vote.  After many speeches and arguments, not a vote was changed simple or professorial, obvious or abstruse, but, by an accident of illness, two members being unable to attend, the Seanad failed in their final vote <Col N="2005" /> to stand by their previous decision, even though the balancing vote was available, but, being in the Chair, was inoperative.</P>
      <P>Does the country feel that such a situation is sufficient as a basis for any act of legislation?  I do not think that even members of the Opposition would suggest that it is sufficient sanction for any major proposal.  Surely this Dáil, as the more representative, directly elected, Chamber, must have regard to the over-all picture of the two Houses in their decision.  Certain elements in the Seanad were not pleased and a few professors, academically skilled but quite inexperienced in constitutional law and in political life, sought to lead the country in its decision.</P>

      <P>As I stated, all that is not a very impressive consideration for the basis of legislation.  Is it not strange that the Opposition should challenge us here that during the last election no official reference was made by what is now the Government Party to their intention with regard to this referendum?  The Government Party had, first of all, to get a majority sufficient to enable them to enact legislation. There was no intention then, as there has been no intention at any time, of passing legislation here without submitting the issue at stake directly to the people.  Is the opposition to our programme and policy that we should not submit this matter to the people?  Having taken a decision and knowing in the light of our Constitution that this course was necessary, where was the need for making any previous reference to it in the course of the general election?</P>

      <P>We have been told by Opposition speakers that proportional representation gives to the Unionist minority in this part of the country the chance to be represented in this House.  But how small a chance! It gave the chance in theory, but not in practice.  Unless a whole province were made a constituency unit, there would be no chance whatever of having that pious hope implemented.</P>
      <P>Many comparisons have been made in relation to election results.  When the people set out to elect representatives to this House, they seek to elect at the same time an organised body with sufficient strength to implement policy. On one occasion here, 68 members were elected for one Party, Fianna Fáil; 31 was the next highest figure; and there were four or five smaller Parties.  Behind the scenes, a Government was formed from the 31&mdash;less than half the major Party&mdash;and a number of smaller Parties.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said the people in England unite in time of war.  During the last emergency here, Fine Gael were not able to keep the leaders of their Party together; they had to expel one of them.</P>
      <P>We have been accused of rushing this matter.  The complaint now is that the two issues will have to be decided on the one day.  That is inevitable because of the delaying tactics indulged in by the Opposition during this debate.</P>

      <P>Several spokesmen from this side of the House have commented on the fact that since this debate began a great number of arguments have been put forward by Government supporters.  They have commented on the fact that these arguments have appeared for the first time in very recent months.  There is great validity in that point for many reasons.  It is extremely significant that the many arguments we have heard here over the past few months were not voiced by any of the Government spokesmen before these proposals came before the Dáil or, perhaps, earlier when they came before the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  Up to that time, not one member of the Government Party who is now supporting this measure, to my knowledge, spoke on the question of P.R.&mdash;with one exception. None of the members of the Government Party who have now adduced many arguments against P.R., and are in favour of the proposal to change to the system which they now wish adopted, put forward suggestions concerning these matters before last autumn&mdash;again with one exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely significant that all these arguments have been thought up <i>post hoc</i>, and that Government spokesmen have now thought up many reasons why P.R. is not a good system, and why the proposed change is for the good of this country, but that before last autumn nobody spoke on these matters&mdash;with one exception. That one exception, as we all know, is the Taoiseach.  Time and time again in the course of this debate, reference has been made to the remarks which the Taoiseach made concerning P.R. <Col N="2009" /> Whereas the Taoiseach suggested in 1937 when the Constitution was going through this House that he thought it was a system that worked well, and said he was in favour of it, it must be conceded that he had his doubts.</P>
    <P>No other member, though, of the Government Party, none of the spokesmen who have taken part in this debate since last autumn, once suggested that they had any doubts about the system of P.R.  I have listened to debates here, and I have read the speeches in so far as I was able, of many speakers on the Government side.  So far as I am aware, with the one exception I have made, this is the first time they have criticised the system of P.R. which was adopted in this country in 1922 and 1937.</P>
    <P>The significance of this is that these arguments have been thought up by Government spokesmen after the decision was taken by the leader of the Government.  I do not accept the view, which is being canvassed in certain circles, that this decision was imposed on the Taoiseach by his back-benchers. If that were so, we would have heard them complain about the system of P.R. before autumn of last year&mdash;and we would have heard Government Party speakers indicating their opposition to P.R. before last autumn.  Instead there was silence on the issue, and the spokesmen who have spoken in this debate, with that one exception, are able to point to no speech they made prior to autumn of last year denigrating, in any way, the system of P.R.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable conclusion that the decision which is now being put through the House, by the majority votes of the Fianna Fáil Party, was taken at the instance of the Taoiseach. Many arguments have been adduced since then to justify that decision.  We have listened for many days to debates, arguments and theories showing that P.R. is not a good system, and to arguments and theories showing that what is called the straight vote is a better system.</P>
    <P>It is clear now, at the end of these many months of discussion, that, in fact, there is really only one argument on which this proposed change is <Col N="2010" /> based, that there is only one argument which really motivated the Taoiseach's decision in this regard, that is, the dislike of the Taoiseach, and his colleagues now, of coalition government. It has been argued that P.R. leads to instability of government; we have heard it suggested that it was imposed on us by the British; we have heard it suggested that it led to dictatorship in Italy and Germany, for example; and we have heard the argument that it does not, in fact, lead to a good type of candidate and that the other system leads to better representation in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>All these are arguments, I submit, that have been considered <i>post hoc.</i> All these are arguments that have been thought out to bolster up a case which depends completely on one argument only, namely, that P.R. leads to coalition government.  I want this to be faced.  I think it does; I think P.R. leads, as a likely consequence, to coalition government.  I want to examine the argument that has been made by the spokesman of the Government Party, that that is a reason why it should be condemned. I do not think the Government Party have made the position very clear with regard to their condemnation of coalition government.  I should like to hear, before this debate concludes, on what basis they place that opposition. Is it based on opposition to coalition government in theory, or is it based on opposition to coalition governments that have held office in this country? If it is based on opposition to coalition governments generally, I find it hard to see how such arguments can be substantiated without involving criticism of many other countries who have adopted coalition government, apparently to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The situation, as we all know, is that P.R. is the system of election which every democratic European country, with the exception of the United Kingdom, has now and has had for a great number of years.  Is the criticism of the Government against coalition government based on the fact that coalition governments are bad in themselves and if so, that all those Governments in foreign countries are bad?  I do not think <Col N="2011" /> any such argument could be seriously put forward.  Is it suggested, for example, to the Austrians, the Dutch, the Danes, the Swedes or the Germans, for that matter, that it is bad for them to have coalition government? Those countries which have had and have at present coalition forms of government have been able to govern themselves very well and very successfully and the system of P.R. which they have adopted has suited them and their needs and apparently has suited their political set-up in that nobody has suggested it should be abolished.</P>
    <P>If, in fact, the Government's opposition is not to coalition governments in theory, then&mdash;and I think this is the real basis of their opposition&mdash;what the Government object to is coalition government in Ireland.  The Taoiseach is on record as having said he hated this form of government.  We have heard spokesmen very many times from the Government benches criticising coalition government in Ireland, and I think that the basis of the Government's opposition to P.R. is very clearly that they dislike coalition government in Ireland.</P>
    <P>What I want to suggest is that the Government spokesmen who are approaching this very serious matter from that angle should now approach it in an unprejudiced and unbiassed fashion.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that when we come to discuss Irish affairs, and the merits and demerits of coalition Governments, the judgment of each of us is coloured by our experiences and by our own Party associations.  I do not expect for one moment any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to applaud the coalition form of government.  I do not expect them to suggest that coalition governments are good for this country. Equally I would suggest that they could not expect a member of this side of the House to denigrate the work of the inter-Party Governments.</P>
    <P>It is my own firm conviction that the inter-Party Governments did a considerable amount of good work in assisting the people of this country to achieve better living standards, but I <Col N="2012" /> am fully aware that members of this House on the opposite side do not share that view.  They are, in fact, now proposing a very drastic and radical change in our Constitution based on a decision which is coloured by political considerations.  The Government have decided, because of their dislike of coalitions, because they realise that proportional representation is likely to lead to future coalition Governments, to abolish proportional representation, and I am suggesting for the consideration of this House that that decision is not an unbiassed or an unprejudiced one.</P>
    <P>It has been taken as a result of their experience of being defeated by two coalition Governments.  It has been taken as a result of their experience in fighting elections with different political Parties opposed to them and for that reason they cannot be expected to arrive at an unbiassed and unprejudiced decision.  It seems to me that such an important and radical change of the Constitution should not be based, as it must be based, on their political prejudices and their natural bias-against two forms of two Governments which defeated them in recent elections.</P>
    <P>For this reason I would have thought that the suggestion made early in this year, when this matter was originally discussed and which is again made in the motion now before the House for an independent commission to consider the matter, would be something that could be regarded as reasonable.  I do think that an independent commission would come to the conclusion that it would be far better for the country to maintain proportional representation. Whether that is true or not and whether or not such a commission would arrive at such a conclusion it seems to me that, if the Government are <i>bona fide</i> in this matter and if they do not approach the problem from a prejudiced position, this motion would be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced that they are right.  I accept that a number of the Government's spokesmen believe that what they are doing is right. I accept that they are sincere but sincerity is not enough.  Whatever the <Col N="2013" /> position, the Government have made up their minds in this matter.  They may have arrived at a sincere conclusion, from their point of view, but notwithstanding that, they have arrived at such a conclusion because they are naturally prejudiced against coalition Governments.  I have said that that is the real reason why the Government are bringing in those proposals.  I have no doubt that the real reason is the Government's dislike of coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>All the other arguments put forward are so weak and feeble that they could not possibly provide the ground on which the Government have decided to bring about such a radical alteration in our affairs.  It has been mentioned, for example, by the Minister for External Affairs, that proportional representation brought about dictatorship in Italy and Germany and it was intimated that this might happen in this country.  I do not know if any person seriously believes that nor do I know how they could reconcile such a belief with the fact that proportional representation was put into the Constitution of 1937 in the heyday of Mussolini and Hitler.  If it was thought then that proportional representation would lead to dictatorship, it was a very poor thing to insert it in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that proportional representation leads to instability of government.  The facts do not prove that.  The facts prove that we have had fewer Prime Ministers than there have been in England in the last 37 years and that we have had fewer Parliaments than they have had in England in that period.  The argument that proportional representation has been imposed on us by Britain is ridiculous and does not stand up to argument but the fact that that argument was used is an indication of how weak the Government felt their position to be.</P>
    <P>I have said that this matter involves a very radical change in our Constitution. Is there any Deputy who will deny that?  Is there any Deputy on the Government benches who will deny that the proposals involve a very radical change in our system of election <Col N="2014" /> and that it is likely to change the whole political set-up in this country? For that reason I feel that as far as we are able, from experience of other countries which have had this system of the single-member constituency, it is desirable before making this decision, which we are now called upon to make, to appreciate what is likely to happen if this motion is carried.</P>
    <P>Figures have been quoted in this House, figures which have not been denied, which show that the single-member constituency system which operates in England can lead to minority Governments, Governments elected by a minority vote of the people.  The figures for England which have been given in this House show that in recent years the Labour Party have been elected as a Government with a minority of votes but with a substantial majority of the seats in Parliament.  The same is true of the Conservative Party.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking examples of what is likely to happen may be seen in the recent elections in South Africa.  In 1953 the Nationalist Party got 49.6 per cent of the votes and 92 seats.  The Opposition Party got 50 per cent of the votes and ended up with 43 seats.  The fact that these types of electoral results can occur, and have occurred in other countries, is a clear indication of one of the grave dangers that we have said should be anticipated, namely, that these proposals can lead, and have led in other countries, to minority Governments. In addition, of course, it is also clear from other countries that this proposed system leads to violent fluctuations in the manner in which the Parties are elected from one Parliament to another, and that the proportional representation system which has been operated in other countries minimises these violent electoral swings.</P>
    <P>These are arguments we have put forward and we have been able to back them up by quotations and figures from other countries.  They have not been answered and yet it does seem to me to be one of the dangers that we have to take into account, in deciding whether to adopt this system or not. <Col N="2015" /> It is quite possible, if this proposal is adopted by the people, that a two-Party system, such as has been recommended by the Taoiseach, and by some of the Ministers who have spoken on this matter, may develop here.  It is also quite possible that it might not develop in this country for a great number of years, that is, the two-Party system which has developed in England, which has developed in the United States, and, to some extent, in South Africa.</P>

      <P>If the two-Party system does not develop within a very short time, if this proposal is adopted by the people, I think the likely consequences for this country are very grave indeed.  I think the likely consequences are also appreciated by the Government Party because, if, in fact, the new system is in operation at the next general election, or the one after, and there are not just two candidates but three or four candidates contesting a one-seat constituency, who is <Col N="2018" /> likely to gain by such a situation but the Fianna Fáil Party?  It seems to me that unless there are formed either electoral pacts of one sort or another, or a new Opposition Party of some sort or another, the Government are likely to be the gainers.  Looking into the future with regard to these matters, it seems to me that one of the distinct possibilities in this proposed change&mdash; if it is accepted&mdash;is that we shall have a number of Parliaments in this House with a very strong Government Party in office and with a very small Party or Parties in opposition.</P>
      <P>These things have developed in other countries, and we have seen what happens in other countries when parliaments are not representative of the people.  We have seen what happens when parliaments are dominated by one Party, where the Opposition is a truncated one and enfeebled by electoral defects.  I do not think I exaggerate when I say one of the possibilities of this change, if it is adopted by the people, will be a grave weakening of our whole system of parliamentary democracy.  One further likely danger is that there may be violent swings if such a system is operated here, swings which will give representation to people unsuited to government, unqualified to govern, with ideas that are ill-thought out, swings which will result in a very dangerous situation developing here.</P>
      <P>I think that the dangers which we anticipate are real.  It is possible that they may not be realised; it is possible our apprehensions may prove false, but I do not think it is worth while taking the chance that that may be so.  I do not think it is worth while taking the chance that what has happened in other countries may not happen here and, in consequence, I do not think this decision, brought about from a political judgment on the part of the Government, is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Government have made this proposal for the abolition of proportional representation because of their dislike of the coalition Governments which have been formed in this country.  They are taking what has been described as a leap in the dark, which is fraught with danger for the <Col N="2019" /> country and for our whole system of parliamentary democracy.  I believe they are taking this leap in the dark for unjustifiable and unjustified reasons and I feel, as I said at the outset, that we are justified in saying that this was not a decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>This was not a decision which was imposed on the Taoiseach by the back-benchers of his Party.  It was a decision taken by the leader of the Government in the knowledge that he would shortly be leaving active Irish politics.  I am satisfied that the Taoiseach, in that regard, thinks he is actting correctly, but I believe he is wrong. No man should take upon himself the responsibility of doing what the Taoiseach is proposing to do, and I think he is wrong in getting his own Party to agree to amend the Constitution in this manner, in view of the very grave difficulties which are to be anticipated.</P>
    <P>Government spokesmen have chided us about being afraid of the people. We are afraid of the people if they are not told exactly what is involved. Unfortunately, we on this side of the House have not got the weapons which are available to the Government Party in their daily newspapers, and in their Sunday paper.  It is our task, as parliamentarians working an Irish democracy through this Parliament, to inform the people of what is involved in these proposals, and that is what we have been endeavouring to do.  If, in fact, the people decide against this proposal, as I am hopeful they will on June 17th, it will not be because the Parties on this side of the House have been trying to do something undemocratic in keeping this legislation from the people, but, on the contrary, because they have fulfilled their democratic duty of educating the people, through Parliament, in what is involved, and seeing that something which may involve very great danger for this State is not accepted by them through their lack of knowledge of the real issues at stake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to refer to some of the allegations made by Government Deputies <Col N="2020" /> that because we are opposing the abolition of P.R. we are denying the rights of the people.  The Fianna Fáil Government are in the position that they are the only Party in the Twenty-Six Counties in favour of abolishing P.R.  The Opposition and other people outside this House, including the United Trade Union Congress, are opposed to it.  The United Trade Union Congress has passed a resolution protesting against the proposed abolition of P.R.  Now we have the Government speakers repeating their master's voice throughout the country. They do not mention the Belfast Government; they merely say: &ldquo;We want a straight vote; we want stability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the last election I heard a Deputy make a similar statement in my constituency: &ldquo;We want a strong Government; give Dev a majority so that he will be able to put his plans into operation.&rdquo;  I say that the whole scheme of the Taoiseach is a red herring to take the people's minds from the problems which face the country at present.  It is brought forward to distract the minds of housewives from the nightmare of trying to make ends meet because of the high cost of living and to take people's minds away from the huge wave of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one word has been mentioned about any of these three important matters in the speeches of the Fianna Fáil Deputies but, as I say, they are only repeating their master's voice&mdash;&ldquo;a strong Government and a straight vote.&rdquo;  What does a straight vote mean?  We do not need to study France to know, although there have been some people making speeches around the country about what is happening there.  I am concerned only with what is going to happen in my own country and I suggest that the straight vote means a vote similar to the vote which they have for the Belfast Government at present.  The Taoiseach was quite right when he stated on many occasions, along with other Fianna Fáil members, that the reaction to the straight vote in the north would be that minorities would have no representation. How right he has been in that prophecy.  Only within the last fortnight a Church dignitary there pointed <Col N="2021" /> out that a number of the Catholic minority were unable to get either jobs or houses.</P>
    <P>Is that the system that we want to see adopted here, that if one Party gets a majority you must be a member of that Party in order to get a job?  I do not believe that would happen but I do not want to be in the position of depriving minorities of their rights.  I have been criticised in my constituency for saying that this action would mean that a large section in my constituency would be deprived of representation. The answer given to me was: &ldquo;Let them join one or other of the large Parties.&rdquo;  Why should any minority or any individual be asked to join any Party?</P>
    <P>I suppose I am the only person in this House who has had the experience of seeing three changes in the proportional representation system since 1923. The first time we had five members for Wicklow and Kildare; we came along some years afterwards and we transferred portion of County Wicklow to County Carlow and reduced the membership. In 1937 Fianna Fáil got a large majority and decided that we would not have so many nine member and five member constituencies but that we would have two and three member constituencies.  I was put back into my own county which became a three member constituency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughman gave us a lecture on how easy it would be for all the Party to be elected.  I do not believe that the proportion he mentioned would work out as the Deputy believes it would.  A commission is to be set up and nobody knows what area that commission will select, whether it will be my constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy pointed out that two big Parties will share the majority of the seats.  I do not agree. However, I accept the Deputy's statement. I am opposing this motion as a trade unionist and in doing so am carrying out an agreement with the Trade Union Congress who have passed a unanimous resolution appealing to their members to do everything in their power to try to bring home to the people the seriousness of voting for any system other than proportional representation, as being the fairest manner of voting.  We all know that this is not a question of a straight vote or of stability but, and it has been repeated many times here, a question purely of political tactics.  Fianna Fáil recognise that with the unsettled state of the country, its economic position and the failure of the Government to fulfil even one of their last general election promises, and the failure of the Tánaiste to provide the 100,000 jobs he promised, their position would be serious if there was a general election at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people were delighted with the promise of the Tánaiste.  I remember a bureau being set up in my constituency to which the people were to go with their complaints.  It did not remain open for very long; they were too busy and the result was that the bureau was closed.  We never had so much unemployment in my constituency as we have at the present time.  This is a political tactic because the Taoiseach has stated, in another part of the country, that he recognises that in the next election, under proportional representation, Fianna Fáil would not get a majority.  It is recognised that any Government in power for a certain time may have to do something unpopular and lose certain of its members. Here the Government has failed completely to implement even one of the promises they made during the last election.  They cannot get on a platform now and talk about the inter-Party Government and the cost of living.  We know what the price of food is at present; we also know about the large numbers of unemployed who meet Fianna Fáil Deputies in their various constituencies.  In the rural areas there are vacant cottages with a charge of <Col N="2023" /> 2/6d. or 3/- a week for half an acre of land, but there are no applicants because they have gone to look for work in another country.</P>
    <P>These are the matters the Government should have been considering instead of indulging in political tactics and bringing in red herrings like the abolition of P.R. and the introduction of the straight vote.  They are merely following the example of the Belfast Government in their endeavour to deprive minorities of representation. Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party has denounced the electoral practices of the Belfast Government.  I am using the word &ldquo;Belfast&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Stormont&rdquo; because a large number of people, especially in my constituency, may not know where Stormont is but they know where Belfast is.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the points which have been raised about France or other countries.  I shall deal with our country.  If Labour were to be defeated in an election it could create a serious situation.  I have weathered the storm since 1923 and, please God, if I have the strength I shall weather it again no matter what way my constituency is manipulated. I am not speaking about myself but about the whole trade union movement which is now united.  If they have no representation in Parliament there may be certain disgruntled individuals who might use the situation to achieve ends against the policy of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>Do not give that excuse to them. Let us preserve the right of every citizen, whoever he may be, to seek the votes of the people and elect a Government without forcing Labour to join Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  There are labouring men in both of those organisations just as there are farmers. When it comes to a question of Government versus Labour, naturally as loyal members of the respective Parties they must vote with the Party.  I have seen teachers voting with their Party against their own feelings.  We should not give to a certain element the excuse that we are not representing the people because this element has no representatives to put forward their <Col N="2024" /> views in Parliament.  I have been here since 1923 and I remember the time when we were not supposed to represent anybody here.  These boys may try to repeat the excuse that we represent only certain elements in the community.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have not, over the last two years, fulfilled the promises they made.  The Fianna Fáil Party, having been elected, as the Taoiseach said, as a strong Government with a large majority, should have as their first concern the solution of the economic difficulties which we face.  I have experienced strikes and various other happenings since 1923 and I can only hope that what has happened in other countries will not happen here.  Men of goodwill are doing their best to cooperate but that cannot continue.  The leaders of the trade union movement cannot continue from month to month asking the members not to take action.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party welcome the opportunity of going before the people and I know what the result will be when the question is put in my constituency.  However, we are prepared to accept the decision of the people and let us hear no more of this talk of denying rights to the people.  We intend to give the people the opportunity of coming to a decision and to explain to them how serious a decision it is.</P>
    <P>I am against dictatorship whether it is on county boards, public boards or in the Government.  If P.R. is abolished we shall have as firm a dictatorship as we have under the county councils. Members will be powerless because there will be such a large majority on either one side or the other that the minority will have very little say and their representations will not be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is only one Party in Ireland asking for this change; there is no other Party to support it.  Apart from the other political Parties who are opposed to the change there is the United Trade Union Congress.  The Government should consider the fact that an organisation representing all the trade unions, irrespective of what their political opinions may be&mdash;and there are various political opinions among the <Col N="2025" /> members of those unions&mdash;have passed a unanimous resolution appealing to their branches and to their members to do everything in their power to defeat the Government's intentions to abolish P.R.  We want P.R. retained so that no excuse will be given either to trade unionists, or any other elements under a different name, to take up a position outside the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am opposed bitterly to this change and I am saying so as a paid-up member of a trade union.  I am confident that my constituency will vote against the abolition of P.R.  They will vote for the retention of that system so that the minorities in my constituency will have every opportunity of having their representatives returned in future elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett mentioned that Fianna Fáil should be more concerned with the promises they made prior to the last election than with changing the electoral system.  If we cast our minds back to the state of this country in January and February of 1957, before that election took place, we can see the advance that has been made in the last two years to carry out the pledges and promises made.  Due to the action, or inaction, of the Coalition Government the country was brought to a state of bankruptcy.  One of the reasons why we needed a strong Government was to bring it back to the sound economic position to which it has been brought today in the course of two short years.  That is one of the reasons why we should have no more to do with coalition Governments here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Declan Costello said we were making this proposal because we did not like Coalition Governments.  I think the people did not like them either.  They gave that answer in no uncertain manner in the last election. We have been told also that there is no demand for this system of voting. Deputy Everett was harping on the trade unions.  I am led to believe&mdash;at least we were told here anyway&mdash;that the system under which they elect their officers is the straight vote and not proportional representation.</P>

Since it was introduced here by the Taoiseach, it has been opposed by the Opposition throughout the country tooth and nail.  They do not want to let the people decide the issue for themselves.  They tell us that we have an intelligent electorate.  If they are intelligent, as we believe they are, why not let the issue go to them?  Why has it been held up for so long without letting the people decide for themselves? We have been accused of dictatorship. All we want is to let this proposal go to the people.

Like every other step he took in the national interest, this has been opposed by the same element.  When he asked for the removal of the Oath of Allegiance to a foreign King which Deputies had to take here, that was in <Col N="2027" /> the national interest and it was opposed tooth and nail by Fine Gael at the time.  In spite of that, the attitude of the Taoiseach was endorsed by the Irish people at an election and he removed the Oath of Allegiance.</P>

    <P>That was point No. 7 of the Fine Gael Party declaration when it was formed in 1933, as published.  If that is not a declaration in favour of the abolition of P.R. and bringing in the single-member constituency, I do not know what it means.  It is quite clear that Fine Gael, their policy and certain members, have spoken and advocated the abolition of P.R.  But now, because our leader has brought in this and has done so in the national interest, they want to oppose it for the <Col N="2030" /> sake of opposition&mdash;and that is all it appears to me.  After today, please God, it will go to the people soon.  I know the answer the people of my constituency will give.  When that is done, when the P.R. system is abolished and the straight vote is in operation, the people will be following the advice of the Taoiseach as they have followed it in the past on everything that was required to be done in the national interest.  I believe they will do this also in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Let us look back on history.  The Economic War was started on the annuities.  In 1938, a trade agreement had to be made with England.  It was a pretty poor business which we had to try to put shape on ten years later.  It was so weak because our farmers were on their knees&mdash;because, as the Taoiseach said, he knew the annuities would be paid in a more expensive way than if they were sent across to England.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Constitution. My phrases with regard to the Constitution of 1937 were relevant to this debate.  Deputy Kitt quoted me as saying I was against a certain system of P.R.  He will not bring in the full quotation.  I was there moving that we would have the principle of P.R. in the Constitution but not the system.  Just a little above that quotation which Deputy Kitt read, there is an interruption from the Taoiseach who said: &ldquo;I know there are many systems of P.R.&rdquo; I added the comment that is there&mdash; that it was understood we had adopted the worst system.  Immediately after that, the Taoiseach continued and said that that might be my view and I said it was not my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later, in relation to the advertisement that was read out, it was argued that we objected as a Party to the then system of P.R. when we agreed that P.R. as a principle should be observed <Col N="2033" /> and we voted for that in the Constitution. The Deputy's followers, of course, voted for it, too, and it was accepted as being the proper way in which the declaration of elections should be done in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt thinks there was a bad economic position here in 1957.  He will remember that one of the tests posed by his leader with regard to a bad economic system and a better one was the question of employment. Since 1956/57, there are 30,000 fewer people in employment than there were in that bad year.  Perhaps Deputy Kitt will explain how that happens under the good system his leader has given the country for two years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new one. It is well thought out but the figures are there.  There was an average of 100,000 unemployed for the period Fianna Fáil reigned.  I do not know about the early years such as 1933 because the statistics are not complete, but from 1934 onwards that was the case.  Let us face the employment figures.  Employment is the thing.  You can get rid of the unemployed if they emigrate, as they did in two of your years&mdash;in the two years since Fianna Fáil came back to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The little pamphlet called <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued before the Budget shows that there were 10,000 fewer <Col N="2034" /> people employed in 1958 than in the year before and 20,000 fewer that year than in the year before&mdash;30,000 fewer persons.  Then we were told by Fianna Fáil propagandists at the time of the 1957 election that it was a question of wives sending their husbands to work and there were 100,000 jobs promised. That is the way in which the present Party got to power.  Deputy Kitt can still think of that as the bad economic position of 1957 and then he says people gave their answer to that in no uncertain fashion.  The Deputy, I suppose, has not looked at the statistics of voting in the last election.  Fianna Fáil did not get a majority of the votes of the country.  They got a majority here through the way in which the marginal seats went but they did not get a majority of the votes cast in the election.</P>

      <P>You got a majority under P.R. but, remember, 150,000 people who had previously supported the Party to which I belong, the Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan and Clann na Poblachta, did not vote.  They did not vote Fianna Fáil.  That is what is called the very emphatic answer in no uncertain fashion given in 1957.  It is because Deputy Kitt's leader recognised how bad, in fact, that result was, when analysed, that we are getting this proposal, so that a thinly-spread minority, evenly distributed over a constituency, can achieve a bigger majority in this House than even that which the Party got without getting a majority of the votes in the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Kitt as I previously listened to Deputy Seán MacCarthy.  It is really dreadful in an area where we are supposed to be <Col N="2035" /> ruled by argument to have Deputy Kitt and Deputy MacCarthy at this point asserting that the Party to which I belong, the Labour Party, and all those other than Fianna Fáil are afraid to let this matter go to the people.  Is that not the argument that is being used?  That is Deputy Kitt's argument. Does Deputy Kitt believe that?  It is going to the people.  The only difference between us is that we want it to go to an informed people.  Deputies opposite would rather have it go to people who would be influenced by emotional sway&mdash;vote Fianna Fáil, vote for de Valera, and let us have all the elections on the same day, and then we may scramble through and we can hope to be safe for a good while.  It is the difference between having an informed electorate voting on a matter and having an electorate that does not know what it is doing, as would have been the case if this matter had been allowed to be rushed by Fianna Fáil, as they desired when this matter was first introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy was allowed to talk today about the voting in the Seanad, even allowed to speak of certain people who are to be regarded as experts on Constitutional Law.  He was then held up.  But he did speak of the majority in the Seanad.  He said the Second Reading was passed.  He did not give the voting&mdash;by one or two votes.  Then he said it seemed to be ludicrous that a House which had accepted the principle of abolishing P.R. could turn around on Committee or other Stage and vote against it.  Of course, Deputy MacCarthy said that that was due to the accident of a couple of people being sick.  There were a couple more accidents than that.  There were certain people there who would not face up to their responsibilities.  There was one lady Senator whose case has been quoted.</P>

Deputy MacCarthy spoke of the six university men in the Seanad and asked what do they, while they may be great people academically, know of Constitutional law.</P>

      <P>He was talking about them in respect to their votes in the Seanad.  He said that they were six of the people who wanted to have this matter delayed and caused the delay.  So they have.  I want to put the Opposition point of view.  They are six people who stand an election, maybe with a select type of electorate, but they do stand an election.  What about the eleven nominees of the Taoiseach?  Are they to be counted? If they are not counted, the Seanad vote was not a majority of one; it was very nearly, as somebody said in this House, a two to one majority of the free Seanad against the proposal and, Sir, if Constitutional law is to be regarded as a qualification for a vote in the Seanad, one could think quickly, without mentioning names, of a lot of the personnel in the Seanad in respect of whom one would very easily come to a decisive negative as to their attitude on Constitutional matters and their knowledge of anything in the nature of Constitutional law.  The Seanad have acted, as they are entitled to do constitutionally.  They have, if <Col N="2037" /> the free vote is taken, by an almost two to one majority, voted against the proposal.</P>

      <P>I made a comment. I do not want to make it again. On the free votes in the Seanad the majority was nearly two to one against.  It was not quite.  It was, at least, in the bookie's language, seven to four against.  It was at least that. Here is Deputy MacCarthy, on this date, a month before the elections take place, still rolling out the old contention that to have a resolution moved and spoken on here indicates fear of the people.  There is no fear of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite confident of what is going to happen.  I might have been afraid of what the popular result would have been if this matter had been pushed to referendum in the winter of last year but there is no doubt that, as the process of education has gone on, as arguments have been proceeding here and have been reported, there is clarification in people's minds.  All over the place, there has been an upsurge of feeling against the proposal.  Quite an anger has developed over the arrogance of the people who believe that, just because one man in this country can get a lot of toadies around him in the Cabinet, get them to agree to something and get a wider group of supporters in the <Col N="2038" /> Dáil, he is going to get all Fianna Fáil supporters to tread the same way just because, after so many years, he has made up his mind that P.R. is no longer good for the people but something that has to be got rid of.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this has been run completely and entirely as a matter of Fianna Fáil politics.  That seems to be a reflection of the anxiety that Deputies opposite must feel, and express themselves as feeling, with regard to the result.  All the Party weight is now to be thrown into these two questions of the President and the abolition of P.R.  First of all, we have the fact that the two elections are to be held on the same day.  I can understand people objecting to this amendment of ours on the ground that, if it were carried, it would preclude all possibility of the two elections being held on the same day and many people would agree that that would be a proper result and it was what was announced as a principle accepted by the Taoiseach when this debate first started.  He said there was no question of having the two matters decided on the same day, that they would be on different dates and different types of electoral machinery would operate in the two elections.</P>
    <P>However, we are following now the precedent established at the time of the plebiscite on the Constitution when it was frankly stated here that it was vital to hold the plebiscite for the Constitution and the elections on the same day as, without the incentive given to the voters to come out and vote for an individual, or individuals, there would be no hope of moving them to come out and vote for something abstract like the Constitution. Therefore, to get the Party strength, it was decided to hold both the plebiscite and the elections on the same day thereby ensuring that those who favoured Fianna Fáil would turn into the polling both, decide the ordinary election and carry forward their votes to the Constitution in a sort of Fianna Fáil spirit.  It is rather significant that about 100,000 people who voted in the general election did not bother to vote, one way or the other, in the matter of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We are now having the Taoiseach <Col N="2039" /> put forward as a Presidential candidate. It makes one think of a previous period, way back many years ago, when defeated in a straight vote with regard to the acceptance of the arrangement with England, the present Taoiseach, then president of an organisation, threw his weight into the scale by resigning from office in the hope that the vote on that issue would strengthen opposition to the Treaty arrangements.  That failed as I believe his effort to swing things now by putting his own personal influence into the scale again in connection with the abolition of proportional representation will also fail.</P>
    <P>We are also, I understand from a speech made here today&mdash;it is a matter that came as a surprise to me&mdash;to have not merely the two elections on the same day but it is also contemplated that, while there will be two ballot papers, they will both be handed to the voter as he goes in to the common booth, the one for the referendum on the abolition of proportional representation and the other for the election of a President.  If that is true, the thing assumes a most scandalous colouring.</P>
    <P>Further, I understand that in the city of Dublin it is now accepted that there are not enough ballot boxes and the position will be that a voter going in to the both and accepting one ballot paper in connection with the Presidential Election and another in connection with P.R. will subsequently have to put both ballot papers into the same ballot box.  The first effort made by the scrutineers afterwards will be the segregation of the votes cast in one matter as opposed to the votes cast in the other.  If that is the situation likely to develop, it indicates a more confused situation than was ever contemplated and will, of course, take away completely from any security with regard to the vote.</P>
    <P>In addition to all this, we have the political attitude stressed by the pressure that is being put and has been put on Deputies that they must all walk the same line, that this is their only safeguard and shield against the terrors of the future and the political wilderness for them unless they conform <Col N="2040" /> and do what the Taoiseach asks them to do.  Worst of all, we have this matter of the letter issued by the Tánaiste.  A letter has been sent by the Tánaiste to business people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard the Minister as very reliable in his statements and I am entitled to ask for the production of a document when the existence of the document is denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By this time one has got used to the Tánaiste writing to people and it is only to be expected that he will write to those who either have received or are likely to receive benefits from the operations of his Department.  That is known in America as &ldquo;lobbying of interested people&rdquo; to put pressure on members of Congress.  We have not, so far, got that system here.  We regard it as something near corruption.  But we have got used to it in connection with ordinary elections.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, as Tánaiste, addresses letters to people who, as I say, have got benefit or, more particularly, those who may look to have benefit from some of the operations of his Department.  With reluctance, one might accept something that has grown up over the years; one might accept that the Minister in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce is entitled to have some regard of those who supported him politically.  It is clear that there is at least a temptation that that may tinge his views when it comes to deciding <Col N="2041" /> things which should be decided objectively.</P>
    <P>Now, however, there are new considerations. The Minister for Industry and Commerce as Tánaiste, and possibly as someone elevated to a higher sphere, wants to know not merely how people supported him as head of the Department giving economic benefit but he also wants to know if they subscribed to the Party itself, the Party which wants one vote cast for the Taoiseach as President and another vote cast for the abolition of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>These are not commercial matters and while, as I say, it is near corruption to have it done in connection with commercial matters, it approaches much more closely to corruption when it is done in connection with such a matter as the Presidential Election and an issue which should be left to the free vote of an informed democracy, the question of the system of voting under which they will elect their representatives to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to ensure success.  Both elections will be held on the same day.  The personality of the Taoiseach is thrown in.  The blackmailing letter issues to the industrialists. All that is happening in relation to these two issues, in relation to what is described as a free vote of the people as to the system of voting and their choice in that regard; and it was expected to be their free choice unprejudiced by anything in the way of politics in relation to the person who will hold office as President of the country for the next seven years.</P>
    <P>It is not worth while at this stage doing anything more than looking at the arguments used against the system of proportional representation that we have.  There was talk about multiplicity of Parties.  It is only the dullest of backbenchers in Fianna Fáil who believe in that any longer and who venture to advance it at this hour.  There has been no multiplicity of Parties in this country since 1922.  There is no likelihood of any great multiplicity of Parties in the future.  The number of Parties which has evolved is representative of distinct interests and these interests have a right to claim representation. <Col N="2042" /> It is one of the benefits of the system we have that it gives representation where there is sufficient strength, a strength which can be regarded as important and worthy of representation.</P>
    <P>We have been told that under proportional representation one might get short Parliaments.  In the two periods in which there was coalition Government in this country both Governments had a longer period of parliamentary office than the average Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told it is impossible to carry through policy under coalitions.  The Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932. They went out of office in 1948.  They had 16 years in Government.  Two elections during that period gave them an over-all majority.  What did they give in return.  Stagnation.  There was certainly no break up of Parliament preventing them from carrying through a policy that might be regarded as good for the people.  For 16 years they held sway.  Yet we get <Col N="2043" /> a complaint now that under proportional representation there is not sufficient length of parliamentary life to enable a policy to be put through. The same people have been in control of Government here for 16 years.  We can look back now on the record of what they did in those 16 years.  Whatever excuse they may make for what they did or did not do, they cannot make the excuse that they were handicapped because proportional representation deprived them of the strength to put their policy through.</P>
      <P>As against that, we are told that coalitions are bad.  We are told that there was a certain amount of lobbying, a certain amount of bargaining going on.  Coalitions are bad, are they? Compare what the two Coalitions did between 1948 and 1951, and between 1954 and 1957 and see is there anything comparable with it since 1932. Taxation was reduced all round. People who had been kept down in their conditions of living by standstill orders, actual and threatened, were not merely allowed but encouraged to have their living standards raised.  Those people who had gone out on pension, when their pensions were not equal to the stress of the cost of living, had their pensions improved.  The whole personnel of the State service, civil servants, the Garda, the Army and teachers who had the right to arbitration were encouraged to seek it, and those who had not were encouraged to have themselves assimilated in their conditions with those who had these arbitration rights.</P>
      <P>The positions of all those people were improved and we started in those years the system of the capital Budget and the capital Budget schemes, which have left their mark on Fianna Fáil and which Fianna Fáil cannot get rid of, much as they would like to, and much as they engaged in a frenzy of vituperation when these things were started.  Judging by results, this country should like coalition Governments and abhor at least one type of single Party Government, the single Party Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a liking for coalition Governments, may I say, outside the single Party.  I mean a coalition where there <Col N="2044" /> is real collaboration, not the type of coalition, as I say, the hysterical mind of Fianna Fáil conjured up where some people try to veto what one of the groups of Parties wants to carry through.  I lived for six years under those conditions.  There was real collaboration.  There was no question of anybody imposing a veto or trying to do so.  Matters were resolved by argument, as they are, or at least supposed to be resolved here, and we do not think it any fault that it was done in a council chamber instead of openly in the Dáil, particularly when the fruits of that argument in the council chamber were eventually exposed here in the Dáil and the Dáil was able to do whatever it could to try to drive a wedge between the Parties and Party methods.  It was something which might be regarded as a compromise between two extreme points of view and extreme points of view are not always the best.  In coalition Government one can get real cooperation and we got it for six years.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of talk by the Government that coalition programmes should be exposed before an election.  Individually, I do not see any great virtue in that, but I should like to look at the application of it. The Minister for Defence is amused but he will not be so amused at what I am about to say.  Here is a programme that was not exposed before the last election.  At the last election the programme which was exposed was 100,000 new jobs, was it not?</P>

      <P>In any event, it was planned to give 100,000 jobs and, in addition to that, the food subsidies were to be retained.  The Tánaiste was very angry at what he called the stupid comments made as to their intentions and he and the Taoiseach at different places said it was no part of their policy to reduce the food subsidies, that they did not believe in such a thing.  May I take it then that before the election the programme was more jobs and cheap food?  &mdash;and after the election the subsidies disappeared and food became dearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was alleged against us when we asserted that workers and State personnel had a right to have their emoluments raised to meet the increased cost of living, that it was a conspiracy against the State, that we were trying to do away with any good that might have come from the Budget proposals by asking the people to look for increased emoluments.  Again, and I have already referred to this, the number of people employed dropped by <Col N="2046" /> 30,000.  There are 30,000 fewer people in jobs in the country now than there were two years ago.  I saw in a journal recently an item on two men meeting in the steerage of the boat at Dún Laoghaire going to Holyhead.  One asked the other: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;I am one of the 100,000 who did not get one of the jobs that were promised.  Who are you?&rdquo;&ldquo;I am worse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am one of the 30,000 who had a job and who lost it since Fianna Fáil came in.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if you were in the Chair when this matter started, Sir.  I am answering a question posed by Deputy Kitt that an election programme ought to be made before an election and not afterwards. I contend that in, 1957, the Fianna Fáil Party promised the electorate 100,000 new jobs and after the election, the reality was 30,000 fewer jobs and dearer food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no promise of that before the election.  If, as Deputy Kitt says, the people gave their answer in no uncertain manner in the 1957 election, I do not know why there is all the horror of putting this matter to the people in a general election. The Taoiseach expressed himself more clearly than any of his Deputies when he said in Monaghan that there was no hope under the present system of Fianna Fáil ever getting an overall majority again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>I hope that on any other occasion on which I am speaking here, the Deputy to whom I shall refer as the cuckoo will come in here to his nest.  I find that he is very helpful to me.  If the Taoiseach could count on it, we would still have the same system. Is that not right?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, he cannot count on it.  He knows he would never again get it in his lifetime or in that of his Party.  The pattern of politics in this country changed just after the war.  The Government were lucky to be in office during the time the war was on because then there was a feeling <Col N="2050" /> that it would be wrong to change the Government during a time of crisis. The first time the people got a chance to speak their mind after the war was in 1948 and Fianna Fáil were beaten. In those days, the people had not got acquainted with the form of coalition governments, but whether they knew about them or not, they were certain of one thing, that is, that they did not want Fianna Fáil&mdash;and they were quite decisive about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not want Fine Gael, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>After the 1948 election, a coalition Government was formed, something that nobody expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was formed to the frightful disturbance of the Party which Deputy Booth was later to join. It was a strange thing for the Taoiseach to find that this could happen.  Before that Government was formed and before the election, there was no coherence between the Parties who formed it. Thy had different policies but they met together and decided it was better to give the people a chance to enjoy a different form of government from that provided by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>That Government went out in 1951. It was actually returned in 1951 also, but six people who were told by the electors to join a coalition Government went over to Fianna Fáil.  Those six people were wiped out ruthlessly by the voters at the next election because of their traitorous behaviour at that time.  In 1954, the people most deliberately voted for a coalition Government. It was promised to them from the platforms.  We said that we would go into coalition if the people gave sufficient votes to enable us to do so and they gave us the votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the whole fabric of government in this country has changed since 1948.  The Taoiseach, who knows politics, if he knows nothing else, can see that.  He knows that the victory of 1957 was a very hollow thing.  It is because the truth is known that there is never again a possibility of his getting an over-all <Col N="2051" /> majority for whatever Party he leads that he has brought in this proposal for the abolition of proportional representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>The Deputy is so genteel it is hard to understand what he says.  In any event it is seen here now after the two statements made, one of which was an aggressive statement against an Opposition; that was by the Minister for Local Government: &ldquo;If this thing goes through Fine Gael have had it.&rdquo;  That was the attack on his part and the other is the nicer phrase of the Taoiseach that unless this goes through&mdash;at least he wants it to go through&mdash;there is no hope of Fianna Fáil ever having an overall majority in this House again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach apparently equates the national interests with the fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party, and, <Col N="2052" /> therefore, feels he is entitled to throw everything into the arena.  It is now being made a completely Party question. There is no longer any pretence that it is being put in an ordinary way for the people to express their views on it after deliberation.  The main thing emerging from the debate is that what Fianna Fáil detests most is the effort to educate the people as to what this thing means.  All the efforts that have been made in the Seanad during the various Stages, and here again now, are not so much devoted to the question as to whether a vote should be taken on a certain date or not, but that when the matter comes before the people the people will know to some degree what they are voting for, and will not be swayed by Party emotion and a one-Party machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question <Col N="2053" /> before the House has been debated since last November, and there is not a whole lot left for me to say this evening but, anyway, I shall try to be honest with the House and with the people who sent me here.  While saying that, I must add that I honestly believe what has been happening here since last November is nothing more or less than the result of a civil war.  Mind you, a civil war in other countries, as well as here, is not easily forgotten.  I personally believe it is the spirit of that civil war which permeates this House through the years, unfortunately to the detriment of the country and of the people of the country.</P>
      <P>One thing which strikes me very forcibly is that every native Parliament since 1922 has been elected under the P.R. system.  As far back as 1927 even the leader of the Government, then Leader of Sinn Féin, speaking at Cavan said that he would be completely out against anybody who would oppose the P.R. system.  Again, in 1937, not being satisfied with the then Constitution he drafted his own which, of course, as leader of the Government he was perfectly entitled to do, but he took very good care to insert and endorse the system of P.R. in that Constitution, simply and solely because he said we were a lucky people to have it&mdash;it was the system we knew and the system we understood.</P>
      <P>Having made those statements I feel it is rather peculiar, now that he is about to retire from the political arena, that he should ask to have the system of election which placed him in power done away with, the system which gave him the strong majority which his Government has at present. Despite that, he gives as one of his reasons for the abolition of proportional representation that we could never get a strong and stable Government until it was abolished.  It is an extraordinary thing that the man who got what he says could not be got under P.R.&mdash;a strong Government &mdash;should now use his power to do away with the system which gave him the power to do away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly believe there must be something very sinister behind the proposal.  What it is I do not know, <Col N="2054" /> but time will tell.  Personally, for the sake of our people and for the sake of generations yet to come, I certainly would not like that that system would be done away with inasmuch as it is quite possible&mdash;and I think Deputies and the Minister on the opposite side will agree with me&mdash;that Fianna Fáil can get into office with a very big majority, and it is possible, having got that majority under the straight vote, there is nothing to prevent them from prolonging the life of the Dáil.  After five years they could easily say&mdash;we should all rejoice in it if we were inside here at the time&mdash;that the life of the Dáil should be ten years, and that once in ten years would be enough to have an election.  I definitely would agree with them on that, if I were here myself, but it would be giving them a power which I would not like them to get, and it might be as well for themselves that they should not get that power.</P>
    <P>Those are my views.  I believe that when the Taoiseach is resigning from the public and political life of the country he should leave to the people the system of election which he has said they should be proud to have, the system of election they knew and the system of election they understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join my voice with that of every member of the House outside the Fianna Fáil Party in appealing to the Taoiseach to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy. This is a very reasonable amendment, that a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas study the whole system of election in this country and ascertain whether there is any better system, or any improvement on the present system, which could be suggested.  The Taoiseach has done that already in relation to the Seanad.  He has already set up a committee to go into the form of election for the Seanad.  If that is necessary for the Seanad, how much more necessary is it for the Dáil, the real power in government?  We have seen the power of the Seanad during the past few months when they turned down this Bill.  We saw where the Government, by a mere motion and with a majority in this Dáil, could <Col N="2055" /> override the Seanad's decision on this matter.</P>
      <P>We have had a debate here for quite a long time on the referendum and only one or two Independent Deputies spoke in favour of the change.  Every other Independent spoke against it.  We saw an even more united front in the Seanad and not one Independent member there spoke in favour of the change from proportional representation to the straight vote.  When it came to the question of voting, the result was 29 against the proposed change and 28 for a change.  The result looked very close, but I wonder do many people realise that 11 of the people who voted in favour of changing the present system were nominated to the Seanad by the Taoiseach?  They had not even to go to the trouble of being elected as the other Senators had, so that really of the elected members in the Seanad, there were 29 in favour of no change and 17 for a change.</P>
      <P>Immediately after, we had a proposal made by six University professors, six independent men, not depending on Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other Party for their votes.  They got their votes, you might say, in their own right as representative men.  The graduates of the Universities felt that these candidates were best fitted to represent them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am <Col N="2056" /> referring to.  These Senators do not belong to any political Party.  They are six independent people and they just asked for the same thing as this amendment asks for&mdash;that a committee be set up by both Houses of the Oireachtas to go into the matter of a change in the system of election.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Lands stated definitely here this evening, if this goes through, it is a leap in the dark.  Do the present Government want the country to take a leap in the dark? After all, we in this House will not be here in 25, or 30 or 40 years' time.  We do not know what could happen here. We have had practically 40 years' experience of the present system and we know what can happen.  We know that the people at any general election, if they so desire, can change from a Fianna Fáil Government to an inter-Party Government or any other Government. In fact we have had various changes since 1948 and there was no trouble about the people changing from one Government to another.  The system in operation gave them that opportunity and under that system we have had the strongest Government since the State was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have not been two years in office and they have three years more to complete their term.  If in two years' time the Government said: &ldquo;The plans which we had in 1957 have not yet matured.  We firmly believe that we have got so far in the field and that if a change were made in the Government next year, all these plans would be dashed to the ground. We want a change in the system so that we may be able to carry on for another five years&rdquo; there might be some grounds for this.  Instead, having been in office for two years&mdash;during which time we saw no fruits of good Government, although we have seen the fruits of strong Government&mdash;they seek this change.  We have seen the various Budgets brought in by the Minister for Finance and we saw that the Minister for Agriculture, during the year, was lost and could not be found.  That can be strong Government.  It can be strong Government when you can have the position that the Ministers are in such a position that they do not care about the Dáil and give irrelevant <Col N="2057" /> answers when they are challenged.  But can you have good Government in that way?</P>
    <P>It is most essential for Parliament, in any country outside the Iron Curtain, to have a responsible Opposition and to have a reasonably-sized Opposition. When you have Bills passing through this House, as you have nearly every month or so, you must have some Opposition to examine these Bills, someone who is qualified, possibly by reason of previous Ministerial experience.  If we have not got representative Opposition, there is no hope of helping the Government.  The Government produce Bills and the people expect the Opposition to perform the duty of an efficient Opposition, and examine the Bills and suggest amendments.  If the Government are not prepared to carry out those amendments, the Opposition cannot help it, but they are supposed to do their duty, and often when a non-contentious Bill is passing through the House, the Government see their way to accept the Opposition's amendments, or see the good points put up by the Opposition.  If you gave a Bill direct from the draftsman to an ordinary man, he would hardly understand it and it is only a man qualified through years of Parliamentary experience who can go through it.</P>
    <P>The Ministers have the assistance of experts in their Departments.  They are there, whatever Minister or whatever Party is in power.  They, or their successors, are there to assist the Ministers, but the Opposition have no facility whatever for obtaining assistance from any expert and it is most essential that there should be a responsible and representative Opposition in the House. If this Bill goes through, it could happen that Fianna Fáil or any other Party, would come back in another election, with 100 seats.  Where would we be then?  There might be only 30 or 40 people in opposition.  Those people would not be whole-time politicians. They would have only a Deputy's allowance and could devote only part of their time to the business of this House.  How could the people expect those Deputies to sit down week after week and do the work which should be done by 60 or 70 Deputies? <Col N="2058" /> When there are 60 or 70 Deputies, the job is quite easy, although they still have not got the expert assistance the Government have.  That is natural enough.  A Minister must have expert assistance to carry a Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>The one great fault in this proposal is that it represents a leap in the dark and I say that we would have much the same result as they have had in Northern Ireland.  The Unionist Government in Northern Ireland abolished P.R. from the same point of view as Fianna Fáil are trying to abolish it. First there was the cry: &ldquo;We do not want small Parties.  Small Parties can put up an election programme to the people which they will not have to carry out because they can never be called upon to form a Government.&rdquo; However, since last November or December the people have seen through that attitude and now the Taoiseach bluntly says it was because Fianna Fáil could not count on obtaining an over-all majority in any future elections under the present electoral system that they wished to allow the people to decide in what way Deputies should be elected in future.</P>
    <P>It was not a member of the Opposition who said that.  We have been saying it all the time but the Taoiseach is saying it now, that it is because Fianna Fáil could not obtain a majority that they are going to the country in this manner.  Surely it is unfair for them to change the rules of the game when it suits them.  The advantage of setting up this committee is that the people would see that here was a committee representing all Parties in the Dáil and Seanad, which would remove the impression that this Bill is being promoted to perpetuate a Party.  The Taoiseach is advancing in years and many people expected he would not be here this week but if he cares to be present another week that is his business.  However, it is very bad policy to try to perpetuate a Party in office.  Who can be sure of anything in this world?  If this change comes about it could act as a boomerang on the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Carew was speaking about the abolition of P.R. in the North, Deputy Cunningham, I think, <Col N="2059" /> said it would make no difference whatever here.  Does he forget the gerrymandering that was done in Derry under this new system?  The same thing could happen in Kilkenny and in Dublin.  If there was a surplus in one constituency they could remove that surplus to another constituency and create another surplus there.  Deputy Cunningham could not see that there would be exactly the same results here as in the North.  In Derry City where there is a large majority of Nationalists, a majority of Unionists are sitting on the council due to the gerrymandering of that area.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the difference between strong Government and good Government.  We have the fruits of strong Government.  I was speaking in Callan on an occasion when Fianna Fáil supporters were distributing handbills printed by the <i>Irish Press</i> saying: &ldquo;Let us go ahead again.&rdquo;  It gave me an idea: to where are we going ahead? Are we to go ahead as we did in 1952 when under the Budget of that year Fianna Fáil took away half of the subsidies? We were wondering would we take away the other half and they were hardly back in Government when they removed it and put up the price of essential foods.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for a man, employed or unemployed, nowadays to live in reasonable conditions.  There is a great deal of unemployment, leading to emigration.  Last Saturday week in Kilkenny a woman told me that the seventh of her eight sons had gone to England.  I knew that woman and her family well and they had come to me to help them obtain jobs on the corporation building scheme.  They were anxious to work and were physically able to do good work as I found out from the engineer.  Every building scheme closed down and when I went to the Minister for Local Government about building in Kilkenny he said: &ldquo;Do not mention unemployment.  That has no bearing on it.&rdquo;  I tried to put a hardship case. The former Minister had sanctioned a full scheme and the present Minister had cut it down to half.  He said unemployment had nothing to do with <Col N="2060" /> it.  I went to him on behalf of the people I represent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out what strong Government means.  If he was not a member of a strong Government he would not have said that. He would have said: &ldquo;We have three Deputies in Kilkenny.  If I do not at least investigate the unemployment situation in Kilkenny I shall not be carrying out my duty.&rdquo;  However, words of his have become famous in this country: &ldquo;If this Bill goes through Fine Gael will have had it.&rdquo; He is only a few hours away from the Bill going through and he will have his heart's desire.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government will be delighted to think that Fine Gael will have had it.  However, if this change is made it is not Fine Gael or any other Party who will have had it but the people for generations to come.</P>
      <P>No matter what propaganda goes out from the Government and the Party opposite, no matter how much money they collect, in whatever way they collect it and whatever machine they use, the people can be trusted to take the right decision.  If the Bill had been rushed through last December the people would have been at a disadvantage, but now they have seen the difference between P.R. and the single member dictatorship.  The people will not stand for dictatorship.  The Minister for Local Government will be proved wrong, and the people will not have had it.  They will say, &ldquo;no&rdquo; when they are called on to vote and I have no doubt that they will also say &ldquo;MacEoin&rdquo; in the Presidential Election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us are inclined to forget a very important thing, that the electorate of this country who are under 59 years of age know only one system of election, that is, P.R. All under 59 years of age are ignorant of the method of election known as the straight vote.  It is essential to point out to them the difference between election by P.R. and election by what <Col N="2061" /> Fianna Fáil like to call the straight vote.</P>
      <P>A Bill was introduced here last October or November.  The Opposition were upbraided because they dared oppose it.  The Seanad was upbraided because they dared oppose and defeat it.  Today we are being told by Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;You are trying to waste the time of the House by talking this matter out.&rdquo;  I think the nation owes a vote of thanks to the Opposition for the manner in which they have talked this matter out, because all the electorate under 59 years of age would not know what this Bill was about or why a referendum is being held were it not for the manner in which the facts have been presented to them by the Opposition speakers.  For that reason they have done a service to the nation.</P>
      <P>Every speaker on this side and in the Labour, the Clann na Talmhan and Independent benches has done a very good service to the nation by explaining to them from this forum what is meant by this Bill.  I wonder what would have happened if no opposition had been offered here and the Bill became an Act, came before the country and the people were asked to mark a cross before &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  What percentage of the electorate at that stage would know what it was all about?  I am afraid very few indeed of those under the age of 59.</P>
      <P>Having justified our action in talking it out, we now come to the question as to why we should have this Bill before us at all.  The people had a Constitution in 1922.  That Constitution was accepted, and it worked perfectly for 15 years.  The present Taoiseach and his Party decided to amend the Constitution in 1937.  In my opinion the big thing in the Constitution of 1922 and in the Constitution of 1937 is proportional representation. If the Taoiseach had any doubts as to the virtue of that particular Article in the Constitution of 1937 he should have brought it to the notice of the Irish people, but he now tells us that even in 1937 he had his doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says the Irish people had a Magna Charta in 1937 in Bunreacht na hÉireann, the Irish Constitution.  But the Taoiseach says he doubted very <Col N="2062" /> much if the Irish people would have accepted it if the electoral system was amended by the abolition of proportional representation.  Surely that is a fraud?  I think that is a downright fraud.  It is pulling the wool across the eyes of the Irish people, by saying: &ldquo;Look, accept this Constitution. There is one of the good Articles in it &mdash;an electoral system by which minorities will be represented in Parliament and will have the forum of the Parliament to voice their opinions.  I am putting that in but immediately I get the chance I shall take it out.  There are doubts at the back of my mind today in 1937, but unfortunately I cannot afford to express my doubts because, if I do, you will not accept this Magna Charta we are offering.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach decided to let sleeping dogs lie and did not bother any more about it.  It never worried him until 1948.  Something happened in 1948 which created grave doubts in his mind as to the advantages of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>What caused those grave doubts? Those doubts were caused by a number of Parties representing different political opinions coming together and deciding to work for the benefit of the nation as a whole.  Remember the time that that occurred in 1948.  It occurred in the month of February. Up in my own constituency, two months before, the present Tánaiste appeared; and what was the picture he painted for the Irish people?  He said to them: &ldquo;You are facing the three blackest years in the history of this country economically and financially.&rdquo; He said that, to try and pull us out of the mire, he would impose certain taxes.  The Irish people believed the Tánaiste and said: &ldquo;This is serious. He evidently meant what he said because he has imposed these penal taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish people hastened to listen to the voices of Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and the Independents who said: &ldquo;We do not believe that this nation is facing this critical time which the Tánaiste says it is.&rdquo;  Each of those Parties asked the electorate to elect them to office.  The electorate did not elect <Col N="2063" /> them to office but gave them a majority over Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that the people did not believe the then Tánaiste that this country was in the dire economic and financial state in which the Tánaiste said it was.  Sinking their differences, all those Parties decided to come together and work on a common platform to prove that by co-operation between them they could pull the State out of this mire into which the Tánaiste said it was sinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that they did pull it out of the mire.  What was the first thing they did?  The only visible <Col N="2064" /> evidence of mire was the imposition of penal taxes.  Is that not so?  They abolished them right on the spot. Not only did they do that but they saw that this country at that time was reeking with tuberculosis and no effort was being made by the then Government to house those unfortunate patients.  Not only did they take away those penal taxes but they found money for the erection of sanatoria all over the country.  When did they do that?  In the days when Fianna Fáil told us we were facing the greatest financial and economic crisis this State had ever known.  How did they do it?  By coming together, pooling their plans, getting the best out of the policy of each Party and cooperating. That is what they did in the years when Fianna Fáil were prophesying disaster for the future. But they did it so well that they created a doubt in the mind of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We are up against a problem.  This thing is going so well that the first chance we get we shall nip it in the bud.  We shall leave this State with two Parties, and two Parties only.&rdquo;  Now let there be no doubt whatever about this.  Fine Gael is based on the acceptance of the Treaty; they are Treatyites.  That was the foundation of the Fine Gael Party. I am not saying what Fianna Fáil are now but they were anti-Treatyites. That was the difference between the two big Parties in this State.  But there were a number of Parties, such as Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and Labour, who said: &ldquo;To hell with the Treaty, the Treatyites and the anti-Treatyites, let us try and get together.&rdquo;  What does the Taoiseach say?  &ldquo;No, we still have two Parties, Treatyites and anti-Treatyites. That is what I want.  Let history decide which was right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall not debate the merits of the Treaty.  Like the Minister, I was probably going around in skirts at the time.  The less I know about what occurred at the time the better.  But it is a pity that we should perpetuate that difference.  It is a pity we should try to wipe out Labour, Farmers, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and Independents.  My good friend over <Col N="2065" /> there, Deputy Davern, on one occasion when I was saying it was a pity that Labour and Farmers should go, said: &ldquo;We have all those in the Fianna Fáil Party.&rdquo;  Is that not the clue to the whole thing?  In other words: &ldquo;We represent all interests in this State; therefore, there should be only one Party, namely, Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Another Deputy said the same thing.  It was said by way of interjection, but I think it was letting the cat out of the bag.  Does the Minister agree with one Party being elected to a democratic Parliament such as this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, how long would it have remained in petticoats were it not for that uplifting of what I might call the lower middle classes during the first World War?  Suppose for a second that Gael Linn want to voice their policy and views by electing members to this House.  Political Parties do not spring up as mushrooms in this State of ours.  They proceed as Clann na Poblachta did, that is, by getting a candidate in now and another in again and by using this forum for putting their policy before the people. Eventually, they are able, possibly, to elect a Party which will have some weight either in Government or in Opposition.  But, under the straight vote, they have not a hope in hell of electing a Deputy to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose for a second the people of <Col N="2066" /> rural Ireland decided they wanted to elect a farmer candidate.  Must he join one of the two Parties in order to get representation here?  The Minister says he must join either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  However, the policy of the farmer might clash with the policy of either of the two big Parties in the House.  If it does, he has to swallow the policy he is advocating and accept the policy of one or other of the two Parties.  He will be left in the wilderness if he does not do that.  That is one of the Taoiseach's arguments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health went down the country and said, in effect: &ldquo;I think, under the straight vote, that what will happen is that the best candidate, the most popular candidate, the most influential candidate in each constituency, will be elected irrespective of the Party to which he belongs.&rdquo;  Supposing that happens and supposing we have 146 Independent Deputies coming in here.  Surely the first thing we would have to do would be to form an inter-Party Government.  They would have to form themselves into groups&mdash;rural groups, urban groups, Gaeltacht groups and probably Masonic groups.  Then they would have to coalesce amongst themselves and come to produce some agreed policy.  Would that be a proper system?</P>
    <P>I think the electoral system we have is an ideal one.  Let me take as an example the constituency which I have the honour to represent with Deputies Breslin and J. Brennan.  Suppose for a second that in my constituency a supporter of Deputy Breslin is dissatisfied with the manner in which he is looking after a particular matter.  He has the right to turn to me, as the opposite number.</P>

We have to be on our toes because if I do not work for my constituent and my supporter he will very soon go to Deputy Breslin or to Deputy J. Brennan.  I <Col N="2067" /> shall take care that I shall work for him and he will not go to them&mdash;and Deputy Breslin and Deputy J. Brennan will do the same thing for their supporters. They know well that if a constituent is dissatisfied with them he will switch over to me very quickly. We can hold up West Donegal as an example to most constituencies.  All the Deputies there are on their toes, which is a very good thing.</P>
      <P>Suppose one Deputy only represents my constituency.  Suppose he happens to be Deputy Breslin or myself.  I know who is voting for me just as Deputy Breslin knows who is voting for him. We know our supporters.  What chance has the opposite number, the person who supported the defeated candidate, of getting cothrom na féinne from the elected Deputy?  None whatever.  What is worse, if that Deputy is a Party hack&mdash;I am not saying he is one side or the other&mdash;what say exactly has the local convention in his election?  We have had examples of it.  I shall quote only Fianna Fáil.  You remember the by-election in Wicklow.  The local convention selected a candidate but the Party bosses said, in effect: &ldquo;No, we do not want him.  You will take our man.  If you do not take our man, out you get.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What would it be like, I wonder, if there were only one Deputy for a constituency?  That Deputy would be selected by the Party bosses in Dublin and that Deputy would eventually reap the fruits of office in the profession of which he happened to be a member, be he a farmer, lawyer, doctor or anything else.  He will move on and his successor, again, would be nominated by the Party bosses in Dublin, and so on down through the years with the result that, after a few generations, the elected Deputies would probably live in Dublin City and have no contact whatsoever with their constituents, as happens in England to-day.  They would live in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Remember that, if some of my own do that, the people, under P.R., have an opportunity of <Col N="2068" /> throwing them out.  Under the direct vote, they will not have a hope of throwing out a man of that type because he will be the nominee of the Party boss and he is the big chief and what he says goes.</P>
      <P>I am referring to what Fianna Fáil hope there will be, namely, two Parties and two Parties only.  While a Deputy was speaking the other day and referring to the two-Party system in the North he was interrupted by Deputy Booth who said that the Government is elected by the will of the people.  Do Deputies here subscribe to the view that Stormont is elected by the will of the people in the Six Counties?  Will any person here stand over that statement by Deputy Booth?  We who live on the Border have some experience of gerrymandering.  Derry, Fermanagh, Tyrone, South Armagh are left without representation despite the fact that the Nationalists there have a majority of the votes.  However, by the manipulation of gerrymandering, they are left without representation.  Suppose we had a strong Government and a weak Opposition here and suppose we came to revise the constituencies, as we would have to do every ten years.  Suppose that strong Government had the say in the revision of the constituencies, I wonder if we would have gerrymandering here?  Does anybody doubt that we have had gerrymandering here? I think that is one of the strongest reasons why we should oppose this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which Deputy McGilligan referred.  On the occasion of the last referendum, there were local elections.  One of the reasons advanced at that time for having the local elections and the referendum on the same day was that there were no politics in local authorities, that the members were not elected on Party lines, that, in the main, they were independent and that their supporters would be coming out to vote and that it would be an opportunity to bring them out to vote.  Despite that, as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, 100,000 electors who came out to vote in the local elections refused or failed to cast their votes in the referendum.  If an elector wishes to vote for one of the two candidates for the Presidency, or <Col N="2069" /> one of the three, if there are three, and goes to the polling booth and demands a ballot paper, will the referendum ballot paper be pushed into his hand or, if he wants to vote in the referendum and demands a referendum ballot paper, will the ballot paper for the Presidential election be pushed into his hand?  If it is, surely that is intimidation, because he has to return the paper and there is a duty and an onus on the returning officer to see that every ballot paper handed out by him goes into the box.</P>
    <P>When this matter was first mooted, the Taoiseach assured us that there would be no other election on the same day as the referendum, that the people would have an opportunity there and then of expressing their views for or against proportional representation.  He then changed his mind, without expressing a view, and hinted that it might be possible that we would have the two elections on the same day.</P>
    <P>Immediately Fine Gael announced their intention of putting Deputy MacEoin forward as a candidate for the Presidency, the Taoiseach, as a political stroke, had to counteract that and threw himself into the fray, not, in my opinion, in the hope that he would go to the Park&mdash;I do not believe that the man ever wanted to go to the Park. I think it is breaking his heart to leave that front seat&mdash;but because he is being pushed.  The reason he is being pushed is, not to make him President, but to carry the referendum, in the hope that the name of the Taoiseach will encourage all Fianna Fáil supporters to come out and vote, not only for him, but for his policy, as they did in the past, without even knowing what it is.</P>
    <P>As I said the other day, Fianna Fáil played their cards and, in the end&mdash;I do not say it in any way disrespectfully&mdash; they produce the joker and they hope the joker will win the trick.  I do not say that in any disrespectful manner to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>He will have the right to nominate his successor as Taoiseach.  The ambition of his Party is that he will go to the Park, that he will nominate his successor as Taoiseach, that the referendum will be carried and that his Party <Col N="2070" /> will remain in office for at least another generation.  Not only does he write his last will and testament, but wants to see it probated as well.  That, in my opinion, is exactly what they are endeavouring to do by holding these two most important elections on the same day.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have performed our duty in the proper manner to the nation by endeavouring to enlighten the electorate, particularly all those under 59 years of age who knew only the proportional representation system of election.  We have done a great day's work for the nation by educating the electorate into the disadvantages of doing away with a system which has worked so satisfactorily since the foundation of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the final stage of this debate and, as Deputy O'Donnell has said, it gives every Deputy a further chance of putting his views before the House.  The charge that we on this side of the House have held up the debate unnecessarily is unwarranted, especially when one reflects on the seriousness of the subject.  It is a very important matter and it is only right that it should get the fullest possible discussion, preparatory to its being put to the people.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has a motion before the House in which he asks this House to deem a certain Bill to have been passed by the Seanad.  That is a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with a Bill that has been fully discussed in the Seanad and defeated there.  We are asked to assume that it has been passed by another part of the Oireachtas.  A Bill comes before the House and is passed or defeated.  This Bill, as we know, has been defeated in the Seanad after very frank and full discussion.  Now, under the Constitution, it must come back to the Dáil and the Taoiseach asks that we should deem it to have been passed by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to contrast the methods of discussing this subject in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  When the Bill was discussed in the Dáil some months ago, on the various Stages, it was passed by a Party vote.  It then went to the Seanad and was defeated <Col N="2071" /> on a non-Party vote.  That is very significant. In the Seanad, there are men of all shades of political opinion, men experienced in economic and political affairs, who are unbiased.  They gave their decision and defeated the Bill. That is in sharp contrast with the result in this House.  As Deputy O'Donnell has said, if the discussion on the Bill does nothing but draw people's attenton to the seriousness of the matter, it will have done a great deal.</P>
    <P>In opposition to the Taoiseach's motion, there is a Fine Gael amendment which asks that the matter be referred to a commission composed of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  To my mind, that might be rather dangerous because, human nature being what it is, vested interests might creep in, unavoidably.  My personal opinion is that, if a commission were set up, it should be composed of impartial men of good standing, having no immediate connection with any part of the Oireachtas.  However, I agree with the principle of setting up&mdash;shall we call it a court of inquiry?  At least, it would mean that the issue could be put to the people with a certain degree of unanimity, that Party bitterness would be avoided and the people would be able, calmly and dispassionately, to assess the implications of the two systems.  It is obvious that the amendment will not be accepted.  This issue will be decided now on a Party basis.  Deputies will be addressing the electorate throughout the country at weekends and they will appeal to the Party loyalties of the people; they will ask the people to vote in a certain way on this issue.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the proper way to tackle this matter because people will be blinded by their Party loyalties and they will not be able, objectively and dispassionately, to give a decision for or against, in the absence of a careful examination of all the implications inherent in the issue.  It is more than significant that the two elections will be held in the same day.  The Taoiseach is entering the Presidential contest.  I think, in company with many others, that the Taoiseach is holding the referendum on the same <Col N="2072" /> day as the Presidential election for the express purpose of attracting out to vote the lukewarm Fianna Fáil supporter. If the two issues were decided separately on different days, it could easily happen that many Fianna Fáil supporters would not bother to come out to vote either for or against the abolition of P.R.  I am convinced that many Fianna Fáil supporters throughout the country are quite satisfied to leave things as they are.  They do not want this change.  But when they see the name of Eamon de Valera on the Presidential ballot paper, they will feel impelled to vote for him out of a sense of loyalty and, having voted for him, they will go on and vote in the referendum.</P>
    <P>It is admitted on this side of the House that there are defects in the present system.  As I pointed out on an earlier occasion, a man can head the poll on the first count and yet be defeated. That happened at the last election in Galway.  The man who headed the poll on the first count was eventually eliminated.  Under the present system, too, we have the situation where a man who heads the poll with a large surplus draws in with him his colleague who may lie at the bottom of the poll. These are two glaring defects in the present system.  That is one reason why I suggest this inquiry should be held in an effort to eradicate and eliminate such defects.  There may be others.</P>
    <P>When, however, we come to consider the proposed new system, we find that a man can easily be returned as the elected representative of the people in a constituency and yet not command the majority support of the people in that constituency.  If for no other reason, an inquiry should be held for the purpose of examining into such a situation as that.  It would redound to the credit of Fianna Fáil and to the credit of the Taoiseach if they would now accept this amendment.  If this inquiry were set up, there would then be no further bitterness and there would be no regrets.  The issue could be put to the people on a unanimous recommendation from this House.</P>
    <P>It has been stated on many occasions by Fianna Fáil speakers in answer to criticisms which have come from this <Col N="2073" /> side of the House that it is the people who will decide.  Of course, it is the people who will decide.  It is only right and proper that they should decide.  But the people should only be asked to decide an issue calling for a change for which they themselves have clamoured.  They have not demanded this change.  The Taoiseach has stated, here and elsewhere, that going around the country since 1948, he was asked on various occasions to abolish P.R. and bring in the straight vote.  I am not aware of anyone in my constituency clamouring for that change.  It is very significant that the Taoiseach made that statement only after he was defeated in 1948 and again after he was defeated in 1954.  It appears now that the people were not clamouring for such a change prior to 1948.  They were not demanding a change between 1932 and 1948.  It was only after the accession to power of the two coalition Governments that the supposed clamour was noticed.</P>
    <P>The charge is being made against us that we are preventing the issue from going to the people.  That is a nonsensical charge to make, especially when one remembers that Fianna Fáil have a majority of 17 or 18 in this House, for all practical purposes.  The combined Opposition know that Fianna Fáil can carry this issue, and will carry it.  It is our duty, however, to insist on a discussion of this matter, a matter of grave import for the future of the country.  The straight vote, if carried, will govern all future elections. For that reason, it is only right and proper that the matter should be fully discussed here.</P>
    <P>There is one particular danger I can see resulting from this change.  It might easily mean that we will have a preponderance of urban representation. There will be only one seat in each constituency.  The bulk of the population reside in the towns.  In each constituency, there will probably be one or two towns.  The man who can attract the majority of the votes in the urban areas will most probably be an urban representative.  His election will be detrimental to the rural population in that constituency, unless specifically rural constituencies are established.  We shall have to await <Col N="2074" /> the outcome of the proposed commission before we shall know what the position will be.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, since this Bill came back from the Seanad, there is apparent in the country, reflected in the national Press, a growing realisation of the serious implications inherent in the Bill.  When the suggestion was first mooted by the Taoiseach and when the Bill was introduced here, comparatively little notice was taken of it.  The discussion which took place here and in the Seanad has brought to the people generally a realisation of the importance of this issue.  I feel confident that they will vote wholeheartedly against the proposed change.  We must remember, however, that many people who walk into the polling booth to vote on this issue will become somewhat confused when they read the official jargon on the ballot paper.  They will not know whether to put &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, respectively, in the squares.</P>
    <P>Before they go in, they may have their minds fully made up to vote in a certain way, but when they get inside, they may get mixed up and put down &ldquo;no&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and <i>vice versa.</i>  It is only right, therefore, that we should fully inform the people as to the implications of this, and as to the meaning of the question on the ballot paper, what it means actually. As a result of that difficult question on the ballot paper, this issue can be won and lost by default, by many people not realising they are making a mistake in putting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; where they meant to put &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Whatever the result of this issue, but especially if it is passed, it will not be a true reflection of the wish of the people because that wish will hinge on their Party loyalties.</P>
    <P>I believe the two elections, the referendum election and the Presidential election, should be separated.  I held the opposite view about that on the Second Stage, and I expressed the hope then that the elections would be held on the same day, if only for the reason of saving a certain amount of expense.  Since then, I have been converted to the view that the two issues should be separated, not only to try to get a definite reflection of the opinions of the people, but also so that they will <Col N="2075" /> not be distracted by the attraction of the magnetic name of Eamon de Valera.  The fact that the Presidential election and the referendum are being held on the same day will damage the ability of the people to give a proper and fair indication of their desire in this matter.</P>
    <P>As I said before, there are other far more pressing problems to be tackled throughout the country at the present time.  We have the high rate of emigration, and the high rate of unemployment, and it would suit the Government and the whole House better, if they tackled or tried, in a genuine way, to tackle the more pressing problems.  I doubt that this change, if it is brought about, will solve or will help to make it easy to sole, the pressing problems which beset us.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is an ulterior motive in the mind of the Taoiseach and in the mind of Fianna Fáil, in general, in bringing this motion to the House.  I am convinced that this is a move to try to perpetuate their continuance in office, especially when they will no longer have the binding influence of the Taoiseach when he retires from politics&mdash;and it appears that that day is not far distant.  It may be difficult for Fianna Fáil in those circumstances to remain a cohesive and united Party and I believe that in future, when the Taoiseach retires, they will find it rather difficult to command the support of the people which they command at the present time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think there is really an ulterior motive in trying to change to the straight vote system.  The reason put forward by the Taoiseach for the introduction of this measure is that P.R. leads to instability of government and irresponsibility in government.  As I said before, if Fianna Fáil press this reason, they must admit that it is a reflection on themselves, and on their past periods of office since 1932, because they were elected under the P.R. system.  If, therefore, the P.R. system results in instability and irresponsibility Fianna Fáil have been irresponsible and unstable for the past number of years.  We must remember <Col N="2076" /> that under the P.R. system they have a majority to-day of 17 and that majority, in this comparatively small Parliament, is sufficient for them to implement their various plans and economic proposals, without seeking to consolidate themselves completely.</P>
    <P>As the leader of the Opposition said, we are coming to the end of an era in this country and no one knows what is in front of us.  An attempt, such as the attempt now being made, to change the system of election is, to my mind, fraught with great danger.  Hints have been thrown out that a spirit of unrest and, possibly worse, might result under the straight vote system.  I would hesitate to contribute to that view, because I should not like to hold the opinion that this spirit of unrest should be encouraged by any kind of inflammatory speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon appealed to the Taoiseach even at this eleventh hour to accept the amendment.  I should like to endorse that appeal even at this eleventh hour and a half.  I am convinced it will not be accepted, but we would be failing in our duty if we did not press the amendment, and the importance and the efficacy of the amendment, on the Taoiseach in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>I have not very much more to say except to comment briefly on the setup envisaged in the proposed commission which may revise the constituencies if the Bill goes through.  There are to be seven men on the commission: three from the Fianna Fáil benches, three from the Opposition benches, with a neutral chairman to be appointed by the President.  If the three Fianna Fáil members and the three Opposition members of the commission do not agree on any plan for the revision of the constituencies, the Chairman, the seventh man on the commission, may present his plan for the proposed revision, and that plan will be accepted, even thought it is the work of only one individual.  The job of recarving and reshaping the constituencies, if it ever happens, is too big for one man, and he should not be given that terrible power, as I would put it, the power to decide on the new constituencies.  His <Col N="2077" /> suggestions will be accepted in their entirety by the President.  That is a very wrong and very unsuitable arrangement.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the fact that under the straight vote system the people will have no choice of candidate.  That is quite true because no Party will put forward more than one candidate for one seat in a constituency.  If the people in a constituency do not like the candidate of a particular Party, it could easily result in their abstaining from voting and you would have a reduced vote.  That would be bad because it would mean we would not have a reflection of the majority opinion of the people.</P>
    <P>They may be in favour of voting for the particular Party but they may not be in favour of voting for the particular candidate and therfore they would abstain from voting.  Under the present system, the people have at least two candidates from whom to choose their favourite; sometimes they have three and sometimes they have four.  They will pick the man they think best to represent them.  When they are confined to voting blindly for one person, it is bad.</P>
    <P>I express the hope that this Bill, whenever it does go to the people, will be overwhelmingly defeated, as I think it will be defeated.  I think the people are satisfied with the present system of election.  It is the system they know.  The Taoiseach himself said that in 1937 when he said it is the system we know and that it has worked well.  I forget the other utterances of the Taoiseach in defence of proportional representation but I do know that he was a champion of it in 1937.  It is significant that since 1948, after two defeats, he has thought the time opportune to make the change he wants made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us an amendment and I do not think it is too much to ask the Government Party to accept it.  It merely asks that an independent body not tinged with any political bias should report on the system of election.  The Taoiseach is not prepared to accept that.  Instead he proposes to bulldoze this proposal through <Col N="2078" /> the House just as he tried to bulldoze it through in the middle of winter for the purpose of preventing the people from knowing all the facts.</P>
      <P>There is no support outside this House for this proposal.  Not one of the Fianna Fáil cumainn throughout the country asked for it.  Only the Taoiseach asked for it and of course &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men have to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but I know that a lot of them throughout the country are saying &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Not even the local Fianna Fáil cumainn have asked for it.</P>
      <P>Different arguments have been put forward in support of the change.  One Minister says one thing and another says something else.  It has been said that it was imposed on us by the British and for that reason it must go. It was imposed on the North of Ireland by the British and the Taoiseach used to say that it would have to go there. He is not saying that to-night but he is saying that proportional representation must go here.  He also says that we must have stability in government. That is a vote of no confidence in his own Party because Fianna Fáil now have the largest majority ever given to a Party in this House and still the Taoiseach says that there is no stability.</P>
      <P>We have had a quarter of a century of Fianna Fáil rule and what have we after it?  We have unemployment, emigration, pessimism, railways closing down all over the country and, worse still, no faith in democracy. That is the most dangerous point we have ever reached in our history.  The Taoiseach has spoken about everything but the thing he was elected to do&mdash;to deal with the problems of unemployment and emigration.  That is what he and his Party were sent into this House to do and yet we have such unemployment and emigration as were never known before.  They have pulled this political red herring across the path to take the people's attention from the problems facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the recent Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, the Taoiseach said they would all have to take off their coats but now he himself has thrown in the towel.  He has lost faith in us and <Col N="2079" /> in the country.  He is not going on any platform throughout the country. I know the amount of hard work that has been done by the Party.  The Taoiseach says that we must abolish P.R. in order to get stable Government, but if the Taoiseach would abolish what he was sent here to abolish, unemployment and emigration, the people would have more faith in democracy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach, at this last minute, to accept the amendment proposed. It would be one of the biggest things he could do, but I suppose he would find it too hard to swallow his words.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies who have spoken recently have voiced some hope that the Government would accept the motion in the names of Deputy Costello and myself.  I do not speak with any hope of that.  The 13th of May, 1959, will be a rather interesting date in Irish history.  I do not know much about the history of the Parliament that passed the Act of Union and wiped itself out as a Parliament, but I do know a lot about the history of this House.</P>
      <P>I do know that this motion will be passed by the strength of the Fianna Fáil vote in this House and that that vote will be analogous to the vote that passed the Act of Union and wiped itself out as an Irish Parliament. It will be a vote in an Irish Parliament attempting to weaken and destroy the foundations on which this House is based.  We all know the need there is, in the light of the work that requires to be done by an Irish Parliament in relation to Irish conditions and the difficulties that confront us, for a secure and stable Parliament, built on the complete support of the people and working with their closest co-operation.  If the intention of the vote of the Government Party tonight is carried into actual effect, and the foundations on which this Parliament is based were weakened in the way the Government proposal would weaken them, then the hopes with which this Parliament was set up would be completely dashed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> We are being asked to subscribe to a proposal that would go to the people as the recommendation from the Parliamentary majority that minorities should be allowed no chance of any representation in this House.  That is the definite proposal: that the value of the Irish vote, and the restrictive way in which it would be cast, would be such that no minority would be able to appear in this House.  We have had an example in the North of Ireland of how that has worked there, the effect it has had on Parliament, which it has nullified, and the effect which it has had on the minority section of the Parliament in the North of Ireland whose political powers it has completely atrophied with all that that implies.</P>
    <P>The proposal, therefore, as I say, is so to weaken and destroy the foundations of this Parliament that the action of the Government to-night, in putting their full voting power behind their proposal, as against standing back and allowing it to be examined as the amendment suggests, is analogous to the vote cast when the Act of Union was passed in a previous Irish Parliament. We oppose that.  We stand by an Irish Parliament in which the minority sections of the country can be represented with confidence.  By permitting them to have their say and influence there, we retain for them a Parliament which they can respect, support and co-operate with.</P>
    <P>This House, since its establishment, has had very many tragic moments. It has shown itself, in its ordinary days, to be a place where men of every Party, from every part of the country and every walk of life, can mix in harmony and friendship.  Even in the course of the long debate that has taken place here on this issue, that aspect has shown itself.  There is, however, one thing in this House which completely nullifies all that.  When the drums beat on the 12th July in the North of Ireland the whole atmosphere is changed and people who would ordinarily salute one another and co-operate one with another, change completely. Here the division bells, and the hissing whisper of orders and instructions of one kind and another, have a <Col N="2081" /> much more frequent and even much more alarming effect on the Fianna Fáil vote in this House.  We have had a situation here in which this House, great and all as has been its strength, and much as it has done for the country, has been hamstrung by reason of the fact that a large Party in this House regard themselves as an Ascendancy.</P>
    <P>They are a Party who object to allowing anybody in this House, in Parliament, or in the country, to have any power but themselves.  They object to any Party, or anybody in this country, getting any credit for any achievement, for having any brains and intelligence, or for having any national feeling but themselves. That is the blemish which is on this House.  Perhaps this is the darkness here before the dawn when the people will have an opportunity of having their say, and the sound of the voices with which they will make their say on the Government's proposal to keep minorities out of this House perhaps will scatter the malignant spirit that holds a great Party in this House. Many people, with fine ideas and all that, will break the malignant spirit that brings so much of malice so much of dissension and so much of the Ascendancy spirit into the ringing of the division bell, and into the Party-whispered instructions.</P>
    <P>I say that this House has had many tragic moments.  It was founded in January, 1919, and though it was not internationally recognised it had great strength, great force, and great achievements.  Where did the strength come from?  Did it come from one Party?  Did it come from two, or three, or four Parties?  It came from the strength of the whole people banded together to stand simply by their own intelligence, by their own devotion to Ireland as a nation, and by their own confidence and comradeship with one another; standing together as a force, as a people, with an institution that they called our Parliament, as the institution to which they looked for guidance and protection and regarded as a symbol of their spirit and industry.</P>
    <P>Where did it lead?  Some speaker on <Col N="2082" /> history recently said history should not be an argument; it should be a conversation.  We have not reached a time here in Ireland where history can safely be a conversation.  I do not wish to discuss any aspect of history at this particular moment except by way of conversation and merely to put into its perspective the work we are doing here today.  I say the Parliament established in January, 1919, representing nothing but a people, a united people in spite of differences of tradition, both politically and otherwise, nevertheless stood for a united people. We can just get one comment, in the conversational way in which people in England can discuss history with one another, on it.</P>
    <P>Thornton in <i>The Imperial Idea And Its Enemies</i>, referring to the position in Ireland said:</P>
    <P>The case of Ireland made it clear to everyone that the British Empire could no longer be assumed to stand foursquare on a basis of unchallengeable power.  For the Sinn Féin movement had challenged that power, and had challenged it successfully. They won Home Rule, denied to generation of Irish Nationalist parliamentarians, in a campaign of terrorism and crime.  They won it not because they had superior military force.  For England to &lsquo;hold&rsquo; Ireland in 1922 would have required the tactics of Strongbow, Essex, and Cromwell combined.  England had bigger forces at her disposal still Cromwell had possessed: but employment of their tactics was not a practicable imperial policy.</P>
    <P>A Parliament was internationally established in 1922 and we must ask ourselves what had the people stood up against?  They had stood up against an attack on their liberties that began in 1912 and 1913, when another ascendancy Party, with an ascendancy spirit in Great Britain, thought they could ride roughshod even over a statute of the British House of Commons and, as another English historian, in a conversational way, writing about English history in the way in which they can apparently among themselves write today, described the <Col N="2083" /> situation that arose there as a rebellion against Parliament and a rebellious movement which would have destroyed Parliamentary institutions in Great Britain if the world war of 1914 had not broken out.</P>
    <P>There was an ascendency spirit at that time in Great Britain.  After that, there was the attempt to enforce conscription during the war.  After the war for small nations had been won, there was the attempt to destroy the Irish Parliament established in January, 1919.  All that came with the Black and Tans and with the arguments, and with the threats of war, and all that kind of thing.  The strength of the people here, represented by their Parliament of 1919, was to overcome these forces and to set up this State.  The strength of the people, the spirit of the people, and the common sense of the people, and the feeling that they had ideals with regard to life and a tradition with regard to these ideals that would withstand the gun that Pearse withstood, the imprisonment MacSwiney withstood and the torture that Ashe withstood, were all responsible for this Parliament being set up.</P>
    <P>This Parliament had its moments of tragedy.  The Taoiseach is well aware that I stood in the seat alongside him to answer to this House, and to the people, for an action taken to defend this House from being wiped out of existence by the assassination of the Deputies, one by one.  We have come to establish our Parliament through terror and through struggle in arms, but in arms not simply for the sake of arms, but as showing the spirit that lay behind them.  If we have had this struggle outside, we are quite aware that the stepping stones to this House are smeared with our own blood.  We know how many died unnecessarily, in one way or another.  The people, with the political plans they laid for electing this House and holding this House, have maintained this House and the path to this House could not have been maintained in the way it was maintained if it had not been for the spirit of our people, which is in their veins and in their minds and in their traditions and ideals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> If we tamper with the foundations, and tamper with the stream through which there flows into this House the spirit of our people, we are doing something to destroy what is our people's strength.</P>
    <P>We are reducing ourselves, temporarily, at any rate, to what Parliament in the North of Ireland has been reduced, where an ascendancy holds itself, through unscrupulous means, in greater strength than it would otherwise have; where Parliamentary life is non-existent and where the political strength of the greater part of the minorities is completely atrophied.</P>
    <P>The proposal which it is attempted to put across is in the spirit which I characterise in my own way, as the spirit that wiped out the Act of Union, the spirit that meant the Conservative Party in 1912 and 1913 trampled on British institutions and traditions in order to prevent our people from having a Parliament of its own.  That spirit, with all kinds of suggestions, innuendoes and misrepresentations, denies that the electoral system upon which the Parliament is based, was based on Irish ideals and the Irish spirit and that it was intended to give, and did give, a reflection in our Parliament of the spirit that sought for unity and institutions that would represent the people.</P>
    <P>In May, 1921, as I have said before, the Taoiseach issued a proclamation affirming the aims of Sinn Féin.  He declared and I quote:-</P>
    <P>The policy of Sinn Féin remains unchanged.  It stands for the right of this nation to determine freely for themselves how they shall be governed and for the right of every citizen to an equal voice in the determination; it stands for civil and religious equality and for the full proportional representation and all possible safeguarding of minorities.</P>
    <P>We are told by the same Taoiseach that proportional representation was forced upon the country in order to trick the people who stood for achieving nationalism and in order to divide and split the people.  Then, the other day he told us that it was because Fianna Fáil could not count <Col N="2085" /> on obtaining an over-all majority in any future election under the present electoral system that they had decided to allow the people to decide by what system Dáil members would be elected in the future.  To allow the people to decide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry; it was in the <i>Irish Independent</i> for 27th April, 1959.  I am sure it was in the <i>Irish Press</i>, too.  We are asked that an informed people should be allowed to decide.  In the last hours of this debate, we have been left here with no voice speaking from the Government benches, while voice after voice spoke from the opposition benches, and with no attendance except a Parliamentary Secretary for a while and the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, in helping the people to decide, spoke in Listowel on 24th of January, 1959.  I think the extract is from <i>The Kerryman</i>, but if anybody doubts that it is correct, I shall hand it over.  The report states:</P>
      <P>It is necessary that the Fianna Fáil organisation should be kept at its maximum efficiency in order that the important task of ridding the country of the present dangerous system of election should be successfully accomplished, said Mr. Kevin Boland, Minister for Defence, at a meeting of Listowel Comhairle Ceanntair on Saturday night.</P>
      <P>A little over 21 years ago our Party undertook a similar task against the combined opposition of all the elements comprising the coalition of to-day.  The object then was to replace the foreign imposed Constitution, which was established on the instructions of Lloyd George and with the aid of British arms by our present opponents, by a Republican Constitution, which will need no alteration when the Six Counties, bartered away by the same people, are regained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the people here to-day will remember the unscrupulous nature of the campaign that was waged by all the Opposition Parties <Col N="2086" /> in their last desperate stand in defence of the British Dominion called the Irish Free State.  They will remember the frantic efforts made to mobilise every sectional interest against the enactment of a free Constitution.</P>
    <P>Then he referred to&mdash;</P>
    <P>...those who have stood firm in face of the organised thuggery of the Blueshirts and saved democracy from distinction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, and I quote from <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 26th April, 1959, spoke in Dublin at a 21st Anniversary Dinner of the Irish Constitution. The report says&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan, who was guest of honour at the function, said this was surprising having regard to the fact that the old Constitution mentioned the King of England 23 times and never mentioned the existence of God.</P>
    <P>&mdash;all helping the people to decide whether P.R. should go or not.</P>
    <P>This House was in being in September, 1925, although it was not recognised by the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time.  Nevertheless sometime in 1925&mdash;Deputies who want to get the exact reference can refer to the records of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Congress in Washington and Ottawa in that year &mdash;Deputy Tom Johnston, Senator Michael Hayes who was then the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, and myself attended the Inter-Parliamentary Congress as the Irish representatives. In front of the full floor of that congress hall, where men from the very east of the world to the west were represented, Deputy Johnston stood up to challenge a statement made by the British Prime Minister at that time about the King of England.  The statement was to the effect that when the King of England was at war all the Dominions were at war and so was the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party challenged that and challenged it with such effect that the Leader of the British Party, Sir Robert Horne, who was out of the congress hall at the time, came back and found it necessary <Col N="2087" /> to answer what Deputy Johnston put up.  He had to admit that what the Deputy had said was right, that there was no body who could commit the Irish Free State to war except Dáil Éireann.  He added that it was not much use for the Irish to act like children, playing tig, crossing their fingers and saying: &ldquo;I am not playing&rdquo; because if there was a strong enemy at war with Great Britain, he could very easily get an excuse for bringing Ireland into war even without the acquiescence of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>However, that is where the King of England won in the Constitution that the electorate are being told about in such an informed way in order to prepare them for knocking down the foundation under our Parliament.  As for God in the original Constitution, I wonder are the Government not ashamed of themselves that, incorrectly, wrongly, and in that way, they bring the name of God into the question.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Taoiseach: why do we offer up our prayers at the beginning of our daily work?  Why do we as individuals pray daily that we may be made partakers of the Divinity of Him who partook of our humanity? I ask that question because it is a vital one in dealing with the foundations upon which you are to build up Parliament. There can be no question of dealing with our constitutional matters by mere arithmetic, by a mere ascendancy spirit directed to material things.  We must realise that the spirit of man is a much bigger thing in which to invest, and requires investment more than the development of the resources of the country, any technique or any scientific approach to things.</P>
    <P>This House is here only because it reflects the people's wishes and reflects their strength.  It is deplorable that this House should be used contrary to the wishes of the people, so that one Ascendancy Party stands in debate against the rest, determined that nobody can have a voice or a say in Parliament or make any contribution to the work of the Government except themselves.  If we cannot exercise that right we shall struggle along in the <Col N="2088" /> way in which we have been struggling and with the record that is there, but we shall not be conducting the affairs of Parliament in the way in which our people intended.  We shall be carrying on the affairs of our Parliament, dating from its establishment in 1922, in a spirit which never informed our political affairs.</P>
    <P>By way of referring to the spirit that moved the people in the difficult days when the Parliament of January, 1919 was set up, I should like to quote, as I have previously quoted, from Col. 1314 Vol. 171 of the Dáil Debates of the 2nd December, 1958, what Arthur Griffith said in June, 1912:</P>
    <P>If democracy is to survive as a working principle of government it can only survive on the admission of the minority to a share in representation with its strength in the government of the State</P>
    <P>That is good enough for 1912 but I should like to go back to the higher reaches of the stream and to quote from the introduction to the first Irish Year Book that Griffith published in 1908.  This was a beginning of an Irish encyclopaedia.  In it various aspects of Irish life were dealt with for about four years and then stopped when the political work quickened, when the Home Rule Bill came along for discussion, when the Volunteers had to be organised.  He had appealed to men of every Party, class and creed to convey in their own way their own experience and their own recommendations with regard to various aspects of Irish Life.  The introduction to the book states:</P>
    <P>The object of this book is to render available to the whole people of Ireland that information on the affairs of their country which is necessary for their defence and essential to their progress.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...The National Council is responsible for the publication of the <i>Irish Year Book</i> but not for the opinions expressed by any of its contributors. Each contributor is responsible for what he or she has written, and for nothing else in this Book.  Our object is to place before All Ireland a book in which All Ireland expresses <Col N="2089" /> itself, and when this book was projected we accordingly communicated with men and women of all parties, classes, and creeds in Ireland, inviting them to deal in the <i>Irish Year Book</i> with those subjects in which they were skilled.  The response confirmed our faith that Irish Patriotism is the monopoly of no party, no sect, no class, Unionist and Anti-Unionist, Catholic, Protestant, Presbyterian, Methodist and Quaker, the Northern Manufacturer and the Southern Agriculturist, the man of leisure and the man of toil&mdash; all are here offering the results of their study and experience to help their country.</P>
    <P>He wanted what he called a concise meeting place in Ireland that would represent the spirit of those who showed, in the manner in which they set out to make a contribution to the <i>Year Book</i>, what contribution they wanted to make to develop Irish resources, to overcome and exorcise the antagonisms that were there for historic and other reasons and to help the various classes of society to come together and exchange their views, experiences and ideas in a developing Ireland on every aspect of Irish life, Irish education, Irish agriculture and Irish industry.</P>
    <P>So that the ideal and the principle in the foundation of the system of proportional representation that was introduced in our Constitution, and that was introduced in our Constitution in accordance with the quotation from the Taoiseach's statement in May, 1921, as the tradition of Sinn Féin, sprung from the people of all Parties, creeds and classes and sprang from a recognition that what the country needed was a Parliament with representation for each of these sections of the people, where they would know one another, overcome their differences and bring their power of work and thought and co-operation together to advance the affairs of this country under an Irish Parliament.</P>
    <P>If the people are being asked to do such a thing, which even the Government in their statement regard as so fundamental to our people, why have they to be misled and distracted and why have the emotions aroused over <Col N="2090" /> the spilling of Irish blood at Irish hands, with memories of our early steps here, to be brought into the situation?  Is not the very fact that we have these memories, as well as the achievements in between, a warning to us that we have to look to our true traditions, where our teaching and strength come from?</P>
    <P>What on earth are we to think of people's concern for this when we hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking of Griffith, his ideals and his works, as the work of an immature political mind?  I think he said &ldquo;like the back-page expressions of an immature political mind.&rdquo; I heard Deputy Tom Kelly, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, stand up here and speak very emotionally of the great man Griffith was and how he slaved from one end of the week to the other.  He might have had 30/- coming in.  Then he found himself in the position in which, when he did go and face the British representatives to have it out in the council chamber and find some kind of a formula for reconciliation and mutual working, he had the faith he had when he came back.</P>
    <P>I had a similar experience to that in the corridors of this House when one responsible member of the Fianna Fáil Party, in a discussion with me arising out of what Tom Kelly said and my reaction to it, said, with regard to his own leaders: &ldquo;I would not follow them to-morrow if I knew where to go.&rdquo; I do not mention that for acrimony.  I mention it because I feel that at this hour of the day we ought to be to some extent among ourselves in the position in which we can discuss history conversationally, in the same way as the British can discuss things that were of vital import and that have really brought disaster on themselves.  Because what the British attitude towards Ireland, as represented by the Conservative plot or rebellion of 1912 and what ultimately flew from that has brought on Ireland has been less in achievement than what it brought on Britain and British interests throughout the world; and what it has brought on Europe and the United States, goodness only knows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> I mention these things because they are known in the hearts and minds of everybody in this House.  The difficulties I speak of are as well known to the people who face us as they are to ourselves.  It is because I feel that they are as close to Irish sentiment in the past, and knowledge of where Irish strength lies, that I dare to criticise them and face them in this way.  We are asked by an Act of this House to suggest to the people that the Irish Parliament wants them to tamper with their foundations here and to keep minority Parties out of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke to-day of the two big Parties and of the people who wanted to have nothing to do with them because of their origins.  He could very well know that there are people who supported one or other of these Parties who want to get away from that and want to find themselves in a position in a Party, or at any rate in a position in Parliament, in which they can discuss Irish matters and cooperate on Irish economic matters without having every expression they make and every discussion they have tangled with thoughts of the past.  These people are not allowed to escape from the bird lime the Fianna Fáil Party want to lay around everything that was done here with the pure purpose of assembly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been speaking on economic matters.  Let us look at just one item of the economic barometer.  The figures published for the Budget discussion show that between 1957 and 1958 there was a fall of 10,000 persons in employment.  In the same period there was a natural increase in population of 25,000 or 26,000.  Going back to 1951, there was a fall in employment of 88,000 people.  In 1958, 88,000 fewer people were in employment in the State than in 1951.  In every one of these years, the natural increase in the population was there, an increase of 25,000 to 26,000 persons.  Therefore, looking at our Ireland in 1958 and comparing it with 1951 we find that approximately 295,000 people are unaccounted for.  I regard that as sufficient fact alone to suggest that <Col N="2092" /> there are serious problems with regard to employment and production to be attended to here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated that the wiping-out of P.R. is very definitely linked with the economic drive.  He is a man with long experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I suppose he has been in that Department for about 20 years.  A White Paper has been published and a grey book has been distributed to pull together all the possible things that could be done in the Irish economy. I wonder if the Taoiseach would tell us how the wiping-out of P.R. would strengthen the people to do the work required to help our people into employment or even to maintain in employment those in employment.</P>
    <P>There is much talk today about adult education and about relations between management and labour.  Does the Taoiseach not realise that some analogous principles apply between the people and their Government, between workers and their management?  In the development of management-labour relations for better production, certain principles are being arrived at and, from the point of view of man's Divine origin and his Divine destiny, consideration has been given to these things in industry.  Will the Taoiseach say that they have no bearing on the relations between man and man and between people and government in politics?</P>
    <P>In the March/April, 1959, issue of the <i>Bulletin of the Catholic Societies Vocational Organisation Education Conference</i>, under a note headed &ldquo;The Key to Management-Labour Relations&rdquo; I find this quoted from the Bishop of Shrewsbury:</P>
    <P>In the construction of good relations between managers, workmen and consumers, the corner-stone is the recognition of the dignity of the human, individual personality.</P>
    <P>In another part of the issue, the following sentence appears:</P>
    <P>As late as February 5th, 1956, when addressing the International Conference on Human Relations in Industry, Pius XII lamented the fact <Col N="2093" /> that while dead matter emerges ennobled by industrial processes, men were there corrupted and degraded.</P>
    <P>He then said that a slow improvement was being made from that position.</P>
    <P>Later there was a reference to his Christmas message of 1942 in which he laid down five fundamental points for the peaceful order of society, which are as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  The dignity and Rights of the Human Person.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The Protection of Social Unity, and especially of the Family.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The Dignity and Prerogatives of Labour.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The Restoration of the Judicial Constitution.</P>
    <P>(v)  The Christian Conception of the State.</P>
    <P>He who would have the star of peace to shine permanently over society must do all in his power to restore to the human person the dignity which God conferred upon him from the beginning ... he must favour, by all legitimate means, and in every sphere of life social forms which render possible and guarantee full personal responsibility in regard to things both temporal and spiritual.</P>
    <P>More and more, as the days pass, Governments as such are handed more and more responsibility and are finding out more and more vocational services that they can give to the society whom they govern.  All the more, therefore, the people who elect the Government have to be sure that they can have confidence that the Government are dealing adequately and fully with those matters in which the people as a whole expect their help and guidance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposals in this Bill, the Government have set out to bring about a situation in which they will squeeze the independence out of the people.  You may have a Fine Gael man, a Farmer, a Fianna Fáil man, a Labour man or an Independent for a particular constituency and, in the <Col N="2094" /> game, Fianna Fáil against the rest, with all the astonishing crown of nationalism, achievement, and all that type of thing, around the Fianna Fáil candidate.  They hope to be at the head of the list, in any case, and to be a Government supported by, say, about 4,500 people out of 15,000.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which he claims and prays for and about his function here on earth in being the fingers of God in taking the resources He places here in this earth and moulding them to all the greatness and the beauty and the services for which they were intended.  My mind goes back again to the spirit which moved our people towards the years 1912 or 1913.</P>
      <P>France has been mentioned here. Before the Volunteers were formed, our thoughts were in touch with Europe and with Christian thought, though we were not University people. There was a Bishop in France at that time who, writing of the magnificent achievements of the 19th century, then drawing to a close, painted a world in 1875&mdash;around the time of the Franco-Prussian War&mdash;where magnificent advances in science had taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telegrams were flashing around the world with the speed of light.  The Alps were being tunnelled.  The Pyrenees were being overcome. Bridges were being built over the seas. Geology was being developed.  Unexpected developments in science which astonished the world were taking place at that time.  There was never an age, he thought, with bigger disasters surrounding it and bigger abysses under its feet.  If we today see how pygmy were the achievements that were referred to there as the achievements of the end of the 19th Century and see the advances of science and <Col N="2095" /> the abysses that open under the feet of men, of countries and of Governments today, we ought to realise, just as he was then preaching, that nothing but religion and a return to religion and the religious aspect of man and the strengthening of man's spirit, using the riches of God and dispensing them properly, could save the world from the destruction around it.</P>
    <P>What are we to do if we have an Irish Parliament trampling on individual responsibility in relation to Government and telling those who do not belong to the Fianna Fáil Party and who will not join some other Party, to be a massed Opposition here discussing the country's affairs at the Parliamentary level as two groups striving for power?  What are we to do if we destroy by Government action and Government policy the sense of responsibility and dignity in the 14,500 people whose mouths will be shut by the man who gets 4,500 votes and enters Parliament as their representative? Where does the Minister for Industry and Commerce think he is leading?  Where do we think we are leading Irish society?</P>
    <P>I have stigmatised the Taoiseach's approach to political and human matters by ascribing to him advocacy of the Machiavellian approach to policy which is enshrined in <i>The Prince.</i>  I should like the Taoiseach to tell me that I misinterpret.  I should like him to tell us, if he is instructing the people and wants to instruct the people, what he means or what the Minister for Finance means, by going to some of the hotels of Dublin to meet a Fianna Fáil convention and telling them that the people who developed the Constitution of 1922 had no conception of and no reference to God, because it is untrue.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach does he realise where he is and the cauldron of confusion, spite, and mischief he is creating for the people while he gathers himself up and departs, as it is suggested, from active political life?</P>
    <P>Unless this Parliament realises that it has no strength except from the people, no intelligence except the intelligence that is the people, you are just <Col N="2096" /> building up a kind of ascendancy spirit that certainly, whatever may happen the ascendancy, will ruin the people and destroy their strength at a vital time in the world's history.</P>
    <P>This, the 13th May, 1959, will be remarkable in history as a date to be associated with the date that the Union was passed but it will record, I hope, that Irish democracy, that is, the ordinary Irish people of every Party, creed and class, were much more wide-awake in their freedom and well able to take care of their freedom and had less difficulties in doing it than the democracy of Ireland that had to stand helplessly by while the Parliament, such as it was in Ireland at that time, was sold.</P>
    <P>I do appeal to those younger speakers from the Fianna Fáil benches who are going around the country to talk some time or another around the fire with their uncles, their fathers or their friends and get the low-down on some of the tribulations that they, as well as other people, and this House, went through from the day it was formed, particularly from the day it was established here in Leinster House internationally recognised.  If they do, they will have some chance of disentangling themselves from the web of ascendancy spite that at critical moments here is dragged around every word and every expression of opinion in this House, lest the intelligence of our people would break through.</P>
    <P>What the Government are looking forward to is the weakening of the people's grip on Parliament, the establishing of themselves as an ascendancy here.  I do not think that it would be good for them because they had every power in the world in the years in which they were in office fully and fruitfully to use Irish resources.  There was no assistance from any Party here that could have been denied to them, if it was claimed. They have not shown themselves to have that competency and I do not know how on earth, in their consciences or in their imaginations or in their intellects, they face the problems before this country if they stick their fingers in the people's eyes and if they get massed behind them a strong <Col N="2097" /> Government that will just represent a minority of the people.  If they do that, then we will have a Government here and a Parliament which has not the people's strength behind it and, caught between a weak and disappointed people and strong world events and internal difficulties, they will just all go, some day or another, into the madhouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained at the outset, the purpose of this motion, which is about to be put to the Dáil, is to see that the opportunity is given to the people to decide whether they want an amendment of the Constitution which will provide for the straight vote and single-member constituency, or whether they want to retain the present system.  It is necessary that the Bill pass or be deemed to have passed both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can be put before the people for their judgment.  It has been passed by the Dáil.  It has not been passed&mdash; it was rejected by a single vote&mdash;by the Seanad.  By this resolution we can deem it to have been passed and then it can be referred to the people by way of referendum.  An amendment has been proposed, and to me, at any rate, it simply represents a device for the purpose of delay.  It is purely a tactical device to prevent this motion from being passed if, by that device, they can prevent it from being passed.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad should consider this issue and make a report. The reasons they give for that suggestion are twofold: we would get more information about the possible consequences resulting from the change&mdash; more information as to how it has worked out in other countries&mdash;and more time would be given to the people to enable them to ponder on this question and make up their minds upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as getting more information is concerned, I doubt if any issue before this House has ever shown such research in various directions and over such a wide field.  That research proves that nothing more is likely to be got by the setting up of a Joint Committee such as that suggested in the amendment. As for getting decisions which <Col N="2098" /> might help us to decide other than what we have already decided, I think everybody knows what would happen; we would get those on one side voting for and those on the other side voting against the change.</P>
    <P>As far as giving the people more time is concerned, the people have had close on six months during which this question has been before them on public platforms throughout the country and in the reports in the newspapers of discussions here and in the Seanad.  Again, I think I am justified in saying that there is no real basis for this amendment.  It is simply a tactical device to gain time and to make it appear, perhaps, that the Opposition are more seriously concerned than, in my opinion, they are in getting time and in getting further consideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>I listened to the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Costello, speaking on this amendment some few days ago. It seemed to me he was very hard put to it, indeed, for argument when he had to take a condensed report of a speech of mine&mdash;a report which occupied a little over half a column in a newspaper. It was the report of a speech which took, I am sure, well over an hour to deliver and which would require, if it were reported verbatim, the whole side of a newspaper.  Yet, the leader of the Opposition took that condensed report.  He took from it a single sentence.  He took that sentence out of its context in order to suggest that the purpose we had in introducing this amendment to the Constitution was simply to ensure an over-all majority for Fianna Fáil in the future.  He suggested that what we had in mind was simply the fact that we could not hope to gain an over-all majority in the future and we were doing this solely for the purpose of ensuring such a majority for Fianna Fáil in the future.</P>
    <P>I thought his argument very, very poor indeed.  It was an unworthy performance really.  He took a sentence, passed away from it, came back to it again with another little twist, like the little twist one gives to advance a screw, turned it about a bit, went on a little further, turned it again until he <Col N="2099" /> was satisfied he had it turned sufficiently into the form in which he now wants people to believe it was said. What I said at that point in that particular speech was the culmination of an argument, an argument I thought a sound argument.</P>
    <P>The reason we are taking advantage of the fact that we have a majority at the moment is to give the people the opportunity of deciding this question for themselves.  I said that an over-all majority for any Party under the present system is extremely difficult to achieve.  I said that had been proved in the case of Fianna Fáil.  We did not get a majority in 1932.  It took two elections to get a majority.  We got it in 1933.  The same situation was repeated in 1937 and 1938.  It took two elections to get an over-all majority.  It took two elections again in 1943 and 1944 to get an over-all majority.</P>
    <P>We have an over-all majority now. We could not rely&mdash;and this is a fact &mdash;on over-all majorities for any Party in the future under the present system because of the development of multiplicity of Parties and because of the dispersion into multiplicity of Parties which the present system of proportional representation encourages.  One could not rely upon getting a majority, a majority such as we have at the moment.  That is a fact.  It is because one could not be certain of having a majority in the future under the present system that I felt it was our duty, with the majority we now enjoy, to give the people an opportunity of deciding this issue.</P>
    <P>It is a very important matter for them to decide.  It lies at the foundations of all our political institutions. It is the basis on which our Parliament rests.  If we want to have a good Parliament and a good Government, then it is our duty to make the foundations as secure as we can.  We believe they are not secure under present conditions.</P>
    <P>The trouble with the Opposition is that they will not face up to the arguments in this particular matter.  They are trying to get away from the arguments by alleging that Fianna Fáil is <Col N="2100" /> inspired by nothing more than narrow Party interest.  I have pointed out already that if we were inspired purely by a narrow Party point of view we would not have touched the present system.  There was no reason why we should spark off this controversy and go to all the trouble of bringing this to the people if we were thinking simply in terms of Party.  We could continue as we are.  We have a majority which would enable us to do our work.  What we are doing is using the majority we have to make the foundations of the State as secure as we can make them.</P>
    <P>I can understand why Fine Gael in particular are not prepared to face up to the arguments because the arguments are the arguments which they themselves advanced on a former occasion in favour of getting rid of proportional representation and adopting another system.  It was they who first advocated a change.  They were the first to attack the present system.  They were the first to point out its weaknesses and its defects.  On a previous occasion here I brought in a photostatic reproduction of an advertisement which they issued in 1927.  They pointed out very clearly what the weaknesses of proportional representation were.  It is really Fine Gael who are responsible for first stating the arguments for this proposed change.  This was the Fine Gael view.  They took it that proportional representation leads inevitably to multiplicity of Parties, that multiplicity of Parties leads inevitably to coalition governments, and then they went on to point out what coalition government would mean to the country.  They said it would mean bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups.  I ask is that a fact or is it not?</P>

      <P>Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;they are the same.  Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael&mdash;I do not distinguish between them.  It is simply a change of name.  The next thing was that you would have frequent changes of Government.  That is what was predicted if you had coalition government. We know that in other countries where there have been coalitions, there have been frequent changes, and we know that here two coalitions were smashed up and burst up from internal friction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frequent changes of government&mdash; and then the advertisement went on: &ldquo;a consequent depression in trade and industry&rdquo;.  Now I heard the Deputy talking a few moments ago as if he wished to do that.  &ldquo;Trade and industry&rdquo;&mdash;they must have known it very well in 1927.  When they wrote that advertisement, they knew perfectly well then how frequent changes of government, weak government, bargaining <Col N="2103" /> for place and power and all that sort of thing would influence trade and industry.  Depression in trade and industry was to follow.  I ask the people of the country to take that and use it as a test of what happened in 1948.</P>
    <P>The next point was: no progress, with stability, security and credit in constant danger.  Those were the things they said would follow coalition government.  The people have had experience of coalition government.  We believe in the future things would be even worse than that, and having got the necessary majority and opportunity, we want to see that the people will be given the opportunity, if they take it, to make the change.</P>
    <P>Now it may be suggested that it was only in 1927 that Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael, or whatever they called themselves at that time, had those views.  I thought I would bring in here another interesting exhibit. On the last occasion, I exhibited here a photostatic reproduction of the advertisement.  I have here a photostat of another very interesting document. It is the leader page of the Fine Gael organ at that time, of 10th May, 1930, <i>The Star.</i>  In <i>The Star</i> we find an excellent record of the faults of proportional representation.</P>

It said that the system of proportional representation here, though not quite as bad as that in Germany&mdash;but that was the best that could be said of it&mdash;had the ineradicable faults which attached to the system and which have exposed themselves wherever this system was in operation.  It went on then to say that before the first World War and after it, certain countries had enshrined in their Constitutions this proportional representation system, that certain &ldquo;theorisers and faddists&rdquo; had pushed their views, with the result that it had been so enshrined.</P>

      <P>Here is what this informed article said about it.  It said that there had been in Britain for a number of years a certain number of &ldquo;generously subsidised propagandist societies&rdquo; which were trying to get the British people to abandon what was their traditional system of election and to adopt proportional representation, that some of the English people were interested but that they were not convinced.  It says that the Home Rule Act of 1920, containing the proportional representation system of election, was put on to us, and here I think that Deputy Dillon must have had something to do with the writing of this article, for the words it uses are &ldquo;on the policy of trying it on the dog.&rdquo;  These kind people thought it would be a good thing to try it on the dog.  I shall go further.  I shall say that they wanted to kill the dog if they could do it.</P>

      <P>They were trying it on the dog in order to produce <Col N="2106" /> certain results which it had produced elsewhere.  That would serve British interests and not our interests.  That is why proportional representation was put into the 1920 Act. That is why I say it was thrust upon our people by the British.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the people and told the country why that was done, but many more interesting things have to come out of this article, so I shall not go off on the other trail. That matter can be dealt with again. It was introduced here, and that was the beginning of it in our Parliamentary elections.  It was brought in through a British Act of Parliament. They would not have it for themselves but, on the principle of trying it on the dog, they gave it to us.</P>
      <P>I should love to be able to read this article because it would be most interesting to do so.  The people here, it goes on to say, did not take very much interest in it.  There was a certain amount of apathy which was attributed in the article to want of experience, for the reason that the people did not know what exactly would come out of it and also because there were things of greater importance happening at that time.  So the Irish people did not kick up a great row about it.  I had something to say about it at the time. I said that we knew why they were putting it in here but that we were sufficiently strong to see that it did not produce the effects which they thought it would produce.</P>
      <P>This article then goes on to talk about what might have happened after the Treaty if there had not been proportional representation and finally it goes on to talk about the fundamental faults of proportional representation. The first thing it says about it is that it operates to be non-democratic.  This is what it says, coming from the other side.</P>

      <P>That is just what we are going to do.  We shall give the opportunity to the people to see, and I shall be surprised if the arguments behind this leading article do not still persist in the minds of those who subscribed to them at that time.</P>
      <P>The article goes on to say that in its operation proportional representation is non-democratic, that it has not shown its evil effects because of the Treaty issue dominating the political field and then it says that perhaps, in four or five years, we would reach political normality and then it would begin to reveal itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then what shall we see, it asks.  We shall see a multiplicity of Parties.  We shall see five or six of them, not strong enough to form a Government themselves, coming together and by &ldquo;selfish negotiations and backstairs intrigue&rdquo;&mdash;I am not coining these words&mdash;by &ldquo;selfish negotiations and backstairs intrigue&rdquo;, they will hammer out some sort of programme.  That programme will never have been put to the people, and therefore the democratic principles will have been violated by all these Parties who altered democratic methods: democracy itself will be set aside.  That is the argument.  These are the Cumann na nGaedheal arguments that are put forward against proportional representation.  Is it any wonder that we have the speakers on the opposite side running away from the facts?  They have not answered these things.  If these are wrong, let <Col N="2108" /> us hear them, let these things be answered.</P>

      <P>We have had this pretence that this system we have operating here is traditionally Irish. My goodness&mdash;traditionally Irish! People may talk about the long record, the centuries-old custom of the British system, but to talk of proportional representation as being traditionally Irish when one of the strongest Parties in the State from the very start opposed it, and said it was a system that would lead to multiplication of Parties and, therefore, to instability of government, is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because we believe these things are fundamentally true that we have introduced this Bill.  We believe the system does lead to instability.  We do believe that the proposed system is a much better system, that it is nearer to true democracy, nearer to true representation of the people. Deputy Mulcahy is talking about preventing people from being elected, but every citizen who can get votes can go out before a single-member constituency and get them.  Every minority <Col N="2109" /> that wants to put up a candidate can do so.  If they want to join Parties, they can do it.  We have no segregation here.  We are not trying to segregate our people into groups.</P>
    <P>We want a Parliament representative of the nation, representative at least of the people in this State, and we shall get it very much better under the proposed system.  It has been proved in practice to be a much better system than the system in which you have little groups that, in any one constituency, represent only a fraction&mdash; groups coming along and uniting behind the backs of the people.  If there is to be bargaining, let it be done in front of the people.  If the various Parties want to get together prior to a general election, they can do so, and that was the difference between 1954 and 1948.  At least it could be said in 1954 that you went before the people with a certain amount of unity.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that it would lead to domination by one Party, but surely it is the people who dominate, not an ascendancy of one Party.  Our Party is only ascendant in the sense that it gets the votes of our people and as long as it gets the votes of the people.  I hope it will have the ascendancy, in a democratic state, for the time being in order to have sufficient power to carry out its programme, to keep the orderly conditions of our State and to make further economic progress.</P>
      <P>That is the issue the people have to decide.  I do not know what way they will decide it.  I know all the Opposition Parties with their vested interests in the existing system will vote against it, and will do their best to get the people to vote against it, but I believe the people will think about the welfare of the country, and about its future, and decide that stability is much more important than having this co-called representation of groups or Parties.  The thing that has to be represented is the nation. We want to have a truly representative Parliament and we want to have a stable Government because that is the ultimate centre of power, of energy&mdash; the driving centre.  We hope the people will have such a Government that will be sanctioned by the people and have their support in carrying out their policy, the policy they have put before the people and to which the people have given their approval.</P>
