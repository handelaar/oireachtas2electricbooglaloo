    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what amount would be required to purchase at current prices the same quantity of goods as the 5/- old age pension, first granted under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, purchased in that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>While the appropriate series of retail price index numbers for this country cannot be extended to periods before July, 1914, the available evidence suggests that between 1st January, 1909, when old age pensions became payable, and <Col N="1022" /> July, 1914, retail prices rose by about 5 per cent.  On the assumption that this figure is correct it may be stated that a sum of 5/- in January, 1909, would purchase at retail the same <i>quantum</i> of goods and services (including rent) as would 24/6 at mid-November, 1958.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the great hardship and unemployment that will arise if C.I.E. abandon transport on the Grand Canal; and whether in view of the national importance of the matter he has ascertained or will ascertain from the board the reasons for the decision; and if he will make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1958, imposes on C.I.E. the general obligation to conduct the undertaking so as to eliminate losses by the 31st March, 1964.  That Act also provides for generous compensation in the event of redundancy arising as a result of steps taken by C.I.E. in compliance with this statutory obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither C.I.E. nor their predecessors were under a statutory obligation to operate services on the Grand Canal.  The Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport, established by my predecessor, indicated, in paragraph 128 of their report, that by terminating canal services and transferring the traffic to other forms of transport, the <Col N="1023" /> C.I.E. undertaking as a whole would benefit to the extent of over £100,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the board's decision on canal transport, I must make it clear that under the Transport Act I have no function in the matter, and it is not my intention to interfere in the exercise by the board of the powers conferred on them by the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that the figure which the Minister quoted is a figure dealing not merely with canal transport but also with maintenance? Is it not also clear that under the statute passed last year the canal must be maintained for a further period of three years and that therefore it is not a comparable figure for the saving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to maintenance, the canal must be maintained as long as any traders use it and some by-traders still use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that figure of £100,000 not the total of the two figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; at least that is the figure given by the Committee of Inquiry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, for the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  It was their estimate of the gain to C.I.E. by the transfer of the canal traffic to other forms of C.I.E. transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that this decision will involve the dismissal of some 120 men directly employed on the boats and the dismissal of further men indirectly employed, quite apart from maintenance men?  What proposal has he to offer to those men, most of whom come from Roberstown where there is no other winter employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as that position can be met by the possibility of transferring these men to other employment within C.I.E. it is a matter for the board.  So far as legislation deals with the matter, there is, as the <Col N="1024" /> Deputy is aware, provision for compensation on loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that this is different from the closing of a section of the C.I.E. rail undertaking?  This is the closing of an entire system, of the entire water system.  Surely therefore that is a matter of general policy to which the Minister must have advertence, both in relation to the waterway and in relation to the employment concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply, C.I.E., and their predecessors, the Great Southern Railways, were never under any statutory obligation to operate services on the Grand Canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if it is proposed to continue to use St. Mary's Chest Hospital, Phoenix Park, as a sanatorium and hospital for patients suffering from tuberculosis; and if in view of the uncertainty felt among members of the staff concerning the future of the hospital he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy no doubt gathered from my reply to a similar question which he addressed to me on this matter on the 19th March last, St. Mary's Chest Hospital, Phoenix Park, Dublin, is maintained by the Dublin Corporation for the purpose of providing institutional treatment for adult cases of respiratory tuberculosis from Dublin County Borough and Dublin County. Any proposal by the Dublin Corporation to discontinue St. Mary's as a health institution would be subject to my approval.  It has been ascertained that the corporation has no such proposal under consideration, as that body feels that St. Mary's will be required as a chest hospital, at least for some years to come.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 22, to delete &ldquo;from the members of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, and in lines 23 and 24 to delete &ldquo;from the members of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is, briefly, to provide that the members of the proposed Constituency Commission would not be drawn from amongst the members of Dáil Éireann.  I agree with the proposal to set up a commission. If the proposal to amend the Constitution and provide for single seat constituencies with the single non-transferable vote is accepted as a result of a referendum, it will require, in my opinion, a new commission&mdash; independent, competent and impartial &mdash;to determine the new constituencies. I do not believe that a commission such as is suggested in this Bill can be regarded as independent, in view of its composition.  I doubt if it would be regarded as the most competent body that could be set up; and I further doubt if its report or findings would be regarded either by the Dáil or by the public subsequently as impartial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposal set out in this Bill, the commission will be formed of seven members.  The only member <Col N="1037" /> who will not be a member of Dáil Éireann will be the chairman, who will be nominated by the Taoiseach and who will be a judge of the High Court.  Three members will be nominated by the Taoiseach, presumably from the members of his own Party in the Dáil; and three members by the Chairman of Dáil Éireann from the &ldquo;Members of Dáil Éireann who are determined by him to be in opposition and on a basis and in a manner determined by him.&rdquo; Apart altogether from the difficulty of determining who is in opposition, I suggest that the Ceann Comhairle will have considerable difficulty in nominating three members to this commission from amongst the members of this House who are not members of the Government Party.  I feel that a commission so composed will automatically be regarded as a political body.</P>
    <P>I might say that I do not share the opinions expressed on the Committee Stage last week, that a person who has political affiliations is necessarily either incompetent or impartial only to a degree.  Everybody who thinks at all has some political affiliations or views, whether or not he is a member of Dáil Éireann.  This commission will be composed entirely of members of Dáil Éireann, with the exception of the chairman.  Therefore, it must be regarded as a completely, or almost completely, politically nominated commission.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to believe that such a commission would not be divided in its deliberations.  On the Committee Stage, some examples were given of instances which might occur, where two Deputies in the same constituency or in the same county to be divided, might seek to use their influence to have the new constituency determined in a manner to suit one or the other.  If the six members of this proposed commission happened to be from six different counties&mdash;which is not an exaggerated possibility&mdash;they would personally be interested and open to influence from quite a substantial body of the electorate in this State.</P>
    <P>The report of such a commission, if it produced a unanimous report&mdash;<Col N="1038" /> which I regard as unlikely&mdash;would be open to the suggestion that it was not impartial and it would be received by the Dáil and most certainly by the public in a hostile way.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach himself pointed out during the course of his contribution on the Committee Stage, the drawing up of the new constituencies is a task which must be undertaken by competent people.  I think it is possible to set up such a commission in accordance with the views of the Taoiseach, but I suggest that to do so it would be necessary to go outside the confines of this House.  Personally, I would like to see the commission set up completely outside the confines of this House.  I would like to see such people represented on it as the Director of the Central Statistics Office.  I should like to see somebody from the Ordnance Survey Office on it and a representative from the universities, such as a professor of history or geography, together with, possibly, somebody from the Army and Garda, or possibly retired members of one or other of these forces who would have the necessary qualifications for the important task with which this commission is charged.</P>
    <P>The report of such a commission would be accepted by the House and by the people whether or not they agreed with the proposal to abolish P.R. and the single transferable vote. The public would look upon the commission as independent, impartial and the most competent body that could be got together.  They would expect its findings would be disinterested and given in the best interests of the country and that the members would carry out their task to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>As I say, apart altogether from the merit of abolishing P.R., the finding of such a commission would be accepted. That, in itself, would be one of the necessary prerequisites to the operation of the single seat, non-transferable vote system.  When speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, I mentioned that one of the essential prerequisites to the functioning of the new system is that the constituency boundaries must <Col N="1039" /> be drawn up in an independent, impartial and competent manner.  The suggestion to set up a commission as outlined in the Bill cannot, of its very nature, be either independent, impartial and may well be incompetent. Therefore, I would urge the Taoiseach to accept the suggestion I have made here, which is to provide for the recruitment of the members of this commission from outside Dáil Éireann. My view is that all the members should be drawn from outside this House.  It it possible there may be different opinions on that, but certainly a majority should not be members of the House.  It would be a better, more competent and certainly more independent body if it could be recruited along the lines my amendment suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Opposition took the view that this should be left entirely to the Oireachtas.  Now, the Deputy is suggesting that the members of Dáil Éireann should not have anything to do with it at all, so to speak.  His preference would be to have outsiders to determine it for them.  The view we take&mdash;and I think it is a sound view &mdash;is that in the commission proposed you have representatives from Dáil Éireann, both from the Government's side and from the Opposition's side, in equal numbers; that they will know, and that they will be more alive possibly than outsiders will be to any dangers that may occur from the determination of constituencies in any particular way.  You have, so to speak, people on the opposite side watching for any move by the Government to determine them so as to help their particular Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, we have taken the view that gerrymandering, in our conditions, would be a very difficult task indeed.  Certainly, at present, one cannot foresee or know what changes might occur, but as far as our community&mdash;in the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;is concerned, we are a fairly homogeneous community.  That is, taking the community as a whole, whatever differences of opinion there are, are fairly well distributed.  Therefore, gerrymandering&mdash;cutting up constituencies&mdash;would <Col N="1040" /> be an extremely difficult task, even if you wanted to do it.</P>
    <P>The commission to be set up will include representatives from both sides of the House.  They will be aware of what gerrymandering could mean for one Party or another.  It seems to me, therefore, that it is a simple committee of the House&mdash;with a judicial chairman&mdash;charged with the task of determining what the constituencies should be.  They will, of course, have at their disposal any aid that can be given by the Civil Service or any branch of the Civil Service.  If the Director of Statistics can help, he can be brought in&mdash;not as a voting member but as an expert&mdash;to give advice.  Any other civil servants could be similarly dealt with.  It would be highly undesirable to have civil servants as members of such a body.  It might not be so easy to get people.  We are trying to provide an impartial chairman, and you see the difficulties that are being raised. Every possible effort is being made in the Bill to see we will have an impartial chairman.  I think it would not be desirable to accept the Deputy's amendment.  I think it would complicate matters and would not be as good as the proposal in the Bill itself.</P>

But a woman after a second or third time, would leave no dirt in the water at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> I was rather reminded of that when I heard Deputy Russell speak about his amendment.  The Government want a simple committee.  Nevertheless, in spite of the way in which it is set up, they want Deputies on it. But Deputy Russell, having been so impressed by the Fianna Fáil line of approach to this establishment, wants to be even purer and purer and more pure than the Fianna Fáil people.  He wants to have a committee that will be clear of Deputies entirely.  He is not really going as far as he thinks. He is only doing in a small matter what the Government are doing with the Dáil as a whole, that is, to push the Dáil as a deliberative assembly out of the picture completely, to settle things in the Party rooms, to be themselves the people who will carry on the business of the country and to use the Dáil as a kind of simple rubber stamp to do the straight thing of putting into practice by law here the things that Fianna Fáil, as the national element in society here, has decided.</P>
    <P>This committee has been fairly well described, even in the short discussion which took place here previously on the Bill.  I do not want to elaborate on it.  Deputy Russell properly thinks that there are certain things the people would approve of and certain things they would not.  In spite of the fact that the people are being asked to take the Third Amendment of the Constitution Act all in one lump, instead of being able to divide it up into the three very different things in it and exercise their choice with regard to one, two, and three, the Deputy thinks there are certain things in it the people would accept and certain things they would not accept.</P>
    <P>In fact this commission is put into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill as a kind of banana, at which the people may nibble and, in nibbling, may be prepared to swallow the whole, namely, the complete abolition of P.R.  The Deputy has indicated that he believes P.R. should be abolished and even, I think, the single transferable vote.  If that is his viewpoint, then I really cannot understand <Col N="1042" /> why he is interested in the commission appointed to arrange constituencies and I cannot understand why he thinks that task should be taken out of the hands of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Every instrument Fianna Fáil can use to belittle the prestige and diminish the influence of Dáil Éireann is being used ruthlessly and, in a certain way, effectively.  The proposal that the basis upon which Parliament should be founded geographically should be taken away from Parliament itself and that the Constitution itself should be used as a kind of medium through which to remove powers from Parliament is certainly something in keeping with the wiping out of P.R., the restriction of the rights of people who ought to have a right to be candidates for Parliament, and the restriction of the rights of voters who ought to have the right to have an equal voice in the election of Parliament.  I would suggest to Deputy Russell that he put down this amendment for amendment sake; it is in keeping with the policy of those people who seek to reduce the prestige, the standing and the authority of this House as the parliamentary setup for the purpose of reflecting the people and serving the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Russell will be more willing, having heard Deputy Mulcahy's speech, to withdraw this amendment than he might have been before the Deputy spoke.  We can see from the line taken by Deputy Mulcahy what would have been said had the Government proposed that members of the Dáil should be excluded from this commission and that its membership should be drawn solely from people outside the Dáil.  Deputy Mulcahy took the opportunity to say that what Fianna Fáil want to do &ldquo;is to do away with the Dáil altogether&rdquo; and &ldquo;take everything out of the hands of Parliament&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered this matter in relation to the type of commission to be set up for the purpose of delimiting constituencies, it was decided, I think, wisely, that, although theoretically, one might get more competent people outside the Dáil, it was only right that <Col N="1043" /> members of the Dáil should participate in the work of this commission.  There will be less likelihood of members of the Dáil as a whole thinking there has been some backstairs conspiracy about the commission, if Deputies are represented on it and intimately associated with its work.  Government and Opposition will know what is going on. They will be able to put the civil servants dealing with the matter on proof as to why a particular scheme is the best scheme, rather than some other scheme.  Both sides of the House will know what is going on and that should kill to some extent the allegations of conspiracy.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, out of the 140-odd members of the Dáil, to get three from the Government and three from the Opposition competent to take a common-sense view and express a common-sense opinion as to whether any scheme proposed is a right and proper scheme.  If there is anything ludicrous in the scheme, it will be quite apparent to them.  They will be in touch with their colleagues here in the Dáil and they will be a channel through which objections may be taken before the commission and debated.  On the whole, I think the proposed system is as good as can be got.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell said Deputies would be open to influence.  He hoped they would be open to influence of a good kind.  They will be open to influence against the setting-up of constituencies which might not be suitable or which might run counter to the general principles of the Constitution.  I think the people generally will have more confidence in Deputies.  They might be much more suspicious of people whom they would not know at all as against well-known Deputies appointed from both sides of the House.  On the whole, I trust Deputy Russell will see that the proposal contained in the Bill is better than the amendment he suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I cannot understand Deputy Russell's attitude in this matter at all.  He has swallowed this Bill a few times in the <Col N="1044" /> course of discussions here and in the course of divisions here.  Why he coughs at this imperfection in the Bill is beyond me, because, of course, once Deputy Russell accepts the principle of the abolition of P.R., he is able to compound pretty well with political sin in this matter.  If that is the position, what is the purpose of complaining about any imperfections there may be in the composition of this commission?</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Russell misunderstands both the mind of the Dáil and the usefulness of outside people in a matter of this kind when he suggests the kind of commission he outlined to-day. I do not think a commission of that kind is capable of exercising the vigilance necessary in such a matter. While I have no use for this constituency commission or this Bill at all, nevertheless, if I had to express an opinion on the matter, I would say that, from the point of view of ensuring that constituencies are democratically delineated and democratically balanced, it would be much better that the balancing should be done by six members of the Oireachtas, three from the Government side and three from the Opposition side, in that at least the vigilance of one against the other would probably be a sufficient corrective of any naked gerrymandering. In any case, if such gerrymandering were attempted, there is nothing to prevent the three members of the Opposition side resigning from the commission and issuing a public statement saying that the commission was being rigged to achieve a certain purpose.</P>
      <P>Because members of the Dáil have that right and would exercise that right because they would feel an obligation to those they represented in the House, I think a commission composed of members of the Oireachtas is to be preferred to a commission of the kind suggested by Deputy Russell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Russell wants to secure his point of view and wants to prevent the proposal in the Bill from going through, the most efficacious way in which he can do that is to oppose the Bill and, certainly, to use his influence <Col N="1045" /> to have votes cast in the referendum, when it is held, against the proposal to abolish P.R.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the case Deputy Russell made on this amendment that he is not happy about what may take place under this section, but this section is just as bad as every other section in the Bill which we have discussed already.  There will be a constituency commission on which there will be three persons nominated by the Government and three persons, who will be regarded as members of the Opposition, nominated by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>We have had experience in the past of Deputies who joined the Fianna Fáil Party somewhere around 1951. Supposing those Deputies had been chosen before they joined the Fianna Fáil Party for their own personal reasons, instead of there being on the commission three members of the Government, there would be an additional member or members, as the case may be, nominated by the Ceann Comhairle who he believed were members of the Opposition and would act as an opposition on the commission.</P>
      <P>There will be only six persons on this commission formed from the Dáil.  Therefore, supposing the Referendum Bill embodying this proposal is adopted by the people, these six Deputies from six constituencies would have the arrangement of, say, 125 or 130 constituencies.  Could it be expected that those six persons, no one of whom might be familiar with West Cork, West Donegal or South Kerry, for instance, could decide fairly and squarely, in the interests of the people residing in those constituencies, the manner in which they should be arranged?  The features of the constituency must be taken into consideration, particularly the roads and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The point I wanted to make is that Deputy Russell has suggested other persons instead of <Col N="1046" /> six Deputies.  I have shown that the Deputies could not do a good job but they certainly could do a better job than six persons taken at random, who are not in the field of political activity and have no idea of the considerations that arise in connection with the organisation of constituencies and the representation of constituencies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell's suggestion that we should look outside for persons who might be able to organise constituencies is, in his opinion, an ideal one, but, in my opinion, such an arrangement is impossible.  It would be useless for the Dáil to support a suggestion without being reasonably satisfied that it would be helpful or that it would be an improvement on the proposal contained in the Bill, which has proved to be objectionable.  It is obvious that the persons whom Deputy Russell has in mind would be presented with far more difficulties regarding the arrangement of constituencies than even six Deputies would be.</P>
      <P>There would be the question of the inspection of constituencies, local inspection on the spot, local knowledge and all the other considerations which naturally will arise if an arrangement of constituencies is being carried out. It is very difficult to imagine what type of persons could be appointed to this commission.  There is also the consideration that they would have a chairman who would be subject to the President at the time, according to the provisions of this Bill, so that the President would have the same type of control as it is proposed to give him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I assume the commission will work in this fashion, that for the consideration of the commission a scheme or schemes will be drawn up in the Department of Local Government showing how the constituencies might be determined in order to satisfy the requisites which are set out in sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the <Col N="1049" /> Schedule, the directives which, as the Deputy knows, provide that the boundaries shall be drawn up &ldquo;on a fair and equitable basis, having due regard to geographical features and established administrative territorial divisions and, subject to those considerations, in such manner that the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that the draft scheme or schemes to be submitted for the consideration of the commission will be drawn up to conform as closely as possible to and to give the maximum effect to these factors.  They will be considered then by the members of the commission who will be, as has been said, drawn from the members of this House, representative, I hope, of the House as a whole.  That is the real intention behind the proposals here.  One half of the members will represent the majority of the House and the other half will represent the Deputies who dissent from the majority.  You will have in this way a commission which, in its composition, should be fair and impartial.  The commission will be thus composed of men who are very familiar with all the problems underlying this task of determining the boundaries of the constituencies.  The commission as proposed will have very close contact with the people of the country and their problems and it will be composed of men who, I assume, will be alert to see that nothing will be done which would be in any way inimical to the interests which they are supposed to represent.  Accordingly this body of investigators and supervisors &mdash;the members of the commission&mdash; will examine the draft schemes very minutely to see that the directives contained in the sub-section are carried out in the largest measure which is practicable.</P>
    <P>I do not think you could get any other body of men with the same sources of information at their disposal. Every member of that commission will probably have behind him his immediate political friends and <Col N="1050" /> perhaps a number of people who could not be described as his political friends who would be anxious to ensure that their particular part of the country would receive fair representation and their economic interests would receive fair representation.  With that background of information and all those sources of information at their disposal, I believe it would be very difficult to get a more competent body to determine this very difficult question and to do justice to every interest involved.  For that reason, I suggest that Deputy Russell, having heard the arguments for and against, might see his way to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Having listened to everything that has been said, I must confess that I do not find myself agreeing with anyone as to the purport of this amendment, and I am afraid that includes its proposer.  It seems to be assumed that the effect of this amendment would be to exclude members of Dáil Éireann from the commission, whereas, as I read it, and found myself in agreement with it, it appeared to me to widen the membership, so that if, say, the Opposition had someone who was not a sitting member but whom they would like to see on the commission, this would give them the opportunity of putting that person on, and likewise the Government.</P>
      <P>I take it that is the purport of the amendment and I think I may fairly claim that is the effect the amendment would have.  Supposing the amendment were accepted, if the Government felt they wanted three sitting Fianna Fáil Deputies on the commission, the amendment as inserted will not prevent them from putting them on.  Similarly, the Opposition will not be prevented from putting three sitting Opposition Deputies on the commission. It would leave each side a little more scope in the selection of the three people.  May I say this, too?  Having heard some of the Opposition speakers, I am more in favour of Deputy Russell's amendment because if they bring that type of mind to bear on the consideration of the constituencies, I think it would be much better for their own sakes to find people who are not sitting members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> An attempt was made to throw a cloud over this commission in regard to the way it will work.  In some mysterious way, the country is to be divided up into constituencies which will return people of a certain political point of view.  Considering that, it might not be any harm if the commission were wide enough to allow someone outside sitting Deputies in this House to be on it, someone who the people might feel, although he was long enough in opposition, had not quite the same personal interest as a sitting member would have in the reallocation of seats.  That is the point from which I started off, looking at the amendment without hearing anything about it at all.</P>
    <P>I must confess that my opinion has been somewhat shaken by the Minister for External Affairs.  I had not thought of the precise angle that what is proposed to be sent up is a parliamentary committee.  When one stops to think of it from that angle, I must confess that I would be very much swayed by the opinion that this is a parliamentary matter and that it would probably be better in the long run that it should be dealt with by a parliamentary committee. To do anything else might very well give the impression that we had no faith in ourselves.  There are quite a number of people in the country who already have that impression without our giving it to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Russell seems to fear that if members of this House deal with the constituencies, they will be too concerned with their own particular interest to give their unbiassed attention to the matter.  If you have three members from each side of the House, provided they are satisfactory members from the Opposition point of view, they will be able to consult with their own colleagues. It is only natural that, when we come to consider the constituencies, <Col N="1052" /> they would be likely to consult.  Any fears the Deputy has on that point may be dispelled.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach points out that this is an unbiassed commission.  That may be.  It may sound all right on paper.  You have three members of the Government, three members from the Opposition and an impartial chairman. With respect to your ruling, Sir, I feel that the President does come into this commission.</P>

      <P>The three members of the Opposition, no matter who they are, are, according to the Taoiseach, able to voice their opinions so as to make this form of the commission absolutely unbiassed in every way.  I submit that the three members of the commission are not really in a position to offer an opinion, whether they are members of Dáil Éireann or the Civil Service or from whatever source they come.  If they do not agree with the other side's suggestion with regard to the limiting of the constituencies, they are not allowed to issue any report whatever in regard to the matter.  As Deputy Norton said, they can resign. That is the only redress they have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell wants to change the commission because he thinks that to have six members of the Oireachtas on the commission is not right because they might have a biassed point of view.  The Taoiseach says the fairest way is to have three members from one side of the House and three members from the other.  I disagree with both.  It does not matter where the three members will come from. They are not allowed to issue a report if they hold a contrary opinion.  If they try to issue a report they will not be allowed to do so and their only redress, therefore, is to resign.  As the commission is proposed to be constituted, I do not think it really matters who is on it.  I do not think it is a fair commission from beginning to end.</P>

There is quite an amount of evidence available in the speeches made here to-day, but it would be uncharitable for people to pursue that line of thought because the members who have spoken have been more or less driven into the position of defending or praising what is embodied in the Bill as an alternative to the amendment suggested by Deputy Russell.

      <P>The amendment of Deputy Russell has given an opportunity to the Government to say: &ldquo;Well, now, your amendment is far more extreme than our proposition and really we have more respect for Dáil Éireann in our proposal than Deputy Russell has shown.&rdquo; There is no question in the world but that the implication of this amendment is the members of this House are not satisfactory persons to be on such a commission, whether or not we agree with the setting up of this commission.  I think Deputy Sheldon was perfectly correct in his condemnation, in his concluding remarks.  There are people outside who have contempt for this House and it is a bad day when Deputies of this House themselves show a lack of faith in the membership of the House by suggesting that it would be better to constitute this type of commission from outside this House.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to allow myself to be led&mdash;because I disagree so much with this amendment&mdash;into pointing out the virtues of the section itself; that is the danger I see.  That is why I think the Government are not a bit embarrassed by the fact that this amendment went down on the Order Paper.  If there were no other choice available to me, and if this entire Bill goes through and if the people pass it, and if the only alternatives were Deputy Russell's amendment and the proposition of the Government then, at that stage, I would not have the slightest hesitation in accepting the Government's proposition rather than the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was interested to <Col N="1055" /> hear the Minister for External Affairs say that, when and if the House adopts the Government's proposals relating to the setting-up of this commission, both sides of the House will know what is going on.  If he is so desirous of having the House so completely conversant with what is going on, surely the thing to do would be to revise the constituencies as they have been revised before&mdash;and they were never revised under any Government but a Fianna Fáil Government. The Minister for External Affairs talks of conspiracy.  Surely, in relation to suspicion and allegations that may arise in connection with the delineation of constituency boundaries, the best way to tackle the matter would be to do so in this House in the full light of day.</P>
      <P>We do not see any merit in Deputy Russell's amendment but neither will we permit the Minister for Health to use that situation as indicating in some way an easement of our opposition to the Government's proposals or that we are in any way sympathetic to their proposals.  There are often more than two points of view and here, definitely, there are more than two points of view.</P>
      <P>I agree that, outside the membership of Dáil Éireann, it would be virtually impossible to find people with the fund of experience and information which members of this House have.  This is a subject which is particularly peculiar to the members of the House.  With regard to those who set out at any time to revise constituencies, those who constitute the commission, officials in the Department of Local Government, whose responsibility it was to advise on former occasions, have all the advice and all the material at their command which they would require.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach intervened and referred to the fact that we are a homogeneous community and that in such a community gerrymandering is an evil which finds it very difficult to raise its head.  Nevertheless, he paid a fine tribute to the system of election we have had for the past 40 years when he referred to the homogeneousness of our people.</P>

      <P>I shall try not to. I feel that the members of this House should decide on the delineation of constituencies.  I feel that any outside group could not possibly do the work which will have to be done.  Consequently, we oppose the amendment and still more strongly do we oppose the Government's proposals in relation to the commission.  We do not accept that our opposition to the amendment can in any way be construed as any change in our attitude towards the entire commission.  We feel that, in the light of day, the whole House should decide and express the final voice on the boundaries of constituencies and that all that happened preparatory to the furnishing of a report should be brought into the open.  In that way, we feel we would obviate any charges of conspiracy that might arise.</P>
      <P>In calling upon such a minute number of members of the House I think we are requiring them to do an extraordinary job of work and one which will place them in a very awkward position.  It might be said, no matter how fairly they may attack it, that they will be influenced by their personal considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, we are in the situation, at this stage, in relation to the Bill, that no amendment can be forwarded which will counter the obvious defects in the Government's proposal but, at any rate, we do not think the present amendment would in any way ease the situation thrown up by the Government's decision completely to disorganise what has been the practice in the past.  We cannot see either in the Bill itself or in the amendment anything which would in any way be a <Col N="1057" /> suitable substitute to the system we have had, despite the fact that we have known that system to be abused.</P>

      <P>I suppose any discussion is better than no discussion.  I got the impression from some of the speakers that they had forgotten what they said on the Committee Stage of this Bill against this very commission, the membership of which they are now defending.  During the two months of this debate, this is the first sign of unanimity I have seen, even if it be only in opposition to my amendment. At least it is some encouragement that when the commission, in its suggested form, gets down to work there will be a suggestion that they will agree on the task allotted to them, assuming, of course, that the referendum goes through.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear from the Taoiseach and Ministers of his Government an outline of the mechanics of the operation of this committee.  Reading literally from the Bill, I assumed the commission, as such would be charged&mdash;and they only&mdash;with the outlining of the constituencies and the drawing-up of the various boundaries. The Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs and other speakers have clarified that point to my satisfaction by saying that, before this commission enter on their task, they will be presented with the suggested outline of constituencies by experts, presumably from the Department of Local Government and possibly other Departments. I think the Taoiseach described the commission as more in the nature of watchdogs to ensure that any question of suggested gerrymandering would not arise.  I must admit it puts rather a different complexion on the work of the commission and its operations from what I deduced from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the intent of my amendment was misunderstood by some speakers. Some speakers referred to getting <Col N="1058" /> these members at random and putting them on this commission.  I thought, when speaking on the introduction of this amendment, I specifically stated from where and what members of the commission might be recruited. Furthermore, in the second of my two amendments, I made it quite clear that the three members from the Opposition side of the House would be recruited by the Ceann Comhairle, after consultation with the Opposition, so that even if the six members were drawn from outside this House three would be nominated by the Taoiseach and three would virtually be nominated by the Opposition.  In that way the balance, as provided for in this Bill, would be preserved irrespective of whether the membership came from the Dáil or outside.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton will forgive me if, as a very junior member of this Dáil, I do not understand their arguments and their remarks in regard to my attitude to this Bill and my attitude in putting down this amendment.  If I understand the procedure of Dáil Éireann correctly the Committee Stage on which these amendments were first put down is the stage on which there is general discussion on the details of a Bill.  If any Deputy has any constructive suggestion to make whereby sections or a section of a Bill can be altered for the better, that is the stage on which he puts down the amendments and a discussion presumably takes place.</P>
    <P>I do not think that cuts across a Deputy's right to defend or support a Bill in principle.  If I am right again, I remember Deputy Norton arguing very vehemently at the start of the Committee Stage for the right to argue the Bill section by section because, as he pointed out, a Deputy might be in favour of certain sections and against others, and he wanted to preserve the right&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;to vote for or against each section whether or not he opposed the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>In putting down this amendment I was merely taking advantage of my position to suggest what I thought might make an improvement in regard <Col N="1059" /> to the setting up of this commission. I would be out of order if I referred again to my arguments in connection with the abolition of P.R. and the single transferable vote.  I made my attitude on that perfectly clear and, having done that, I think I have the right to suggest amendments, whether they are accepted or not, just as other members of the Dáil have the right to argue against them if they wish.  I believe it is helpful at this stage for somebody to put down amendments which he regards as desirable, however ridiculous they may appear to some Deputies.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the discussion on the various stages of this Bill for the past two months, I could not see how any six members of this Dáil could sit down and hope to reach unanimity.  However, from the remarks made on both sides this afternoon I have rather more hope now. Even if it is only a question of arguing that a commission, such as is proposed by the Government, is better than a commission composed on the lines of my amendment, we will have made some advance.  In withdrawing the amendment I express the hope that the commission will meet in the amicable spirit in which the Taoiseach hopes it will meet and that it will go ahead and carry out its task competently and impartially.</P>

    <P>Section 7. 1º of the Schedule reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Until the date of the dissolution of Dáil Éireann occurring next after the 15th day of April, 1961, or occurring next after such earlier date as may be determined by a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann, Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent the constituencies determined by the law in force on the 1st day of January, 1959, and all elections for membership of Dáil Éireann, including the filling of casual vacancies, shall take place in accordance with that law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish this section to read so that it will be quite clear to the Dáil and to the country that it is not the intention to have a general election before 1961. When the Government brought in this Bill they gave two paramount reasons for doing so, (1) that they probably would not have the opportunity of a majority here again and (2) that it was for the purpose of political stability and for the purpose of securing strong Government.  This Government has an overall majority of 20 and in a comparatively small Parliament such as this anyone could consider that a strong and stable majority.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in the early stages of this discussion said that a strong Government is necessary so that a Government may implement its policy.  This Government in the ordinary way has a period of five years from the time it was inaugurated.  That is a period in which they could implement any policy they wished to implement.  Deputies will realise there has not been any very great implementation of policy, so far as political debate goes, within the past three months, nor has there been very much opportunity of doing so.  Some Minister may leap up when I have <Col N="1061" /> concluded and say we have prevented any business being discussed other than this Bill.  The Opposition have duties to perform and one of their duties is to go thoroughly into any form of legislation proposed.  Every fairminded person whether he is inside or outside Dáil Éireann will realise that an Opposition is only doing its duty in going through every section of this legislation conscientiously and in a painstaking way because this legislation proposes to amend the Constitution, and the amendment of the Constitution is a vital step in the life of any nation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will accept this amendment and I cannot see how they can reasonably reject it.  The life of this Parliament will then be assured until 1961.  That is not a very long period.  It means that the Government will have been in power for four years.  If anybody opposite can convince me that there is any reason why these few lines, that I want deleted, should be in the Bill, I would be very willing to listen to any reasonable argument that may be adduced.  If the referendum goes through, of course, any discussions that we are having on the legislation here must bear directly on the referendum.</P>
    <P>The referendum is associated with this Bill and if the referendum goes through I do not know who the Taoiseach will be.  He may be the present Taoiseach or there may be some other person, but he might quite reasonably say to himself that Deputies no longer represent, as a result of the referendum if it be passed, the particular constituencies to which they were elected and, therefore, it is necessary for the country to decide.  Whether he does or does not do that, my argument is that if those lines are deleted it does create political stability.  It creates the situation that even assuming the referendum goes through, if it does go through, Deputies are still considered to represent their constituencies until the 15th April, 1961, independent of any resolution that Dáil Éireann may pass on the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> I think that is reasonable.  I think it is a reasonable request to make to the Government, and I think it would be acceptable to the country.  As a public representative going round the country, I have not met anyone who wants an immediate dissolution of the Dáil.  People may be discontented with the Government but generally speaking, when the people returned this Government, they expected that they would implement some sort of a policy.

      <P>In some ways it does, because I am trying to give the Government an opportunity of implementing their policy if they accept this amendment.  The grave risk is that if they do not accept this amendment they will run out to the country again as they have done before. I would say, therefore, it is reasonable to ask the Taoiseach and his Government to accept this amendment, and the main plea for that is political stability.  That is the argument that they themselves have used.  But, if they can show me that, by leaving this as it is, we still could be assured of political stability, in that case I want something more than the word of a Minister.  I want some definite proof that we shall have political stability, and then I will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>It is not my experience that any Government with an assured majority would run to the country.  For what purpose would they? Why would a Government with an assured majority dissolve Parliament? They usually dissolve it to try to get a bigger majority.  Usually they go to the country when their parliamentary position demands it, or when some other question of public interest would demand it.  Therefore, I think the Deputy can be assured that no Government that has a parliamentary majority, and has work to do, is likely to dissolve Parliament.</P>

      <P>If a position like that arose I do not think it would be wise not to let the people decide.  I am told that it is likely that the earliest date by which the constituencies could be determined and everything made ready for the holding of an election under the new system and a new register would be about April 15th, 1961, the date that is mentioned here. That is, in all probability, the earliest time when the new register and everything would be ready for the new system; but we have to provide for all sorts of things that could happen, and if it should be in the interests of the country that there should be an election before that, and if things were ready, and an election had to be called, the matter could be settled by a resolution of the Dáil.  It would be very unwise to tie ourselves up and say that, no matter what happens, when the work was completed&mdash;it could not be done before that&mdash;we could not have a general election on the new system to test public opinion.  I do not think it would be wise that that should be prevented.  I think the Bill is much more satisfactory, from the point of view of the public interest, as it is and the amendment proposed by the Deputy, therefore, cannot be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to <Col N="1064" /> make in favour of the amendment is that the present Government got a substantial majority in the last election, regardless of how they secured it. Several times during the course of this debate it was stated by the Taoiseach and others that they were now using this majority in order to put before the people, in a referendum, an issue which, in the opinion of the Government, could not be determined by the people if they had not this substantial majority.  This Bill is being put through by this substantial majority, however it was obtained, and the result is that it is going to be placed before the people for their decision in the form of a referendum.</P>
      <P>This is only one of the many things that the Government could do during their period of office while they hold their present substantial majority.  As I say, when this matter has been decided one way or the other, the Government will still have a majority in this House to implement a policy, if any, during the authorised period of five years from February, 1957, when they secured their majority in the election of that year.  They are entitled to stay here in Parliament for a period not exceeding five years.  They are just finishing their second year now and, when this issue is decided one way or the other it could reasonably be expected that the Government will set about some others of the many major problems confronting the country.  That is why I am in favour of the amendment moved by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, because he puts it fair and straight to the Government to tell the people now that they are asking them for a decision on an issue that can be put to them, in the opinion of the Government, only in the present circumstances, and that a decision is being asked from them one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is being put up to the Government now to say that when this issue is decided, they will avail of the majority which they secured in 1957 to implement the policy which was promised to the people, and to stay in Government so long as they have the majority and the confidence of the <Col N="1065" /> people.  I think it is a very reasonable proposition to put up and it should be embodied in the legislation, now that we are discussing this matter, realising very clearly that the majority at the present time is being used in order to have this particular issue decided.  It is a pity it was not decided in a general election.</P>

This is a specific matter.  We are asking for a specific decision from the people and when it has been disposed of we expect the Government to carry on with the work.

      <P>If the question of shortening the life of this Dáil has arisen, it has arisen because of the fact that the Government, by what they are doing, by what they are attempting to perpetrate, brought about political instability. It is because of the fact that there was a Government in office with a substantial majority, capable of pushing through this House, without hindrance, any measure they wished to enact.  In those circumstances, they brought down on their own shoulders the question of this referendum. Should the referendum fail to secure the support of the people, and the indications are that it will so fail, then <Col N="1066" /> the Government will be in the position that they will have lost the stability they enjoyed up to the time they initiated all this business of changing the electoral system.  It is in consequence of that that the whole question of stability arises.  The Taoiseach may smile.  The Taoiseach intervened and posed a question: &ldquo;Why should any Government with a comfortable majority run to the country?&rdquo;&mdash;as if he has forgotten that he is the man who ran to the Park in 1947, when he had a comfortable majority.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will recall very clearly that there was a very poor view taken of his action in those days by his own supporters.  The Taoiseach was in this House when Deputy Cowan was sitting on the benches opposite and we can remember him telling us that he had an assurance from the Taoiseach that the Government elected in 1951 would not end their term of office until 1956. Repeatedly, the Deputy who voted for the election of the Taoiseach in 1951 told us&mdash;it is on the records of this House&mdash;that he had been guaranteed that the Government would not resign until their full term of office was up. Consequently, in view of our experiences, surely we can ask what the Government propose to do, if they suffer a reversal in the referendum? It is in that situation, not brought down upon the Government by the Opposition, but by their own action in this regard, that we are posing the question: &ldquo;Will the Government permit, if the referendum is passed, the various organisations of the country at large to gear themselves up to the new situation before a new election is launched upon them or react to the people's rejection of the present proposals just as the Taoiseach reacted to the results in three by-elections&rdquo;?</P>

The next thing is that you will deprive&mdash;at least Deputy Esmonde has admitted that he seeks to deprive&mdash;the people of the right to decide an issue of some fundamental importance if required by the Taoiseach of the day to do so.  I think that is an absurd interference with the rights of the electorate under the Constitution. If the people decide in favour of this referendum, as I presume they will, surely we should take all steps to implement that decision as soon as possible, and with the greatest expedition. After we have taken the steps to implement the people's decision, if it should become necessary to dissolve the Dáil, why should the people not be entitled to have the benefit of their decision?  That is what the mover of the amendment says they are not entitled to.  He says that, irrespective of what the people may decide at the referendum&mdash;and the assumption underlying all the speeches, of course, is that the decision will go one way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When the people have decided that issue, if it should be necessary later to have an election and the machinery for giving effect to the people's decision has been set up, why should the people not have the benefit of their decision?  I cannot see any reason why we should be estopped from proceeding on the basis of a new system, if by any chance it is necessary to appeal to the people again.  Of course I do not think it will be necessary to appeal to them.  As Deputies have said, there is a strong majority in the House.  I doubt if the people at a general election will vote to be thrown into the conditions of chaos and confusion which existed here before the general election of 1957.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said that the earliest date on which they would be ready for a general election under the new system would be the date mentioned here, 15th April, 1961.  Of course, that is not true.  No matter how long a delay there is on this Bill we can accept it on the strength the Taoiseach has, the strong majority he has, that it will be steamrolled through the House. I do not think any Deputy need doubt that.  Also the commission has to be set up within a limited period and if the commission has not agreed at the end of six months, the chairman will issue a report on behalf of the commission. That takes seven months.  If the Taoiseach tots up the figures, he will find that if he wants to have a general election, as I now believe he does, having heard what the Minister for Health has said, he can have it far sooner than 15th April, 1961.</P>
      <P>It has been said over there that we are afraid of a general election, that we want the Government to stay there. Nobody wants the Government to stay, but every Deputy has a duty to the people and if this Government were elected, whether rightly or wrongly, under false pretences, why should we in any way agree to legislation to let them play about with the Irish people? That is just what they are doing. Whatever doubts I had on the question, the Minister for Health has let the cat out of the bag.  The purpose of this is to change the electoral system, if they can, and as soon as they have done that, try to have a snap election and perpetuate themselves in power.  I have absolutely no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted, it is then the will of the people and it is embodied in legislation in accordance with the Constitution.  That knocks down the argument of the Minister for Health.  There is no reason why the amendment should not be accepted and there is no reason why the Government, if they were genuine in what they say, should lose faith.  They said when introducing the Bill that it <Col N="1071" /> was <i>pro bono publico,</i> that it was generally desired and that they were introducing it because it would bring stability in the country.  I put down this amendment to give the Government an opportunity of proving to the Irish people that they genuinely want stability.  It does not matter whether the amendment goes through or not; I am perfectly satisfied now that they do not want stability, that they are running away from the issue and that they have got a majority under false pretences.  They are not able to &ldquo;deliver the goods&rdquo; to the people.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, it is not the first time it has happened.</P>

      <P>To delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first purpose of these amendments <Col N="1072" /> in the form in which they are stated is to get rid of the system by which amendments to an existing statute or statutes are dealt with by reference in a Schedule.  That may be from the point of view of the draftsman an extremely useful method of drafting and rather more easily done than in the body of the Bill but it has led, as we all know, to complications in debate and discussions in this House.  My first purpose in these amendments is to take away the Schedule so that there will be no difficulty from the point of view of the rules of order.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these two amendments is really to get rid of what I described I think&mdash;if I did not do so. I shall do so now&mdash;on the Second Reading of this Bill as a ridiculous proposal.  The proposal originally in the Bill in sub-section (1) (b) was really to take in what was provided in Section 15 of the Referendum Act, 1942 at sub-section (5).  That sub-section provided:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a constitutional referendum, the proposal which is the subject thereof shall be stated on the ballot paper in the same terms as nearly as may be as such proposal is stated in the Bill containing such proposal passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this sub-section obviously was that voters at a referendum should have some notion of what they were about.  The only way they could get that was either by discussion outside this House, following discussion inside the House, and then on the ballot paper but the proposal here, when the Bill originally came, was that instead of telling the voters anything about what was in the Bill there was merely given the Short Title of the Bill which, under the existing constitutional and other provisions, is, in fact, very much longer than the Long Title of the Bill.  That seemed to me to be so absurd that suspicions were raised in our minds about the amendment.</P>
    <P>These amendments were put down in order to embody in this Bill something which we think ought to be contained in the Bill and govern not merely the constitutional referendum <Col N="1073" /> which we have been debating here for some weeks past but also all future referenda.  Deputies must remember that the Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1958, has on its face no particular reference to the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill we have been discussing for abolishing P.R. P.R. is not mentioned anywhere in this Bill at all nor is the Bill we have been discussing mentioned in it.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to settle the procedure not merely for the proposed referendum on the abolition of P.R. but for all future referenda.  Therefore, we must approach the consideration of this Bill from that very special point of view. I think there can be no doubt whatever that it is absurd to suggest the voters will have the remotest notion what is in the proposed amendment to the Constitution merely by having their attention directed to the technical Short Title of the Bill.  That is what the proposal is.  It is utterly indefensible.</P>
    <P>What is intended to be done by these amendments in my name is, first of all, that the ballot paper shall be in a different form from that in which it is in the Schedule of the present Bill. Certainly, it will revert more or less substantially, with certain improvements suggested by these amendments, to the form set out in the Schedule to the Referendum Act, 1942.  The ballot paper shall contain a column wherein there shall be stated in concise clear language&mdash;popular language if you like &mdash;the principal proposals in the Bill to amend the Constitution in such a way that voters will have some notion about what they are voting.  Surely that is a principle that ought to appeal to any person of any common sense in substitution for the ridiculous proposal contained herein?</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, that the ballot paper, instead of being in the very tendentious and very misleading form it is in the First Schedule to the present Bill, should take the form I have set out in the First Schedule in these Amendments.  That contains, first of all, what is really the form of the ballot paper which was in the Referendum Act, 1942, except that I have, I think, improved it by putting the phrase &ldquo;instructions for marking the paper&rdquo; at <Col N="1074" /> the very top of the ballot paper.  Then we have: Do you approve or do you not approve of the proposal stated becoming law?</P>
    <P>What was in the Referendum Act, 1942, was: &ldquo;Do you approve or do you disapprove of the proposal stated in the first column below becoming law?&rdquo; I have taken that sentence out of the Schedule to the Act of 1942, making one change in it.  Instead of the words: &ldquo;Do you approve or do you disapprove&rdquo;, I suggest: &ldquo;Do you approve or do you not approve&rdquo;.  That is a much simpler way of putting it to the very simple people who may vote on this referendum and who might not know. I think that is an improvement.</P>
    <P>The next two paragraphs of this form of ballot paper are taken up from beneath the form of the ballot paper in the Schedule to the Referendum Act, 1942, thus making the matter clear without in any way affecting the principle of the ballot as set out in the Schedule to the Act of 1942.  Then you have: &ldquo;If you APPROVE of the proposal, place the mark &lsquo;X&rsquo; in the second column under the word &lsquo;YES&rsquo;&rdquo;.  Then it goes on.  &ldquo;If you DO NOT APPROVE of the proposal, place the mark &lsquo;X&rsquo; in the third column under the word &lsquo;NO&rsquo;&rdquo;.  Then the three columns follow.  We have on the left hand side the column for the proposal. I hold that there is set out there a concise, clear statement of the principal provisions of the Constitution Bill which is the subject of the referendum.</P>
    <P>That can be done simply, concisely, clearly and very shortly.  There is not the slightest shadow of doubt about that.  The present proposal to change the Constitution by abolishing the principle of P.R. in elections is, in its present form, almost impossible to read; but notwithstanding that, when you digest it, you find only three proposals in it, which can be stated very shortly and simply: the abolition of P.R., the substitution of the single non-transferable vote and the setting up of a commission.  Those three principles can be stated very concisely in the column headed &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;. <Col N="1075" /> Similarly, any other Bill can be digested in the same way and the provisions set out, so that the voter can know what he is doing.  I have headed the other columns with &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  In order to make the thing absolutely clear, because there may be some trouble by reason of the words &ldquo;approve&rdquo; or &ldquo;disapprove&rdquo; or &ldquo;approve&rdquo; or &ldquo;do not approve&rdquo; being used, I put down &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tá&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; really mean &ldquo;approve&rdquo; or &ldquo;disapprove&rdquo;.  Anybody looking at that and asked: &ldquo;Do you approve or disapprove?&rdquo; will know what &ldquo;approve&rdquo; means.  If you approve, put &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tá&rdquo;; if not, put &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Such a person will know exactly what he is doing.  That is a simple form of ballot paper, addressed to people who may not know precisely what they are doing or what they are asked to do.</P>
    <P>This Constitution Amendment Bill is the first referendum going to the people.  It is of the utmost importance. If there is to be any validity attached at all to those words so much bandied about in this debate, particularly by members of the Government, &ldquo;the will of the people&rdquo;, if they are to have any effect or validity, it must be clear and demonstrable that the will of the people has been expressed with full knowledge of what they are doing.  Therefore, they should know precisely what they are doing; otherwise, the voting may not really express what people wish or people may not come out to vote because they do not know what they are asked to vote about.</P>
    <P>That is not mere theoretical argument at all.  Anybody who hears discussion of the Government's proposal outside knows there is a great deal of disturbance, disquiet and wonderment about what it is all about.  That is not political argument.  It is a mere statement of fact.  If there is to be any validity in this argument, which has been bandied about in various contexts and in utter irrelevancies from time to time&mdash;that the will of the people is to be expressed&mdash;then it must be expressed after they have been fully <Col N="1076" /> informed and with full knowledge of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I think this ballot paper is simple and clear and is a vast improvement on the proposed ballot paper, which gives no information whatever or no information of any validity.  It starts off in the First Schedule to the Bill: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&rdquo; I asked, and got no reply, to the question: Why were the words &ldquo;or do you disapprove&rdquo; left out?  Then you have &ldquo;Tá, Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nil, No&rdquo;. You have the position where, under the proposals in the Bill, the ballot paper faces the not too well educated voter and asks: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&rdquo; The Short Title of the Bill is given, as being as the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, which means nothing to him.  Then he has &ldquo;Tá, Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nil, No&rdquo;.  He is being asked to approve of the proposal. He says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  What do you do if he does not approve?  Why is it not put to him clearly to approve or disapprove?</P>
    <P>Another portion of the amendment deals with fundamental matters also.  I have already dealt with the question of the form of the ballot paper and what should be in it.  I propose also to amend the provision in Section 15 of the Referendum Act, 1942, by inserting other matters.  I have dealt with sub-section (1), the form of the ballot paper.  Sub-section (2) is the same amendment as the Minister desires and is set out in the Schedule.  There is no change in that.  Sub-section (3) is a radical amendment.  I do not ask the Minister to go back to what might be said were the complicated provisions of the 1942 Act.  I suggest an easier way than merely giving the Short Title of the Bill.  I suggest that sub-section (5) shall cease to have effect and, instead of it, there should be inserted the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a constitutional referendum a summary of the proposal which is the subject thereof shall be stated on the ballot paper in simple and <Col N="1077" /> concise language so that the voter may understand the principal provisions of such proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely there cannot be any argument against that suggestion?  Anybody can take even the most complicated Bill and state it in simple and concise language.  If anybody suggests that it would be difficult and that you must have the whole Bill or half the Bill set out, the answer is in the words stated there.  First of all, you have what are the principal proposals.  Having ascertained those, you can state them in simple and concise language that is easily understood.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the present Bill&mdash; a complicated Bill with all sorts of provisions.  There are three principal proposals in it: the abolition of P.R., the establishment of single member constituencies with the single nontransferable vote and the setting up of a commission to define the boundaries. That can be stated in simple and clear language.  The voter then knows what he is asked to do.  He has been informed by debates in the House and discussions outside and he is able to make up his own mind.  I cannot see that there could be any possible objection to the suggestion I put there. You do not need a constitutional lawyer to do what I ask to have done. In fact, you do not require any lawyer. It can be done in layman's language, in popular language.  The authority for doing that will be the section in the Act I propose to insert.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) is really the same as the Minister's amendment.  I am just leaving it as it stands.  There are two amendments proper, therefore, and the Schedule I set out is, in my submission to the Dáil, an improvement, which will give the voter the information he is entitled to and which will lead to the proper expression of the wishes of the voters and generally the wishes of the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Then, the proposal in the ballot paper will show in concise and clear language&mdash;not necessarily legal language&mdash;the effect of the principal proposals of the Bill.  Accordingly, the people can know what they are doing.</P>

      <P>The purpose of my amendment No. 2 is to clarify for the benefit of the voter the main provisions of the intent of the Referendum (Amendment) Bill.  I should like to refer to the Minister's remarks when introducing the Bill on the Second Stage.  Under the Referendum Act, 1942, the form of ballot paper to be used at the referendum contains a space in which the proposal which is the subject of the referendum is to be set out.  The voter is asked to state whether he approves or disapproves of the proposal becoming law. The Act provides that in the case of a constitutional referendum &ldquo;the proposal must be stated on the ballot paper in the same terms as nearly as may be as such proposal is stated in the Bill containing such proposal, passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest that the form of ballot paper as set out in the Bill does not conform with the provision that the proposal &ldquo;is stated on the ballot paper in the same terms as nearly as may be as such proposal is stated in the Bill containing such proposal&rdquo; and my amendment is for the purpose of inserting in the space underneath the question: &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&rdquo; the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, which provides for the abolition of the system of P.R. by means of the single transferable vote and the substitution of single-seat for multi-seat constituencies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that is possibly the most concise form in which one could set out in the space provided the purpose of the Bill.  Giving less information would <Col N="1079" /> not, to my way of thinking, provide the voter with reasonable information as to the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the position of incapacitated voters.  As the Bill stands, an incapacitated voter will simply be told: &ldquo;This is the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.&rdquo; My amendment brings to the attention of the voter the main provisions of the Bill&mdash; the abolition of P.R. and the creation of the single-seat instead of the multi-seat constituency.  I suggest that is the minimum information to which any voter, incapacitated or otherwise, is entitled.</P>
    <P>During his Second Reading speech the Minister advanced the following argument at column 114 of Volume 172 of the Official Report in support of the form of ballot paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...We found that because of the situation as now contained in sub-section (5), Section 15 of the Referendum Act of 1942, we would be compelled to include in any ballot paper we might issue all that is contained, literally word for word and line for line, in the Third. Amendment of the Constitution Bill which is before the House at present. We would have to put it all in...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think everybody accepts there are obvious practical difficulties.  The Minister suggested that the Bill could be made available at post offices and in other public buildings.  It was suggested by Deputy Corish, I think, that copies of the Bill might be sent to voters.  I take it that would be a very expensive procedure and, apart from that, I assume very few would read it.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the circumstances, the simplest way is to set out in the space provided on the ballot paper the main purposes of the Bill. They have been discussed here over the past two months and they will be easily understood and appreciated by the ordinary voters.  Whether or not the Minister accepts my amendment, or makes some minor alteration.  I think the voter is at least entitled to the information set out in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the conclusion of my speech on the Second Reading that I was willing to consider any and every suggestion that might come from the Opposition.  In our deliberations on this Bill we ourselves have gone into the whole matter thoroughly and we do not find it as simple as Deputy Costello would now give the House to understand to find a formula incorporating any or all of the information he suggests should be conveyed clearly and precisely to the electorate. I have listened to the speakers here and I have read the speeches of Deputies who believe that the Bill contains as many as three issues.  Others hold that it really contains only one issue, others that it contains more than three issues.  While it is suggested we should get a summary, concise, clear, and simple in the interests of all concerned, I think Deputies opposite are well aware that it is not so easy to get a simple, precise summary which will be acceptable to everybody and to all Parties in this House.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggested here is one which I do not think, judging by what has been said so far at any rate, will give effect to the wishes of those who propose it.  Incorporating the entire Bill in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (5) of Section 15 of the 1942 Act would be&mdash;I think this is agreed by all&mdash;a ridiculous procedure. The alternative suggested is that we should put on the ballot paper a summary or synopsis, of the contents of the Bill.  It is all very well for us here to give our views as to what the Bill contains.  We might even go so far as to send out a circular, agreed if possible, couched in simple language for the benefit of the voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything that goes on the ballot paper must be of an authoritative nature.  We cannot play around with what may go on it.  It was to ensure that there would be no suggestion of playing around with the way in which the proposal would be set forth on the ballot paper that we refrained from doing anything along the lines now suggested.  It is almost impossible to get any kind of summary which would present fairly the actual issue involved in this particular referendum.  That <Col N="1081" /> certainly is my belief at the moment. It was my belief when we were considering this matter originally.  Nothing I have yet heard has changed my opinion as to the absolute impossibility of getting a form of words which will set forth a clear exposition of the entire contents of the Bill and will not at the same time lend itself to being held up by some member of this House as something unduly influencing voters one way or the other.  That is still, as I say, my mind on the matter, despite what has been said on these few amendments so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a widespread feeling in the public mind that they are going to be tricked on this issue. I shall take the two words, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to support my argument. First of all, the voter gets a ballot paper and, if he wants the present system to be continued, he votes &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Would not the logical thing be to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the proposed new system? Instead, the voter who wants the present system continued has to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the present system and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the new system.  Obviously, unless the voter is properly tutored and has good reason to understand whether to put the X sign opposite the word &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;No&rdquo;, he will be confused as to the result of his vote.  As I have said, a voter who supports the present system has to put X opposite the negative.  That is a peculiar way of saying that you want the present system continued, but that is the way in which the ballot paper will be presented to the voters in this referendum.</P>
      <P>What has been done so far in the Bill that has been presented to the Dáil to try to clarify the position to the public will confuse the people and some effort should be made by the Government to make very clear to the people the result a voter will get by putting X opposite the word &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or by putting X opposite the word &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the ballot paper.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent I am in order in making this suggestion. It appears to me that it will be exceedingly difficult if we are to <Col N="1082" /> have a detailed discussion on the form of the ballot paper merged into the discussions as to whether parts of this amendment No. 2 should stand or not and, in particular, as to whether part (3) of this composite amendment should be accepted. Part (3) is the one which states that there shall be on the ballot paper a summary in simple and concise language of the proposal.  That is a matter which can be debated and, I think, upon which the debate might be concentrated, but, at intervals, as in the case of Deputy Rooney, we are diverted from the discussion of that matter to a discussion of the form of the ballot paper.  Could we, perhaps, agree that the discussion on the form of the ballot paper might be held over until we have come to some decision as to the amendment proposed in part (3) of Deputy Costello's amendment No. 3?</P>

If we had this in a Schedule here in the Bill each of the sections would have been dealt with and each sub-section would have been dealt with on Committee as a separate discussion, which is what we wanted and I was trying to achieve that by the form I took, but I have no objection to debating the question of the concise statement being put in the ballot paper as a separate discussion leaving over the other parts of the ballot paper for discussion afterwards, if that is acceptable.</P>

If the Minister for Health, on the lines upon which he made his remarks there, would help to keep us on those lines by meeting us in the discussion in a way that we can exchange ideas, then the proposal is perfectly agreed, and, as you say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there would remain then to be discussed on amendment No. 5 everything that is suggested in that amendment outside whatever might be put into the square under the heading &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The reason I put that question is that, in the course of the discussion on Second Reading, I think it was Deputy Corish and other Deputies, appreciating the difficulty in which we were, suggested that if a statement were circulated by the returning officer before the day of the ballot, that might serve.  When I read these amendments, I thought that <Col N="1084" /> perhaps amendment No. 4 was an alternative to part (3) of Deputy Costello's amendment No. 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may answer the Minister, amendment No. 4 is really supplemental to the provision in amendment No. 3.  The scheme is, if amendment No. 4 were adopted, that there should be sent out by the returning officer with the card showing the voter's number and place of voting a document setting forth to each elector and in simple and concise language, a summary of the principal provisions of the Bill containing the proposal passed, or deemed to have been passed, by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That simple and concise proposal goes out to each voter with the card showing his number and where he is to vote.  He, therefore, has ample opportunity of considering that when he gets his voting card. Armed with the information contained in that document, which has to be stated in simple and concise language, he goes into the polling station and sees before him in a column what is practically the same&mdash;in fact, I would envisage identically the same language &mdash;as is in this document.  One supplements the other and he has the information, when it is sent by the returning officer about what the purpose of the proposed constitutional amendment is.  He goes in and sees the ballot paper and having seen the other document, he knows what it is all about.  He votes &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, being in complete possession of all the information to know what he is voting on.  The two things are not different but supplementary.  I do not know whether at this stage I should answer the argument the Minister has made or whether he wishes to say anything further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to reply to the case made by Deputy Costello on the opening of the discussion on these amendments, but I should like to point out that I can see if we are to have this supplementary document submitted, a document which is required to state in simple and concise language a summary of the provisions of the Bill and if we are to <Col N="1085" /> use that precise form, or more or less that precise form in relation to the ballot paper, we may get a rather unwieldy ballot paper.  It is all very well to talk about the electors being fully informed, but one can inform them by sending them a statement before they go to the polling booths.  It would be simple in form and easy to handle such a statement.  If in fact the ballot paper must convey in precisely the same terms, or even approximately the same terms, the same meaning as the supplementary statement which Deputy Costello envisages under amendment No. 4, then I think we are going to get a very large ballot paper indeed and lose to some extent the advantages which it is sought to secure by having a simple ballot paper, with, if you like, a supplementary message explanatory of what the referendum is about.</P>
      <P>If we are to have these two&mdash;the statement on the ballot paper and the supplementary statement&mdash;we may have the voter going into the polling booth with the supplementary statement and the ballot paper and starting to compare one with the other. That of course would involve a great deal of time and probably cause a great deal of obstruction to the course of the poll.  I really think I was justified in assuming that this effect was not intended, but that one amendment was put down as an alternative to the other and I believe one should try to consider it from that point of view.</P>

In fact, it was his own Department who in 1942 were responsible for this Bill, and he says now that the Local Government Department in 1942 brought forward to this House a ridiculous proposal and secured its passage through the House.

Instead of telling the voters or adding the whole Bill as a supplement to the ballot paper, which might or might not be read&mdash;if people are sufficiently interested, they will at least have an opportunity of reading it&mdash; what is so ridiculous in that&mdash;we propose to give them merely the Short Title of the Bill which, if you want to have anything ridiculous, is much longer than the Long Title, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>That is a ridiculous position, but it is even more ridiculous when we hear the arguments of the Minister because what he says is that because of the difficulty in getting a concise statement of the principles of the Bill put into the ballot paper, &ldquo;We will give them no information at all.&rdquo; The Minister comes forward and says: &ldquo;My predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, when Minister for Local Government proposed that the people should be fully informed by getting the entire Bill on the ballot paper.&rdquo; He now says: &ldquo;That is ridiculous.  What I propose to do is to give no information at all, except the Short Title of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;which is not ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason he gives for that is that it is difficult to get a concise statement of the principles of the Bill and so &ldquo;We will give the elector no information on the ballot paper.&rdquo; Was ever <Col N="1087" /> argument in this House reduced to such complete absurdity?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the position adopted by the Minister and his colleagues at the moment is entirely indefensible.  We are being asked to pass what we are told is necessary legislative machinery to permit of an important decision being taken by the people.  As the Bill now stands, in the first referendum being held under the Constitution, a ballot paper is proposed which incorporates as an integral part of it a column supposed to indicate to the voter what he is voting about.</P>
      <P>As the Bill now stands, in that column will go the words &ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill&rdquo;, and it is suggested by the Minister and the Government that that phrase indicates to the voter what it is all about.  In my view, that argument is absurd.  It would be far better and certainly more consistent to provide nothing at all on the ballot paper. That at least would be consistent.  If the advice given to the Minister in relation to the present section in the Referendum Act of 1942 is correct&mdash; I cannot enter into whether it is correct or not, but assuming it is correct&mdash;and if, under the Minister's predecessor's section, the ballot paper must contain quite a number of proposals, we can then appreciate that there are certain administrative difficulties involved, but surely the mere fact that these difficulties exist can be no reason for, in effect, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, giving the voter no information at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there may be reasons which I do not know about, up to the moment it appears to me that the Minister in charge of this Bill has adopted a <i>non possumus</i> attitude which is unjustifiable.  He points to a difficulty and then, because the difficulty exists, he expects all of us to <i>ullagón</i> and say that nothing can be done about it.  Have we not enough ability here to devise some formula which will give the voter at least some information, in a matter of this kind?  It is absurd for the Minister, with his <Col N="1088" /> Departmental advisers sitting there, to say that the best they can do is produce a phrase &ldquo;the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.&rdquo; I do not think he is helping the House at all in this discussion.</P>
    <P>I hope sincerely that the Minister and his colleagues will revise their view and that they will recognise that what we are saying here is not being said merely for the purpose of saying it.  There is grave public disquiet with regard to this matter and there is public concern that, on a constitutional referendum of this kind, proper information should be given to the voter, so that those who go to cast their votes may do so, knowing what they are voting about.  It cannot be said, as was suggested on the Second Reading, that the voters read the papers or listen to the radio.  Of course they do, some of them, but by no means the majority of those entitled to vote do so.  The vast majority of those entitled to vote seldom, if ever, read a daily newspaper. They may listen to the radio, but I do not know that it can be said with certainty that the vast majority of the electorate have been in a position closely to follow the debate and argument in this House.  In any event that is a matter for conjecture and the issue is too important for us to decide upon a pure matter of conjecture.</P>
    <P>The Act which we are amending now provides as one of its principles that on any referendum&mdash;and this has particular reference to a constitutional referendum&mdash;the voter should have before him on the ballot paper a clear indication of what he is voting about. We should not change that lightly and substitute for it a proposal, as at present incorporated in the Schedule, which in fact gives the voter no information.  I am talking about a voter who has not been following our debate and argument here as closely as others may have followed it.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should come to meet us on this important matter and that, through his Department and those available to advise him, the Government should prepare for our consideration some formula which will meet the difficulties suggested by the Leader of the Opposition and which will ensure <Col N="1089" /> that when the voter casts his vote, he will know what he is voting about.</P>

      <P>I do not want to intervene too often, but I do so now in order that the Minister may have one last point&mdash;there may be nothing in it&mdash;to deal with when he is replying, if he decides to reply.  I would direct the Minister's consideration and that of his advisers to the question of the constitutionality of the proposals contained in his own Bill.  He has proposed to use the Long Title.  The Constitution says that the Bill is to be expressed as &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution&rdquo;, with its Long Title.  If that be so, it is a point which at least should be considered whether substituting in the ballot paper the Short Title for the Long Title is or is not in agreement with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody ever suggested that, whether the Long Title or the Short Title is on the ballot paper, it will convey all the proposals in this Bill.  I do not quite follow the argument which has been made here. It might as well be suggested that, in an ordinary election, the ballot paper should set out the Party to which each candidate belongs&mdash;Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and so on.  On Deputy O'Higgins's line of argument, the elector must have on the ballot paper before him all this information.  Surely that is assuming that all the electorate are completely illiterate and do not know what is going on at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does anybody seriously suggest that the people voting for or against the proposals here will not make sure, before they come in and get the ballot paper and go carefully through the information, about what is contained in this Bill?  Do we not all know that, before any elector comes in to exercise the franchise, to record his opposition or approval of these proposals, he will have made up his mind and that he will not be assisted in any way by any information contained in the ballot paper?  So long as it is quite clear on the ballot paper that he has <Col N="1090" /> an opportunity of indicating whether he is for or against the proposal in as simple a method as possible, from a practical point of view, that is what is required.  Otherwise, I cannot follow Deputy O'Higgins's line of reasoning.  I cannot see any way in which we could get approval of the type of thing which would go on the ballot paper. The only alternative would be to attach the complete Bill to the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>The Deputy speaks about public uneasiness.  Considering the amount of time and debate which has been devoted to this matter here and the discussion that is going on about it throughout the country, surely everybody understands what this proposal is and what it entails?  I cannot follow the reasoning of Deputy O'Higgins, or, for that matter, of Deputy J. A. Costello in connection with this.  It has been suggested in some peculiar way, by, I think, Deputy Rooney, that there is something confusing about the form of the ballot paper.  I could not quite follow his reasoning about the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If he is right, there is something there to be examined.</P>
      <P>The proposal as it appears in the Schedule seems to be a simple, straightforward one.  I think every Deputy should be satisfied that the electors are not going to make up their minds just when they come into the presiding officer at the last moment.  They will come to the polling booths with their minds made up to vote for or against this proposal.  It is immaterial whether we put the Long Title or the Short Title, as it will not help or hinder any elector who comes in to exercise the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's argument answers the case which, we have suggested, is of importance.  It may be quite true that some electors will come in with their minds made up in favour of P.R. or against it.  The difficulty that we envisage is that, when they come to cast their votes, they will be in doubt as to how to express themselves on the ballot paper according to the way they wish to vote.  We must all appreciate the fact that there will be <Col N="1091" /> voters who may be illiterate, who may not have had the benefit of a good education, who may not have been able to read or may be blind and not have had the benefit of a wireless or have bothered to listen to the Dáil reports.  These people may be a minority in the country, but they are entitled to vote according as they wish and their vote is as valuable as any other person's vote.</P>
      <P>We have to see that people who may be illiterate or badly educated are entitled to vote in the manner in which they wish to vote.  People coming into the polling booths, having made up their minds to vote in favour of P.R. or having made up their minds to vote against it, will have a ballot paper put into their hands which, I respectfully submit, does not make clear to them how they should express their opinion in order to record their opinion properly. There will be people who do not know what the proposal to amend the Constitution is.  There will be people who are in favour of P.R.  There will be people who, when they pick up this ballot paper and see the word &ldquo;YES&rdquo;, may think that, by putting an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in front of it, they are voting in favour of P.R.  Such a person may be a stupid person.  Such a person may be an illiterate person.  However, that such persons do exist there can be no doubt.</P>
      <P>It is manifestly unfair on the Government's part, to refuse these amendments and to run the undoubted risk of confusing people who are ill-informed about the legislation and about what exactly the Dáil is discussing. I see no reason why a poorly educated person, picking up this ballot paper, will not think he is voting in favour of P.R. by putting an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in front of the word &ldquo;YES&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have suggested it is desirable that the elector should get as much information as possible on the ballot paper.  I wonder if the Government accept that proposition?  We think it desirable that the ballot paper should contain as much information as is practicable on what the elector is voting for.  It may assist the elector, <Col N="1092" /> in the first instance, when he sees the proposal there, as to the manner in which he may cast his vote.  Above all, even though he may have made up his mind before coming in and before seeing these proposals, the manner in which he has to exercise his vote in accordance with his wishes will be made perfectly clear to him.</P>
    <P>We have suggested a way out of the difficulty.  We have suggested that there should be inserted on the ballot paper, in simple and concise language, a summary of the proposals.  What objection is there to that?  The apparent objection&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;is that it is impossible to find simple and concise language to make a summary of a Bill to amend the Constitution.  I think a summary of this Bill could be made in simple and concise language in five minutes&mdash; and, if the Minister wants it, I can do it for him.</P>
    <P>The Minister raises the second objection that it may be difficult to get agreement by the members of all Parties on what is the summary in simple and concise language of the amendment in the Bill.  That may be so.  We may all have slightly different views on the language to be used in the &ldquo;simple and concise language&rdquo; but we are prepared to make a present of that to the Government at this stage.  We are prepared to put into the Bill that there will be inserted in simple and concise language a summary of the proposals and it will, of course be a matter for the Government to work that out.</P>

Maybe we are foolish to trust the Government in this fashion.  Maybe it is wrong of us to take that risk.  We can make that point subsequently, if the Government have in some way given a wrong twist in their summary. At this stage, we are prepared to allow the Government to put on the ballot paper a summary in simple and concise <Col N="1093" /> language.  Is it impossible to make a summary of this Bill in simple and concise language?</P>

      <P>I do not quite appreciate the necessity of considering this matter that there may be illiterate voters and people who find it difficult to understand things.  When you are asking the people to make a fundamental change in the Constitution, you are doing a very formal thing.  I do not see why the document upon which a voter expresses his opinion would not be a formally drawn-up document.</P>
      <P>From anything the Ministers have exchanged by way of opinion, I find it difficult to think that much of what has been said from the ministerial benches this evening is anything but something like bubble-gum blowing. It does not seem to have anything but a kind of treacly, bird-lime effect on discussion.  I do not see that, from the Minister's point of view, it is necessary to do anything but to produce a clean, formal sheet of paper that can be regarded as being authorised in some way and having on the top of it &ldquo;The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill&rdquo;.  Then, lower down, you can have the instruction.  &ldquo;If you agree with this, put an &lsquo;X&rsquo; below.  If you disagree with it, put a nought.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All you need is a sheet of paper headed at the top &ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill&rdquo;.  Then, lower down: &ldquo;If you agree with this, put an &lsquo;X&rsquo; below.  If you disagree with this, put an nought.&rdquo; That is the attitude the Ministers have taken up.  Do the Government not appreciate that when the people are asked to bring in a change in the Constitution the document upon which the individual voter expressed his will should have formality and clarity about it?  It does not matter, in fact, from the point of view of the proper doing of business, whether or not that form is being handed to an illiterate or a semi-ignorant voter or to a person who not only is well able to read but is well able to absorb the contents.  Surely if the State is arranging for an action to be taken by a responsible voter then the matter ought to be done in a proper way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> The Minister speaks about a difficulty. When winding up the debate, the Minister expressed himself as perfectly willing to listen to all the suggestions of the Opposition by way of amendment or otherwise.  He had the advantage of having the discussion here.  He had the advantage of realising that there was something to be thought over.  However, he has made no contribution to this discussion that would show he has given any attention to this matter since we last saw him here on the subject&mdash;nor has any of the other Ministers who spoke.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that, by all the suggestions made by the Minister for Health to-day&mdash;or, at any rate, from the ministerial benches&mdash;some people think only one change is to be made in the Constitution while other people think three changes are to be made, and yet other people again think several more changes are to be made in the Constitution?  Is the proposal the people are asked to vote on not a proposal to wipe out the P.R. system under which Deputies are elected to three member constituencies with the single transferable vote?  Further, is it not proposed to wipe out that system and to substitute instead single member constituencies and the non-transferable vote?  Is it not also proposed to introduce a commission to delineate the boundaries of constituencies rather than have it done here?  Are they not the proposals and why have we this bubble-gum blowing from the ministerial benches in their efforts to avoid agreeing that that is so and to imply in an ill-defined and verbose way that there are difficulties in stating that on a piece of paper?  I ask Ministers are these not the proposals in relation to the document on which the citizens will vote in relation to the changing of the Constitution?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Opposition to-night is rather mystifying for anyone who sat through the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill.  During that discussion it was obvious that they then had no ideas in their minds as to what they felt was wrong with this Bill, and that was put to them during the discussion. Although there was but one useful suggestion <Col N="1095" /> from the Opposition&mdash;and it was Deputy Corish who alluded to it at the time&mdash;which has since been taken up and indeed was under consideration, we are now being accused of not having given any thought in the interval to the difficulties.  The fact is, we had given very great thought and consideration to the difficulties of this measure before the Second Reading. If since then, on reconsideration&mdash;and there has been quite an amount of reconsideration&mdash;we did not seem to add anything to what we had to say on the Second Reading, it does not at all imply that we have not given the matter full consideration.</P>
      <P>Again in reply to some of the points made here, it is no harm to revert to the manner in which this matter and the subject matter of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill have been debated in this House, to find out whether or not it can be held that the people have had and are having up to to-night the benefit of a very elaborate debate which would leave very few of them in the ignorance in which Deputy Costello, senior, and Deputy Costello, junior, seem to feel our electorate are.</P>
      <P>This ignorance of the electorate is not a new thing from the elder Deputy Costello as can be instanced from his statement in the debate on the draft amendment of the Constitution.  At that time I think he said&mdash;I should hate to misquote him&mdash;on some stage or another that many of our people did not even know what a Constitution was.  Possibly that is still the idea that he and other colleagues of his have in regard to our electorate.  I do not agree with that view of the intelligence of our electorate.  I am satisfied that with the length and variety of the discussion, the hours and the number of speakers who have taken part in the debate on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, our people are very well informed as to what is involved in the referendum and what they will be voting on.  Even at this moment they are very well informed and I am certain that between now and the taking of the referendum they will be even more informed, if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> On the debate on the Second Reading of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill there were 63 speakers.  The debate lasted for 50 hours, spread over nine days.  When the Draft Constitution Bill was before the Dáil in 1937, the Second Reading lasted only 21½ hours spread over three days.  There were then only 28 speakers.  The Committee Stage of the Draft Constitution lasted about 39 hours spread over seven days and there was a Recommittal Stage taking approximately seven and three-quarter hours spread over two days.  Therefore the Committee and the Recommittal Stages of the Draft Constitution took 46¾ hours as against 50 hours spent on the Second Reading of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Despite the fact that we have had a lengthy session since in Committee on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, we are now being told the people are not alive to what is at issue and they will not be properly informed by the time the referendum takes place. Surely, this being but a small part of the Constitution and more time having been spent on a very small part of the Constitution than was spent on the whole Constitution in 1937, it can scarcely be held that our people are not very well informed, in so far as it is possible to be informed, from the discussions in this House.</P>

Let us look at this question of the wording on the ballot paper. &ldquo;The Draft Constitution&rdquo; were the words on the ballot paper in 1937 in connection with a very full and lengthy document?  Now of course we propose to put the Short Title only on this ballot paper and it is suggested we are doing something almost unconstitutional, that we are not giving the people the full facts as to what we are doing.  So far as information is concerned, many Deputies may already be aware that it is intended to send a circular to the voters in advance of the taking of the referendum and that circular I hope will be an agreed circular which will obviate circulating the full text of the Bill, as we would have to do probably if we did not get agreement.</P>

      <P>We have reached a rather interesting stage in this discussion.  It transpires that the Minister does not see any insuperable difficulty in circulating to the voters a fair summary of the contents of the proposed amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It transpires the Minister hopes that a summary which is fair, and which is agreed by all Parties in this House, may be circulated to voters.  Now, therefore, all the drafting and other difficulties have disappeared. The spirit has descended upon certain people and the light has been seen, but the Minister then goes on to adopt a further impossible position. He now says that he will not put that on the ballot paper.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to the fact, which I am certain is well known to him and to other people in this House, that quite frequently when a voter goes to vote he does not record or mark his ballot paper in accordance with his intentions.  He makes a mistake, even on a simple ballot paper for a Dáil or local government election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much more true can that be with regard to a voter, voting in an unusual form of election, which is a referendum on a proposed amendment of the Constitution?  He may know his own mind.  He may intend to go in and vote against the abolition of P.R., or to vote in favour of the proposal. That may be the intention in his mind but when he goes in, having <Col N="1101" /> decided in his own mind the way he intends to vote and having read all the debates and informed himself on the whole issue, he sees facing him on the ballot paper merely the words &ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution&rdquo;.  He may not be a well-educated person.  He may have his own idea as to which side he is on but ordinarily he would be entitled, under present legislation, to say to the returning officer: &ldquo;What does this mean?  Can you tell me if I vote for the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill whether I am voting in favour of P.R. or whether I am voting against it?&rdquo; But the returning officer, under the Minister's proposal, cannot say a word to him.  He can only say: &ldquo;If you are in favour of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill answer &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.  If you are against it answer &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo; Why would the Minister not agree, in relation to such a voter, where an agreed, fair summary is possible, that he should be presented on the ballot paper with the particular question he is asked to decide and, mind you, that is what the law now says.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is being extremely unfair to his colleague, the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health is an old and experienced member of this House.  He came into this House in 1927 and has remained here since, but the Minister for Health, as Minister for Local Government in 1942, saw precisely what had happened in the plebiscite held on the Constitution in 1937.  In that plebiscite the significant thing was that there was such a large proportion of spoiled votes.  The unfortunate electors who went in to vote in the plebiscite on the Constitution saw just &ldquo;Draft Constitution&rdquo;, and a large proportion of them did not know in putting down their &ldquo;X&rdquo; whether they were voting in favour of or against it.</P>
    <P>The significant thing about that plebiscite was the large percentage of spoiled votes and it was because of that, I think, that the Minister for Local Government, five years later, came into this House with the Referendum Bill of 1942, which incorporates a section saying that in a <Col N="1102" /> referendum on the ballot paper there shall be a statement setting out the proposal the people are asked to decide.  The Minister for Health, as Minister for Local Government then, was acting wisely, I think, in the light of experience but now, when he has left the Department of Local Government, his successor says that the section he put in the Bill in 1942 is impracticable and unworkable.</P>
    <P>It appears now, however, that it is both practicable and workable to put on the ballot paper a fair summary of the Constitution amendment proposal. We have got the Minister so far; he has only another few inches to go and he will not go that distance. Why?  I should like to know and I suggest that the reason is political: that the Minister realises that it is possible that on this referendum the people will also be asked to elect a President.  He looks forward to seeing a number of people coming in to vote for the Fianna Fáil candidate for the Presidency who have not followed this issue clearly.  He hopes that on going into the polling booths to vote for the Fianna Fáil candidate, the Taoiseach, they will be handed also a referendum ballot paper with nothing on it except &ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill&rdquo; and they will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for that.</P>
    <P>That is what is obviously behind the Minister's hesitation in going the whole distance on this issue, having gone almost the whole way.  I suggest that he would serve himself and his colleagues better, and the cause he professes to believe in, if he would agree with the eminently reasonable attitude adopted by the Opposition in asking for a fair summary.  That is all we ask, that a fair summary should go on the ballot paper, so that it cannot be said that, whatever way the people decide, it was decided either in ignorance or by mistake.</P>
    <P>Let those on the Ministers' Benches, who profess concern for the welfare of the country, remember that this referendum issue can be decided by one vote, by a simple majority, by the vote of an illiterate, unfortunate person, who goes in a car to a polling booth perhaps to vote for one of the Presidential candidates, if the election is <Col N="1103" /> held on the same day, and is presented with this referendum ballot paper.  He says to the returning officer: &ldquo;What does the Third Amendment of the Constitution mean?&rdquo; He is told, under the Minister's proposal: &ldquo;I cannot tell you that.  I can merely say you are asked to vote for or against the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.&rdquo; The Minister says that it is sufficient and that voter will answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  By the vote of that illiterate person, the future of this country may be decided.  Does the Minister think that is reasonable?  Does the Minister think it is a safe position for him to adopt, to deny that person, illiterate, or deaf, or blind, or physically incapacitated, the right to get some information as to what he is asked to vote upon?  The Minister originally started off by saying that a fair summary was not possible.  We know now it is possible.  That has been a tremendous hurdle for us to get over.  It has been got over.  Now we suggest going the whole way and putting a full summary on the ballot paper, if it is possible by agreement of the House. Then the Minister can take pleasure in the fact that whatever way the people decide this issue, the decision will be taken in full knowledge of what is at stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one remark which I should like to make before I withdraw this amendment.  I have not, and I never had, the slightest hope of receiving from the Minister for Local Government any reasonable consideration for any reasonable amendment we might put down.  It appears to me quite obvious that the Minister came in here with his mind completely made up and closed to any arguments.  The alleged arguments which he advanced demonstrate one thing, that is, that he wants&mdash;I do not know whether he spoke for his colleagues or not&mdash;to close down on debate in this House so that the people will not be fully informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the point&mdash;I doubt if it was relevant&mdash;of producing the comparable figures for the amount of discussion that took place on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill <Col N="1104" /> and the Draft Constitution except to show that we have spent more time discussing this Bill than the Draft Constitution. Did he forget that his own Leader, then President of the Executive Council, would not listen to any argument against the principle of the adoption of P.R. which he and his colleagues now wish to destroy?  Very little argument took place on that.  The Taoiseach would not listen to it because he was so right.  Now he comes in and says that he was wrong, and the Minister criticises us for debating at too great length this proposal to change a system which the Taoiseach said in 1936 was correct and which he now says is wrong.</P>
    <P>Not merely do we make no apology for fully debating these proposals but we rejoice in having done so and we shall continue to do so.  The one thing which we were determined to achieve, and which we have achieved, was to bring home to the people the seriousness of the issue in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  We intend doing that to the last day on which this campaign will be waged no matter what the Minister, or his colleagues, say, and no matter what number of statistics are brought in.  We want to inform the people; the Minister and his colleagues want to keep the people in the dark.  Because of their majority, they will not listen to discussion. They do not regard this as a parliamentary assembly, as a deliberative assembly.  They want to push the Bill through without discussion, but we intend to have discussion.</P>

    <P>I wish to ask the Minister a few questions.  As I understand it, the <Col N="1106" /> Minister has come some of the way to meet my objection in regard to the form of ballot paper.  I should like to be clear about what he is prepared to do.  As I understand it, he is agreeable to a statement, which will be agreed by all Parties, a fair and reasonable summary of the proposals contained in this Bill, being sent out to each voter before he votes.  Would the Minister also see that the same summary will be available in the polling booths so that anybody who has not read it, or has not listened to a summary from somebody else, will be in a position to ask the presiding officer to read the summary for his benefit before he votes?  Finally, will the agreed summary of the Bill be published in the national newspapers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way. I want to put it very clearly and I shall read the actual statement.  Before doing that, my very strong feeling about it is that whatever we may agree to, whatever statement we may have arrived at or can have arrived at in various ways, coming and going, deleting and adding and so on, while that is all right and may be issued as an agreed statement, only that which is really authoritative, precise and legal should be in the polling booths. Because of this, because while you may sell, give or deliver any summary or statement as to what is supposed to be in the Bill, or is in the Bill, I think it is going a little too far to suggest that the agreed statement should be &ldquo;shoved&rdquo; down the voter's <Col N="1107" /> neck when he goes into the polling station, because of the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

I am suggesting that doing as the Deputy suggests, putting it into the ballot paper or the polling booths, or leaving it available and freely displayed in the polling stations is tantamount to &ldquo;shoving&rdquo; it down the voter's neck.  It is not a legal or authoritative document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely that is not tantamount to &ldquo;shoving&rdquo; it down the voters' throat, especially if they ask to have it read?</P>

      <P>In trying to meet those who have tried to meet us in regard to the circulation of this statement I have explained what I think.  I may have been stronger than I should have been, possibly, in putting across my views on what putting it in the polling stations is tantamount to. Nevertheless, despite that view of mine, between now and the next stage, I shall consider the suggestion put forward in regard to it, but I should like again to emphasise that <Col N="1108" /> as it will not be a legal or authoritative document, it does not appear to me to have the right to be within the precincts of the polling stations.  But I am prepared to consider what may be or can be done between now and the next stage, and I undertake to the House to do that.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, on the Second Stage of this Bill, the argument was used, perhaps by Deputy Russell, and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to illiterate voters, that there will be people who because of infirmity or illiteracy, are not of themselves capable of reading and understanding what is going on.  Such people may come into a polling booth, it was argued, and find that the question or proposal before them is not sufficiently clear and it was suggested they ought to be allowed to ask the returning officer for information, but that he will not be allowed to give any further enlightenment on it.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on the Second Reading, the returning officer or presiding officer at a general election or a local government election is not permitted to give information to an elector, illiterate or otherwise, who seeks it, as to whether the Mr. Smith on the ballot paper is the Mr. Smith belonging to the Party the person wants to vote for, or what Party any particular candidate may belong to.  They may not give that information at the moment and everybody knows it can be as confusing to electors&mdash;or even more confusing&mdash;where there are ten or 12 candidates on a ballot paper as in the case in a referendum.</P>

      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1946, shall be amended by the addition at the end of the sub-section of the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;and the local returning officer shall also deliver, whether by post or otherwise as he shall think proper and at the same time as such polling card is delivered to such elector a document stating in simple and concise language a summary of the principal provisions of the Bill containing the <Col N="1110" /> proposal passed, or deemed to have been passed, by both Houses of the Oireachtas&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a sense, I have already dealt with this amendment in dealing with the previous amendment which I have withdrawn.  It is an amendment to sub-section (1), Section 4 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1946, to provide that the local returning officer shall send to each voter who is entitled to vote at the proposed referendum a card showing his number and polling place and that with that card, or contemporaneously with it, the local returning officer should deliver a document stating in simple and concise language a summary of the principal provisions of the Bill containing the proposal passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>This is the statement as we now have it, an agreed statement by the Parties in the House, although I think some of the Independent Deputies, unfortunately, may not yet have got it.  The statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following summary of the principal proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, is circulated for the information of the voters:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> At present, members of Dáil Éireann are elected on a system of P.R. for constituencies returning at least three members, each voter having a single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to abolish the system of P.R. and to adopt, instead, a system of single-member constituencies, each voter having a single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill to set up a commission for the determination and revision of the constituencies, instead of having this done by the Oireachtas, as at present.</P>
    <P>If you APPROVE of the proposals in the Bill,</P>
    <P>Place an X opposite the word YES on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>If you DO NOT APPROVE of the proposals in the Bill,</P>
    <P>Place an X opposite the word NO on the ballot paper.</P>

      <P>May I save the Leader of the Opposition from a slight misfooting?  As far as the statement goes, it is all right; but the latter part of this document is based upon the Schedule as it appears in the Minister's Bill and would not be in harmony with amendment No. 5, which we hope we may be able to persuade the Minister to accept.  It is <Col N="1112" /> just a small matter and it does not affect the general principle of the circulation, on the one hand, and the statement of what is involved, on the other.  It deals simply with the machinery side of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumption that it is a Local Government Bill, I want to direct my remarks to the Minister for Local Government and pray that he will not be interrupted, while I am addressing him, by his colleague, the Minister for Health.  I understood the Minister to say that in principle there could be no objection to amendment No. 4 moved by Deputy Costello.  Consequently, if this amendment or something substantially the same goes into the Bill, then we are putting into the Bill an intimation that a returning officer may send by post, or otherwise deliver, a document stating in simple and concise language a summary of the principal provisions of the Bill.  If he is directed in the Bill to do that, that would seem to me to be sufficient authority for exhibiting in the polling booth a copy of the document which, if this amendment is accepted, the returning officer would be directed to send out under the Bill.  Therefore, I suggest that this summary takes on a new significance, if we put this section, or the substance of this section, into the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite likely to be the same one.  I hope I have made it clear that, in principle, the amendment seems to be accepted and between now and the next Stage, we hope to consider the matter fully and bring in something which will meet the wishes of those who sponsored this amendment; but that does not tie <Col N="1113" /> us down to all the things that would appear on the wording there.</P>

      <P>On the assumption that something like this is accepted, and that the document will be circulated, does the document not take on a recognisable significance?

Then it will not be an agreed Party statement: it will be a document of authority sent out by the returning officer.  There will not be two documents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Minister brings in an amendment which will embody the principle in Deputy Costello's amendment, would it not be possible to extend the amendment to convey that where there are illiterate voters, this document will be read out, that is, the one which is being sent to each voter?  If it is reasonable that the presiding officer should read out ten, 12 or 20 candidates' names, as being the people from whom he must choose at an election, would it not be reasonable also that the presiding officer should read out the issue in a referendum, so that the illiterate voter may be able to make up his mind as to which way he should vote?  I do not wish the Minister to commit himself, if he will think about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>I should not like to put this as a burden on the presiding officer.  He may be able to do it in a quiet little backwater polling station, but it might make the position intolerable in a large polling station and make it difficult for voters to get through. When they are all lining up and there are illiterates inside asking these questions and getting these answers, and everyone waiting around, possibly some may not get in to vote at all. That is one aspect of the matter.</P>

      <Col N="1117" /> The form of the amendment is in the Schedule as I have drafted it.  I have indicated, in the course of the speech I have made, the improvements that appear in it and I do not intend to repeat them.  I just wanted to indicate that the Act of 1942 contained the words &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution or do you disapprove?&rdquo; The words &ldquo;or do you disapprove?&rdquo; are left out in the proposed form in the Bill.  I suggest the words in my amendment would be clearer and an improvement: &ldquo;Do you approve or do you not approve of the proposal stated in the first column below becoming law?&rdquo;, in order that persons may know precisely what they are going to do.  All the other amendments suggested follow.</P>

I cannot quite recall what his main arguments were, but of one thing I am satisfied, that is, that, looking at the proposed specimen ballot paper, it still appears to me, as it did when this matter was being dealt with, that the one in the Bill appears to be a much clearer type of ballot paper than the one suggested in the amendment before us.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate&mdash;Wheat Levy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time this afternoon a number of questions were addressed to the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the wheat levy.  One of these questions was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture when he proposes to restore the wheat levy collected on last year's wheat crop; what compensation it is proposed to make to the farmers; and in what form.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply indicates that the Minister hopes to be able to make an announcement in this matter before the end of the present month.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment for the purpose of placing on record the very serious situation in which the wheat-growers find themselves in relation to this matter.  Early in November of last year the Fine Gael Party put down a motion moved by Deputy Hughes and seconded by myself, expressing disapproval of the action of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government in the collection of the wheat levy.  In the first instance, an undertaking was given to the farmers that the wheat levy would not come into operation unless there was a surplus of wheat.  We are now satisfied beyond all doubt that that surplus did not exist and that over £500,000 has been collected forcibly, wrongfully and dishonestly from the farmers and held by the Government. The arguments used on the occasion of the discussion of the Fine Gael motion were so strong and the points were driven home so forcefully by the speakers that the Government decided on the following Friday, as a result of that motion, to request the Minister for Agriculture to make an announcement to the effect that certain reliefs would be given to the farmers from the Wheat Levy Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers were of the opinion, <Col N="1122" /> and everybody who read the Minister's statement felt likewise, that no time would be lost in having the 5/9 per barrel levy restored to them. November faded out; December passed; January is now in its final days and we hear in the House from the Minister that by the end of the month he proposes to make a statement.  He does not say whether he will give the 5/9 per barrel levy back to the farmers or not.</P>
    <P>It goes further than that.  We find that from the fund, which reaches a sum in the region of £500,000, that not alone will it be possible to restore the 5/9 per barrel but, because there was not a surplus and because of the very limited acreage grown, it is quite possible that something in the region of 7/- or 7/6 per barrel refund is expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Or maybe 12/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the better. That is what we want.  The farmers have passed through the hardest and toughest year, financially and otherwise, for over 100 years and are now expected to embark on the sowing of crops, ploughing, and planning their wheat acreage.  It is unfair and unreasonable for the Minister not to refund whatever they are to receive so that the money would be of some use to them before they commence their spring work.  I would like to know, and I am sure the House would be very pleased to know, the exact amount that will be refunded, whether it is 5/9 or 7/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham says 12/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would also like to know if there is any other form of compensation in mind, as was indicated by the Minister some time ago, in relation to the serious losses, particularly in the wheat-growing counties, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, East Cork, Laois-Offaly, Dublin and other important wheat-growing centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like it placed on record again in this House that if there had not been a Fianna Fáil Government in office there would have been no <Col N="1123" /> levy imposed on wheat.  The oftener that is said, the better.  That is a fact.  We of the Fine Gael Party would not have imposed this levy of 5/9 per barrel.  Therefore, we are calling upon the Government, because on the last occasion that we put down a motion in this House it bore good results.  Two days after discussion of the motion, the Minister made a statement.  We are now hopeful that as a result of the series of questions asked in the House this afternoon it may be possible to extract from the Minister and the Government information as to the amount of financial relief coming to the farmers. The sooner that statement is made, the better.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed that the Minister has sold out the farmers to the millers.  It is the opinion of farmers, even the Fianna Fáil farmers who at one time had a certain amount of confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government, particularly in relation to their wheat-growing policy.  They have now reached a stage that they believe, and have good grounds for believing, that the Minister has sold them out, lock, stock and barrel, entirely to the millers.  The proof of that is the fact that the Minister could take it upon himself to appoint for the millers a public relations officer, a place which has been taken recently by a certain journalist whom he secured in having fired out of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>The Deputy must confine his remarks to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I just want to convey to the farmers confirmation of their belief that the present Minister has sold them out to the millers.  I, and the Party to which I belong, and the farmers now feel that the Minister has sold them completely to the millers, that they have been left to the mercy of the millers, that they are being left to the mercy of the millers for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the country depends entirely on the hardworking, industrious farmers, particularly those <Col N="1124" /> engaged in wheat-growing, it is a disgraceful act on the part of the Government to allow a group of individuals like the millers to hold in the palm of their hand those who are the backbone of the nation, the hardworking farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to occupy all the time for this motion because Deputy Hughes is anxious to say a few words. We demand that the Minister for Agriculture should repay every penny that he has taken out of the farmers' pockets.  The farmers are entitled to that money.  They have been wrongfully deprived of 5/9 for every barrel of wheat they grew this year.  That is a statement of fact.  The sooner the Government makes restitution to the farmers for what they have been wrongfully deprived of, the better.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and, in particular, the Government, to provide this financial relief so that it will be available to the farmers by the end of this month.  Many farmers have to take conacre.  They have to purchase seeds, manures, fertilisers and prepare the ground for the coming year's wheat crop.  The farmers have been very grossly deceived by the present Government.  We raise this matter, not for the purpose of criticising the Government but in the serious hope of guiding them on the right and proper lines in an attempt to assist the wheat-growing farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's attitude on the wheat problem since last harvest.  The farmers experienced the worst harvest in memory; one would expect that the Minister would be on the side of the farmers but, since the harvest, he seems to have no interest whatever in the farmers or in the problems facing wheat-growers during that time.  We all realise that the levy of 5/9 was arranged to sell surplus wheat over a certain tonnage&mdash;300,000 tons were estimated as our requirements but we had nothing like that at all.  It is believed that 200,000 tons were not produced this year and that proves there was no justification whatever for holding this levy and that the farmers were at least entitled to a refund of 5/9 right away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> We are now four months past the harvest and we still cannot get any statement from the Minister.  That is an extraordinary situation.  I do not know what is behind the Minister's attitude in not telling the farmers exactly where they stand.  Everyone realises the disastrous year through which the farmers have passed.  It was the worst year in memory and surely, therefore, they are entitled to their rights, so far as the levy is concerned. The levy was collected to deal with a surplus.  We did not have a surplus and as a result of the disastrous harvest, the farmers are justly entitled to compensation and there is ample money to meet such compensation, to an even greater extent than 5/9.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, the Minister still says he will make a statement before the end of the month.  We are within a few days of the end of the month and he still has not made his statement. It is very important&mdash;and the Minister should realise it&mdash;that this statement should be made by him.  It will have a very important effect on this year's corn crop.  The farmers are now planning their grain crop for next year and they want him to say what his policy, and the policy of the Government so far as wheat growing is concerned, will be.  It looks as if it is the Minister's job to try to kill wheat growing.  That is what it appears to me to be and to the farmers generally down the country. He cannot even at this late hour tell us in the Dáil what is to be the refund to the farmers, the refund they are entitled to and which is their right. It is a most unreasonable attitude which the Minister has taken up here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Agriculture at Question Time to-day, asking him to reply to three points: (a) the reason for the delay in sanctioning a refund of the wheat levy and other price deductions to wheat producers; (b) the amount per barrel which will be refunded; and (c) the date on which farmers will receive payment.  The Minister did not reply to any one of these points, except to say that he hoped he would be able to make an <Col N="1126" /> announcement on the matter before the end of the month.  It is the kind of undertaking he gave before in connection with the announcement of milk prices.</P>
      <P>We know very well that the Minister does not like the farmers and that they do not like him.  That stretches back over a number of years, but now, in his office as Minister for Agriculture, his dog in the manger attitude towards them has no justification in relation to this wheat fund.  This was a live issue during the summer session&mdash;the question of the setting up of a price-cutting board, a board which was set up to take 5/9 a barrel, in addition to other deductions, from the price of wheat which would go into a fund in order to level out the price, if a surplus had been produced.  Approximately £500,000 was taken from the farmers in that way.</P>
      <P>Most of the wheat was delivered before October and certainly before the end of November.  We have been asking the Minister what is the reason for the delay, but he will not tell us. Obviously, the Department have done their work and probably they have received the necessary report from the Wheat Board.  The Minister has also had consultations with the farmers' organisations so that it is obvious that he could give the money back to the farmers to-morrow, if he were prepared to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what problems are created by this delay.  Does the Minister know, for instance, that the wheat growers last year spent about £500,000 on combines and that many of those combines were purchased through hire-purchase arrangements.  This money is being withheld from the farmers who could use it in order to pay their instalments.  In addition to that £500,000 spent on, I think, 500 combines, there was a further £500,000 spent on harvesting equipment and that also was obtained on the instalment system either through the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the various finance corporations.  In addition to the wheat levy of 5/9, those who took in the wheat applied deductions which never were applied before&mdash;&ldquo;screenings&rdquo; and other descriptions <Col N="1127" /> were given as excuses for the deductions&mdash;and all these deductions were taken from the net price paid to the farmers.</P>
    <P>It was shown very clearly to the Minister that there was no legal authority or right to hold that money back from the wheat growers because it was intended to have it in the event of a surplus, which did not result from the harvest.  There has been no surplus. We have seen that arrangements have been made to import vast quantities of wheat this year; probably more wheat will be imported during this year than was imported at any time since before the war, with the exception of the war years.</P>
    <P>By his stubborn silence in relation to this matter in the last few months, the Minister has shown that he has no sympathy whatever for the wheat growers; but he took advantage of his position in past years by making these matters issues at elections on several occasions.  It is very disappointing for many of the wheat growers to find now that the Minister and the Government are not prepared to stand over the undertakings given on the radio on the eve of the general election.  At that time, the farmers expected to get a better price than they were getting at the time of the announcement on the radio.  Instead of that, the average price has been reduced by more than 15/- a barrel since the night of that announcement by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of having the cash for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers.  The position this year is not the same as it was last year, because many of the seedsmen will be unable to give the credit which they gave in previous years, owing to last year's disastrous harvest, and the fact that many of them even now have not been paid in respect of the wheat harvest of 1958.  They are faced now with farmers trying to get seeds on credit again this year, but they are unable to give the necessary credit.  This cash which is being held back from the farmers would enable them to purchase the necessary seed wheat, the price of which is very high this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I feel the Minister is just showing contempt for the wheat growers and the House by remaining mute of malice.  It is obvious that he is one of the few persons in the Fianna Fáil Party who has shown his opposition, his determined opposition to wheat growing.  Many of them have pretended in the past to be in favour of it, but we have heard very little from them since last summer when this Wheat Board was set up.</P>

      <P>The Minister is entitled to ten minutes for his reply and three Deputies have spoken already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to join my voice to the voices of Deputies on this side of the House in appealing to the Minister in a very straightforward and honest way.  I want to ask him to see his way to making a decision on this problem to-night.  The reason I do so is the question I asked the Minister on 7th January and to which he referred in his reply to-day.  On that day, I asked a supplementary question.  I said that the wheat-growing farmers were very anxious to know whether they were going to get back 5/9, 6/-, 7/6 or even, as Deputy Cunningham says, 12/6.  I do not mind.  They would like to know what they are going to get back.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me the few minutes in which to put my point of view.  As an auctioneer, engaged in this business over the past five or six months, I know&mdash;and the Minister himself knows&mdash;that the farmers who take land or let land, or even those who own land, want to know what they are to do for the next 12 months.  They would now like to know what the position is in regard to last year's harvest.</P>
      <P>There are only four days until the end of the month.  In answer to my question on 7th January, the Minister said he would make his statement before the end of the month.  In all fairness and honesty to the farmers, the Minister should make that statement now.</P>
