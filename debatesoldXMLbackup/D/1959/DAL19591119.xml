      <Col N="186" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer a few observations along the lines upon which Deputy Michael O'Higgins opened for this Party on the Second Reading.  Generally speaking, he dealt with one point: that this legislation was unconstitutional; and that is the point I want to come at immediately.</P>
      <P>Those who prepared this Bill were good enough to circulate for the information of members of the House an explanatory memorandum in which the two relevant provisions of the Constitution are set out, but, apparently, they decided to forget all about what the constitutional position was.  As the memorandum sets out, Article 16.2, sub-section 4, of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population, but any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann sitting when such revision is made.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Constitution referred to in the memorandum is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population. (Art. 16.2.2º.)</P>
      <P>That provision has, apparently, been observed.</P>
      <P>The second part of that provision, paragraph (b), states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency, and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is <Col N="187" /> practicable be the same throughout the country. (Art. 16.2.3.º.)</P>
    <P>The two phrases which govern this matter are the phrase contained in the first extract I read, that due regard must be paid to changes in distribution of the population, but the over-riding order is that which I last quoted, that the ratio between the number of members to be elected in each constituency shall be the same throughout the country and the only reservation is &ldquo;so far as it is practicable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have gone through the statements made on this legislation, first, by the Minister and secondly by the Taoiseach. I find the word &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; is used only once in the whole of the columns these two have spoken between them.  Such phrases as &ldquo;practical difficulties&rdquo;, &ldquo;difficulty of communication&rdquo;&ldquo;rural bias&rdquo; and &ldquo;giving people living in certain areas of the country the better representation they deserve once a ratio has been struck&rdquo;&mdash;all these have been used, and used to bring about the situation disclosed by this legislation.  But the phrase is &ldquo;so far as it is practicable.&rdquo; Later I shall quote some definitions that can be found either in judicial dictionaries or in decisions of the Courts.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that the Irish word both in the present Constitution and the one that preceded it is &ldquo;feidir&rdquo; which means &ldquo;possible&rdquo;, and &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; has the meaning of &ldquo;possible&rdquo;, and only that meaning.  On that simplified version of the Constitution, then, the ratio had to be the same so far as that was &ldquo;possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We get an interesting view of how the constitutional change was brought about by looking at the speeches.  First of all, we find that Donegal was taken as the pivotal constituency.  Here, in the early stages of consideration by the Government of the proposed changes, a matter of difficulty arose. Again, may I emphasise there is no question of difficulty in the Constitution; it does not say that the ratio is to be the same in so far as there is no difficulty about that; it says so far as is possible.  But Donegal was taken as <Col N="188" /> the pivotal constituency and we are told that there is appalling difficulty up there from the point of view of Deputies getting in touch with their constituents or constituents getting in touch with Deputies.  This, we are told, is caused by a tremendous mountain range in that area&mdash;a range which, according to the Taoiseach, divides the East from the West, with only four passes by which people can travel from one part to another.  One immediately gets a picture of the Himalayas, or some such range.  One gets a view of the officials of the Department of Local Government setting out with provisions to last them for a fortnight, or so, and getting the native Sherpas up in the area to guide them through the four passes, which alone allow for communication over this mountain range which splits Donegal, according to the Taoiseach, from East to West.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, of course, the Minister told us that this range of mountains practically divides the northern half of the county from the southern half.  The pivotal constituency was Donegal and the pivotal matter in Donegal is a mountain range; and that mountain range, in one view, runs from East to West and, in another view, from North to South.  One would have thought that if a county was to be taken as an exemplar and that the disadvantages and difficulties emerging from that county were to be regarded as either existent or nonexistent in other places, the geographical features might have been fairly accurately discovered and accurately revealed to this House. According to the Taoiseach, it was the mountain range which caused all the trouble.</P>
    <P>Eventually at column 405 of Volume 177 of the Official Report, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We ultimately came to the conclusion that there was no need and no justification for altering Donegal at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was on account of the geographical difficulty.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and once we took that decision there seemed to be required a similar decision regarding Kerry and Galway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> At that point, Deputy McQuillan interjected: &ldquo;Where is the range of mountains in Galway?&rdquo; and, of course, there was not any range that could be elevated to the proper height for this particular point of argument.  So the Taoiseach went on to say that the key decision &ldquo;to leave Kerry and Galway unchanged was taken in regard to Donegal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Donegal, therefore, gave the lead, and the difficulty in Donegal is a mountain range.  That difficulty works this way: constituents may have to travel a considerable distance to see a Deputy or a Deputy may have to travel a considerable distance to see his constituents.  Because of that difficulty then a decision was taken not to make any change in Donegal representation and that decision, as the debate shows, once it was taken, was to hold equally for Kerry and Galway.</P>
    <P>I have searched, as I have said, through this debate to discover what were the conditions and the arguments that operated in the minds of those who drafted the legislation.  At column 379 the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...we must, as a legislative assembly, have regard to special circumstances and the practical problems facing a Deputy who takes a responsible view of his duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be that is a proper view to have, but it is not in the Constitution. The Constitution makes no allowance for special circumstances or practical problems so long as they do not amount to impracticability.</P>
    <P>Later, again at column 379, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...such special circumstances are mainly geographical or topographical, though in some cases the claim for special consideration on these grounds may be reinforced by economic factors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same column, speaking of legislation dealing with the Gaeltacht or undeveloped areas, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One principle, however, which I submit is fundamental in this matter, is that it should be made <Col N="190" /> as convenient as possible for all citizens who may wish to interview their Deputy on any serious matter affecting themselves, their neighbours or their district, to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, the whole tenor of this is the difficulties of Deputies and constituents, difficulties that may upset convenience, and the fundamental point was&mdash;the Taoiseach had spoken of the big mountain range, and this was pivotal&mdash;that it should be made as convenient as possible for Deputies to see their constituents and constituents to see their Deputies.</P>
    <P>Later, the Minister spoke of the variation in the density of population. Again, that is not a matter to which reference is made in the Constitution except that the ratio, and only the ratio, between the number of people in a constituency and the number of Deputies to be elected should be the same throughout the country.  At column 380 the Minister spoke of people &ldquo;concentrated in small areas&rdquo; but scattered over a wide area and &ldquo;sometimes in remote and rather inaccessible places.&rdquo;  The conclusion was then reached that these &ldquo;people do not enjoy the same facilities for consulting with a Deputy as people who live close to, or in the same town or city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that point geography raised its head for the first time and in the same column, column 380 of Volume 177, the Minister spoke of the West.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The nature of the western seaboard adds considerably to the difficulty of a Deputy in keeping in touch with his constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Columns 381 and 382 are full of the same matter with regard to the work a Deputy has to do and the difficulties constituents may have in reaching him. For that reason, the Minister said, the Bill might appear, if viewed in a purely statistical light, to err on the side of leniency so far as rural representation was concerned.  By that time we were full into the swing of the argument that there had to be a bias in legislation in favour of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>May I point the contrast once more? The Minister says that the Bill might <Col N="191" /> appear to err on the side of leniency as far as rural representation is concerned, if viewed in a purely statistical light.  The Constitution imposes on this legislation that this is a matter which should be viewed in a statistical light.  In fact, it is statistics which govern the whole thing, so far as that is practicable, and that is the only reservation in the Constitution.  Later the point raised by the Minister was that we must lessen the disparities between the city and the country&mdash; that is, the way in which people are grouped.</P>
    <P>Finally, he came to another point, which is apparently regarded as fundamental, namely, that we should not go outside the city boundary, nor indeed as far as possible vary the area.  The present electoral provisions change constituencies from their present boundaries.  That is what I have gleaned from the Minister.  I think I am correct in saying that the view expressed there is that the Minister, the Government and the Department were entitled to take into consideration difficulties; that they are entitled to look to the convenience of people and, in particular, to look at the rural areas.  Having looked at these, with the idea of the convenience of Deputies in their minds, they were then definitely entitled to give a rural bias to the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, at column 404, in the opening stage of his speech, said he wished to bring the question of practicability before the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because there is an obligation... to justify the differences which appear in the Bill in the relationship between the number of residents and the number of Deputies in the constituencies proposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Most of us would regard it as impracticable to cross a county boundary in preparing Dáil constituencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is the only time the word &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; is used by either of the two people who put up what I imagine is the Government point of <Col N="192" /> view on this whole matter.  Again, I think in using the phrase in this context the Taoiseach showed he did not understand what the constitutional provision was.  If I am right in thinking, and as I propose to show, that the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; means &ldquo;possible&rdquo;, then there is no impossibility in crossing a county boundary. It may be undesirable and to be avoided as much as possible but that is not what the Constitution permits. It says that there is a ratio to be struck and to be preserved throughout the whole country as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued on that line.  Having taken the line that it was impracticable, he went on to say that they decided to avoid any such arrangement and to stick to county boundaries as far as it was practicable, and also to make the fewest changes possible because there were very good reasons why changes should be minimised. There may be good reasons. The Constitution says that there is to be a ratio to be kept unless it is impossible to keep it.  The Taoiseach at column 404 said&mdash;</P>
    <P>The reference to practicability also requires us to have regard to geographical reasons.</P>
    <P>Then he introduced the mountain which divides the east from the west of Donegal. The reference to practicability in the Constitution refers only to the ratio, to the number of people in an area whom each Deputy is supposed to represent.  That is to be kept throughout the whole country as far as possible. Having decided that Donegal should not be changed, the Taoiseach said that a similar decision seemed to be required in regard to Kerry and Galway.</P>
    <P>May I return to the Constitution? The provision is that &ldquo;the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country&rdquo;.  That certainly does not mean that it, say, a ratio were struck <Col N="193" /> and it were found impossible to keep that ratio in a constituency, the rule of uniformity goes.  The Constitution says that whatever the ratio determined is, it should be kept as far as practicable throughout the country.  If it did emerge for good reasons, even for geographical reasons, that it was impossible to retain that ratio in one constituency, it does not mean that having broken through the rule with regard to the ratio for one constituency, the constitutional provision goes, that it disappears for the whole of the country.</P>
    <P>At column 405, the Taoiseach spoke of the&mdash;</P>
    <P>practical consideration of the travelling facilities available to Deputies,</P>
    <P>and said that that was surely a practical consideration they were entitled to take into account when determining constituencies.  He even went so far as to say:</P>
    <P>...if none of these practical considerations existed, our obligation would be to make each constituency as near as possible exactly the same size in respect of population as the others, but, taking these practical considerations into account, it seems to me that the variations from that rule that are proposed here are quite justifiable.  This idea that, within the limits fixed by the Constitution, we should tend to give greater representation to rural than urban areas has appeared in all the Electoral Acts we have passed here.</P>
    <P>These two arguments raise two points: Practical considerations; practical difficulties. If there were these practical considerations, the Taoiseach admits we should have the same size in respect of population throughout the country for each constituency.  The Constitution makes no reference to what are called practical difficulties. There is no reference to a difficulty except by implication.</P>
    <P>In his second point, the Taoiseach said that the idea of giving greater representation to rural rather than urban areas has appeared in all Electoral Acts.  If it has, it was known to the people who passed the 1937 <Col N="194" /> Constitution.  They knew there was a tendency to give representation of a biassed type to rural areas.  If that is the case, they must have discarded the idea when framing the Constitution. They did not put into it a provision that better representation might be given in rural areas.  The Constitution was passed with one phrase and that phrase in no way hints at giving better representation to the rural areas.  With all the knowledge the framers of the Constitution had and with all the information in their possession, they did not put any provision into it per mitting that view to be taken.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The obligation placed upon the Minister for Local Government was to prepare proposals for an arrangement of constituencies which would keep that over-all limit and also an arrangement which would keep the existing constituencies in so far at it was possible to do so.</P>
    <P>That is contained nowhere in the two Articles of the Constitution I have quoted and they are the only two which have any bearing on this matter. Later the Taoiseach spoke of the fact that the boundaries of the city of Dublin had been enlarged and extended from time to time.  He said at the bottom of column 406:</P>
    <P>There is a consideration there which we are entitled to take into account...</P>
    <P>The Constitution does not say so.  At the top of column 407, he says:</P>
    <P>I would not argue it as necessarily the type of practical consideration that the framers of the Constitution had in mind.</P>
    <P>There are many more things but the rest of the Taoiseach's speech is taken up with the distinctly rural bias, that it is good for the country that there should be, in connection with the next election to Dáil Éireann, a rural bias. The greater part of the rest of the Taoiseach's speech is taken up with that.  Then he came again to this difficulty raised in County Donegal with regard to the mountain.</P>
    <P>This phrase &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;<Col N="195" /> has been the subject of discussion in the courts over and over again.  Before I go to legal opinions and judgments in the courts, I might read from that fount of all wisdom, the Oxford Larger Dictionary from which many years ago we got our definition of a republic and established that this country, even before the repeal of the External Relations Act, had become at least a dictionary republic.  The Oxford Larger Dictionary defines the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; in this way; it says: &ldquo;capable of being put into practice, carried out in action, of being effected, of being accomplished or done.&rdquo;  It puts as synonyms the two words feasible and possible.  The word feasible is defined as being &ldquo;capable of being done, accomplished or carried out, possible or practicable.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;possible&rdquo; are taken as alternative synonyms as far as the dictionary is concerned and each has the meaning of capable of being put into practice, capable of being used in practice.</P>
    <P>There is no argument produced to this House to say that it was not possible to keep the same ratio through the country.  At a later stage in the supplement of the judicial dictionary we had I think in what was known as Stroud's dictionary &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and in particular it speaks of such things as the Factories Act where &ldquo;all practicable measures&rdquo; are supposed to be taken.  That was simply defined in many courts as &ldquo;those that were possible having regard to the stage of knowledge at the time, particularly the knowledge of scientific people.&rdquo;  Certain regulations were made in connection with a variety of businesses in England and here also, for instance in connection with building, there were many regulations and those are imposed on people who engage in building to protect their workers, to ensure that they should take certain measures &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; and court decisions have interpreted that for many years as &ldquo;possible to be accomplished within human or normal resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a couple of cases a contrast was made between certain statutory provisions <Col N="196" /> where things are demanded &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; and where things are demanded &ldquo;as far as reasonably possible&rdquo; and it has been held that the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; imparts a higher duty than what would be imposed if the phrase used was &ldquo;so far as is reasonably possible.&rdquo;  In one other case a bench of judges said that &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; cannot be considered as being equitable or fair or reasonable. It cannot be said to have these meanings.  In quite a number of cases this whole matter has been analysed and the general run of it is that the court looks at something and says: No, you are not asked to do what is practical, what is easy, convenient, reasonable or fair; none of these considerations are involved by the use of this word: the use of this word merely means is it possible or not.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;possible&rdquo; is, of course, a word which most people would agree that they know the meaning of.  At any rate, it is defined as meaning &ldquo;capable of being done.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;possible&rdquo; itself means &ldquo;what may or can be done.&rdquo;  Those being the views held by the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the phrase in this Constitution had been &ldquo;so far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; then, of course, there would be a lessening of the force of the word and that has been canvassed in many cases but the phrase used is &ldquo;so far as is practicable&rdquo; and that is the beginning and the end of the matter.  Out of their own mouths the two people who spoke with authority in this matter have condemned this legislation as unconstitutional because the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; was used once and once only and then you give it a meaning that is not the meaning that must be read into the word.  Out of their own mouths the Minister and the Taoiseach have condemned this legislation as contrary to <Col N="197" /> the Constitution, more particularly contrary to the Constitution which was drafted as the Taoiseach alleged with full knowledge that previous Electoral Acts had shown a bias in favour of rural areas.  If that be the case this Constitution must be interpreted as having put that idea aside and said: &ldquo;Whatever the legislation may have been in the past, for the future there will be no bias or leniency towards different areas.&rdquo;  You get a ratio and you get that in the first part as not more than one for 20,000 and in the second as not less than one for 30,000 and once that ratio is struck it goes for the whole country.  So far as this ratio is concerned that applies, not if it was &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;practical&rdquo;, not if it is fair, not if it is convenient but if it is possible.</P>
      <P>It is to be remembered in this connection that when last year and early this year we were discussing a Bill to abolish Proportional Representation there was, of course, in that a suggestion that if the referendum was carried out and P.R. abolished there should be set up a committee to distribute the seats in accordance with the Constitution as changed by the abolition of P.R. and that committee was to be headed by a judge.  That was to be the situation.  Of course these two things were to be tied together and it is quite easy to see that the Government with equanimity might accept some sort of submission that would be put forward because it would be impartial. But the two things were tied together so that the country was offered a choice of having both or none.  Personally, I objected to the committee for the distribution of seats being headed by a judge because I thought it was not a job for a judge and I also felt that bringing in a judge was merely to give a pretence of fairness whether the fairness might be required or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those days I made a forecast that if the move to abolish Proportional Representation was defeated we would hear no more about the outside committee headed by a judge to establish constituencies in accordance with the Constitution.  The phrase I used was that if P.R. was retained the situation would be met by a handy, talented <Col N="198" /> piece of gerrymandering and here is that handy, talented piece of gerrymandering in this legislation.  May I say if there appears to be a contradiction between what I said about having a judge on the committee to investigate this and having the view that this ought to be referred to the courts as to whether it is constitutional or not, I want to explain that I think the settlement of constituencies originally is not a matter for a judge but I think it is for a judge or a bench of judges later to be asked to determine a legal matter, namely, whether the Electoral Act as drawn now is, or is not, in accordance with the Constitution?  I think it is a matter for administrative people, who may be able to say that something is completely impracticable, to be allowed to carve out the constituencies in a particular way and then present the legislation which embodies their views to a court to decide what the court is in a position to decide, namely, a point of constitutional law.</P>
    <P>For many years I understand that where Deputies of this Parliament meet with Deputies from Britain or Northern Ireland one of the most important points of argument or controversy, so to speak, is the dreadful way in which constituencies have been gerrymandered in Northern Ireland and more particularly in an area I know very well, Derry City.  It has been pointed out as a great example of ruthless gerrymandering in favour of a group.</P>
    <P>The situation in Derry City is, of course, that the Catholic and Nationalist population there are not merely in a majority but a tremendous majority and yet when the Corporation of Derry City is built up it shows a very strong vote against the Catholic Nationalists.  The only defence for that has not appealed to any one of us. It is a good defence made over the years.  An acceptance of the fact that Derry City has been gerrymandered was to get a map to show a big, long tongue stretching out into the heart of the Waterside, the Catholic area in that city, and to see how the Nationalist Catholic population are so corralled up into one small area, in consequence with a very small representation, <Col N="199" /> and then the minority, the Unionist people in Derry City, are grouped together over such a wide area that they get a representation far beyond what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The argument put up in Derry City is bias.  They say &ldquo;Yes, we have divided the constituencies and our purpose in dividing them in this way is because it is possible to give a bias in favour of the industrial and commercial interests in Derry.&rdquo;  In other words, they say the wealthy people in Derry, the people running the main industries and engaged in the main trading ventures in the city, are people who ought to get the representation and they add: &ldquo;The only way we have been able to do that is to carve&rdquo;&mdash;as I say&mdash;&ldquo;a very peculiar configuration of a city to enable representation on an enormous scale to be given to people who, on a statistical basis, are not entitled to it at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We here lose that argument for the future.  Nobody can raise that argument hereafter, either with British representatives or Northern Ireland representatives, because we will immediately be told that here this community has taken a decision on rural areas and, no doubt, the point will not be lost that discrimination in favour of rural areas was definitely intended, as was blatantly obvious, to meet the needs of one political Party. If there is a brick to throw, so to speak, at the Unionists and Orange people in Derry City, that brick can be hurled back with great force after we have decided on a bias which, as I say, the Constitution does not allow.</P>
    <P>In the North there is no Constitution of the type that there is here. There is no fundamental document in relation to which ordinary legislation must be judged.  There is nothing one could take before an independent bench of judges, if they are so independent in the North, nothing&mdash;no test so to speak&mdash;that can be applied to the legislation that divides Derry City, under which the gerrymandering has been done.  Here we have a different situation.  The Constitution, amongst its provisions, includes one for the establishment of an independent judiciary and a phrase in the Constitution <Col N="200" /> in definite, explicit terms gives that independent judiciary the task of deciding whether legislation is, or is not, in accordance with the constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have fortified the judges that we have established here with all the well-known fortifications to ensure their independence, to give them an independent voice on all matters relating to the Constitution and, if necessary, to repel attacks on the Constitution made by the Executive, as they have done time and time again. In the North there is no standard, there is no way of bringing before the courts such matters.  In the North there is no standard by which a piece of legislation, brought before the courts, could be ruled invalid because it is contrary to some fundamental document.  Here we have all the apparatus of a Constitution.  We have a fundamental document setting out duties and setting out certain rights.  We have a Bench of independent judges, well fortified by every device that history has thought up to make them independent in the past, to give the independent judgment which is required of them from time to time.</P>
    <P>We have the Constitution which, I say, this legislation breaches, because new meanings are read into the phrase &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;, and statements made by the Minister and his leader, the Taoiseach, indicate that the phrase &ldquo;impracticability&rdquo; was never considered by them.  There was an easy term of what was a practical difficulty and, if there was practical difficulty that was regarded as meaning that the keeping of the ratio throughout the country is impracticable.</P>
    <P>Will there be any use made of our independent judiciary in this connection? As I say, we have a standard by which the matter may be ruled and we have a bench of judges before whom the matter may be brought.  How may this legislation be brought before them?  There is no question of the population moving towards it.  It is a matter only for the Taoiseach, for the President, after consultation with the Council of State.  In other words, the fate of this measure and the testing of <Col N="201" /> this measure depend entirely upon people who are probably very resentful at the result of the referendum on proportional representation and, indeed, on the result of the Presidential Election.</P>
    <P>It is in the hands of persons, people of that type, who, I must say, looking back to past history must be held to be biassed when this whole matter arises.  The framers of the Constitution have made several efforts upon the Constitution that they made, but these efforts have been restrained by the provisions in it.  There was an effort made years ago in connection with the Article dealing with education.  There was a later effort made in connection with the rights of association, and a later effort made in connection with the rights of private property, and in all these cases the Constitution has been upheld.  These attempts to encroach upon constitutional rights were made by the framers of the Constitution themselves and they were beaten, but only just beaten.  There is now this test that can be applied though I do not suppose that this legislation will get to the courts.</P>
    <P>It may be that some well-minded citizen may decide he will test the matter but there are only two ways, that somebody incurs quite an amount of heavy expense of a personal nature in having the legislation brought before the courts or else, before it becomes law, it may be referred to the courts by the President after consultation with the Council of State.  I say that I doubt if this legislation will ever reach the courts.  Certainly it will not reach them by way of Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>

      <P>I hope the President will obey his own Constitution. If he does not, it is not a reflection I cast on him.  It is only his own activities that will.  I do not care if this goes before the courts or not.  Take your Bill with you.  It is a new device with regard to rural bias and practical difficulties, but take it with you with this memory that once in any piece of legislation&mdash;in the teeth of the constitutional phrase&mdash;one gets outside considerations like rural bias, if rural bias be permitted this time, at a later stage another type of bias may be entertained.  If practical considerations, practical difficulties, prevent the Constitution being carried out any number of difficulties may be elevated, and that means that another Article of the Constitution may be so undermined and snapped that it is no worth-while guarantee to anybody.</P>
      <P>The people who made attacks on the Constitution before may slip through this time for an easier victory, they may get this thing through but, if so, we give the example to the future that what can be done now can be repeated with different distortions on another occasion.  I have no doubt if this legislation is acceptable, and is not referred to the courts, then because it is acceptable the other legislation brought in later will have to be accepted as in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that brings us to a funny situation.  The main institutions of this country have not been regarded with any great favour by the public.  They certainly have not won any widespread measure of support.  The Constitution in which this Article was included did not get through by any large majority. The population was divided roughly into thirds.  One-third voted for; one third voted against; and something more than one-third did not vote at all. I think that same situation prevailed &mdash;there might have been some small differences&mdash;at the first election for President in this country.  It was the same thing last year in connection with the election of the present President. It was the same with regard to the P.R. Bill.  One-third of the community has no respect for the Constitution, the <Col N="203" /> election of a President or for such a thing as a Referendum on an important matter like P.R.</P>
    <P>This legislation is partisan in the worst possible way.  It will not make any difference in the end.  When people have been long enough in this House, they will realise that once the tide begins to go out and once the Party is on the way out, these little footling changes that are made here may save a difficult situation for Fianna Fáil but they will lose the next election.</P>
    <P>You do not change the situation by pettifogging legislation of this kind. Far-sighted people might say: &ldquo;Well, if we are going to sell our birthright for a mess of pottage, we might make sure that the mess of pottage is going to give us something.&rdquo;  It is not very good to destroy an institution and find that it availed you nothing as a Party. That is what you are going to find. Mountains in Donegal and rural bias are of no avail against the ordinary economic things with which we are surrounded such as the balance of payments and unemployment and with expenditure far outstripping revenue.</P>
    <P>The great plans to resuscitate the economy are reduced to the level of the Taoiseach addressing members of local committees to send him up relief schemes as quickly as possible in this attempt to save two or three seats from the wreck that is ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Never in my wildest dreams did I envisage myself in the role of mountain climber.  Never did I realise, until quite recently, that I had apparently succeeded in climbing mountains because on Second Reading the Minister made it clear that I probably knew nothing about Donegal.  I was in Donegal.  Some years ago, on the first occasion that Deputy O'Donnell was a candidate for Donegal, I remember travelling a fair share of that county.  Others travelled with me.  We did not travel over the Border.  It may be that the Cork accent would not be very popular beyond the Border.  We travelled through county Cavan and from there right through Donegal.  Let me affirm that I was more than surprised to discover <Col N="204" /> that one of the mountain passes by which we travelled had a very nicely tarred road.  Having travelled on some appallingly bad county roads in Cavan and having come into Donegal to find a mountain pass with an excellent tarred road, it must be said that Donegal is not in such a bad way when it comes to road travel.</P>
      <P>Having entered the county Donegal from the south-east and having travelled up to the north-west, I am still in some doubt as to where this range of mountains is.  It certainly must be said that the discussions in the House have not in any way enlightened us in regard to the extraordinarily difficult mode of travel that is imposed upon the people by mountains which at one stage are stated to run from north to south and at another stage conveniently run from east to west.  It is quite obvious that from the outset the Minister had to adopt a line of defence in relation to the statement made by the Taoiseach when he said in the House that the pivotal point in relation to any changes that might come about was Donegal.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister in regard to having to defend Donegal. I never asked him to do so.  I never begrudged the people who maintained the position they still hold, but it is quite obvious that the Minister himself knows that the whole thing stinks politically.  He knows that the only way to get over it is to build up, without any undue delay, a range of mountains running east and west and north and south and then tell us how impossible it is to work in such a county and such a constituency.  Having travelled through Donegal, I must say that it is a poor case the Minister had when he depended upon the mountains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has already enlightened us upon other aspects.  If we are to take into consideration the proposals before the House the only county where there may have been mountains in the past but which are now gone is Cavan. There are no mountains in Cavan. Deputy McQuillan must remember that while there may have been mountains in Roscommon in the past, they are going, therefore, to lose a seat.  Again, in the Westmeath area, <Col N="205" /> there are no mountains and, of course, we have no mountains in Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan concentrated upon the legal implications of these proposals in an excellent manner.  I do not wish to delay the House on this subject but I should like to draw attention to the sheer political hypocrisy behind it all.</P>
    <P>The Minister when speaking last week is reported as stating at column 1087, Volume 177, No. 8, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...in fact, with that little leeway that was left to us, bowing to the wishes in a general way of the Opposition as expressed on Second Reading.</P>
    <P>So the Minister has bowed to the wishes of the Opposition in relation to the two extra seats but further on at Columns 1107, 1108 and 1109, you will find how far he has gone in his bowing to the wishes of the Opposition.  It is a strange but true fact that 40 members in the Opposition voted against what the Minister terms their wishes and only three members of the Opposition appreciated the kind consideration of the Minister and voted for it.  In fairness to those three Deputies, I must say that two of them were from a Wexford constituency.  Naturally, I do not blame them.</P>

      <P>The three were kind enough to appreciate the generosity of the Minister while the rest of the Opposition did not.  Is it not an extraordinary situation?  Fianna Fáil, as I mentioned the last day, hold the key position in one county, which is represented by the Minister for Finance.  That settled that.  In addition to discovering a tidy range of mountains in Wexford, they came to Dublin&mdash;the Deputy may not be interested in Dublin&mdash;and having travelled the whole of Dublin city and county, they discovered another extraordinary situation, that right in <Col N="206" /> South-East Dublin, around which the Tánaiste travels, there was another range of mountains.  Deputy Sherwin and other Deputies in Dublin were not considered.  If you were not in SouthEast Dublin, you had no mountains to contend with; But, having the mountains, the Tánaiste is now as proud as a peacock, seeing that he has the help of another Deputy, and they are hoping to have another Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>
      <P>It would be sheer nonsense to waste time discussing such a scandalous piece of hypocrisy as this Bill.  This Bill and the Minister for Local Government have created a record in another extraordinary manner.  As far as I am aware, it has never happened before in this House that a Minister was able to move an amendment and ask for a vote on it and three Deputies were able to table amendments and support the Minister in asking a vote for them, without putting up one single phrase in favour of the amendments. That in itself must give the answer to everything.</P>
      <P>At column 1107, the Minister for Local Government is reported as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Blaney: I move amendment No. 5.</P>
      <P>That is all he said.  There was not one word to justify the amendment.  I challenge any member of the Government Party to show where in the debates in this House, whether on the Second Stage of the Bill or otherwise, the justification for a seat for Wexford as against Cork was mentioned by the Minister or by any Deputy who had an amendment down or by any Deputy who voted for the amendments.  Suddenly, they become dummies.  They had done their canvass.  Fianna Fáil secured an extra seat in Wexford the last time and they are hoping for another seat now.</P>

      <P>I do not care what way he came; he was elected by the people.  I am here to speak the plain truth and no Deputy will prevent me. Not one or two but many Deputies were able to show cause why a seat should not be taken from Cork.  I am not blaming a Labour Deputy or a Fine Gael Deputy from Wexford for voting for Wexford but not one of them was able to show cause as to why their claim was justified.</P>
      <P>It all comes back to another extraordinary situation.  Whatever we may have thought in the past, the records will show that, in 1947, when dealing with a Bill of this nature, the Taoiseach at that time allowed a free vote of the members of his own Party.  We are told of the advanced and liberal-minded statesmen we have in the Government.  Why is it that the Taoiseach did not allow a free vote of his Party on this occasion?  The answer is obvious.  If a free vote had been allowed, Wexford would not have got the seat and Dublin might not have got the seat.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious, even in the case where amendments were tabled in relation to changes in certain townlands, that no consideration was given. That has all gone now.  As Deputy McGilligan says, it makes no difference. It does not make any difference where we are concerned.  Let the future take care of itself.  It is true that of all the Bills brought into this House for a long time, there is more political taint about this Bill, about the mountains in Donegal, about the mountains of South-East Dublin and Wexford, than there could possibly be in relation to any Bill brought in during the term of the Government or by any Fianna Fáil Government in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Desmond has been stressing so much the possibility of hypocrisy in connection with this matter because I feel that that charge will ricochet back on him and others who have expressed themselves in the same way.  It is worth while to check back over the general debate on this Bill to see what is the basis of the Opposition criticism <Col N="208" /> of it.  It will be clearly shown that, although a few Deputies made sudden and unsubstantiated accusations of the most widespread corruption and imputed the lowest possible political motives for the Bill, in very many cases Opposition speakers have expressed themselves very coolly and quietly and, basically, in support of the general provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is shown most clearly in the fact that when it came to the end of the Second Reading, the question was put and agreed to.  If this was such a scandalous measure, something which nauseated Deputy Desmond and Deputy Ryan so much, they would at least have called for a vote so that they might record their feeling of nausea in more concrete terms.  In actual fact, having blown off a lot of hot air, they agreed to the general trend of the Bill and reserved detailed criticism for later.  That showed perfectly clearly that the Bill as originally drafted was basically sound, though there were some matters of detail or, in fact, only one matter of detail, which could usefully be deferred to the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Rather than waste the time of the House with long discussion in public, the leaders of the respective Parties, in a statesmanlike way, got together to see if some reasonable agreement could be reached and placed before the House in public for debate and decision.  It was agreed that the proposed amendments by the Minister were reasonable and disposed of the main objections which had been raised in earlier debates.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 177, column 1089, because Deputy O'Higgins spoke in such a reasonable way and because I believe he expressed the view of his own Party.  He made it perfectly clear that he did not agree with his colleague, Deputy Ryan, I do not criticise him for that because occasionally I disagree with my colleagues.  I think Deputy M.J. O'Higgins in this instance was speaking for the great majority of his Party.</P>
      <P>As reported at Column 1089 of the Official Report of 12th November, 1959, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> I do not think that any Deputy who approaches the consideration of this measure in a calm and fair-minded way, having regard to that constitutional provision, could argue that the Bill as originally introduced, providing as it did, in the constituency of Dublin South (West) that the population per seat would be practically 26,000 and in other, rural, constituencies that the population per seat would be something over 16,000, could say that that ratio which is required by the Constitution was being maintained.</P>
    <P>As against that, the Taoiseach argued that the House was entitled, in interpreting the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; to take into consideration geographical boundaries...</P>
    <P>In the next paragraph Deputy M.J. O'Higgins continues:</P>
    <P>While the Government have not gone the whole way in answer to the arguments put to them on the Second Stage, I feel&mdash;notwithstanding what Deputy Ryan has said, I do not mind expressing it&mdash;that they have made a reasonable effort to meet the point of view put forward and that it would be churlish on my part as a Dublin city Deputy not to accept and appreciate that.</P>
    <P>Surely that shows the way a reasonable Deputy was approaching it from the Opposition point of view?  I think Deputy M.J. O'Higgins was not mincing any words.  He is not afraid to advance criticism in a very direct way whenever he sees it necessary so to do. In this case he expressed himself as feeling that while the Government have not gone the whole way they have made a reasonable effort to meet the point of view put forward on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Having reached that stage we then proceed to the voting on the amendment. However, before I get to that I might quote Deputy Manley who spoke on the same day and who was reported at column 1105 of the Official Report as saying: &ldquo;When I spoke on this Bill on Second Stage, I expressed the hope that it would be left as it was.&rdquo;  Deputy Manley is not <Col N="210" /> given to exuberant irresponsible statements, in my experience.  Here is another Deputy who said that the Bill should be left entirely as it was.  He was satisfied with it as it was.  He would not have been satisfied if it had been a scandalous Bill of political corruption as Deputy Desmond alleged. When it came to the vote on the first amendment the figures were: Tá, 86; Níl, 13.  Does that look as if the House was grossly dissatisfied?  Does that look as if there was a large minority hopelessly dissatisfied with the general tenor of the Bill?  Quite the reverse.  There was virtually as near unanimity as one could get on any question where a vote is called for.</P>
    <P>We come now to the second amendment which dealt with Wexford.  The voting was Tá, 63, Níl, 40.  Here again, if it was such a scandalous decision to award an extra seat to Wexford, an extra seat over and above that originally provided in the Bill, and to make no provision for Cork, is it not more than odd that the total Opposition could not raise more than 40 votes in an effort to defeat it?  I am very glad that only in a few isolated cases has the charge of corruption, political bias and gerrymandering been made.</P>
    <P>In general, I think the Opposition have accepted this Bill simply because it is reasonable, simply because the minimum number of amendments have been made to constituencies.  If there had been any large-scale alteration of constituencies I think the Government would have laid themselves much more open to charges of wishing to manoeuvre constituencies to their own advantage.  In actual fact, the minimum number of amendments have been made and these suggested amendments have virtually been agreed to by the House.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputy McGilligan had to admit, with Deputy Desmond, that he does not know anything about Donegal really or about the way the mountains run.  It is a pity Deputy McGilligan always runs out of the House so quickly after speaking.  The easiest way to help him would be to ask him to consult a map.  I am sure he would be able to read a map.  I am <Col N="211" /> sure he knows where the mountains are in Donegal.</P>

      <P>The point at issue is not whether it is difficult to get over the mountains but how long it takes one to do it.  As the crow flies, the distances around Donegal are short enough.  Unfortunately human beings have not the ability to fly over the countryside as the crow does.  Consequently, they must travel over the twists on the roads which, however well tarred and maintained, take a long time to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try to get away from <Col N="212" /> ascribing political motives where none exist.  It is bad that such a charge should be made when in actual fact the Deputies who made it agreed with the general principle of the Bill, did not call for a vote on the Second Reading and did not produce any amendments whatsoever.  If the Bill were so rotten we would have been flooded with amendments but Deputies did not produce them.  Only one amendment was put down and it was agreed to by the Government and became a Government amendment.  Surely we can get across to everybody in this House and to the public that this House is virtually agreed that in a very difficult situation the best possible solution has been arrived at; that the general tenor of the Bill has been approved on Second Reading; that the first amendment to the Bill was carried by an overwhelming majority and that on the second amendment the Opposition bothered to produce only 40 votes?</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the facts I think it can clearly be stated, in spite of all the efforts of Deputy McGilligan on the definition of &ldquo;practicability&rdquo;, that so far as is practicable in the strict sense of the word the uniform ratio has been maintained.  Every effort has been made to achieve that.  No alternative suggestion has come from any Opposition Deputy or any Opposition Party as to how better the Bill could have been drafted.  Consequently it is to be expected that this Bill will pass its final stage without a division.  It would be very much better that it should.  The general provisions have been agreed.</P>

But this Bill says that the people of Dublin may have only three quarters of the political power which God gives to man and that the other quarter will be distributed amongst the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage there was such a large majority in favour of giving one extra seat to Dublin that I say it was because the House had a guilty conscience in the matter.  If this House were truly honourable, it would have given another four or five seats to Dublin instead of the paltry one which was given.  As the Bill stands, taking the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork, over three-quarters of the people of this country are deprived of their full political power.</P>
      <P>This House has concerned itself in relation to this Bill with one aspect of a Deputy's duty, that of being a messenger or a runner of his constituency, but the ideal for which generations of Irishmen fought and died was not so that we could have our own messengers running to offices in Dublin but that Irish people might through the ballot boxes exercise an influence over Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill as it was introduced and as it now stands deprives the working people of Dublin of the voice that would correspond with their numbers, and the working people of Dublin who compose about 65 per cent. to 70 per cent. of the people of Dublin have their political voice reduced by a quarter compared with that of their country cousins&mdash;the people of Dublin who led the revolution which brought about the freedom of this country, those who obtained at very great sacrifice <Col N="214" /> the Republic we have in which everybody is supposed to have equal political rights.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Booth was fair to Deputy Michael O'Higgins in suggesting he was in complete agreement with this Bill.  Deputy O'Higgins made it clear that in acknowledging what the Taoiseach and the Minister had done between the Second and Committee Stages, he was acknowledging what they had done within the framework of the Bill.  He felt a great deal more could have been done but in so far as the Government gave way to very strong criticism on the Second Stage, he was prepared to acknowledge that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware why Fine Gael did not put down an amendment.  On the Second Stage the Taoiseach was good enough to intervene to say he was prepared to consult with the Opposition regarding possible amendments which could be introduced. In regard to any amendments we might have introduced he knows very well how this House would have divided.  His own Party would have been drilled by the members on the front bench and if the rest of the House were left to divide freely on it the country Deputies would have voted against Dublin all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most undesirable that it should be necessary to say these things but I would not be fair to the people of Ireland if I did not draw attention to the unfair treatment which has been meted out particularly to the working people of Dublin whose votes have been lessened in value by the Government <Col N="215" /> Party and, I am sorry to say, by the Labour Party who have gone into the lobby to vote against equality of political power for the working people of Dublin.  That that should happen in this Republic in which we pay lip service to the equality of the political value of every person is to my mind a disgrace to this Assembly.  Deputy Booth and the rest of the House know that there was little point in wasting time putting down amendments which would be defeated by the narrow-minded views of country Deputies.</P>

      <P>Much time could have been saved if the Government were honest enough to give the country their particular interpretation of &ldquo;so far as it is practicable there would be no change made in connection with the ratio.&rdquo;  Their interpretation of those words really is &ldquo;so far as it is politically desirable.&rdquo; If we put that interpretation on the Bill before the House, every part of the picture fits; the whole puzzle becomes clear, and there is no difficulty about its solution.  All sorts of smokescreens have been put up to cover their interpretation of those words &ldquo;so far as it is politically desirable we shall leave things as they are.&rdquo;  There were smokescreens about mountain ranges and about the topographical, geographical and demographical problems in an attempt to give a reasonable appearance to the deliberate form of gerrymandering which has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth is noted in this House as an expert in trying to extract members of the Front Bench from difficult situations.  He adverted to the fact that there was no great outcry from the Opposition and said that if the all-round Bill was bad there would be no shortage of amendments. I hope I am not misquoting him.  The fact is that, under the terms of the Constitution, and the <Col N="216" /> scope of the Government, their powers of manoeuvring were very limited so far as gerrymandering was concerned.  The very small space that was left to them was explored to the limit in so far as a gerrymandering effort could be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about Donegal and gave reasons for the decision that has been taken in regard to the two constituencies there.  Again Deputy Booth had to come to the rescue of the Minister in connection with the embarrassing situation which has arisen in Donegal.  For years Bord Fáilte have been criticised for the lack or alleged lack of attention they have given to Donegal as a tourist county.  The arguments which have been put forward for years are that Donegal is inaccessible, that it is too mountainous and that it is a bleak, poor country.  That was the picture which was painted here by the Minister, as a responsible Deputy, and as a representative for Donegal. In Merrion Square, or wherever Bord Fáilte have their office, they are tearing their hair out.  On the one hand Bord Fáilte are trying to paint Donegal as a very attractive county that should be visited by people from all over the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, the Minister who is a Donegal Deputy, is taking the line that Donegal is a bleak county, that the mountains there are as difficult perhaps as any to be found in any part of the world. According to the Taoiseach there are only four passes in the mountain range which runs from the north to the south of Donegal over which people can travel from east to west Donegal.  I am not making a case for tourism.  I am trying to put the Minister on an even keel and prevent him from destroying the possibility of a flourishing tourist season in Donegal by his description of his own county and the two constituencies in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather surprised in dealing with the rest of Ireland that more <Col N="217" /> Deputies from the Opposition and the Government side of the House did not express some views on the action taken by the Government in connection with rural constituencies such as the one I represent, Roscommon, and also other rural constituencies such as the one a little further east, Cavan. Here are two examples of where the question of practicability comes in. Here we can find out the real interpretation of &ldquo;so far as it is politically desirable there will be no change.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Politically speaking Roscommon and Cavan are, in the main, anti-Fianna Fáil and therefore there is nothing politically desirable in allowing the same representation in those constituencies.  In fact, it would be a most desirable achievement if they could block off the Opposition from those two constituencies.  If we take another rural county, Galway, we find that the Taoiseach and the Minister have expressed their anxiety to ensure that a rural bias would be given with regard to the allocation of seats.  What do we find with regard to the question of &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;?  We find the interpretation there is, it is politically desirable to make no change in Galway because it suits the Government so far as the number of seats are concerned.  If the same mathematical calculations were applied to Galway as were applied to Cavan and Roscommon, Fianna Fáil would lose, at the minimum, two seats in Galway. You see what happens.  It would appear that the county for years past has been loyal to the political Party which are in power and in return for that loyalty it is decided that they will get special preference.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach&mdash;the President if you like; I do not want to drag him into this debate&mdash;have on numerous occasions in the past 40 years criticised the authorities in the Six Counties for their gerrymandering of constituencies. It is quite true that gerrymandering has taken place in the North to suit the Unionist Party, and much money has been spent down here on issuing pamphlets to show up that gerrymandering in the Six Counties.  At any rate, the arguments that have been used against the authorities in the Six <Col N="218" /> Counties can no longer be used successfully by the Party now in power here because they themselves have, so far as possible, resorted to the same tactics as the Unionist Party in the Six Counties to hold on to office as long as possible.  That is another argument which has been taken out of the locker of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is one shot less left for them to fire at their opposite numbers in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Clann na Talmhan Party and the Fine Gael Party should have expressed their views strongly in this House on the question of Cavan and Roscommon.  It was their duty to do so just as it is mine.  I want to have on the records of the House, at any rate, that this action of the Government, so far as my constituency is concerned, will not pass unnoticed.  On the Second Reading of the Bill a Fianna Fáil Deputy criticised the Government for their action in knocking off a seat in Roscommon.  I refer to Deputy Seán Flanagan.  I should like to compliment him on the fact that he took a disinterested view in the matter and criticised the action of the Government.  His criticism has been appreciated generally in County Roscommon. If I wanted to exploit fully the arguments I could keep this debate going for the next two hours dealing with geographical features and the necessity for giving Roscommon the same representation as it has enjoyed in the past, but I do not intend to do that.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by pointing out that, in the west at any rate, the people have no illusions about the reasons which determined the allocation of seats in the various constituencies. The fact that no change has been made in the three Galway constituencies has caused many an eyebrow to be cynically raised.  I can assure the Minister that the people have not swallowed the argument put forward here that the Government were swayed by a rural bias in their approach to this problem.  No question of practical difficulties arose in the cases of Roscommon and Cavan, but the embarrassing situation was there that if seats had to be taken away on the basis of population, it <Col N="219" /> would be desirable from the Government's point of view to take them from areas which had shown antagonism to or, shall we say, a lack of support, for the Government Party.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies may say it is only natural for the Party in power to take such a step, but I think we should be thankful for the good sense displayed by the people last July when they decided they would hold on to what they had, namely, proportional representation. When I see the skilful guillotining done within the limited scope of the present Bill, I shudder to think of what the Government would have achieved if they had succeeded in their move to abolish proportional representation.  Therefore, we should be thankful to the public for being alert on that occasion. Although they can do very little about what is passing through this House, I believe they will bear in mind the arguments put forward by the Government concerning rural areas such as Roscommon and Cavan and the reasons why those two areas were singled out for the drastic treatment they received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of some of the remarks on the Committee Stage and on this Stage of the Bill, I should like to put on record my views concerning my own constituency.  I spoke on the Second Reading because I felt it my duty to make a case for my constituency.  I did that, I believe, in detail.  I argued against other constituencies. I was told by some people on both sides of the House that I might ruin my case by comparing my constituency with other constituencies, but that did not deter me.  Even though the Minister and the Government channelled the whole discussion into a conflict between Cork and Wexford&mdash;at least it appeared to be a conflict between them&mdash;that was not the argument of anybody who spoke on behalf of Wexford constituency, nor was it, I believe, the argument put forward by those who suggested that the representation in Cork be left as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is a compliment or not, I should like to say it was a skilful <Col N="220" /> piece of work on the part of the Minister and the Government.  Here were Cork and Wexford, each saying they had a case for retaining the seat, but the Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;The two of you can go into the arena and decide who will get an extra seat.&rdquo;  But that was not the argument made by Wexford or Cork.  I was told it would be unpopular for me if I were to suggest, as I did in 1947, that Wexford retain its seat and some other constituency lose it.  That was the only method by which Wexford could get its seat in 1947, and, on a free vote, it did get the seat back.  On this occasion, I was also prepared, as an individual, to suggest that a seat be taken from some other constituency which had not a better case than Wexford and that the Wexford seat be left.  I did not do that because on the Second Stage the Taoiseach announced he would seriously consider&mdash;he nearly went as far as to promise&mdash;that there would be two extra seats.  Therefore, I confined myself to the one amendment, that Wexford get five seats instead of the four proposed.</P>
    <P>I still believe that while Wexford should have five seats, Cork, in all justice, should not be disturbed.  On the recent population figures, Cork has an excellent case for the retention of 17 seats for the whole county.  The Minister and the Government had quite an amount of latitude when they talked about constituencies, populations, and so on, but they were very careful not to include in their calculations the city of Cork or Cork borough when they considered representation in Cork county.  As far as I see it, the total population of Cork, including the borough, is 336,663, which means that, before these proposals, one Deputy represented 19,800 people.  If there are physical difficulties in Donegal, Galway and certain other constituencies, surely there must be the same physical difficulties in County Cork?</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that it is the Minister's constituency, but I am sure he appreciates by now that the case must be made against Donegal when one considers the other constituencies.  In the whole of County Donegal prior to this Bill, one Deputy represented 17,437 people; one Deputy will still, <Col N="221" /> under this Bill, represent 17,437 people.  In Cork, one Deputy represents 19,800 people.  The Minister and the Government may have considered excluding the borough in relation to county Cork and that may give a lower figure.  It is not for me, however, to make the case for Cork, except to say that as far as I was concerned on all the stages of the Bill, my attitude was that, if two extra seats were to be given, Wexford should get one and Cork should get the other.  That is the way in which I and the Labour Party voted.</P>
    <P>As far as I and my colleagues were concerned, it was not a contest between Wexford and Cork.  We based our case on the fact that Wexford had a better case for five seats than Donegal had for seven or Galway for nine.  I suggested that there was nothing sacred about the constituency boundaries in Galway and that the county could be divided into two constituencies&mdash;two four-seat constituencies or one three and one five-seat constituency. The Government were not impressed by that argument and tabled the amendment which was subsequently passed this day week.  Let me stress again that the contest was not one between Cork and Wexford, as far as I and the Labour Party are concerned.  I made my case on the basis that Wexford was more entitled to five seats than Donegal to seven or Galway to nine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words with regard to this bias in favour of the rural areas.  The Minister's argument was that because of the size of the areas represented, there had to be a bias in favour of the rural areas.  I cannot understand that argument. The basis of the argument in favour of the abolition of P.R. was that a small constituency with one representative responsible would be the best because such a man would have closer contact with his constituents and there would, therefore, be proper representation.  Having argued the abolition of P.R. on the fundamental basis of smaller areas, when the Minister had the chance of dividing up the Twenty-Six Counties into three-seat constituencies, he did not avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> The Constitution provides that the constituencies must not be less than three-member constituencies.  I would argue in favour of one-seat constituencies under the P.R. system of election. However, as the Minister has said, the Constitution makes no provision for that.  But, after all the talk on P.R., he comes along and hands out five-seat constituencies which, he states, extend in some cases a distance of 80 miles. He has a bias in favour of the rural areas but he himself is creating a problem now by not giving more attention to the size of constituencies.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any bias, it should, in my opinion, be in favour of the urban areas, and particularly Dublin city.  The whole argument for the bias in favour of the rural areas is that a Deputy is obliged to travel long distances. In view of the argument that Deputies have not enough to live on, to say nothing of paying out large sums in travelling around, I refuse to believe that they do travel, except on an odd occasion.  I believe that most of the contact is kept either by phone or letter.</P>
    <P>It is an easy matter to deal with the constituent by letter because a Deputy can sit here, bored stiff listening to some people talking, and he can relieve his boredom and answer letters, as some Deputies do. On the other hand, we in the city have personal contact all the time. It is not a question of costing us only 6d. or 9d. to get to our constituents; it also costs our 22,000 constituents only 6d. or 9d. to get to us.  That is the whole point.  Rural constituents will not pay £1 or £2 to see their representative.  I do not believe they will pay anything.  If they happen to be in the neighbourhood on business, they may call on the Deputy.  Except in the area where the Deputy lives, I am quite sure that most of the contact is kept by letter or telephone.</P>
    <P>It is the city Deputy who has to work and there should be a bias in favour of the city Deputy.  The rural Deputy may live in a town.  He may live in the country.  We live in huge blocks of buildings inhabited by thousands of people.  Every time a pipe bursts or the lights go out, they <Col N="223" /> are knocking at the door.  That goes on all the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have kept in mind, too, the fact that there is a tendency for people to migrate from the rural areas into Dublin.  He should anticipate that the population of Dublin will be considerably larger by the end of the next 12 years and the population in the rural areas lower.  There are huge problems facing people who live in urban areas.  Consider the large numbers of unemployed.  In the country unemployed people may live on a small farm, or have some other means, but here in Dublin when you are unemployed, unless you have relatives, you are on the floor.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy goes down to the labour exchange, he will see the numbers lined up there.  They are on the doorstep waiting to see their representative.  There will never be that number on the doorstep of the Deputy representing a rural area. Huge numbers come because they have been cut off assistance, refused public assistance, their light cut off when they are not working.  They arrive in droves.  As I have said, they have only to pay 6d. or 9d., or walk &mdash;the whole 22,000 of them&mdash;in the one day if they want to see their representative. In the rural areas, they will not travel 80 miles, or whatever it is, and pay two or three guineas in order to see a Deputy.  If there is any question of bias, it should be in favour of the city Deputy, the urban representative, who, if he happens to be active, has work piled on to him at every turn.  I do not know why Deputies should not be compelled to reside in or have some abode in the areas they represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in so far as the Government are concerned in relation to this matter, both in relation to the original Bill and in relation to the Bill in its amended form, the Government are fully satisfied that the measure is constitutional.  The dissertation to which we listened from Deputy McGilligan, while entertaining in some ways, was nauseating in others.</P>
      <P>It was rather strange after such a short lapse of time to hear Deputy McGilligan talk of the independent judiciary, and the righteous people that he now says they are, and then to turn back to a few short months ago and dig out the debate on the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill and find at Column 1803, Volume 171 what Deputy McGilligan then thought of the self-same judiciary.  I am not aware that they have all been changed in the last few months.</P>
      <P>At column 1803 Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>They all think the same thing&mdash; and when he says &ldquo;they all think the same thing&rdquo; he is referring to a decision arrived at unanimously by the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in favour of the proposals that later came to the House in the form of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. He says&mdash;</P>
      <P>They all think the same thing and I suppose I could add into that, the people who were previously politicians and have since been elevated to the bench.  They know now, and they will remember their old Fianna Fáil affiliations and think exactly what the Taoiseach thinks&mdash;</P>
      <P>At that stage Deputy Moran intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> The Deputy has just suggested deliberately that members of the judiciary would know that they were former members of Fianna Fáil and would now be persuaded by what the Taoiseach has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan: And is that anything dishonest?  If so, I am glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>Now that was the version that we then got on the judiciary.  The Deputy came in here this morning and spoke about various aspects of this Bill, as we now see it, and spoke of the gerrymandering that has taken place under the present system.  He very quietly forgot that it is the selfsame judiciary that he says are now so independent and so righteous, the people who then were not the people in their view to sit on a commission to decide the boundaries of the constituencies but who would now be so much better than the system we now have, and have had for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>Lest it might be said that one swallow does not make a summer let us consider what Deputy Costello had to say in the same debate with regard to highly respected members of the judiciary.  At Column 1029, Volume 171, he said as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Can anybody assume for a moment that a judge appointed, even with this ridiculous machinery of the President, will not be a politician, because that is the scheme under which the Taoiseach brought the position of President into the Constitution?  He will be a politician, probably or possibly elected by the votes of the strong Party in strong Government, that the Taoiseach is so fond of.  He will select his own judge.  He is supposed to consult the Council of State.  Supposing you had an independent Council of State&mdash;let us assume that almost impossible situation&mdash;and they tell him &ldquo;You must accept AB; he is a good judge, an independent judge&rdquo;, he may say, &ldquo;Thank you gentlemen. I have consulted you.  That is all I have to do.  I will appoint CD&rdquo;, who is a tool of the Government in power, who is what the late Kevin <Col N="226" /> O'Higgins would have called a legal careerist, who got his job on the bench because he was the lickspittle of a political Party.  That is the system supposed to give us impartiality and supposed to create public confidence in this whited sepulchre, the commission set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having read those two extracts, and having listened to Deputy McGilligan this morning, one can only assume that the legal dance which he performed here, while it might be appreciated from the point of view of the intricacy of that dance, is certainly not convincing to the House and I am quite sure not convincing to the members of the public.  Of course the Constitution which Deputy McGilligan was at such great pains to assert was being ignored in this Bin, could not get by at the moment without some scourge from Deputy McGilligan's rather bitter and vitriolic tongue.  The Constitution was apparently accepted by a little over one-third of the voters; it was rejected by a little less than one-third and there was something over one-third who had no interest whatever. Generally speaking he summed up the situation with regard to the Constitution as receiving little respect from the community.  Yet it was the Constitution upon which we had this long dissertation from Deputy McGilligan this morning.</P>
    <P>Let us take Deputy McGilligan's own method of calculating the attitude of the community to the Constitution. Let us take this little over one-third, and somewhat less than one-third and something more than one-third who did not vote at all.  Let us go back to the last election of 1957 to the Dublin North (Central) constituency.  The total electorate we find there was 28,009 persons.  Deputy McGilligan was a candidate; 2,985 of those 28,009 people voted for Deputy McGilligan&mdash; a very small figure.  It does not surprise me.  But it is an amazing figure and using the same type of argument as Deputy McGilligan has used with regard to the Constitution, if the figures he quoted&mdash;very rough figures&mdash; indicate that the Constitution is little respected, how little respect then must there be in the Dublin North (Central) <Col N="227" /> constituency for Deputy McGilligan? If there is such little respect, should he not be ashamed to appear here representing those people at all?</P>
    <P>Further in his charges against my attitude to this matter he would make it appear&mdash;other Deputies have also made the direct charge&mdash;that I, because I come from East Donegal, have had some ulterior motive, some personal gain to get from leaving the situation as it is.  Let me recall this matter again.  The number of votes I had in excess of the quota was almost as great as the total number of votes Deputy McGilligan was able to secure in his own constituency.  As far as I am concerned, I did not want to say this during the debate but the matter has been referred to again.  So far as I am concerned, and so far as Fianna Fáil and the Donegal constituencies are concerned, the position would be that if the area were reduced to two three-seat constituencies in the morning&mdash;and I am saying this having given it full thought&mdash;we would, after the next election, if it was held in the morning, and on the past figures&mdash;that is all anybody could go on&mdash;we would have four seats out of the six&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was then said by him and now interjected by Deputy Sweetman that a seat is being left in Donegal as some sort of a payment to the Independent Deputy from that county who has been in this House for quite a number of years and who of late has supported some&mdash;only some&mdash;of the measures which the Fianna Fáil Government have introduced, not because he is bound to do so but undoubtedly because, in his independent mind, he realised they were for the best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely answering some of the rather unfounded charges made and some of the rather weak arguments advanced here by certain Deputies who would like to have us believe that the Government in their approach to this matter were motivated by the basest possible motives and that these Deputies, as individuals, approached the matter with the highest possible ideals.  That is all I wish to do in regard to the type of arguments that have been made.</P>
      <P>In going through some of them, one thing that keeps recurring&mdash;although I notice that Deputy McGilligan who first raised the hare, later kept away from it&mdash;is the reference to how the mountains run in my county.  Very astutely, Deputy McGilligan kept away from that subject.  Deputies may have recourse to this map when the proceedings here are finished.  There is no conflict whatever between the Taoiseach's statement that the mountains run north to south and my statement at a later stage that mountains run east to west and that this had a very big bearing on the actual boundaries of the constituency.  If Deputies will look at this map, I think they will agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>How can a map be reported in the Official Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies look at this map, they will see mountains <Col N="231" /> running from north to south that could have been referred to by the Taoiseach and here from east to west are three ranges going right across. Deputies may have this map for perusal lest they may not believe that I can see straight when looking at a matter like this.  There are mountain ranges running north to south and mountain ranges running east to west and I dare say if we wanted to find mountains running in other directions in other parts of the county, we could do so.  So much for the play made by Deputy McGilligan in the first instance suggesting there was a contradiction between what the Taoiseach and I said.  Apparently, Deputy McGilligan checked his facts and found there was not much basis for what had appeared to him to be contradiction. Other Deputies, without checking the facts, followed the same argument but they can now find out from this map what the facts are and I am sure the map does not lie or err.</P>
      <P>One of the things Deputy Booth made very clear was that with all the charges that had been made, there was a rather significant absence of a challenge or a vote on the Second Reading of this Bill.  Why was there no vote on this Bill?  At the same Stage of the 1947 Bill, a vote was challenged but we come along to 1959 and we find that no vote is challenged. Yet, after a minimum of amendments put down on Committee Stage, three of which stood over my name, we find on the Final Stage, the most desperate charges and descriptions of this Bill as a new &ldquo;low&rdquo; in gerrymandering of constituencies.  These Deputies who have these views now may have had them a week or a fortnight ago.  Why did they not express them on Second Reading?  Why did they not challenge a vote and, even though they might have felt they would not beat us on the vote, it is recognised that the final method of recording one's disapproval of a matter in this House is to challenge a vote and have that vote recorded.  There is no such record and there will not be on the records of this House any names of members voting and recording their disapproval of the passing of the Second Stage of this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> One would expect normally that in a rather complicated Bill like this, covering the entire 26 Counties, there would have been a very big amount of amendments on Committee Stage. They might have been on only small detail, but one could expect that there would have been a very large number of them.  We did not find any such numbers.  Outside the three which stood over my name, and two which were consequential on the changes proposed, there may have been two or three small minor amendments entered on the Order Paper.  Surely Deputies are rather tripping themselves up, being rather uncomplimentary to themselves and are really acting in a contradictory way by allowing those stages of the Bill to pass?</P>
    <P>In the first instance the Second Reading was not challenged to a vote, and on Committee Stage scarcely any effort was made to amend the Bill.  Then, on this time final run through we find them talking when they should have done what was up to them to do, by putting down amendments on Committee Stage.  Now they are making all sorts of wild charges against the actual terms of the Bill, as we now have it before the House, and ascribing all sorts of base and ulterior motives to the members of the Government, and to myself as Minister for Local Government, as to the methods by which we brought about what we have now before the House. I think their arguments now are completely hollow, completely without foundation, and the only reason they are being made is because they failed to put down amendments when they should.  Amendments could have been put down but they were not.  Ample opportunity was available to all Deputies to put them down, and for any Deputy to criticise the Bill now is as much a criticism of himself as of any member of the Government, or as of myself as Minister for Local Government.  If they did not like it they had a remedy.  The effort was not made and I leave it to the House and the public to judge these arguments and the validity of the charges made, to <Col N="233" /> judge whether they are simply made for political argument and political propaganda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not forgetting the Deputy on this occasion because I did omit on previous occasions to advert to his advocacy then of the one-seat areas, now amended to three-seat constituencies, as is constitutional, and making the case that it seems very strange now that we in the Government should find ourselves with five-seat areas, and big areas at that, that we can be brought to task for our advocacy in the Referendum of single-seats, that we advocated them on the basis that they would be smaller and more easily represented, and would give the people a better service, make them more easily serviced, and give the people a better type of Deputy.</P>
      <P>I still adhere to the view we expressed at that time but the picture has changed since then in that the people by a majority, even though a very small majority, voted to show that they did not want the change.  Therefore, in this Bill in giving five-seat and four-seat areas, and notwithstanding the fact that we fought the Referendum on the basis of single-seat constituencies, that in no way takes away from the validity or genuineness in putting these things forward.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan talked of political expediency and made the general charge that this Bill is for the purpose of gerrymandering and giving to a political party, the Fianna Fáil Party, an advantage.  He described it as a skilful guillotining and said that within the very limited scope which was possible for manoeuvring a very skilful job had been done.  While saying that in broad general terms he did not make very much of a case in proving his point by instancing the various individual cases and pushing them home.</P>
      <P>He only made generalisations and took me to task for putting Bord Fáilte in the dilemma he says they are now in in regard to Donegal, and their efforts in the past in bringing people to that county.  He seems to think that the practical difficulties of taking part of what is now East Donegal into West Donegal are not valid.  I have contradicted that by the case I have made.  I do not see anything inconsistent with the mountains of Donegal, which are famous in song and story, and now in the brochures produced by Bord Fáilte, and my description of this particular part of the country.  I only hope that anybody who might be thinking of going to that county will come and see these mountains and these passes of which we have talked here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> There is only one thing further I would like to say with regard to the boundary between East and West Donegal, as we now have it and have had it since 1935, and that is that strangely enough in the eastern side of the constituency and county, the boundary that now exists on that side is the one which has been in existence since 1885 and this map, that so clearly outlines the mountains, also clearly outlines that boundary which exists since 1885.  Another thing the House may not be fully aware of, and which I would be remiss in not mentioning, is that the electoral divisions for election to our local council for many years, correspond in their entirety with the division between East and West Donegal.  The boundaries of those districts correspond in their entirety with the division between East and West Donegal.  In other words, the local administrative areas are, in fact, the same boundaries. Their boundaries are the constituency dividing line and that in itself is an argument which was not, in fact, advanced by me and which should have been put before the House for its consideration in regard to this whole question of division.</P>
    <P>There is one argument that has been used here or rather&mdash;should I say?&mdash; misused.  It was stated several times by many Deputies that I said that there was a rural bias in this Bill but what I said in my speech on Second Reading was that there may appear to be a rural bias so far as the provisions of the Bill were concerned. If viewed in a purely statistical light &ldquo;there may appear to be&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;there is&rdquo;.  I just want to correct that misuse of what I did say &mdash;the misuse that has been repeated by several Deputies.</P>
    <P>The latest acquisition to the House, Deputy Ryan from Dublin South (West), was at great pains to criticise roundly this particular method.  He disagreed with very many things in it. He disagreed with them on earlier Stages of the Bill.  In particular, might I say to the Deputy that, having disagreed so strongly with so many things <Col N="236" /> on other Stages of the Bill&mdash;the argument I have put forward and what I have stated in regard to amendments applies very strongly to him&mdash;I should like to know why the Deputy did not put down his amendments.</P>

      <P>It is quite easy to make these charges at a stage in the proceedings in this House when it can be pleaded that we cannot amend it now. Deputy Ryan, though he may be new to this House, was not in any way unaware of the facilities offered to the Deputies on this and every other matter to put in the amendments and try to correct the various things upon which he has expressed himself so strongly.</P>
      <P>Cavan and Monaghan were mentioned. It was said that the only reason they were dealt with as they have been was that they were anti-Fianna Fáil. Deputy McQuillan made that statement. Deputy McQuillan knows that as far as Cavan is concerned, there were four seats and there are four Deputies from Cavan.  Fianna Fáil hold two of the seats.  It does not seem to me that Cavan is or has been, on its past record, anti-Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Roscommon, which is Deputy McQuillan's constituency, could, in its composition of the members now returned to this House, be regarded, in consequence of their actions in the House, as anti-Fianna Fáil.  What I put to the Deputy is this: If we were to leave Roscommon with its four seats, the average per Deputy would be lower than the lowest average we have.  I think the Deputy would be the first to admit that we had to try to work in our entire programme into the entire number of seats and there were just not enough seats to satisfy every constituency.  The practicability of the constituency and its boundaries had to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> That brings me to the reference made by Deputy McGilligan when he said earlier that the word &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; had been used only once in the two speeches made by the Taoiseach and myself on the earlier stages of this Bill.  As a matter of interest and knowing Deputy McGilligan's facility for getting the wrong slant on certain facts across to this House, I checked up and found that in the Taoiseach's speech alone the words &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo;, &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;, &ldquo;in relation to the practicability&rdquo; and all sorts of phrases meaning the same type of thing had been used no fewer, on my quick count, than seven times by the Taoiseach alone in his short intervention in this House.  I have not yet checked back on my own speech but I can quite safely say that on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage together will be found at least the same number of references to this word which Deputy McGilligan went to great pains to define for us here today.  In fact, as I sat listening to Deputy McGilligan, I just felt that if he continued going round in a circle, he would finally be convinced that the word &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; certainly meant <Col N="238" />&ldquo;practicable&rdquo; so well was he doing the circle but he stopped half-way round.  In fact, it is just as well.</P>
    <P>I just want to say that in our preparation of this Bill, and the constituency boundaries we have now presented to the House, the practicability or impracticability has been referred to on a very great number of occasions, not just once as Deputy McGilligan said here.  In making the case that it was mentioned only once, he was making the case that we had not placed much weight on that word in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I should say in regard to this whole matter, except to conclude, as I commenced, by saying that the Government are satisfied&mdash;were satisfied and are still satisfied&mdash;that this measure, as presented now in this amended form to the House and, indeed, in its previous form, is constitutional in every respect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete section 21 (2), lines 37 to 40, and substitute the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The Chairman may suspend from duty a civil servant to whom this section applies, who, while employed on duties directly related to the business of Seanad Éireann, is guilty of grave misconduct warranting disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman expressed some doubt about the wording of the section as it stood.  I undertook to look into it again and to see that it was made certain that members of the staff engaged on Seanad work would be covered by the section.  Therefore it is a redrafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the redrafting does cover the situation. The previous draft, shall we say, threw some doubt on the matter.  I am not interested so much in the power of suspension <i>per se.</i>  What I am interested in is that when officials are doing Seanad work the Seanad will be enabled to carry on its work on its own.  I agree with the Minister that the way to provide that is through, so to speak, the delegation of the power to the Chairman of Seanad Éireann.  One should not lose sight of the fact that we are considering not merely the position of what I might term an unruly official but the principle that while the Seanad is doing its work, even though it happens to be in the same building as the Dáil, it is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is a point that was considered.  It is extremely <Col N="241" /> difficult to express by way of statute what the Deputy has in mind.  I should not like to put into a statute that the Ceann Comhairle would be bound to allocate staff, and so on, if required. We have to assume the Ceann Comhairle will do that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 9, section 28, to insert, after subsection (2), the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  (a) In the subsection&mdash;&lsquo;civil servant to whom this subsection applies&rdquo; means a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas (other than the Superintendent, Houses of the Oireachtas, or the Captain of the Guard, Houses of the Oireachtas) holding office on the 1st day of June, 1959;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;reckonable service&rsquo; means, in relation to a civil servant to whom this subsection applies, service rendered by him which would, if this subsection were not passed, be reckoned in computing his superannuation allowance and additional allowance under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) For the purpose of calculating the superannuation allowance and additional allowance payable under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1956, to a civil servant to whom this subsection applies, whose reckonable service would, if he retired on attaining the age of sixty-five years, exceed sixteen years but not twenty-six years, the Minister may add to the reckonable service of that civil <Col N="242" /> servant such period of notional service as the Minister thinks proper, so however that the total of the reckonable service of that civil servant and the notional service so added shall not exceed the period of service by reference to which the superannuation allowance and additional allowance payable under subsection (1) of this section were computed.</P>
    <P>This amendment comes as a result of discussion both on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage. Many Deputies expressed a wish to see the members of the Staff of the Oireachtas considered with regard to superannuation.  Various suggestions were made.  Having considered the matter, I thought the best we could do in all the circumstances was to raise the number of years' service notionally to 26 years, where it may be lower, in reference to those who are serving at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested that I might give special consideration to former members of the I.R.A., being defined as those who are drawing pensions or holders of a medal.  On consideration, I thought it would be difficult to do that.  It would be very difficult to meet the case that the members of the Oireachtas Staff were in any different position from the members of the Civil Service generally. This is a different code of legislation. Ex-members of the I.R.A. have been dealt with by various Acts by way of pension and medal which qualifies a person for a special allowance if he is qualified in another way.  It was pointed out to me that if we wanted to do something else for members of the staff who were in the I.R.A. it should be done under the military service pensions code or an Act of that kind.  I departed from that and thought the simplest way of dealing with it would be to bring all the serving members up to around two-thirds of the superannuation they would be entitled to on retiring This amendment is now presented to give effect to that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally dissatisfied with this amendment.  I cannot accept what the Minister has said, <Col N="243" /> namely, that this amendment gives the same privileges, if one may use that word, to the people that are named as to those who are included in the original subsections (1) and (2) of Section 26.  It does not seem to me that it covers the very special case that can be made for the people who had the task of trying to build up the institution of this Oireachtas particularly in its very early years.  The task of building up these Houses and of building up the traditions that were to go with them was quite a different task from that which has been compared by the Minister in relation to the Civil Service as a whole.  There was opportunity, in one way, of experience in relation to Departmental work but there was no such opportunity in relation to a Parliament.  Therefore, the people who came in at the beginning and gave of their best here are entitled to be treated in a different way</P>
      <P>When two members of the staff are being picked out for special treatment &mdash;I use the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo; to cover officers and everyone else in this connection&mdash;we in this Party feel very strongly that the treatment should be accorded to everybody.  The Minister's amendment does not accord the treatment of added years to everyone.  It accords it to a few more than the two persons concerned.  That is not meeting the principle.  That is only going, for the sake of expediency, a very small part of the road.  The principle involved in subsection (1) of section 26 is that six years' service shall be added. If six years' service shall be added for one man, then six years' service should be added for everyone employed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say I am totally dissatisfied with this amendment, as I was totally dissatisfied with the original section, I want to make it clear that it is because the same measure of concession is not being given to others as is being given to a very small number, rather than that I have any objection to those who are getting it.  I am not objecting to the giving of the concession to those mentioned in the original section or to those given in this amendment but when six years have been given in one place they should be given in all <Col N="244" /> places.  That seems to be common justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman I am totally dissatisfied, but it seems useless to go into detail in an effort to improve this Bill.  On a previous occasion I mentioned the position of other members of the staff. I still hold that view in relation to these men.  They are being denied justice in so far as the Minister claims to be fair by giving common justice to two officials.  I consider it is necessary to go beyond that and I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one case, without mentioning names.  There is a person who since 1919 served as an official of the Irish Government.  He had a break in service due to imprisonment. He refused to take part on any side in the Civil War and now political victimisation is continuing in this case. I am convinced the Minister knows of this case.  The Minister cannot say fair play is being given when he is considering only two members of the staff, although I say good luck to them. Whether it is because of indifference or because of his determination to continue political favours for some and discrimination for others, he is claiming that this amendment will be the remedy, when we know it is only eyewash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Minister correctly in his statement in moving this amendment, he appeared to experience some kind of perturbation that singling out the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas for special treatment in accordance with the demands from this side of the House might give rise to dissatisfaction in the Civil Service as a whole.  If that argument is to be accepted and regarded as valid, it is an equally valid argument against the principle enshrined in the section to which this is an amendment, namely, Section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, I made the comment with regard to this section, from which this amendment emanates, that it was marred by selectivity.  I cannot see my way to depart from that view on looking at and reading this amendment.  Rather am I reinforced in my view that not alone was the <Col N="245" /> principle of selectivity put into operation in regard to the principal section but that it has on closer scrutiny been moved a step further in that direction as far as this amendment is concerned, namely, that it selects a few more.  It is not very hard to guess the arena from which that selection is made and the natural corollary is that discrimination is rampant with regard to others.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear upon what we disagree and let us be clear in relation to the principles from which we proceed towards the doing of justice.  At the recent Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis the Taoiseach announced our entrance politically into a new era and side by side with that he said he thought the old era of bitterness and strife should be forgotten and regarded as dead. This section and the amendment are giving new life to that bitterness.  It is for that reason that I am opposed to them on the simple basis that they are resurrecting the past, leaving justice undone.  If the Minister is going to fulfil the pronouncements of the Taoiseach at the Árd Fheis, the Minister would do well to reconsider this, to go back and do justice to the people who gave their lives to the building up and moulding of our Parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to be concerned that he might be creating a precedent if he were to treat the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas differently from other members of the Civil Service in this respect.  Is it not clear that the introduction of this Bill, which protects the interests of a small number of civil servants in that special position, already establishes that principle? All that is being asked on this side of the House is that the principle should be extended to cover all Civil Servants who have given particular service to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In accepting the suggestions put forward on this side of the House he would be merely extending the principle in this Bill to cover all those who feel they have justifiable demands on State funds for their special services over the years in the service of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="246" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Sweetman that this amendment does not give equal treatment to all members of the staff.  I came down in favour of this amendment in the end because I believed I was giving equal treatment to all, that is, that any member of the staff who would have less than 26 years' service at the normal retiring age would have years added to that to bring it up to 26 years.</P>
      <P>I think the argument on the other side is that we should add years. Some advocated on the Committee Stage that we should bring everybody up to 40 years; others thought we should add years to everybody whether they were near the 40 years or not.  That would certainly be departing from the section as it stood referring to individual officers.  If, for instance, the two officers concerned had 34 years' service I would certainly never have asked the Dáil to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>When this section was before the Dáil I explained that these officers were in a particular category, that these posts had so far been filled by the I.R.A. and that it was not likely that any further vacancy in either of these two offices would be filled by an I.R.A. man.  I said it was more than likely that in the future these offices would be filled by ex-members of the army or the police force who would have served a fair number of years, who would have a fairly substantial pension and would therefore need no special treatment as far as we were concerned.  That is the reason why these two men were picked out.  The other officers came in at a normal age and will by the time they reach 65 years of age have earned full pension. I must confess I do not know who the individual is that was mentioned by Deputy Desmond but there may be hard cases of that kind.  To accuse me, as Deputy Lindsay did, of raking up the bitterness of the Civil War is ridiculous, because of the two men mentioned in the Bill, one was on one side in the Civil War and the other was on the other side.  To accuse me of being partial is, of course, mere Fine Gael pleading, and that is a sufficient description of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> I am also accused, I think, by Deputy Lindsay, of bringing in another group that might be favourable to this Government.  I do not know either of the men.  I have seen the circumstances of their cases, the number of years they have served, when they came in and when they are likely to retire.  I may have seen their names, but I do not know one from the other.  I have no personal interest in them.  If Deputy Lindsay is speaking for the Fine Gael Party, and if he thinks this amendment is unfair, I am quite prepared to withdraw it.  I shall not have the slightest compunction about withdrawing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess the Minister and I differ categorically on the principle involved in subsection (1) of Section 26.  The principle there is not, in my view, what the Minister says it is&mdash;bringing a person up to 26 years' service.  The principle is that of adding six years to a person's service for pension purposes.  If the principle was what the Minister says it is, I could quite understand him, but it is not.  The principle is the addition of six years' pensionable service.  If that is the principle enshrined in sub-section (1), Section 26, then that principle should be applied to anybody who needs six years' service to give him the maximum pension.</P>
      <P>I made it quite clear on Committee Stage that I do not expect anybody to go over 40 years' service, which must be the maximum under the Superannuation Acts.  My amendments, which were ruled out of order, were on the basis that the principle was that they had six years' service added and so much service could be added for those who needed that service to bring them to the maximum, so long as the addition did not exceed the six years being added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the whole point.  Here is a principle of adding six years' service for pensionable computability.  If you can add it for one, you can add it for everybody.  So far as I can see from the lists the Minister gave me&mdash;I have already paid my respects to him for having given them to me&mdash;there are 30 people on the staff who may retire <Col N="248" /> with less than a full pension.  I am not quite certain in relation to one of them, but there are either 29 or 30. There is one man who is referred to as having 40 years' service and I do not see why he is included.</P>
    <P>So far as I can ascertain, the Minister's amendment covers six, so that means 23 people are left out of the principle included in subsection (1) of Section 26.  That is not a serious number when one computes the entire Civil Service or even if one computes the entire number of people serving in these Houses.  Without any doubt, many of those 23 people who are still left out are people who served the State before 1921.  Many of them are old I.R.A. men.  So far as I can ascertain&mdash;I did not go round asking individual people&mdash;many are old I.R.A. men who came into the service of the State later on in years.  The Minister acknowledged on Committee Stage or Second Stage&mdash;I forget which&mdash;that he could understand that the type of service in these Houses was a type which might appeal to old I.R.A. men.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister, in framing this amendment, is not doing full justice to the principle of adding six years.  I do not think he is right in saying that the principle is one of bringing someone up to 26 years. There is no merit in that argument.  If you had five officers, one of whom had 17 years' service, one had 18 years' service, one had 19 years' service, and two had 20 years' service, and you brought in an original section covering all five of them, so that they would all be raised to 26 years' service for pension purposes, then I could understand the Minister making the argument that the principle involved in the section was to raise it to 26 years.  It is not what happened.  One person had six years added to his service and that is the principle that is in the section as it stands, and that is a principle which, I submit to the Minister, should be extended to all the 30 people involved and not merely to six.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see the Deputy's way of looking at it but I should like to repeat that if the two officers mentioned had over 30 years' service, I would never have brought the <Col N="249" /> clause in.  It is because their years of service were so low that this was done and we did not give a very big lift&mdash; just six years.  If there are others in the same boat, there cannot be any great grievance if we bring them up to 26 years also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested there is another way of dealing with the matter if there is a grievance on the part of other long-serving members of the House who are old I.R.A. men.  In order to avoid bringing in other members of the Civil Service or creating a difference between them and persons working in the Houses of the Oireachtas, could the Minister not decide that they should be treated in the same way under other measures such as the military service pensions legislation and so on?  If the Minister feels such machinery is available for dealing with this special question of adding to their years for superannuation purposes, would he not consider it would be applicable to the two cases mentioned in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. What I said was that it is very difficult to pick out an ordinary civil servant&mdash;I want to make it clear that I mean an ordinary civil servant, whether of the clerical officer grade, messenger grade or usher grade, which grades are closely allied as the ushers are drawn from the messengers&mdash;and give him special terms because of I.R.A. service.  It would be very difficult to do that and withstand the demands of the other Departments of the Service who would have a claim, anyway, that they had equal rights to the same concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that in the general service we have to depend on the code of military service pensions to give these people preference over ordinary civil servants who had no military service. I have been arguing from the beginning that the two officers in the Bill are in a different category.  These two posts have been filled by I.R.A. men from the beginning, but, as I explained, they will be the last I.R.A. men to go into these posts.  From now on, it is more than likely that these posts will be secured by officers of the Army or Garda Síochána who <Col N="250" /> will have had a fair number of years' service and will have therefore a fairly decent pension.  As a result, there will be no case in the future for giving the occupants of those posts any special concessions.</P>
    <P>As we are now making the change and as there are two men not far from retirement, I put the clause in to cover these two cases as exceptional cases.  As far as the ordinary staff are concerned, I feel you cannot make an exceptional case there.  Perhaps I am illogical in yielding to the pressure of the Dáil and bringing in now this amendment to cover everybody up to 26 years at least so that they cannot have a grievance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned ushers.  I did not intend to mention any particular class but, as the Minister has mentioned ushers, I shall try to compare them with messengers. In latter years they have been recruited from the messenger branch of the service.  But there is, I would suggest to him, an entirely different situation in relation to them and in relation even to the other class involved here, and more or less analogous, that is a paperkeeper.</P>
      <P>When these Houses were being established ushers had to set out on an entirely new line of country, quite different from that of a messenger in a Department.  A messenger in a Department had his duties more or less-easily circumscribed and defined.  But in the establishment of the Oireachtas, and particularly in its formative years, there was a great deal more to be done.  It required tact and initiative. It was not merely a question of doing a job but of ferreting out exactly what job you were supposed to do.  It was not merely a question of taking a message from somebody who called at the gate to see Deputy So-and-So. There was a great deal more than that involved.  No precedents were available to us here.  Therefore, there had to be a large amount of new work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the ordinary work of a paperkeeper in a Department is merely to see that the various officers, typists' pool and so on have adequate stocks of the various forms, paper and so forth.  That is not the case here.  The <Col N="251" /> case here is not one of doing a circumscribed job but of trying to see how you can develop your job, be it usher or paperkeeper, to assist the Oireachtas to work as an Oireachtas. There is therefore quite a difference between the comparison the Minister has drawn and other messengers in the service.  I do not think that could be denied, and I do not think the civil service associations would want to deny it to the tiny number of people concerned in those two jobs.  There is then the question of the reporters and translators.  I can see reasons there why they would not be comparable to the ordinary civil service grades.</P>
    <P>As I say, there are only 30 people involved.  To the best of my knowledge, the amendment deals with six. It might be that there are only 29 involved and the amendment deals with six, leaving 23.  It is only 23 or 24, to judge from the schedule the Minister gave me.  Having regard to the undoubted fact that there is a difference between these members of the staff&mdash;and I think everybody in the House would support the Minister in claiming that there is a difference between them and the rest of the civil service&mdash;the Minister ought to deal with the whole lot rather than only six.</P>

      <P>The six years is what is involved.  I do not want to go into the argument of how much unestablished service is pensionable.  I have deliberately avoided that line. As far as I can see, it would run from one to six years' added service. In one case, six years might be involved; in another, one year.</P>

      <P>The Minister says this is a non-recurring problem arising out of the consideration of the two people mentioned.  Is it not true also of the people the Minister is being asked to consider now?  The question of I.R.A. service will not occur again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made was that the two named in the Bill filled posts that were, if you like, automatically filled up to this from the ranks of the I.R.A.  That cannot be done again because the old I.R.A. people are getting too old now to fill posts of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gives the six years which Deputy Sweetman has asked for and which I am asking for, it will dispose entirely of any substance in the charge I have deliberately made of discrimination.  I shall whole-heartedly withdraw that charge if the six years are given.  As Dr. Browne says, it will not be recurring; and when we are doing something in a small community such as the staffs of the Houses of the Oireachtas, it would be as well that no foul taste would be left in anybody's mouth.  I think the Minister is reasonable enough, if he feels so disposed, to make this small concession of six years apply to everybody here, and time will certainly reward him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, if the Minister looks, he will find that one person who came here in 1923 will retire with only 29 years' pensionable service and that the addition of the six years would still leave him with only 35 years.  Another man who came in on the 1st November, 1922 would retire with only 32 years' service.  If he got the six years, he still would not be up to the maximum.  I am not arguing against six.  Six is the number in the other section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another man who has service starting on 25th July, 1922, but who will only have 33 years for pensionable purposes.  Another man who started on 1st August, 1922, will only have, without the addition, 34 years for pensionable purposes.  There is a real difference between these and the other classes in <Col N="253" /> the Civil Service as a whole.  It is a general service problem and the principle in subsection (1) which the Minister has brought in is the principle of adding six years.  I suggest he ought to do that for everybody.  I cannot put down an amendment.  He alone has the right to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to repeat that I can understand the Deputy's argument with regard to the principle. When I was asked to consider the cases of these two men my first reaction was that we could, perhaps, give them about two-thirds in order to be fair. That was the sort of principle I applied. In other words, we would bring them up to 26 years.  We look at it in a different way, and that was the principle as far as it occurred to my mind in the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a pity, to put it at its most courteous, that we should look at it in a different way when such a very small number are involved?  The Minister is good enough to concede my point of view as a possible view.  Is it not better that we should get courteous uniformity all round when we are dealing with the Houses of the Oireachtas?  The Minister will not be weakening.  He will be showing his strength and he will get a withdrawal from Deputy Lindsay into the bargain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in the unique position that the Opposition is not objecting but is merely asking him to be fair.  That is all we are asking.  No member in Opposition has offered any criticism of what is being done in relation to some.  The Minister has spoken of the position of the two officials named in the Bill.  Sometimes I find myself wondering if the Minister is trying to convey to us that these two officials came in directly, as it were, from the I.R.A.  Actually they came in from another branch of the Service.  I should like to know, and this question carries no derogatory connotation or any criticism of any officials, at what age these officials came into this particular service? Would they, if they had remained in the service to which they were <Col N="254" /> attached prior to coming in here, enjoy the same benefits or would they be less, or would they be more than the Minister is offering?</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has mentioned&mdash; indeed we have all mentioned&mdash;the position in relation to some other members of the staff.  Whatever the Minister may say, he is going a certain part of the way towards helping, but he is not going all the way.  After all, there are not many involved.  I do not believe for a moment there would be any objection on the part of any other civil servants in other Departments; but, even should there be objection, we have a definite answer.  The men we are pleading for here are old I.R.A. men just the same as the two for whom the Minister speaks.  We are on common ground in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister still says he does not know the position of the one man I have mentioned. I have picked out one case. The others have already been mentioned. Deputy Sweetman has concentrated today on their position.  But the one man I have picked out is, it seems to me, one who had no say whatever on one side or the other, be it civil war or old I.R.A.  Age changes situations in every generation but, as far as I am aware, one man is in the position that he is not getting fair play.  Is it because he took no side in the misfortunes of the early 'Twenties?  He had been in the I.R.A.  Can we not give him credit for that?  He had a term of imprisonment.  Can we not give him credit for that?  Is it too much to ask that he should be treated on the same basis as others have been treated?  If the two officials concerned had not come into their present positions as officials, as the Minister terms them, of this House but had remained in the branch to which they were attached prior to coming here, would they now be in the position in which the Minister is placing them?  Would they be better off?  Would they not be as well off? If they are getting concessions now from the Minister, then good luck to him for offering them and may the <Col N="255" /> recipients enjoy them, but surely the Minister is big enough to see that what he is giving to two should also be given to others who are equally entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give Deputy Desmond as much information as I can.  If one of the two had remained in the service he was in, he would get roughly the same pension and gratuity as provided in this Bill. The other had, of course, left the service for some years before he came in here, and so I cannot answer the question in his case.</P>

      <P>One thing is clear&mdash; this will not be a recurring problem. It will not arise again so far as the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned.  Remembering that, is the expense of adding six years so formidable that it cannot be overcome? In my view the amount involved is so small that it would be well worthwhile spending even more to achieve some degree of uniformity and some degree of harmony.  I again appeal to the Minister to take the substance out of the feeling that there is discrimination.  I shall be the first to withdraw any suggestion of discrimination if he concedes the six years to meet the case reasonably adequately.</P>

      <P>Sé an bhun-chúis faoi ndear don Roinn an Vóta Forlíontach seo a lorg ná go bhfuil cead ag teastáil chun níos mó ná an soláthar de £3,750 atá déanta chuige sin mar Dheontas-i-gCabhair faoi Fho-mhírcheann O den Vóta d'íoc le haghaidh scoláireachtaí saoire agus scoile sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I mbliana bhí méadú mór ar an lión páistí a cuireadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht seachas an méad a cuirtí sna blianta roimhe seo.  Sa bhliain 1956 cuireadh 242 pháiste go dtí an Ghaeltacht; sa bhliain 1957 cuireadh 333; sa bhliain 1958 cuireadh 465 agus i mbliana do cuireadh 1,128.  Sna blianta 1956 agus 1957 ní raibh ach ceithre Choiste páirteach sa scéim faoina gcuirtear na páistí go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  'Sa bhliain 1958 do bhí ceithre Choiste déag páirteach agus i mbliana do bhí fiche Coiste páirteach sa scéim.</P>

Chun na deontais <Col N="262" /> sin d'íoc in iomlán i leith na bpáistí a cuireadh chun na Gaeltachta i mbliana do bheadh iomlán de £4,685 ag teastáil agus muna gceadaí an Dáil an t-iomlán sin, mar a hiarrtar leis an Vóta Forlíontach seo, beidh ar an Roinn na deontais sin a ghearradh síos. Nílim sásta an gearradh síos sin a dhéanamh ag féachaint don dochar a dhéanfadh sé sin don scéim agus do leas na gCoistí atá dá cothú.  Da ndéantaí an gearradh a bheadh riachtanach bheadh meán-chailliúint de £46 15s. ar gach Coiste atá páirteach sa scéim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a short and, I think, non-controversial Bill which is necessary to keep the Rent Restrictions Acts in force while the Oireachtas is considering a comprehensive measure which will repeal and re-enact the Acts with modifications.  The comprehensive measure represents the result of the Government's consideration of the rent control problem in the light of the recommendations in the Conroy Report on Rent Control and in the light of the economic and other developments that have taken place since the Report was presented.  Owing to the technical and complex nature of this branch of the law, the drafting of the measure was not an easy task but the examination of the text is now almost completed and I shall shortly submit the Bill to the Government for final approval.  I expect to introduce it early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>The present Bill is on the lines of those passed in recent years.  Section I proposes to continue the Acts for a further year but this period is a maximum one as it is reasonable to assume that the comprehensive Bill, which will replace it, will have been passed through both Houses by then.  Section 2 is a usual provision in Bills of this kind and enables a landlord who puts premises into a reasonable state of repair during the period for which the Acts are being continued to obtain the same lawful addition to the rent as he could obtain for such repairs if he did them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is general agreement that the existing Acts should not be allowed to lapse pending the enactment <Col N="264" /> of amending legislation and I therefore ask that the House give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

If any case could be made on the grounds of urgency, naturally accommodation could be given, but the date to which the legislation is extended is to the end of next year.

      <P>Not as long as it is put through by the 31st December.  I think Deputy Sweetman was talking yesterday about the Order Paper being cluttered up with Bills.  This is an opportunity to take at least one Bill off the Order Paper.  It is true that <Col N="265" /> there are a number of Bills on the Order Paper which have been on it for a considerable period.  I have no doubt that the Deputy was referring to that particular type of Bill, but here is an opportunity to remove at least one of them.  If the Deputy sees some good reason for not giving it to us, I cannot object to it, of course.</P>

      <P>There are difficulties. Objection was taken yesterday to having these things remaining on the Order Paper without any indication when they would be cleared up by furtherance of the proposals. There are two other Bills&mdash;the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, 1959, and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1959, both in Second Stage.  Those two pieces of legislation were in a filling cabinet in my room in the Attorney-General's office by the Autumn of 1956, if they were not there by the Summer of 1956.  It was a long time before they made their appearance on the Order Paper. They have remained there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of no reason why these Bills should have been held up for the past four years. ties in so far as the drafts had to deal <Col N="266" /> There may be constitutional difficul-with certain points but surely it does not take so many years to get over a constitutional difficulty?  There is another piece of legislation&mdash;the Charities Bill.  That was certainly in draft in the early days of 1956 with one point only remaining and that was the definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.  It has not taken all that time to get the definition of what is a charity because the rest of the Bill was merely machinery. Against that, I am asked to clear up a Bill which made its first appearance a week ago.  The Minister will get it cleared off next week.  I am objecting to the habit which is growing up of looking for all Stages of a Bill without any notice being given to people who do not happen to be here on the day the Second Stage is on that it is proposed to take all Stages. Some intimation should be given that it was proposed to ask for all Stages on the grounds that the Bill was not controversial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that has aroused a good deal of controversy and general discussion among the people of the country as a whole.  Although the Third Stage might be a more appropriate Stage upon which to make one's contribution, I somehow feel that it is incumbent on every Deputy to express his opinions on the present Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that comes to mind in discussing a Bill like this is the reaction of the public as a whole.  In the messages or the instructions, if one cares to put it that way, which we receive from our constituents the <Col N="267" /> general reaction has been why is this Bill introduced?  That is the opinion of the public as a whole.  What the Deputy has to consider, first of all, is whether such a Bill is necessary and if such a Bill is necessary does it, taken as a whole, meet the requirements of this trade?</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say at the outset that a Bill is necessary.  No one can be satisfied with the existing state of affairs.  It would be no harm to go into the particular reasons which might have motivated the Government or the Minister for Justice to introduce such a Bill.  There is a widespread public feeling that the man in one street is getting a better deal than the man in the other, that is to say, among licensed traders, as a whole, there is the impression that people are not getting a fair crack of the whip, if a licensed trader a few streets away is satisfied with the present licensing laws and at the same time if I break those laws, I am brought to the courts and prosecuted, while my counterpart working under the same conditions in the same locality is not.</P>
    <P>That rather suggests to an ordinary public representative who knows nothing about this trade and who has no connection whatsoever with it that some amendment of the existing laws is required.  Why should we require a Liquor Bill?  I think I might say at the outset that we require a Bill because public opinion is not behind the existing law.  There is no desire on the part of the Irish people that these laws should be enforced.  There is no real sympathy when these laws are enforced.</P>
    <P>That seems to suggest that there is something wrong with the situation as a whole.  Therefore, the onus is ultimately on the public representative to discuss any Bills brought before the House and to decide whether he thinks the Bill is a good Bill or whether it is going to be of benefit to the public as a whole.  It is for that reason that I speak on the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss what is actually in the Bill itself, I want to <Col N="268" /> refer to a matter to which other Deputies have referred before and to which the Minister did not refer but which, on being questioned by the Leader of the Opposition, he said we were freely and fully entitled to discuss on Second Reading, that is, the position of the 6-day licensee versus the 7-day licensee.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone who has spoken so far on the Second Reading has promoted in any way the cause of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  The <i>bona fide</i> trade was originally created a considerable time ago, when the circumstances were totally different from what they are to-day, for the purpose of enabling travellers to buy a drink and have it according to the law of the land, as they wanted it.  That, of course, was long before the days of universal mechanical transport.  It was in the minds of the legislators and those who drew up the Bill in those days to create a situation whereby a traveller could satisfy his thirst or inclination for a stimulant on his journey.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy will acknowledge that the position to-day is totally different. To-day, there are a number of licensed houses in and around the city of Dublin.  It is possible for a person to get into a car and travel a distance of three miles and buy a drink.  In the circumstances at present existing, he may have to ride a bicycle very soon, next week, at any rate.  It is fair to say that the situation that existed when the original legislation was introduced to deal with this question no longer exists.  Therefore, if the <i>bona fide</i> trade is to go, in fairness, it must be replaced by something else.  The replacement of the <i>bona fide</i> trade is Sunday opening and, to a lesser degree, the extension of the licensing hours.</P>
    <P>That brings me to 6-day and 7-day licensees.  Deputies have received a great deal of literature on the question. I have read that literature, but, apart from that, I was quite satisfied that, in any legislation, we had to be as fair as we could to every section of the community.  It has been a fundamental principle of the Party to which I belong that we do not represent any particular section of the community, <Col N="269" /> that we do not necessarily represent a majority.  I do not want to give the Government Deputies a shock by saying that we might be representing a majority in the fairly near future.  Our fundamental principle has been that every citizen, whether he belongs to a majority or a minority&mdash;and we fought for three months over that in the debates that went on in the Dáil&mdash; has the right to the protection of an elected representative.  If my colleagues opposite find cause for humour in that, they are welcome to it.</P>
    <P>There are about ten 7-day licensees to every 6-day licensee.  If the public houses are to be open on Sunday and if the <i>bona fide</i> trade is to be abolished, we must produce some form of legislation to deal with that situation.  It is quite obvious that the 6-day licensees, if they so desire, could be in a position to be on co-equal terms with their 7-day counterparts.  It may not be so evident in cities or county boroughs, where there is a greater concentration of population, but it must be evident to every rural Deputy, where local conditions count for so much and where there is a smaller concentration of population, that in trade the personal touch is vital.  It is our duty to preserve it and I may even say to fight for it.  Therefore, if we abolish the <i>bona fide</i> trade and if we give the right to open public houses on Sunday &mdash;and this Bill purports to do that&mdash; we must do justice to the 6-day licensee and, if we do not, <i>ipso facto</i>, we put him out of business, we destroy his business, we destroy his livelihood and we destroy the value of his property.</P>
    <P>As I said before, it is a fundamental policy of the Party I represent&mdash;and my own personal policy, if I may say so in all humility&mdash;to preserve the rights of minorities.  In that regard, it is unfortunate that there is no provision in any section of this Bill to deal with the section of the community I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday to what I considered to be a good speech by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Seán Flanagan.  He made a very fair and useful case on behalf of this section.  In his constituency, Mayo, <Col N="270" /> and also in Monaghan, there is a majority of 6-day licensees as against 7-day licensees, but I fully accept that Deputy Flanagan was making a case which he believed to be just and I am trying to make the same case.</P>
    <P>I think the 6-day licensees, if they wish to open on seven days a week, should be given a licence to do so.  I do not think that means that you will have a rush of the entire 1,400 six-day licensees to open on Sunday.  I should not like to suggest that for a moment. I do not think the Minister or his Department will be embarrassed by any such rush.  I know people in my own constituency who are 6-day licensees and who, if they were offered it tomorrow, would not accept the right to be a 7-day licensee.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the 7-day licensee has paid a greater fee, that he has paid that fee over a number of years and that to put the 6-day licensee on an equal basis would mean that an injustice might be done to a 7-day licensee.</P>
    <P>I took particular trouble to find out what the position was in regard to the licence paid and the valuations in the cases concerned.  The problem in my constituency is not as acute as it is in Monaghan or Mayo, but there is the peculiarity in Wexford that the 6-day licensees are concentrated in two areas, the towns of New Ross and Wexford.  It would be unfair to give any particular case but I have checked the fee paid for the 6-day licence and the 7-day licence.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>My Department received sketch and site plans for the erection of a dispensary at Tralee on the 27th April, 1959.</P>
      <P>The delay in approving the plans was due to the fact that consideration had to be given to the possibility of using instead the County Clinic for dispensary purposes.  For this purpose it was necessary to obtain from the local authority particulars of dispensary attendances and of sessions held in, and attendances at, the County Clinic.  This information, when obtained, established that a separate dispensary would be required.  Approval has now been issued to the site proposed and the plan of the proposed dispensary is being examined.  My Department's comments on this plan will be conveyed to the local authority shortly.</P>

      <P>My attention has <Col N="276" /> been drawn to the statements made at the meeting referred to.  These statements envisaged a grant allocation from the Hospitals Trust Fund of 30 per cent. of the cost of an approved bed extension scheme at Killarney Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have recently decided that the present position of the Hospitals Trust Fund would justify the granting of assistance towards the cost of a limited programme of urgent and essential improvement works at mental hospitals and a standard grant of 40 per cent. towards the cost of such works as may be approved by my Department is being offered.  This decision will, in the case of the Killarney extension project, be conveyed formally to the mental hospital authority as soon as revised proposals, which are under consideration by them, have been received.</P>
      <P>I should be very happy, of course, to allocate a higher grant percentage in the case of mental hospital projects but the Deputy will appreciate that the present and prospective position of the Hospitals Trust Fund does not permit me to be more generous.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, the amount of building works carried out in mental hospitals during the last ten years has been relatively limited and the percentage grant allowed for such works was generally in the region of 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. for approved works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The compensation provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, follow the same lines as other Acts involving acquisition of, or interference with, property by a public <Col N="279" /> undertaking.  Provision is made for compensation in respect of lands, easements, fisheries, water rights, navigation rights and other rights.  Only persons having direct interests in the property affected are entitled to compensation. Persons who have merely licences to use the property have no valid claim.  Interests in chattels and personal rights confer no right to compensation. Gillies, netsmen, keepers and other employees of fishery owners have, as such, no interest which would entitle them to compensation on foot of works under the 1945 Act.  The same applies to drift net fishermen operating under licence.  It would not be correct to assume that the execution of arterial drainage schemes necessarily involves widespread displacement of persons employed in connection with fisheries.  If, in the event, disemployment should happen in some cases, sympathetic consideration would be given to the employment of the persons concerned on the drainage work.</P>

An old I.R.A. man's disability pension is not taken into account when he looks for an old age pension up to the age of 80.  Must you economise to the extent of £3 10s. at the expense of the unfortunate men for whom this Bill was passed?  They are sailing very near the Plimsoll line as far as the economy of the State is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind printed catalogues, the position is that there are not up-to-date catalogues for all the paintings, water colours, etc. in the National Gallery.  A printed catalogue of the Italian paintings was published in 1956 and a summary catalogue of the remainder is nearing completion. All pictures are listed according as they are acquired and the compilation of such lists is, therefore, continuous.</P>
      <P>As regards the National Museum every object acquired by the Museum is entered immediately it is received in a register and these registers constitute a catalogue of the items in the museum.  It is not, I understand, museum practice anywhere to undertake the publication of formal catalogues of the entire contents of museum collections.</P>
      <P>In the case of the National Library printed books, periodicals, newspapers, etc. are normally catalogued as they are received.  Manuscripts, however, have come to the Library at such a rate that there must necessarily be delay in the detailed cataloguing of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether the existing storage space in the three institutions is sufficient and suitable for the purpose of making inventories, the position is that apart altogether from any question of making inventories the accessions to the institutions have been such as to make the provision of additional storage <Col N="295" /> space necessary.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the question of providing additional accommodation for the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library is at present under very active consideration and that I hope that the necessary steps in this direction will be taken before long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was dealing with the position of the 6-day licensees <i>vis-á-vis</i> the 7-day licensees.  I was dealing with the point that if the 6-day licensees were given the privilege of 7-day licences, that would be unfair to the holders of 7-day licences who have been paying licences over a great many years.  The argument might be adduced that the 7-day licensee had paid more than the 6-day licensee.  I stated that in my own constituency the 6-day licensees are concentrated in two towns, Wexford and New Ross.  I have taken the trouble to make inquiries in reference to the actual position that obtains to see if there is any disparity as between the two sections.  A typical case is where, in one of these towns, a 6-day licensee with a £30 valuation&mdash;I understand licences are based on valuation&mdash;is paying £15 in licence fee.  A 7-day licensee with a valuation of £32 is paying £16.  That puts the two absolutely parallel and seems to prove the case that there is no great divergence in the amount of the licences paid by 6- and 7-day licensees.  I say this for the benefit of the House and for the benefit of the Minister and the Government. If the Minister sees fit, as I hope he will, to do justice to this particular section of the community he will find that he is not doing a financial injustice to the 7-day licensee.  Although the Minister has not mentioned the matter on Second Reading, I hope that, in view of this debate and in view of the number of Deputies who have made the case on behalf of the 6-day <Col N="300" /> licensees, the Minister will appreciate that the 7-day licensees have a genuine case and one which should be considered at Government level.  Perhaps the Minister would introduce on the Committee or Report Stage something to meet the requirements of those people who have paid licences over the years and who are contributing towards the revenue and who will be placed at a complete disadvantage if this Bill goes through in its present form.  They will, in fact, be faced not only with a loss of livelihood but also with a loss of business and a serious devaluation of their property.</P>
      <P>We come now to other matters in the Bill.  There seems to be a widespread feeling of revulsion against this Bill and it is very hard, in the short time at one's disposal, to find out the cause of that revulsion.  Of course I realise that we will still have ample time to deal with the different items in the Bill.  As far as I can find out the feeling of revulsion against this Bill&mdash;and of course I speak as a rural Deputy&mdash;is because new facilities are being created for the sale of intoxicating liquor.  It might well be argued that these new facilities are better in the main because they are legalising an illegal situation which exists.  Be that as it may, I am only voicing the opinions that have been expressed to me and in the main I do not disagree with them.  I suppose in middle age or in our young days we form our habits.  The proverb says that a leopard does not change his spots. Those that are addicted to the consumption of alcohol and who are regular consumers of alcohol will consume it at any time, whether it is an illegal time or not.  The main argument put forward in this Bill is that these illegalities exist; let us make a law that everybody will respect and which everybody will look up to.  I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people are drinking after hours, if they are using the <i>bona fide</i> law for a purpose for which it is not intended, it is right to regularise the position, to extend the hours and liberalise them to meet that case.  The arguments that have been put up to me were that if you open licensed premises <Col N="301" /> for longer hours&mdash;and on this point I want to refer particularly to the opening of the licensed premises on Sundays&mdash;you will create a new drinking public.  A lot of Deputies may think that that is a foolish argument. I am citing the arguments put to me by parents and by those who have moral principles at heart&mdash;that by opening licensed premises on Sunday and making it easier to drink you bring into the orbit of alcoholic consumption the younger generation who have not been inclined heretofore to take alcohol.  That may be a rather broad statement but it was an argument put up to me.  Take the case of rural Ireland.  I think the hours of opening are from 1 to 3 o'clock on Sundays and from 5 to 8 o'clock in the evening.  Could I ask the Minister's advice on that point?  Is it proposed on Sundays to open the licensed premises constantly from 1 to 7?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put to me is that if you open a licensed premises in rural Ireland from one to three&mdash;and those are hours I feel constrained to oppose and it is one of my reasons for voting against this Bill&mdash;you are going to encourage after Mass drinking.  In villages after Mass the people assemble and very often there are three or four public houses in a village. You are going to encourage the youth to go into those public houses as a general meeting place to discuss rural topics, or football or hurling, or anything you like.  In the first instance they will probably consume a nonalcoholic drink.  These are young people who are not inclined to drink but after a bit, through force of habit and from watching what other people <Col N="302" /> are doing, you will encourage young people to take drink in the morning.</P>
      <P>I do not know if that is correct or not but those are the representations made to me by parents and by those who have the moral welfare of the youth at heart.  I am inclined to agree with them.  The arguments which the Minister used in his opening speech were that it is a long-standing custom for people to go to the shops and do their shopping after Mass in rural areas and that as a lot of promiscuous drinking has taken place&mdash;in other words illegal drinking&mdash;in rural Ireland as the public houses were not open, then he would open them now for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I feel there may be something to be said for the Minister's point of view but taking it by and large I think it would be a mistake to have an earlier opening during the day. I have spoken to the owners of licensed premises on this matter and I have asked them what they thought about it.  I asked them if they thought it would impose hardship on them; did they think it would create difficulties from the point of view of employment, their paid hands, and so on.  I spoke to a limited number but I spoke to people whom I considered to be representative.  They expressed the opinion that the hours would not be satisfactory, that it would lead to a great deal of trouble and that it would mean that they would be working virtually all day on Sundays.  I think there is a lot in that.  In many villages in rural Ireland there are three or four licensed premises and one owner has to do the same as another owner if he wants to remain in business.  It virtually boils down to the fact that the owners will work all day themselves on Sundays.  They will work from 1 o'clock to 3, close for a few hours and then open, in the summer months, from 5 o'clock to 9 o'clock again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is their day?  Are they not virtually working day in day out? They do not seem to want that.  I may be wrong and I should be glad to hear the opinions voiced by other Deputies, but that is the opinion they conveyed to me.  The reason I am <Col N="303" /> voicing it is, as I said before, I have heard it from parents, the owners of licensed premises themselves and from them in relation to their employees.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the opening on Sunday evenings or to the hours.  If you are going to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> trade&mdash;and I think there is general agreement on that in the House as a whole&mdash;I think it is desirable that the Minister should consider the other matters and weigh all the facts and, perhaps, all the advice available to him from experts and from his legal advisers and perhaps he will then see fit to make a differentiation with regard to opening in rural Ireland and Dublin in the middle of the day.  It may be hard for the Minister to do that.  I read the Commission's Report and one of the things they stressed was that we should have uniformity of licensing laws everywhere.</P>
    <P>The only other point that strikes me in that respect is in regard to the extension of licensing hours in the evenings.  I have had a good deal of representation in regard to the hours at which premises should close at night.  I am speaking principally of rural Ireland and I think everybody agrees that the hours at the moment are not conducive to meeting the requirements of those who live in the country and particularly of those who work on the land.  I think an extension of the hours is necessary. The Bill, I think, proposes an extension in the four months of the Summer to 11.30 and in the other months to 11 o'clock.  Those who live in the country know that &ldquo;old time,&rdquo; as it was called played a very prominent part in Irish rural life up to a few years ago.  While I do not know what they do in the West of Ireland, in Leinster at any rate &ldquo;new time&rdquo; appears to have come to stay and most of the businesses go by &ldquo;new time.&rdquo;  Yet people work in the Summer as late as they can on the land and I think the hour of 10 o'clock or 10.30 at the moment is insufficient to meet the requirements of the rural community.  Also from my experience in Dublin, I think it is probably insufficient <Col N="304" /> to meet the requirements of the boroughs.  Generally&mdash;and I am speaking on the advice I have received from constituents and people actually concerned outside&mdash;I think 11 o'clock as the overall hour in the four summer months of the year, at any rate, would be sufficiently late.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that if the licensed premises were to stay open in Dublin until 11.30 we would create a host of problems both from the trade union and the transport angle and that the ordinary social life of the city would be completely disorganised by keeping licensed premises open until 11.30.  As far as I know the major portion of transport from the centre of the city is not much later than 11 o'clock and I think the Minister would be well advised to consider that point.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Tourist Board are one of the parties that are vitally concerned in the new licensing regulations.  I think it has also been stated that the idea is that if we extend licensing hours we would get a far heavier influx of tourists here but the point we should have emphasised in regard to the tourist trade is&mdash;is the family tourist trade more valuable to us than the type of person who wants to drink late?  Apart from the moral impact of the question, taking it by and large, I think the family tourist trade, parents with their children, spend far more and are of far more benefit to the community also than the late-drinking type of person.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything to substantiate any argument that the tourist board or others concerned may have made, though I am practically certain they have made those suggestions, other than suggestions in relation to hotels.  The suggestion that there should be a prolongation of hours in hotels for the serving of people with meals would be sound. I make that suggestion&mdash;again I am advised by those who know more about it than I do&mdash;in the belief that the majority of our cross-Channel tourists come from the North of England and that the South of England people are inclined to go East to the <Col N="305" /> Continent and go there because they have uninhibited and free licensing hours.  They can eat a meal or get a drink as late as they like.  If we extend that in this country I think we will be catering for an increase in a limited type of tourist.  It may seem unfair to give an advantage to one class as against another, but I believe that it is necessary that we should encourage those with money, to come and spend it here.  For that reason I rather welcome all the provisions concerned with that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think it is probable that a new licensing Bill was thought to be necessary because of the difficulties in which the Garda Síochána find themselves in regard to the implementation of the law.  Perhaps there is a feeling among district justices who seem to impose such light sentences for infringements that the present licensing laws had not the support of the people as a whole. I think those views were expressed by the Minister and I have no particular reason to disagree.</P>
    <P>This is an important measure affecting every walk of life and it will affect future generations in Ireland just as it affects those who are walking about to-day.  In this House, therefore, we should try, at any rate on the Committee Stage, as my Party has indicated, to give free choice. It would be a good thing if the House were free to vote as each individual desires so as to produce for the country the best possible Bill.  But I think we ought to be mindful of the fact that if we do get a Bill by a free vote of the House it should be somewhat different from what is being offered to us to-day.  We, in this House, are representative of every shade of opinion and of practically every walk in life.  If we produce a Bill it is our duty as public representatives not to alter the law, not to override what the Bill contains, provided the law is freely promulgated and is constituted law by the Deputies in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Fadó thuill muintir na tíre seo droch-cháil i gcúrsaí óil agus bhíodar ina gceap magaidh ar fud an domhain. Bhi fáth leis sin freisin, agus bunús stairiúil.  Ach le blianta beaga anuas ó bunaíodh an Stát nua anseo tá feabhas mór tagtha ar an scéal.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to get rid of a very absurd anachronism we had in this country for many years, the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  I believe it should have been abolished years ago, and I think that most reasonable people will welcome the drastic change that this Bill proposes in regard to that trade. I compliment the Minister on the courageous stand he has taken with regard to this matter, and I also compliment him on the straightforward and unequivocal manner in which he spoke when he introduced the Bill last Wednesday.  We all know that the <i>bona fide</i> trade had long outlived its usefulness, and public opinion was not in favour of its renewal.  If the <i>bona fide</i> trade has to be removed some compensation has to be brought in by way of fixing more suitable hours for drinking, and this the Minister proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as country districts are concerned the proposed new hours on weekdays seem to be generally acceptable, <Col N="307" /> and seem to meet the requirements of the community.  Certainly, from 10.30 in the morning to 11 p.m. at night, for eight months of the year, offers ample facilities to people who want to have a drink, and the extra half-hour for the three summer months and the month of September also seem to be satisfactory, and to be appreciated by people with whom I have discussed this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also adopted a very realistic attitude as regards Sunday opening.  I have listened to people suggesting that there should be no Sunday opening, but every one who has his eyes open knows that people drink on Sundays, with or without the sanction of the law.  They go into a public house on a Sunday and if the local Garda sergeant is a realist he keeps his eyes closed.  If he is a bit of a crank he causes trouble, but people will get a drink whether he wants them to have it or not.  That has been happening for many years and it is about time that some Government, or some Minister, had regard to that fact and based the law on the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>To me it seems most ridiculous that a man who drinks for six days of the week, and who behaves himself, should be denied the right to have a drink on a Sunday.  If Sunday opening is to be a fact, as we all hope it will, then great credit is due to Deputy Corry who, as he stated last night, introduced a Bill many years ago to make this possible, only to find that he had the great majority of the Deputies in the House, irrespective of their political affiliations, whether from city or country, voting against him.  I think he has made a lot of converts in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The hours which the Minister proposes for Sunday opening seem to be all right, with the exception of the 1 o'clock opening.  I would venture to suggest that that does not meet the wishes of the people in rural Ireland. Most of the Masses end around 12 o'clock.  Does the Minister expect the people to hang around on a wet, cold Sunday for an hour before the pubs open?  He is inviting them to break <Col N="308" /> the law if he does not make it more realistic and have the proposed opening hour within half an hour after last Mass, say 12.30 p.m.  If he insists on holding to 1 p.m.  I venture to suggest that extra half hour will help only one group of people, the politicians.  It will keep the people together for an hour after last Mass to hear an election speech before the pubs open.  I would ask him to bring the opening forward to 12.30 p.m. and close at 2 p.m., or 2.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The evening opening seems to be all right, from 5 o'clock until 8 o'clock for eight months of the year, and to 9 o'clock for the other four months. It has been stated that people will not attend Evening Devotions if the pubs are open, but it is my experience that people who take a drink on a Sunday evening are not much attracted to Evening Devotions.  If they are going to go into a pub they will hardly attend religious services.  The 5 p.m. opening will suit towns that have hurling and football matches and other sporting events.  It will give an opportunity to the people who frequent these fixtures to have a drink and go about their business after.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister clarify the position with regard to early opening in towns for fairs and markets.  I am not sure of the changes this Bill will bring with regard to that kind of opening.  I know that fairs in country towns start at an early hour of the morning.  When the farmers arrive, they have often been on the road from 2 or 3 a.m.  They arrive in a country town wet and hungry.  Most of them look forward to liquid refreshment of some kind, whether it is intoxicating or non-intoxicating.  In my town, the public houses cater for that service.  I should like to know if it is proposed, under this Bill, to deny the publicans the rights they have enjoyed down through the years of early opening for fair days and markets.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to insert some provision in the Bill so that at the annual licensing court, there will be some representative of the local authority or the local development company present and that the dates of fairs for the following 12 months be made known so that a general exemption <Col N="309" /> can be got from the court for an opening of this kind.  I understand that the solicitors are making a good thing out of it at present.  They have to have special courts for these and the solicitors are paid very well for making an appearance on behalf of the public. I think that is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to throw some light on what he proposes to do about holiday resorts.  These resorts, whether they are coastal resorts like Salthill, Kilkee, Lahinch or inland resorts like Lisdoonvarna&mdash;I speak only of those resorts I know anything about&mdash;should be allowed to have the same facilities as they have enjoyed for many years.  Part of their charm is that you can adjourn to the &ldquo;local&rdquo; at night, whether it is a hotel or a pub, and enjoy a drink in the company of the other visitors to the resort until a reasonable hour of the night.  That is the position at the present time.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, a pattern of drinking habits has been followed in these resorts.  Each place has its own rules and regulations.  They have their sing-songs and socials.  I think that is a great attraction in each of these resorts, on the western coast, at any rate. Nobody would deny that these singsongs and get-togethers are the main attraction in many of these places.</P>
    <P>The publicans have a very short season.  They have to reap in as much as they can in the course of a few months.  Their receipts over these few months keep them going for the rest of the year.  No legislation introduced in this House should set them back.</P>
    <P>I may mention that some time ago I was looking at T.V. and listening to Sir Compton McKenzie who was being interviewed about the Edinburgh Festival.  He was asked what he thought about the Edinburgh Festival.  He said that the Edinburgh Festival was not a festival at all.  He knew of only one festival&mdash;the Wexford Festival.  He said that part of the attraction in Wexford was that when he returned from a concert or an opera, he could sit in his hotel, entertain his friends and buy drinks for them.  I do not know what hour of the morning he mentioned but he mentioned a late hour of the morning. <Col N="310" /> That is what made Wexford such an attractive place.  It would be a pity that attractions of this kind which have been enjoyed by resorts in this country should be stopped as a result of this Bill becoming law.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Second Reading, the Minister mentioned that his purpose was to keep the anomalies which revealed themselves under any licensing system to a minimum.  That was a very laudable purpose and the Minister must be commended but I would ask him to seek uniformity. He completely ignores the problem of the 6-day licensee, of whom there are 1,400 in this country.  He is bringing uniformity into the licensing laws for the other 10,000.  I should say that he has not actually considered the six-day licensees, to judge by his speech but he chooses to ignore the existence of the 1,400 6-day licensees.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware of that.  I would also thank Deputy McQuillan for complimenting one set of these licensees in the town of Ballinasloe who were represented by counsel at the Commission and whose views were heard on the question of Sunday opening.  The Minister has blatantly ignored the existence of the 6-day licensees.  I am not going into the different aspects of it for, as Deputy Esmonde said, we have been bombarded with literature.  I speak of the problem as I know it.</P>
      <P>People frequent a licensed premises because it is their &ldquo;local&rdquo;.  If that &ldquo;local&rdquo; happens to be a 6-day premises, they will go there for six days of the week.  Under the Bill, that premises will be closed on Sunday and the customer who enjoyed his &ldquo;local&rdquo; for six days of the week will be driven by this law into another premises on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens?  It is the thin end of the wedge.  It is a way of diverting trade from the 6-day licensee.  It is a way of putting his customers into some other publichouse.  If they form the habit of going to another publichouse on Sunday, in the course <Col N="311" /> of time, they will say: &ldquo;I cannot get into Johnny's place on a Sunday but I can go into another man's publichouse. He is a nice fellow and I will give him my custom from now on.&rdquo;  The business of the 6-day licensee will diminish and in the course of time, he can write <i>finis</i> to his publichouse trade.  I think that is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>The problem exists in my constituency, especially in Ballinasloe, and strong representations have been made to me to speak here on behalf of those publicans.  I know that the problem presents certain difficulties to the Minister.  These six-day licensees are looking for a privilege they did not enjoy heretofore, even with the existing <i>bona fide</i> trade but they are prepared to pay for it.  They do not want anything for nothing.  Surely the Minister or his advisers can devise some means of allowing these people to open on Sunday?</P>
    <P>I know that I shall be given the stock answer&mdash;that if they can secure a seven-day licence and extinguish it, they can have it transferred to their own public house, but seven-day licences in my part of the country are not too easily got.  As a result of this legislation, they will be very dear if they come on the market.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should try to find a solution of this problem and grant those people what they want.  As I say, they do not expect to get it for nothing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Minister has allowed restricted opening on St. Patrick's Day.  It was long overdue. He is entirely justified in introducing it.  The outlook of the public on drinking has changed radically for the better down through the years.  In any event, drinking is too dear nowadays to let down your hair on St. Patrick's Day.  The only places where Patrick's Day is traditionally celebrated are New York City and other parts of the world, certainly not in Ireland.  Successive Governments have made sure that the people will not drown the shamrock here or, if they do, that they will have to pay for the privilege.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> The Minister made very pertinent remarks about the enforcement of the licensing laws, and quite rightly so.  He stated that he does not propose to alter the penalties provided for under previous legislation and he has seen fit to leave a certain discretion to the courts in this matter.</P>
    <P>Most publichouses are well conducted. The majority of publicans insist, in their own interests, that customers behave themselves and that people under the influence of drink are not served but are politely told to be about their business.  That is right; that is at it should be; but I think the Minister should know that in certain towns hooliganism at night after the publichouses close is not at all uncommon. The Garda authorities should be made to stamp out that type of conduct.  Many people, young and old, who want a night's rest, are wakened by the noise of young hooligans when they come out of publichouses well tanked up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a realistic approach to the problem it proposes to solve.  The members of the Commission who gave their time and energy to interviewing witnesses and hearing all sides of the case are to be complimented on the excellent reports, especially the majority report.  They are to be complimented and so is the Minister on his courage in adopting the main recommendations with regard to the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade and the extension of the hours of <Col N="313" /> opening and embodying them in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not drink but I used to drink and I had experience of <i>bona fide</i> drinking.  I did it in the States, in the speak-easies.  It is a long time since I drank but I know both sides of the case.  To me, the question of drink is a very important, serious and controversial matter.</P>
      <P>Recently I read a life of Kevin O'Higgins in which there was a quotation from him, when the 1924 Bill was before the House, to the effect that he found this business worse to deal with than the Civil War.  He put it in this way, that the publicans were harder to beat than the Republicans.  I can understand that, because it is a very controversial business.  There are the vested interests of the publicans and those engaged in the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, the drinkers, the man who is satisfied with a few beers and the man who likes to make a session of it, and the night club.  There are many aspects that are not even touched on in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I know both sides.  I hate beer.  I hate the look of it or the thought of it because I believe it is the cause of half of all evil.  I believe it is the cause of most of the assaults that we read about.  People come out drunk and want a fight, whereas, if they were sober, they would not.  Drink is the cause of most accidents.  Men think they can control a car when, in fact, they are unable to do so.  A man who is coming home drunk may think he is all right but he is swaying from left to right.  He may get home but he has no control.</P>
      <P>Drink is responsible for a lot of crime.  As far as I can see, young fellows start to drink at 15 and 16 years of age.  If they were not employed, they would be tempted to steal in order to get the money for drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drinking is something that you must try to control.  You cannot just prohibit it, as was done in the States.  Worse evils were created because the control was taken from the authorities and put in the hands of gangsters.  Whether it is an evil or not, drink is something people want.  Wine, women and song are the spice of life.  To a great many people, drinking is the spice of life. <Col N="314" /> They can go to the publichouse and they can be T.D.s and Ministers there every night of the week, they take themselves so seriously, and enjoy it. There is no great harm in it in the case of many people.  People who work hard and who drink are sober the next day and can do their job. It is a dangerous pastime for people who live by their wits, who have a session every day.  They are the people who do <i>bona fide</i> drinking.  They have the money.  Half of them are mental.</P>
    <P>That is the problem and the Minister has the job of facing up to it and of trying to control it as best he can. It is suggested that this matter should be left to a free vote of the House.  I do not accept that.  It is like a battle. You cannot leave the direction of a battle to the various officers.  The general may hold a council of war but it is the general who decides what to do; it is his responsibility.  That applies also to the Minister.  I might hate drink but others want drink.  It would be a peculiar situation to have people of such divergent views deciding an important issue of this sort.  This is the responsibility of the Minister and he will be held responsible.  It is up to us to express our views and let him decide.</P>
    <P>There are a few small matters. What we have to say will be food for thought for the Minister.  I believe the Minister is right in opening the publichouses at 1 o'clock.  It is said that the last Mass in the country is 12 noon. In the town, the last Mass is at 12.30 and in some places there is a very late Mass.  If the publichouse were to open at 12.30, there might be people dashing from the publichouse to the Church.  It would not look well.  If the publichouses were open in the country at 12.30 and in the city at 1 o'clock, you might have people going out to the country to get a quick one, to be in first.  It is best that the publichouses should open at 1 o'clock.  It will encourage people in the country who come out from Mass at 12.30, to go home and get their dinner.  In towns, they may go home at 12.30 in the knowledge that they have an hour in which to drink afterwards.  One o'clock is the best time.  It will eliminate a dash from church to publichouse and will give a reasonable chance to <Col N="315" /> people to go home and get a dinner. If the publichouses opened at 12.30, some people would not leave them until 3 o'clock, at which time the dinner would be over at home and the family would have gone out and perhaps the parent or husband who had been in the publichouse until 3 o'clock would have no dinner at all. The times suggested give a reasonable chance to men to go home to their dinner, even if they go to late Mass.</P>
    <P>There is only one small point I want to challenge, that is, the opening until 11.30 p.m. in summer.  It has been put to me that if you open the pub until 11.30 p.m. in the summer it will be difficult for a lot of people to get a bus home.  The last bus for Finglas leaves Eden Quay at 11.25 p.m.  If people are drinking in the pubs until 11.30 p.m. they will have to walk home or get a taxi. The same applies in many cases as far as buses are concerned.  Therefore there is a danger that many people will be rushing home at midnight and at one o'clock in the morning. That is the danger of the 11.30 p.m. closing hour.  I appreciate the change from 10.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>My only recreation is to go now and then to the cinema.  I do not care a great deal for it but my wife likes it.  We have to leave the cinema before seeing the complete programme in order to get a drink before 10.30 p.m.  That applies to thousands of persons.  There is a huge cinema audience.  Every cinema is packed every night.  When all these people come out at 10.30 p.m. they cannot get a drink.  The extra time which is about to be given will now permit them to get a drink.  They cannot have the drink before entering the cinema because there is always a queue.  You cannot have it both ways.  If you want to get into the pictures you must go immediately after tea.  I find that if I am down after seven o'clock I am stuck there until 9 o'clock.  That applies to everybody.  If you want to go to the cinema or if your wife wants you to take her to the cinema, you must get there a bit early.  If you do not <Col N="316" /> manage to get in until 8 o'clock and you want to see the big picture it means that if the husband or the wife wants a drink the door is shut by the time they leave the cinema.</P>
    <P>An extension of the opening time enables a person to have a drink and yet leaves him in nice time to catch a bus to get home.  If the pubs remain open until 11.30 p.m. a great many will miss the bus and that will cause trouble at home and everybody will be in bed.  The right time, summer and winter, is 11 p.m.  Even the publicans themselves will complain.  Their employees will not be out of the pubs until 11.45 p.m. and they will have trouble in trying to get home.  Here you have objections from the publicans, you have objections from those employed by the publicans and you have objections from wives whose husbands will miss the bus and arrive home at midnight or later and cause a bit of a scene when everybody is in bed.  Therefore, the right time, summer and winter, is 11 o'clock.</P>
    <P>The big cinema audience can have time for one or two drinks and everybody will be satisfied.  The bus service will suit everybody.  I am speaking from experience.  I still go into a pub for a bottle of stone beer.  I have left the pictures on numerous occasions without having seen the whole of the big picture just in order to rush into the pub at 10.15 p.m.  It is important from the point of view of the tourist trade that there should be reasonable opportunities for drinking.</P>
    <P>Before I became a Deputy I was in the dance game all my life.  I have some knowledge of what people want. Tourists and visitors have often come to me and said: &ldquo;This is a dead hole.&rdquo; You must give tourists a reasonable opportunity to get a drink.  When people go abroad they want to be merry and to enjoy themselves.  This is the time to talk about all that.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the 6-day licences. The Minister should have uniformity throughout.  You will encourage the 6-day licensees to sell beer off the premises or to let in a few on the quiet after Mass.  It was always done and can still be done.  I know it.  It is hard to blame the people.  As has been pointed out, they have competitors <Col N="317" /> who have 7-day licences and their clients will leave their local and go to a competitor.  I know the danger of that.</P>
    <P>I was in the dance business and we were always at war.  On certain nights I had a big crowd and on certain nights I had a small crowd. I always knew why.  Some opponent would have a big crowd on the night I would have a small crowd.  We got to know the business.  Sometimes when I got a big crowd, at the expense of someone who was not on, I might dish out half-price tickets.  In other words, I would collar the other fellow's crowd.  I took advantage of his not being on that night.  That is the point.</P>
    <P>If the customers of the six-day licensees go elsewhere the fellow with the seven-day licence can establish competitions for £5, and so on, on certain nights.  He can work on the other fellow's crowd.  It will not be fair.  There should be uniformity throughout.  Otherwise you will have a drink handed out on the sly and you will have fellows behind the blind after Mass.  It always happens but do not encourage it now.</P>
    <P>There are about 20 night clubs in this city and probably there are night clubs in every urban area.  Night clubs are common on the Continent. People with plenty of money go there and tourists in particular always want a night club.  They want a good time.  There is nothing evil about a night club.  There might be but, if it is regulated, I do not see how such would be the case.  The people who go to these night clubs stay out until two or three o'clock in the morning and take drink.  That is common on the Continent.</P>
    <P>We have night clubs here but they have only a wine licence.  According to the Commission of Inquiry the wine licence is granted by the Revenue Commissioners but there is no mention of hours.  The hours are my concern now.  Every week in the year it is there in the newspapers to be read that so-and-so was charged with selling drink after hours.  It goes on.  You can fine them as often as <Col N="318" /> you like but it will go on and that is a problem for the Minister.  They should get an extension of the wine licence so that they can sell wine, because there is a trade for it.  I am not personally interested in this matter.  I hate wine.  However, it is a problem of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>It is not the ordinary worker who goes into those night clubs so the Minister need not worry.  They charge fancy prices there and a cover charge. They charge maybe 10/- for a 2/- glass of wine.  Only people who have plenty of money, or the tourist, can afford to go into these places in search of a good time.  The night clubs exist.  So far, the Minister has not been able to put them out of operation and I assume he will not be able to do so.  They will take the rap and continue as before. Why does the Minister not try to control the problem?  Why does he not say that there is a demand among certain people for night clubs and that we will give them a wine licence until 2 o'clock in the morning?  If he does not consider it, he is continuing to allow the possibility of an illegal sale of drink after hours.  This is a matter about which so far he has not and probably will not be able to do anything, although it is illegal.  They sell more than wine; they sell strong spirit with the tea.  The prosecutions are there but the fines do not close them up.  That problem is there to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I referred recently to the question of methylated spirits.  This is something which may be common only to certain areas.  It certainly affects my area.  In a certain street there, all round the lanes, there are men and women stretched out every day from methylated spirits.  The Minister can inspect this area for himself.  I would ask that something be done about it, that it be made impossible for these people to get methylated spirits.  It may be that in this neighbourhood, they are able to get the methylated spirits but there are other areas in which the same thing happens.  This stuff can knock them over for sixpence and it is a problem the Minister should face.  I should also like the Minister to bear in mind the danger of extending the hours to 11.30 in the summer.</P>

Rinne an Coimisiún obair mhór agus tá an Bille seo leagtha amach ar an tuarascáil a chuir an Coimisiún san os comhair an Aire.</P>
      <P>We are in general agreement that the present licensing laws are unsatisfactory and that some type of legislation was necessary to take the place of the present laws.  These laws have been flouted from one end of the country to the other and the cavalier treatment of the licensing laws has not only a detrimental effect on the enforcement of the law in general but there are general abuses that stem from them.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was planning this Bill he had to try taking every aspect into consideration to evolve what I might call a practical Bill, a Bill which would give us laws which could be enforced, laws which would enable us as far as is humanly possible to control the licensing business.  Extremes had to be avoided.  We are aware of the disastrous effects of complete prohibition in America.  Similarly in countries where the closing hour is very early the results were bad so far as the incidence of drunkenness is concerned. On the other hand, the Minister had to decide what would be considered a reasonable closing hour.  Cognisance had to be taken of the various views of the many bodies who were interested in the licensing laws and a decision had to be reached.  It was inevitable that in reaching a decision certain hardships would be imposed and certain interests adversely affected.  While that is unfortunate we must accept it as something which in the long run will be for the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission sat for a considerable time studying the various aspects of the licensing laws.  They submitted <Col N="320" /> a report and the Bill which the Minister has submitted to the Dáil is by and large based on this report, and I think it will be generally acceptable throughout the country.  Licensing laws are for obvious reasons difficult to enforce.  The present laws were not enforced.  We realise, now, from our experience, that it is not sufficient to instruct the Gardaí to enforce the law, that we must have a certain degree of co-operation between the Garda authorities, the publican and the publican's customers.</P>
    <P>The big problem, as I see it, that faced the Minister was not in fixing a particular hour for closing, as such, but in fixing an hour at which he could get this co-operation and which at the same time would be consistent with the public good.  It has been said here on a number of occasions that there was not a popular demand for these late closing hours.  The obvious reason is that these hours were in operation under the <i>bona fide</i> law, under an exemption Order and where people were on the premises illegally.</P>
    <P>Deputies have to approach this according to the dictates of their consciences, and if I believed that the change in the closing hours would cause more drunkenness or lead to excessive drinking I would have to oppose the Bill.  However, having studied this matter seriously I feel that the later closing hour could reduce the amount of drink consumed and will certainly reduce the incidence of drunkenness.  These are some of my reasons.  If you take the rural area where the farmer or farm worker works late in the summer-time and arrives in his local public house after 10 o'clock it is straining human nature a bit to expect him to leave at 10.30 p.m.  At 10.35 p.m. he is illegally on the premises, and if the Garda were to come at that time the penalties would be the same as if he were caught at one o'clock in the morning. For that reason the psychological effect is that once he passes the legal hours he is inclined to remain on the licensed premises until a very late hour.</P>
