    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has yet considered the Report of the Company Law Reform Committee; and in particular, whether he proposes to accept the recommendations contained in paragraph 143 in relation to directors' fees and in paragraph 182 in relation to consolidated accounts of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given preliminary consideration to the Report of the Company Law Reform Committee and a Bill designed to give effect to certain of the recommendations of the committee has recently been passed by the House.  As I indicated in the course of the debates on the Bill, my object in introducing a short Bill at this stage was to give effect at once to a number of important recommendations made by the committee.  The revision of the whole code of company law is an extremely complex matter which will require considerable time for its completion. A detailed study of the committee's report as a whole is in progress and a further Bill will be introduced when I have reached conclusions regarding the committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>I have not yet taken a decision regarding the specific matters referred to in the Deputy's question.  As the Deputy is doubtless aware, these particular recommendations must be considered in conjunction with other recommendations concerning the financial accounts of companies and the relations between companies and their directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware&mdash;I am sure he is&mdash;that many companies would like to conform in advance to what is set out as the <i>desideratum</i> in the new legislation? Will he, therefore, even before the legislation is itself announced, announce when decisions have been taken on the major aspects?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the wisdom of that.  I have no desire to take hasty decisions.  I would rather <Col N="638" /> be quite certain that the full scope of the recommendations of the committee have been considered and that each amendment in relation to the general picture which it is intended to build up will be considered in conjunction with other recommendations concerning the financial accounts of companies and the relations between companies and their directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Irish whiskey is neither displayed nor available for sale in the waiting room in Idlewild Airport, New York, where Aerlinte passengers must congregate, even though other liquors are there displayed and available; and that Irish whiskey was not available in the same manner as Scotch whiskey at the Aerlinte reception in New York on the 18th March last; whether he has received any complaints in regard to these matters; and whether he has sought or proposes to seek information from Aerlinte in regard to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The display and sale of liquor in the waiting room used by Aerlinte Éireann in Idlewild Airport, New York, is under the control of catering concessionaires and not of Aerlinte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a complaint received by Córas Tráchtála Teo. in February, <Col N="639" /> 1959, Córas Tráchtála arranged that the question of display and sale of Irish whiskey would be taken up with the catering concessionaires at the airport. I am informed that as a result of that approach Irish whiskey is now on display and on sale in the public bars at the airport.</P>
    <P>Irish whiskey was freely available at the reception on the occasion of the opening of the Aerlinte office in New York on 18th March, 1959.</P>
    <P>Apart from the complaint made to Córas Tráchtála, Teo., to which I have referred, I have received no complaints in regard to these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an item was published in a national newspaper here on 19th March last stating that although many a bottle was opened at the bar, it was noted that only one bottle of Irish whiskey was there and that the rest appeared to have been bottled in Scotland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if in view of the appearance of sludge and waste oil deposits on the beaches of south east Ireland, he will make immediate <Col N="640" /> representations to the international body set up to control the disposal of waste oil at sea to have immediate steps taken to abate this nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no international body charged with the control of the disposal of waste oil at sea and it was to remedy this problem that the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil was drawn up in 1954.  The Convention prohibits the discharge of oil or oily mixtures within certain sea zones.  The zones affecting the Irish coasts for ordinary vessels, consist of the seas 100 miles from the coast of Ireland, Britain and the north west European countries and in addition, for tankers, of the seas extending some 700 miles westward in the Atlantic. The Convention provides that all ships of adhering states should keep records of discharges of oil or oily mixtures. These records may be inspected by any other adhering state.  If the records show, or if evidence is otherwise available, that a Convention ship discharged oil or oily mixtures in a prohibited zone the inspecting state shall notify the Flag State concerned of the matter and the latter state is obliged to institute proceedings if the evidence available warrants such a course.</P>
      <P>Ireland has accepted the Convention, the provisions of which were implemented here by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956.  Unfortunately many countries, some with substantial tanker fleets, have not yet accepted the Convention.  Success in preventing oil pollution depends on international co-operation by all parties concerned and the Deputy may rest assured that this country will cooperate fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the amount paid from the Central Fund for sinking fund in 1958/59 was £530,000 in excess of estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total Central Fund expenditure on the Service of the Public Debt in 1958/59 was £19.578 m. as compared with the estimate of £19.745 m. showing a saving of £167,000.  Of the total provision, £18.006 m. was for fixed charges of combined interest and sinking fund. The allocation of this amount as between interest and sinking fund is conjectural to some extent at the estimate stage since the outcome will depend on variations in interest rates <Col N="642" /> and on the amount of outstanding debt which it may be possible to acquire for redemption.  The fall in interest rates during the past year combined with a reduction in the volume of temporary borrowing found necessary enabled a greater portion of the annuities in respect of Voted Capital Services to be applied as sinking fund.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, factors operating to reduce the estimate for 1959/60 were the writing off under the Transport Act, 1958, of the interest-bearing Exchequer advances to Córas Iompair Éireann and the Great Northern Railway Board, repayments of capital by the Road Fund, decreases in 1958/59 in advances under the Local Loans Acts and the Electricity Supply Acts and the fall in interest rates during that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment last week I referred to the Minister's remarks in relation to the cost of government.  In his Budget statement he referred to the magnitude of that cost and he made some very pertinent remarks.  I think it was about two years ago, in 1957, that the Minister undertook to do all he could to effect a degree of economy in the various State Departments under his control.  Whether his efforts since have met with any great success I doubt very much, but I agree that there are many difficulties in the way of bringing about these much needed economies.  They are difficulties which cannot be overcome very easily or very quickly and one of the most important of those difficulties is concerned with the human element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget statement the Minister referred to consultations which were going on between himself and the respective bodies which cater for the various officers and servants in the many Departments.  He said that he was awaiting their remarks and he hoped that he would receive co-operation and understanding from them.  I sincerely hope that some good will come from his efforts.  Ministers before him have done what they could to <Col N="679" /> economise in this direction, and, as I said, it is a long term plan which must be adopted and which cannot be implemented overnight.  It is very strange that in this small country of ours, in which there are less than 3,000,000 people, and in which the population seems to be declining, we must have such an army, if I may call it such, of personnel to administer the various services.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that if the population is declining the numbers required to administer the various services would proportionately, to some degree at least, also decline.  But the total outlay required at present to pay salaries, wages, etc., is in the region of £34,000,000.  That is a staggering figure and I hope the Minister will succeed in his efforts to redress that situation in some way.  One possible method which he could adopt would be to hesitate to fill vacancies as they arise.  I am convinced that we could do with a much smaller number of officers and servants in the various Departments; I would go so far as to say that if vacancies were not filled down the years it would not impose any extra burden on those carrying on the services.  The attitude, of course, adopted by the generality of the people is that the moneys required to pay this huge salary bill is coming off a broad back, just because it is the Government that provides the money. The Government, of course, means the people and that is everybody who buys anything, who pays taxes in any shape or form, or who pays rates.  That brings us to old age pensioners.  They are being asked to pay their share of the expenditure of the Government whether that expenditure is desirable or not.  As I say, I hope the Minister will meet with success in this matter and will continue his efforts to bring much needed economy into the running of the various Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain reliefs in this Budget and it is very significant that, small as they are, they <Col N="680" /> have been spread over a comparatively wide area.  I would say that that was obviously to impress the majority of the population in the hope that the effect will last until the Presidential Election and the Referendum have been held.  They are reliefs to a certain degree and as such they are good.</P>
      <P>With regard to the import levies, the reduction of some and the abolition of others is a very timely step to take. As we know, these levies were introduced to redress, to some extent, our adverse balance of trade some years ago.  Now with the Free Trade Area on the horizon&mdash;it will come eventually, I suppose&mdash;it is only right that we should begin to acclimatise ourselves to open competition, as it were, and not to resort too hurriedly to the protective measures which we introduce from time to time, in the form of custom duties and import levies.  If the Free Trade Area does materialise, even though we are classed as a comparatively underdeveloped country, we will still have to face a certain amount of competition, even in the initial stages and, if only for that reason, I think it is good that the import levies should be reduced.</P>
      <P>In that regard, Deputy Sweetman was the person who imposed those levies in 1956, in a courageous effort to solve the financial problem at that time.  One of their main purposes was that the money accruing from those levies should be used for capital purposes alone.  Now we find, not this year only but also last year, the Minister using the money from those levies for current purposes.  When the present Government was elected in 1957, I am sure they rubbed their hands with glee when they thought of the little nest egg which lay in the money accruing from the levies, when they thought how they could use that money to balance their Budgets in a fictitious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relief has been given to the tune of 2/6 to old age pensioners, widows and blind pensioners and also to those in receipt of unemployment assistance. When the Minister was referring to that item of his Budget, he said it would be given to those drawing the <Col N="681" /> maximum rate, in other words, the pension would be increased next August to 27/6 as against 25/- at present.  Can the Minister say whether it is his intention to go down the line in porportion and give proportionate increases to those who are in receipt of smaller amounts of pension? Whether he intends to do that or not I do not know, but I do not think he made any reference to those who were in receipt of less than the maximum pension.</P>
    <P>These increases have been advocated by many people throughout the country and they are overdue, especially when we recall the burden which many old people have to carry in relation to the high price of the necessities of life, ordinary food, bread and butter, on which they rely so much.  If this increase in pension helps in some way to mitigate that burden, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to State pensioners, on page 16 of his Budget speech, and said:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All would agree that pensioners who gave long and loyal service to the State in their different spheres deserve special consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that special consideration should be given to these pensioners because of the long and loyal service which they may have given. Everyone, we can presume, gives the best service he can.  This increase in pension is given, I imagine, to help in some way to offset the present cost of living and not so much in recognition for their long and loyal years of service, as the Minister puts it.  It is given primarily to offset the burden of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <i>En passant,</i> I should like to ask the Minister to do what he can to help other sections of our people and put them in a position to say that, when they retire from their various employments, they likewise will be able to fall back on pensions.  If contributory schemes were introduced in many of our industries, it would help in some way to satisfy many of our workers and would ease the tension which undoubtedly <Col N="682" /> exists between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>With regard to reliefs given to greyhound racing, the Minister pointed out that one of his reasons for abolishing the tax on greyhound racing was that there was no such tax on coursing or on horse racing and, to put the three sports on a level, he thought it proper to abolish the greyhound tax.  He also referred to the possibilities which exist in a flourishing greyhound industry. In that regard, he remarked that Bord na gCon had recommended that this tax should be abolished, so that the greyhound tracks could flourish and the greyhound industry likewise flourish.  Many people down the country will question the wisdom of that move.  I personally agree that the greyhound industry gives a certain amount of employment and that its industrial potentialities are very great; but we cannot get away from the fact that greyhound racing is gambling, no matter what we think of it.</P>
    <P>I imagine that it would have been more fitting and more proper if the Minister had applied these reliefs to other more necessitous objects.  After all, we have only to take up our newspapers to read of the very large numbers who frequent these race meetings of all types.  That suggests to me that they are in a position to carry a small tax.  I do not agree that the tax should have been removed from greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>With regard to other entertainments, the greater duty on admission to dances is likewise being reduced. Dancing, of course, is a luxury and whilst I agree that there are some worthwhile organisations which run dances for the purpose of augmenting their funds, I do not agree that the tax on dancing either, should have been reduced.  If the Minister wanted to help these philanthropic and charitable organisations, he could have done so by some sort of weeding out, separating the wheat from the chaff, and deciding that dances run by such and such an organisation would merit exemption while others would not.  However, that may be very difficult and cumbersome and may not justify the expense or the time involved in operating it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> I notice that the effective date for relief in relation to greyhound racing is the present time&mdash;from last Monday, I think&mdash;but the old age pension will not be increased until August next. When the increase comes in August, I wonder will it be retrospective to the date of the Budget?  That point has been put to me by some pensioners since the Budget was introduced.  They hope it will be retrospective, but whether their hopes will be justified or not remains to be seen.  At any rate, they are anxious that this halfcrown increase will be made retrospective to the date of its announcement.</P>
    <P>Income tax and surtax were mentioned by the Minister and it is good to see that there is a reduction, even though it is a small one.  At least, the Minister is travelling in the right direction.  I recall that some time ago, during the debate on the Vote on Account, Deputy J.A. Costello and Deputy Dillon were very vociferous, sincere, and genuine in urging that a direct reduction be made in taxation as against the granting of moneys in the form of grants.  They said that would do far more than anything else to ease the present burden on industry, and, now, the reduction in income tax, and the raising of the level to £2,000 in relation to surtax, is some relief.  Their effects on industry and employment should be good and I hope that they will lead to an expansion of industry in general.</P>
    <P>I envisage many difficulties with regard to the proposed introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system which, as a matter of fact, is already operated by many firms in this country.  Possibly this debate is not the proper occasion on which to go into detail, but I do not intend to do that.  I just want to impress upon the Minister that there are two sides to the problem.  There is the interest of the employee and there is also the interest of the employer, and it is an undoubted fact that the introduction of this system will impose extra work and extra expense on many firms.  I suppose that it will be one or two years before it is introduced, and I hope it will be a system which will meet with the <Col N="684" /> approval of both sides, employers and employees.</P>
    <P>When the Minister referred to reliefs in relation to buildings and other industrial reliefs, he said that all the recommendations of the Industrial Taxation Committee had now been implemented, except two.  These two are, of course, the granting of a two per cent. annual wear and tear allowance for capital expenditure on industrial buildings, and the granting of an obsolescence allowance where plant or machinery is not replaced. He said that it was his intention to provide in the Finance Bill for the implementation of both these recommendations with effect from 6th April, 1960.  I was interested to read that harbours will be brought within the scope of these relieving provisions and I welcome that step very much.  He said that capital expenditure incurred on dredging and other site preparation works will be eligible for initial and annual allowances.</P>
    <P>With the introduction and the operation of the oil refinery at Whitegate, it is to be hoped that the provincial harbours will be developed to a great extent, in order to be better able to take the supplies of oil when they are carried around our coasts.  If only for that reason, these allowances in relation to harbours should be welcomed and provincial ports should be encouraged in their efforts to develop because, as I say, they will be required to be in a position to take these imports of oil from the Whitegate refinery.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a reference also to the present duty on tobacco and said that the imposition of an excise duty of 2½d. per lb. on the leaf was decided on with the consent of the manufacturers.  When we consider that we collect about £25,000,000 in revenue from tobacco duty, we must admit that that is a very important source of revenue to the Government, but I am glad to see that this arrangement is optional.  Even though the manufacturers have agreed to an increase of 2½d. per lb., they may opt out of this arrangement if they wish and they may continue, as they have been <Col N="685" /> doing for the past number of years, to pay according as they draw from their warehouses.  The Minister said that brewers could take advantage of a four weeks' time lag in order to pay duty and it was in the interests of the tobacco manufacturers to do likewise.</P>
    <P>There is one facet of this matter to which I should like to refer, that is, in relation to the tourist industry and the consumption of tobacco in this country. I think that the possibility of increasing still further the numbers of tourists who come here lies in not increasing the price of cigarettes any further.  By that, I mean not falling into the temptation to increase the tax on cigarettes.  Thousands of people who come to this country find they can get cigarettes&mdash;which are a very important item in our daily lives&mdash;cheaper than they can get them at home, and, if cigarette prices do not go up, tourists, especially English people, will be encouraged to come here in greater numbers.  In that regard, I would urge the Minister to allow those visitors to take out of the country as many cigarettes as they want when they are returning home.  Sometimes we read of cigarette seizures being made from tourists and I think that is wrong.  It is not encouraging the tourist industry; it is not encouraging our native tobacco industry; and if some steps were taken to remove that anomaly, it would improve the position.</P>
    <P>There are one or two omissions from this Budget which I should like to mention.  The first relates to death duties.  The Minister made no reference to the heavy burden which many people have to bear when they find they have to pay death duties on estates.  The effect of this burden on industry, on the farming community and on people affected in general, is very great and I hope the Minister will do something to lessen that effect sometime in the near future.  That subject was included in the submissions made to the Minister by the Association of Chambers of Commerce. They thought it so important that they included it in the memorandum which they sent to the Minister prior to the introduction of the Budget.</P>
    <P>Another omission which I observe <Col N="686" /> is that the duty on newsprint remains. We can recall the reason why the special import levy was imposed on newsprint back in 1956.  I know the Minister is aware that the printing industry gives great employment here. It is one of our most important industries.  When we remember that newsprint is not produced at home&mdash; we are not competing against any native project in that regard&mdash;the Minister should consider giving some relief to this industry.  But there does not appear to be any hope that this duty will be reduced.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister in his efforts to promote the general economy of the country to see to it that greater and easier credit will be available.  It is the absence of credit at a reasonable interest that is retarding our economy at present.  It is good to observe that the banks and other lending organisations in recent months are more inclined to give money on loan.  But the rate of interest is still very high, and that is one of the chief deterring factors for people who otherwise would seek credit and use it in the interest of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly referred to the human factor which should transcend everything else.  No matter what any Government does in its efforts to advance the economy, its efforts will be brought to nought if the people themselves do not cooperate and work as hard as possible.  I would ask the Minister to concentrate on tourism, forestry, the eradication of bovine T.B. and on education.  The emphasis should be placed on the latter subject. Only when education is improved will we have laid the solid foundation for tackling the other projects.</P>
    <P>This Budget has been referred to as an election Budget.  That is quite possible, human nature being what it is; but in my opinion it could not have been otherwise, because reliefs had to come; the people were crying out for them.  The reliefs given to old-age pensioners and others, to income-tax payers and those liable for sur-tax were bound to come eventually.  The situation was becoming too serious and the burden that industry in general was carrying was well high intolerable. <Col N="687" /> While this year the budget was comparatively good, it will be very interesting to see what kind of Budget we shall have next year and whether the Budget will contain any good things. I hope it will but time alone will tell. I could describe this Budget as one of presumption, because the Minister is presuming he will not require £2,500,000; before the year is out, I think he will have to come to the House and ask for that £2,500,000, or portion of it, in the form of Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Like very many others who are members of the general public, I welcome this Budget as a very proper one and, at the same time, quite a courageous one.  I was glad to hear the last Deputy refer to the fact that the reliefs were necessary.  I am glad to agree with him that it is not simply a question of an election Budget.  Most members of the Opposition do agree that a Budget such as this was essential in the national interest.  Whether there is a referendum, a general election, a Presidential election or anything in the offing, this is the sort of Budget which the economic situation of the country demanded.</P>
      <P>There are many factors which give rise to feelings of optimism.  One, referred to by the Minister in his Budget speech, was the increase in employment in manufacturing industries. Comment was made by some members of the Opposition on the fact that total employment had not increased and some feeling was expressed that the Minister had in some way juggled with the figures in order to produce an imaginary increase in certain quarters.  I have not got any particular insight into the Minister's mind but it certainly appears to me that it was reasonable to refer specifically to the increase in employment in manufacturing industries by reason of the fact that it is in that sphere that there is the greatest possibility of an increase in employment and that it is through expansion of manufacturing industries we can hope for some impact on the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment, of course, does indeed remain a very serious problem, <Col N="688" /> as the Minister stressed, too.  But we have got to remember that modern developments have made employment, as such, more difficult.  The rising standard of living generally, the rise in wages has made it much more economic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was commenting on the difficulty of providing employment under present circumstances when, through the rising standard of living and the rising cost of wages, it has become much more economic than hitherto to use mechanical equipment and to dispense with manual labour. This has been particularly obvious in the road development schemes where modern machinery is capable of laying roads much more economically and, in fact, very much better than if manual labour solely were employed.  This applies to all branches of industry where the use of mechanical equipment is increasing very rapidly and where industrial expansion can be very considerable without&mdash;unfortunately, in many ways&mdash;affecting the total employment position.  I refer to that simply to stress the fact that it is not easy to make a significant improvement in the unemployment position without a very large increase, indeed, in both industrial and agricultural output.</P>

      <P>What about the 100,000 jobs the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that question might more properly be raised at another time and directed to someone other than myself.  I do not, therefore, propose to pay any attention to it.  The unemployment position is still very much in the mind of the Government. That is clearly shown by the Minister when, in the opening part of his speech, he referred to the total unemployment figure being still much too high.  It is, of course, obvious that there has been a significant fall in emigration. It is no harm to emphasise that some effort has been made, and some success achieved, not only to stop the <Col N="689" /> rot but also to put the country on the road to complete recovery.  The Minister was very realistic in his approach. He could quite easily have glossed over certain disturbing features, but he did not attempt to do so.  He even referred to the fact that there has been some disimprovement in our trading position in recent months; in January, imports were exceptionally high and exports were below average.  There was no effort made by the Minister to disguise the continued weakness of our position in certain sectors of our economy.  The Minister looked the facts squarely in the face when framing his Budget.</P>
      <P>He referred later in his Budget statement to the fact that the economy has gained ground generally.  That is certainly no exaggeration.  In Table V of the Economic Statistics, there is reference to the general monetary situation. The net external assets of the commercial banks for the years 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958 are set out.  For 1954, the net external assets were £121,000,000; for 1955, when the rot and the panic had set in, net external assets dropped from £121,000,000 to £85,000,000; there was a slight recovery in 1956 when they increased to £88.4 million; at the end of 1957, there was again a slight recovery to £90.5 million; and at the end of 1958, they had gone up to £104.9 million&mdash;practically £105,000,000.  That shows the growing strength of the economy.  It shows a very healthy sign generally and is something for which the Government very rightly take their share of the credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of that improvement, it was only right that the Minister should see his way to run what he described as a &ldquo;limited temporary risk&rdquo;.  This type of risk is well known to anyone engaged in business, whether large or small.  There are times when one must take a limited risk in order to achieve a certain long-term aim.  That is precisely what the Minister is doing.  At the same time, he issued a warning that we must not overspend for current purposes.  Our spending must be productive. There is no sign there of lack of realism or lack of foresight.  I was glad the Minister mentioned the human factor.  Very often, in high finance, <Col N="690" /> the individual is forgotten.  There is such a mass of statistics to be analysed that the human element is overlooked. The Minister has avoided that pitfall exceedingly well.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed in a way that the Minister did not go a little further in respect of one matter to which he referred.  He stated it was the object of both Government and Opposition that taxation should fall more heavily on expenditure rather than on income. I believe our entire taxation system in relation to income is fundamentally unsound.  Taxation on expenditure provides an incentive for saving and investment; taxation on income does not.  I believe taxation on expenditure should be increased and taxation on income progressively repealed.  It is only in that way that we shall foster a proper spirit of providence; it is only in that way that saving and investment will be encouraged.</P>
    <P>When one knows that the more one earns, the more one pays by way of taxation, one is tempted to take the view that one will get the best value one can for one's money, as quickly as one can, before the Revenue get it. Taxation on expenditure, on the other hand, inculcates a habit of saving, and the more savings there are the stronger will be our economy as a whole.  I hope the Minister will keep that aspect of taxation before him and I hope that, before he relinquishes office, he will have made an even more courageous move to rectify the position and give a further tonic to our economy generally.</P>
    <P>Pension increases have been well received, but on the whole people tend to say that the increase is too small. Unfortunately, that cannot be denied. Few people, however, appreciate the cost of even a small increase.  The general public should be made to realise that it is not niggardliness on the part of the Government which prevents them raising certain pensions by 5/- or 7/6.  The increase of 2/6 in the old age and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance will cost £883,000.  The operative date is next August.  The cost, therefore, for a full year will be much greater.  Perhaps when that is realised, people will be a <Col N="691" /> bit more understanding of the reluctance on the part of the Government to go further than they have gone in the present instance.  The Government are not unmindful of the needs of the less fortunate members of our community. To do more than they have done would call for the provision of an enormous sum of money.  That money can be raised only by additional taxation and such an increase would not be appreciated by the public generally.</P>
    <P>Referring again to the importance of the human factor, I was glad that the Minister referred to the fact that heavy taxation can be a serious disincentive to individual effort and can, and does, militate against managerial, executive, and professional abilities being fully applied to the raising of the level of production and employment.  We are only now beginning to realise the tremendous need for really well-qualified managers and executives in industry.  Training in management is absolutely essential and the Irish Management Institute is doing a tremendous job in raising the standard of management and putting before industry generally the absolute necessity for proper cost accounting in industries of all sorts.</P>
    <P>Good managers and good cost accountants are highly qualified men who could and would command very high salaries in Britain, where the need for them is more fully realised, and if we lose such men, we shall be losing men who are absolutely vital to our own expansion.  For that reason, I was delighted that some concession was made in the income tax levels, but I am still very doubtful on the question of the P.A.Y.E. system.  I know it is possible in businesses of a moderate size and it is, of course, comparatively easy in a very large business where a very large accounts staff is constantly employed; but in small businesses, or on a farm, I foresee the most terrible difficulties in making the P.A.Y.E. system work at all.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be introduced only with extreme caution and it certainly is not the complete answer to the problem of the revision of our income <Col N="692" /> tax code.  It could help considerably in certain cases, but I think that is as far as I would go.  I am absolutely convinced it will raise a tremendous number of almost insuperable difficulties for employers of small staffs who will not be able to deal with the complicated issues involved.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I was disappointed also by the Minister's omission to refer to death duties.  I am sure he gave the matter consideration but I feel this is becoming a matter of increasing importance as time goes on.  In the grey book, <i>Economic Development</i>, the yield from various sources of taxation is set out and it is interesting to see that the yield from tobacco is £8.98 million, whereas the yield from death duties is £.23 million, £230,000.  That is the gross yield from death duties.  It has to be remembered that the current Estimate provides for salaries in the Estate Duty Office of practically £46,000.  Other expenditure in connection with the assessment and collection of estate duty such as is incurred in the Accountant General's Office, the Stamping Branch, the typing pool and so forth, easily accounts for £5,000.  The upkeep of premises&mdash; light, heat, stationery, office equipment and so on&mdash;easily accounts for another £5,000 per annum.  This makes a total expenditure of £56,000 at the very least&mdash;it might be considerably more&mdash; leaving a net receipt for death duties of £174,000 at the very most.  I estimate it would be considerably less than that.  For the purpose of collecting £174,000 worth of death duties, we run the risk of very substantial disemployment because a family business may be put in extreme financial difficulty through having to raise the necessary funds to discharge death duties.</P>
    <P>Those who are clever enough can make suitable provision to avoid payment of death duties to any great extent, but there are far too many cases where an old-established business has had to be wound up, the staff dismissed and the premises disposed of because a comparatively small amount of death duty had to be raised at once.  I cannot feel this is in the national interest at all and I would ask the Minister to give further <Col N="693" /> consideration to the suggestion that death duties should be abolished.  I feel that that would be a tremendous incentive to investment in this country, especially if death duties were not leviable on Irish assets but were still leviable on assets overseas.  It would mean that a man retiring to this country and wishing to avail of that facility would be almost compelled to realise his assets in the other country and to invest in Irish industry or Irish property in order to avoid payment of death duties.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this could make an enormous difference to our whole economy by creating an influx of capital which could well be used for industrial development.  At the moment, it is very difficult to float a private issue for a private company. It is very difficult to turn a private company into a public company because the necessary amount of investment capital is not available.  For that reason, the Industrial Credit Company has to step into the breach.  I believe it would be an additional benefit to the State if extra capital were attracted to the country and I would ask the Minister to look into this very carefully.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister was prepared to regard repair of foreign ships in Irish dockyards as a qualification for the granting of tax relief and I hope this concession will also apply to those who repair foreign ships actually on the high seas.  Based on Dún Laoghaire, in my own constituency, there is one salvage ship to which I have referred already in correspondence with the Minister.  That ship goes out and repairs ships which are experiencing mechanical trouble while still at sea.  All the earnings of that ship so far have been in foreign currency and even though the ships are repaired at sea and not in Irish dockyards, as mentioned in the Minister's speech, Irish labour is employed and foreign currency is brought into the country.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will bear that matter in mind and that salvage ships based on Irish ports will qualify for the granting of tax reliefs, the same as any other export industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> The Minister referred to the question of possible economies, or a possible reorganisation, in the Civil Service structure.  I am afraid I must confess to a little disappointment that further progress has not been made in that connection.  I do not want to appear prejudiced against the civil servants as such, but at the same time, there is foundation for the belief that there is far too much overlapping in many Government Departments, and far too much reluctance to allow junior civil servants to take decisions. I have a horror of this business of one person referring a file to somebody else, who refers it again to a higher person; then it goes a little further and up further again and back, and up and down, with the result that a tremendous number of civil servants are very actively engaged, but no decision is being reached.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has read that magnificent book <i>Parkinson's Law.</i>  It is indeed a very amusing book but it is also a damning indictment of Civil Service procedure in all countries.  Let us be quite clear that, though it was written about Britain, it also concerns us, and I gather that it applies equally to Europe and America.  It is a chronic weakness in the Civil Service structure.  In view of that, the time has come to be rather more ruthless, and possibly the Minister ought not to be so much the gentleman he undoubtedly is being in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that the views of heads of Departments have been sought, and that efforts were made to reconcile differing views by discussions, and that proposals were then forwarded to the staffs.  I think that is an impossible thing to do, to refer, to a staff concerned, measures for a reduction in their numbers which would undoubtedly affect the seniority of some of them.  The decision must be taken at the top and a decision will have to be taken that the total number employed in the Civil Service must be reduced by a certain percentage, by a certain date.  That decision should then be referred to the heads of Departments and they should be told: &ldquo;Your Department must continue to run efficiently with a reduction of five <Col N="695" /> per cent. in your staff during the current year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one would suggest that civil servants should be dismissed, but I am convinced that by the ruthless stopping of recruitment, a very substantial reduction in the total man-power could be achieved fairly rapidly.  That is a job which needs courageous handling, but I believe the Minister has the courage to do it, and I hope he will do it.  If he does it, it will undoubtedly be received with great relief by those who are at present the employers of that vast body of civil servants and who sometimes feel they are not getting their full money's worth.  I know that sounds unfriendly and unappreciative. I do not want it to appear that way because my experience, especially with senior civil servants, has been very friendly&mdash;and I may say I was greatly impressed by their standard of ability and enthusiasm&mdash;but below them, there are so many others that it almost appears that they are falling over one another and getting in one another's way rather than helping their seniors to reach decisions or to get the facts of a case clearly before them.</P>
    <P>In general, I feel that while I have criticised a few points, both of omission and commission, the Minister is to be congratulated on a courageous Budget. The accusation was bound to be levelled against him that it was purely an election Budget, but I am glad the Opposition generally appear to realise that the economy of the country needed the shot in the arm which it undoubtedly is getting.  If this shot in the arm produces as good results as we all hope it will, and as I certainly believe it will, there is no doubt that next year's Budget will be a satisfactory one also.  This is a time when we should proceed with courage and realism and the Minister has done both.  I should like to congratulate him on what he has done so far, and to ask him again to give consideration to the other points I have raised, in which I feel I am supported by a number of others, both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Sunday, I was <Col N="696" /> interested to read an article in the <i>Sunday Press</i> under the heading: &ldquo;Upward Swing in Economy is now Certain&mdash;say Industrialists.&rdquo;  The article reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The view of industrialists is that the Budget is bound to lead to a tremendous upward swing in our economy.  The Federation of Irish Industries and other organisations are to meet shortly to consider in detail the incentives to industry which have been provided.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is printed in heavy type at the top of the article.  It goes on to give the views of the President of the Federation of Irish Industries, the past President of the Federation of Irish Industries, and then the views of prominent industrial leaders such as Sir Basil Goulding, Mr. Colm Barnes, Glen Abbey Textiles, Dr. Louis Smith, Economic Adviser to N.F.A., Mr. David Frame and Mr. J.K. Clear of the National Fishermen's Association.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure it will be noted that only one of these groups can lay any claim to being an organisation catering for, and made up of, the ordinary working people of this country.  I was amazed to find that in that article not a single view of organised labour as represented by the Congress of Irish Unions or, indeed, by any leader of any organised group of workers in this country was published.  It may well be that the newspaper endeavoured to get their views for inclusion in the article, but the fact is that the article, as published, gives not a single view of the Budget and its effect on our economy as seen through the eyes of those who represent organised labour.  While it is true that the paper may not be at fault perhaps because of not receiving replies to queries, but it must be noted that the Congress of Irish Unions published a statement last Friday giving their comments on the Minister's Budget statement, and it is amazing that this article could not include even a synopsis of their statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Press</i> is practically a Government controlled affair and it may well be that it was thought undesirable to have any discordant note <Col N="697" /> in the hymn of praise being sung in connection with the Budget.  It might have been embarrassing if questions were asked of trade union leaders as to how the 70,000 unemployed and their dependants were to fare during the coming year and what prospects or hope the Budget gave them.  Again it could be embarrassing and take away from the strength of the article and the optimism expressed in it, if a question were asked as to where the real figures were which gave the Taoiseach the authority to claim that emigration was now on the decline.</P>
    <P>Many of us keenly interested in employment and emigration fail to find the same comfort from the figures available either from the Central Statistics Office or from our own personal knowledge.  An eminent churchman in the South of Ireland, Bishop Lucey, has claimed that emigration is now as bad as ever it was since the days of the Famine.  In last Sunday's article in the <i>Sunday Press</i> the reason for such an optimistic outlook and the facts on which it was based should have been brought to the notice of readers from one side as well as the other.  I regret it was not thought fit &mdash;I realise the Minister has no personal responsibility for it but I wish to comment on it&mdash;at least to publish the views of organised labour because they are an important factor and they are the factor that will have to be considered if our economy is to make the progress that is foretold.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to examine this Budget from the point of view of the ordinary working man without casting our minds back to the Budget of 1957. Any reliefs or concessions given in this Budget can be viewed only against the background that in that year the £9 million subsidies for essential foodstuffs, bread, butter and flour, formerly subsidised by the State, were removed and that on to the shoulders of the ordinary working people was placed that added sum in providing these essentials for themselves and their families.  That was done notwithstanding the fact that the Tánaiste in his speech in Waterford, and I believe elsewhere, gave a definite assurance that if his Government were returned <Col N="698" /> to power, there was no intention of removing them.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister gave some compensatory increases in that year to certain social welfare groups but the net result was that every year since 1957 a sum of over £5 million is being saved by the Exchequer that formerly went towards subsidising these essential foodstuffs.  It is against that background only that the present increases granted to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and those others of the social welfare assistance group that have been included, can be examined.</P>
    <P>We can be forgiven if we are not enthusiastic about or loud in our praise of this belated and inadequate increase.  It certainly loses much of its flavour when we realise that in 1909 under an alien Government the sum of 5/- then granted to the old aged had the same purchasing power as the present 25/- a week of the old aged pensioners.  It is a poor tribute to our native Government that the standard of living of our aged poor has so little increased as to be measured by the pittance which will only now be above the 5/- level of 1909.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, although it is not his responsibility to make representations to the local authorities, to ensure that this increase of 2/6, small and badly needed as it is, will not be taken into consideration by the home assistance authorities in reckoning the allowances payable to some of the old people.  It would be deplorable if the generosity of the Minister in granting this increase, because of the urgent need that he and the whole community see for it, were to be vitiated by the action of the local authorities who may seek justification for withholding it on the grounds that rates are already too high.</P>
    <P>Believing, as I do, in the justice of the increase given to the home assistance group, I do not quarrel with the Minister's method of finding that money.  However, it must be clear to everybody that the Budget was strained and a particular adjustment was made to permit this money to be paid.  I wonder, were it not for the coming referendum and the Presidential <Col N="699" /> election, if such a manipulation of the figures would have been resorted to. The conservative attitude of the Minister in other years would give good grounds for such thoughts as those.  I think it was Deputy Brennan of Donegal who, on Thursday last, accused members of the Opposition of blowing hot and cold, some saying it was an election Budget, others that there was nothing in the Budget at all. I do not want to be accused of that line of thought.  My own personal view is that were the Minister not faced with certain problems, some arising from the British Budget and others arising from the fact that the referendum and the Presidential election are about to take place, we might well have had a different statement last Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Tax reliefs costing £1,600,000 have been given in this Budget and they cover a wide variety of groups embracing practically the whole community. I cannot help thinking that, even if part of that sum were retained, all the social welfare groups, some of whom are omitted now, such as orphans or single people on unemployment assistance, who have to struggle on on a pittance, very often on the verge of starvation, might well have been included.</P>
    <P>Included in that sum of £1,600,000 is £600,000 for forms of entertainment which cover cinemas, dancing, track-racing and boxing.  Practically all of the concession will find its way back into the pockets of promoters of these entertainments.  The Minister indicated that the public were not to expect other than that.  Whatever case might be made for the cinemas and the danger of loss in employment unless a tax concession is given to them, I feel that very little can be said on the other scores.  Even in relation to the cinema, I feel the question of tax is not the important thing.  Emigration and the evergrowing popularity of television in this country will, as in other countries, reduce attendance at cinemas and consequently reduce the employment content there.</P>
    <P>As has been found here and elsewhere, if employment in a business dwindles due to the creation of a <Col N="700" /> counter-attraction, those who lose their employment in one way are made up for by those employed or re-employed in the new venture.  I feel sure that the tax concession can but stave off the day when a change will take place and resort to further measures of a much different kind will have to take place.  I suggest that if some of the concessions could be passed on to the cinema patrons the same objects could be achieved.</P>
    <P>Some forms of entertainment have not a large employment content.  The Minister said, in relation to dancing, that the funds raised were generally for charity or philanthropic work. Those who live in the country, in particular, know that there is a good deal of fund-raising for various types of organisations through the holding of dances but it is mainly to the professional dance-hall owner that the benefit of this concession will go. Perhaps we should not be too surprised at that.  I remember another Budget when the very same concession was made to the same gentlemen&mdash; and at a time when taxes were being imposed on the working people.  There would be some reason or excuse&mdash;if you like that word better&mdash;if the remission were given to some form of entertainment that could claim to be at least of some cultural value.  An examination of the people who will benefit under this concession will reveal that they cannot make any serious claim to importance either in the educational or cultural fields.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister indicated, and later confirmed by a White Paper, a remission of special import levies in respect of which a sum of £200,000 has been allocated. When the inter-Party Government found that imports were exceeding exports by a very high figure they were driven to imposing these levies.  How effective they were was proved within six or eight months.  This Government saw fit to change that; it is their right. I was amazed at the proposal practically to wipe out the special import levies <i>in toto.</i>  It is true that the present Government have a different view on the matter from that of the inter-Party Government.  The mere fact that <Col N="701" /> the money has been changed to the current account rather than to the capital account, as the inter-Party Government proposed to do, is indicative of that.</P>
    <P>Last week, just after the Budget, the daily papers published a statement from the Central Statistics Office pointing out that for the three months ending March last the balance of trade showed that imports exceeded exports by £6,000,000 more than for the same three months of the previous year. That increase of £6,000,000 on the corresponding three months of the previous year would seem to show that this is not the time to reduce taxation on importable articles mainly of the type the inter-Party Government considered we could manage without at least for a time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction in income tax, I suppose the country in general will welcome the reduction in direct taxation.  The Minister pointed out that the human element, that is, the working person, in our industrial economy must be considered and encouraged. That is quite true.  I would point out that the vast number of ordinary working people&mdash;those in factories, shops, farms and on the roads&mdash;all belong to the lower-scale group of income tax payers.  It could be said that were it not for the overtime or bonus earned for increased output most of them would not be liable to tax at all.  If encouragement is needed one would expect an upward increase in the allowances, to bring them outside the scope of income tax, which would be more appropriate than the reduction of threepence for the lower-scale group.  In contrast, the higher-scale group&mdash;mostly white-collar workers&mdash;with salaries ranging from £1,000 upwards, get a 50 per cent. better allocation and surtax to the tune of £160,000 is being handed back.</P>
    <P>Just as it is recognised that an increase in the ceiling of insurable employment from £600 to £800 is necessary because the value of money has decreased, I feel it would be more equitable that the earned income allowance for ordinary workers should be increased and that those least well <Col N="702" /> able to pay, and who do most of the donkey work of production, should get the benefit of whatever concessions are possible.  It is the same pattern right through.  We find the conservative approach of depending on progress by encouraging those who are the producers and who invest money in business rather than those who put into business all that God has given them, namely their health, strength and goodwill to produce.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the last speaker suggest that the Minister should be careful in connection with the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system.  The trade unions generally have welcomed the proposal to introduce that system.  The Minister must know the difficulty confronting workers when called upon to pay income tax in the year following that in which the money was earned.  We know what workers do with their wages, the very small wages, having regard to the cost of living, available for the working man in this country.  Every penny the worker earns is spent week by week and if, in the January following the year in which he worked, he receives a demand for £10 or £15 income tax, it is practically impossible for him to pay it.  The final result is that the Revenue Commissioners notify the employer to deduct the entire sum in one week or a percentage for a number of weeks.  It frequently happens that the wife and family of that working man have to go short while that payment is being made.</P>
    <P>The P.A.Y.E. system will help not only the worker but will help the State, inasmuch as money which is now lost to the revenue by workers emigrating when faced with these demands, will be secured each week and any readjustments necessary can be made at the end of the year.  If workers should have the misfortune to be unemployed for a period, there is a possibility that, as is the case in Great Britain, during the period of unemployment, they will be recouped the amount of excess income tax paid. Employers are overstating the difficulties involved in this system.  Whatever the difficulties may be, the responsibility of operating the P.A.Y.E. system or a system of weekly deductions from <Col N="703" /> employees' pay packets is a burden that should be placed on industry. That should be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Encouragement is being given to the Minister to reduce the Civil Service. It is ridiculous that a sensible Deputy should state in this House that the Minister should fix arbitrarily on five per cent. of the Civil Service and direct heads of Departments to do without that percentage and to run the service as efficiently as formerly.  If it were as easy as that, employers who engage time and motion experts and such people to indicate how staffs can be reduced without interfering with output, are very foolish indeed.  Again, of course, there are the organisations to which civil servants belong.  They will have a say.  The Minister would be very well advised not to take such an arbitrary decision as he is being pressed to do in the House to-day.  It is quite a good line to hear the proposals of his advisers, to discuss with the various organisations representing civil servants and to get their views and, if possible, to get some measure of conformity and agreement with any proposal.  The mere fact that one prefaces his remarks by saying that one does not want any civil servants dismissed does not get away from the fact that it is a proposal to reduce the employment content of the Service, to make existing workers in that Service work harder, which is equivalent to saying that they should get less pay. That type of proposal is not in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service is much maligned but in my experience as a Deputy I have found a good deal of wisdom, a good deal of sagacity and intelligence in every letter, every proposal, every recommendation made by the various officials with whom I have come in contact.  Civil servants are paid only what is right for giving us a very efficient and a very courteous service.</P>
    <P>I shall sum up the effects of the Budget as I see it as a whole.  The social welfare increases are inadequate and not sufficiently embracing.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland old people are paid far in excess of what we are paying here.  While it is <Col N="704" /> not possible for us to reach the level reached in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, much greater effort must be made if we are ever to attract our people, our colleagues, our fellow-countrymen in the North to view favourably a proposal to merge into the Republic.  The concessions to entertainment do not appear to be justified at this particular moment.  It is a strange thing that a sum of £200,000 should be handed back to those who provide amusement while a single person in receipt of unemployment assistance receives as little as 19/- a week.  Such a person is expected to survive on that meagre allowance while £200,000, that could quite easily be collected, is handed out for amusement. The removal of the special import levies appears to be inopportune. The income tax concessions, although welcomed by the country, could have been given in a better way.  It is quite true that the Minister was under certain compulsion.  Due to the reduction of income tax in Britain, he was compelled, in order to maintain at the same level the differential between Great Britain and this country, to employ the method described in his Budget.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to see how the Government's prophecies are fulfilled in that connection, namely, that there will be an upward swing in employment. Those of us who are concerned from the labour point of view will measure the progress, not from the point of view of the balance of payments or balance of trade, but from the point of view of the increase in employment and the reduction in emigration that may follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures published in the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget make depressing reading and give a rather depressing picture of the state of the national economy.  In Table VIII, it shows that the gross national product at constant market prices in 1958 was £526,000,000 compared with £538,000,000 in 1957 and £528.6 million in 1956.  These figures, taken in conjunction with other figures which I shall read later, indicate that all is not well with the state of our economy and that it will <Col N="705" /> require the concerted efforts of all sections to effect an improvement.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is too much destructive criticism from many different quarters concerning the state of the country.  It is easy to see what is wrong and what should be changed; what is not so easy is to provide a remedy, or remedies, for these economic problems.  Listening to this discussion, and having examined as carefully as one can the figures presented in the very informative <i>Economic Statistics</i>, it appears that we should concentrate on the area of agreement existing between Parties and seek to widen the area rather than the reverse, and that too much time is spent making debating points by showing where differences exist, or by enlarging points of disagreement.</P>
      <P>While this may be good for Parties at a particular time, it seems that it is not good for the country.  Undoubtedly, the lack of progress has been due to a very considerable extent to politics and personalities.  If impending changes on the political scene will mean an end to these disastrous activities, then the sooner these changes occur the better. In recent months, very full proposals have been published of aims of economic policy, or <i>desiderata</i> which should be achieved.  To a great extent, these proposals have been sponsored not only by the present Government but by the previous Government and they have secured general acceptance from interested outside bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering these, however, insufficient attention is being paid to a number of the conclusions which have been drawn in these reports and the indices contained in some of the figures quoted in them.  These reports laid down certain aims for agriculture, for an expansionist policy and dealt with certain aspects of agricultural policy.  In that connection, I should like to ask what steps have been taken to implement the recommendations concerning marketing and the linking of the marketing arrangements and the price structure between this country and Britain?  On page 212 of <i>Economic Development,</i> a suggestion <Col N="706" /> is made that a bi-lateral beef policy would be of mutual benefit and would accord with modern internationalism in economic affairs.  Having previously referred to the importance of the British market to Irish producers and the importance of the Irish supply to Britain, it suggests that it argues a joint approach.</P>
    <P>The last agreement concerning trade which was made between the two countries was made over ten years ago. Many changes have since occurred and while, in the main, the 1948 agreement has worked well, very few modifications have been made in it. For that reason, it seems that in the light of the careful analysis which was made by the various Departments and which is contained in the report I have referred to, now is the time for a fresh look at that agreement with a view to effecting either a new agreement, if such is necessary, or whatever changes are deemed desirable in the light of changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>A somewhat later agreement in respect of pigs, coupled with the guaranteed price which was effected by means of the maintenance of, in certain cases, an Exchequer subsidy, did for a while work satisfactorily.  All the indications are that the pig industry is an industry which depends probably more than others on stable price conditions and the drop for the first three months of this year of 70,000 pigs delivered to the bacon factories indicated the serious effects which a change in price can have.  In view of the substantial rise in recent years in the value of bacon exports, it is important to maintain that position. In 1956, the export of bacon and hams amounted to £2,000,000.  It increased to £4.3 million in 1957 and last year it went up to £8.1 million.  That is a valuable trade and it is important that careful attention should be paid to maintaining price stability so that there will be no deleterious effect on the numbers of pigs reared and sent for curing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order that progress should be continuous, stable conditions are <Col N="707" /> essential and, while it is difficult, if not impossible, to secure those conditions, so far as external prices are concerned, certainly where the prices fixed are within the control of the Government here, it is important to maintain stability and to avoid fluctuations.</P>
    <P>The figures given in Table V of <i>Economic Statistics</i> indicate that 1958 was a year of decline in agricultural output and while that may be due to a considerable extent to abnormal weather conditions, undoubtedly prices had a part to play.  The very exceptional prices which obtained for cattle in 1957 were slightly reduced last year and also the reduction in the prices paid for wheat and milk delivered to creameries, as well as the weather, probably influenced production to an extent.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I believe the Government should consider this whole question of a new, or certainly a revised, trade agreement with Britain. We have a number of other trade agreements with Continental countries and, while in many respects these agreements have been satisfactory and have afforded an outlet for a variety of commodities, in the main, trade with Continental countries is unsatisfactory, in that we import substantially more from these countries than we export to them.  Most trade agreements with these countries were made many years ago.  Some of them were revised on a yearly basis, or every few years.  In a few cases, new agreements were negotiated. The time has arrived, particularly in view of the heavy adverse balance which characterises our trading with almost all Continental countries, when steps should be taken to see that these agreements are implemented in practice by the other countries and that no measures are taken which will prevent the full exploitation of the advantages of the agreements from our point of view.</P>
    <P>If we are to recover the ground which was lost last year, more strenuous efforts will be needed, both on the agricultural and industrial fronts.  The drop of £9,000,000 last year in agricultural income undoubtedly had a depressing effect, more especially when prices and costs continued to increase <Col N="708" /> and inevitably meant that people continued and are continuing to leave employment on the land.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact &mdash;without quoting any firm figures which would indicate what the position is&mdash;that emigration appears to have dropped.  If the numbers in employment given in Table XII of <i>Economic Statistics</i> are taken in conjunction with a reply which was given last year in the British House of Commons, the position does not appear to be so satisfactory. Last year the total at work in the country was 1,131,000 compared with 1,163,000 in 1956 which would indicate that there was a drop of 32,000 persons.  If the figure is taken of those not presently at work for any reason, either unemployable or in hospital, the figure shows a drop of 25,000.</P>
    <P>Last year, for the first ten months, according to a figure given in reply to the question I have mentioned, 48,000 new applicants from Ireland got employment permits in Britain between 1st of January and 31st October, so that in round figures about 50,000 employment permits were issued in Britain last year to persons from this country.  While it is true there is some drop in the numbers unemployed, when account is taken off the large number of new applicants for employment cards in Britain and the fact that the total at work is down in two years by 32,000, the picture is anything but satisfactory.  This persistent problem of a high level of emigration has continued, as the <i>Economic Survey</i> indicates, under all Governments and in peace and war. For that reason, it is vital that we should endeavour to take whatever steps are possible to improve the economy by reducing taxation.  The present administrative structure is too large and expensive for the country. The reference made by the Minister in the course of the Budget statement showed that the total cost of the Civil Service, Defence Forces, Garda and teachers, amounts to over £34 million, almost half the figure being made up by the cost of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which has been the subject of consideration by Governments over a number of years, and <Col N="709" /> it is easy to say that an overhaul of the Civil Service is necessary.  The general standard of the Civil Service &mdash;of all civil servants&mdash;is high, but the system is in many respects outmoded and requires to be modernised with a view to efficiency.  Delay in dealing with this matter means a continuation of an excessively costly administrative machine.  The matter has been the subject of Departmental examination for a number of years and it ought to be possible, in conjunction with the Civil Service staff associations and in the light of the experience gained by the examination that has been conducted, to devise a system in accordance with the needs of the country.</P>
    <P>That does not mean dismissing and dispensing with the services of redundant civil servants.  The new system to be put into operation should not affect existing serving civil servants who should be allowed to work out their time, but should mean that in the future&mdash;in the very near future&mdash;a new Civil Service system, in accordance with the needs of the country, would be put into operation.  This procedure will not yield spectacular economies immediately but will provide an efficient and an economical administrative machine without causing hardship to those employed in the Civil Service. It is obvious that so far as possible State Departments should be run on the lines of an efficient business concern and, when criticism is made of the way the machine works, a great deal of unintentional and unnecessary criticism is expressed against officials where what is really at fault is the outdated system that has been allowed to continue in operation in entirely different circumstances.  While demands for new and different services have grown, no worthwhile effort has been made to provide an administrative structure that would provide a machine suited to our requirements, and in keeping with the population of this country.</P>
    <P>The whole fabric of the State structure, almost in every section from the top down, is top heavy for the size of the country.  Sometimes views are expressed that we have to maintain <Col N="710" /> certain standards for prestige purposes but prestige spending, in the main, gives a bad return and is responsible for a make-believe attitude in place of the realism which is needed in the competitive conditions existing at the present time.  That lack of realism gives rise to a cynical reaction on the part of many who have to face the realities of a lack of employment and opportunity, and yet see a great deal of unnecessary expenditure in an effort to maintain a structure that is artificial and unsuited to the needs and capacity of this country.</P>
    <P>The <i>Economic Survey</i> reveals some very important facts.  Repeated efforts have been made by different Governments to start new industries and to provide employment.  Whenever a new industry is successfully launched, bouquets are handed out all around, but if we look at some of the industries already established, we see they have declined.  Attention is drawn to that in the <i>Economic Survey</i> on page 167 where reference is rightly made to the importance of industries based on agricultural products.  It says there, in Chapter 17, paragraph 1:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In 1929 exports of biscuits exceeded £500,000 and imports were only £11,000.  Exports had declined by 1940 to £298,000 while imports increased to £19,000.  In 1957, exports were valued at only £86,000 (of which £84,000 went to the Six Counties) while imports were valued at £120,000.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The substitution of an import trade for a once flourishing export trade is most regrettable.  The development of an export business would be most helpful from the employment and balance of payments aspects.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>If capital should prove to be a limiting factor, the Industrial Credit Company should be able to provide the necessary facilities....</P>
    <P>I believe that the factors contributing to that decline should be the subject of a most exhaustive examination, by the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="711" /> and Department of Finance, to see what steps are possible to regain the valuable trade which once existed.</P>
    <P>It is true that in connection with another industry which I propose to mention, taxation has a direct impact on its development.  In paragraph 10 of the same chapter, reference is made to the distilling industry.  It gives the average export figures for three pre-war years, 1937, 1938 and 1939, which amounted to approximately 230,000 gallons a year with a financial value of £179,000.  In the post-war period, exports of whiskey grew steadily from 1948 to 1951, reaching a peak in the later year of 438,000 gallons valued at £558,000.  They decreased steeply in the next three years but have since begun to recover.  Undoubtedly in this connection taxation has a direct effect. In 1952, the effect of the tax on spirits had a serious reaction and exports in 1954 were down to a total of 127,000 gallons, valued at £224,000.  They recovered, in 1957, to 194,000 gallons, worth £333,000.  As paragraph 11 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While total exports of whiskey are now above the pre-war level in value, because of higher prices, they are still below that level in volume and they are 50 per cent. less in volume than in 1950-51.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, very often a great deal of attention and effort&mdash;governmental, ministerial, departmental and, in some cases, local&mdash;is put into the establishment of a new industry; but these two valuable industries, using homegrown raw materials, providing substantial employment, producing a commodity equal to the best produced anywhere and providing in many cases male employment, have been seriously affected, in the one case, by taxation and, in the other, by causes of which I believe a careful examination should be conducted.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the other matter I wish to refer to.  When the levies were imposed in 1956 in order to correct the adverse trade balance, one of the commodities on which a levy was placed was newsprint, in order to restrict at that time the importation of newsprint.  During the course of the past year, the Minister, in reply to <Col N="712" /> questions, said he would consider it in conjunction with this year's Budget. Although the Budget has been introduced, the duty on newsprint is still maintained.  One firm alone, Independent Newspapers, Ltd., employs, directly or indirectly, a thousand persons.  Taking the other daily papers and the weekly and provincial papers, the total number employed, both directly and indirectly, in the newspaper industry is very considerable. For that reason, the amount of money involved, while falling heavily enough on the industry concerned, is, from the Exchequer point of view, not very considerable, and certainly in the manner in which the balance was made up this year, not a frightening figure.</P>
    <P>It is therefore clear that in the case of this existing established industry&mdash; an industry which exists without State protection, without State assistance of any sort, which provides well paid employment, which is decentralised in the sense that a great many of these newspapers are located in small towns or comparatively small towns throughout the country, as well as providing employment in Dublin&mdash;the continuation of the tax is unwarranted, more especially at a time when attractive inducements are being offered to foreign participants in industry here. This is another case of losing sight of existing valuable employment.  The other two cases I mentioned&mdash;the biscuit industry and the distilling industry&mdash;both indicate and show what serious effects&mdash;certainly in the case of distilling; the biscuit industry is somewhat different&mdash;taxation can have on employment, exports and on trade generally.  It is for that reason I hope the examples which they show and the effects which taxation had on the distilling industry will serve as a reminder that a similar reaction might occur in respect of those affected by the tax on newsprint.  I believe the Minister should seriously consider the remission of that tax.</P>
    <P>During the course of discussions which have taken place, and particularly during the last general election, there was a good deal of talk on marketing and the need for improved marketing conditions.  In 1957, a sum <Col N="713" /> of £500,000 was provided for the establishment of a marketing committee.  It is true that the establishment of the committee was delayed somewhat. Now that it has been established, I understand two interim reports have been presented.  Rumour has it that one of these deals with bacon.  If this committee is to have any value, surely the reports should be made available to the public, more especially when the number of pigs sent to the factories for the first quarter of this year shows a drop of 70,000.</P>
    <P>It is strange that in those circumstances these reports have not been published, because Government spokesmen during the last election spoke a great deal about improved marketing conditions.  I understand the sum provided was not spent, or very little of it used, in the first 12 months.  Now that the committee has furnished two reports, it ought to be possible for the public to see them and for those interested to get the benefit of the examination which that committee has conducted into marketing problems. The figures for the current quarter indicate that the import excess is growing again this year.  These tendencies will require to be kept under review if some of the problems which existed previously do not recur again.</P>
    <P>During the past two years, there has been a spectacular and continuous rise in the cost of living.  Table 10 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> shows that the consumer price index increased from 107.7 in February, 1957 to 117.7 in February of this year.  While that occurred, import prices dropped from 117.2 in February, 1957 to 107.3 in November, 1958.  So that, while consumers here had to pay more for essentials, the goods that individuals imported here dropped in price substantially. What is even more significant is the fact that the price of bread, flour and butter increased substantially, while, at the same time, less was paid to our farmers for wheat and for milk supplied to the creameries.  It is obvious that there is something wrong with an economic policy when, while import prices are declining continuously and while we pay less to our <Col N="714" /> own producers for wheat and for milk supplied to the creameries, we charge our own consumers 3½d. more for a 2 lb. loaf, flour having increased by 70 per cent. and butter by 7d. per lb.</P>
    <P>These facts undoubtedly compelled the Government to introduce the increase of 2/6 in old age, widows' and blind pensions.  Evidently the Minister and his colleagues in Government consider that the increase in the cost of living justifies this increase in pensions. The Minister for Social Welfare must have approved of it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should advise the Minister for Social Welfare to instruct the officials of his Department not to take the incidence of this increase into consideration in connection with the granting of home assistance.  When a Minister has approved an increase, his officials should not try to whittle down the benefit of that increase by reducing home assistance.  The fear that that may happen now is disturbing a number of possible recipients.  There can be, in my opinion, no justification for such reduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement referred to the fact that there is agreement on both sides of the House that taxation should be levied on expenditure rather than on income.  Very often there is a slender balance between the level at which revenue can be maintained, or increased, and the rate at which it will depress production. Any easement, therefore, in the burden of taxation must undoubtedly stimulate production and, at the same time, act as an incentive.  The heavy rate of taxation here has been a deterrent to further expansion.  Many foreigners who come in here with the object of establishing industries are deterred from doing so because of the high rate of taxation.  It is important, then, that taxation should be maintained at a stable level over as many commodities as possible at the same time and for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>The very sharp drop to which I referred earlier in the case of distilling is an indication that, once penal taxes are imposed, the effect is very far-reaching. Improvement is slow, and very often long delayed.  It is desirable from every point of view that taxation <Col N="715" /> should be maintained at a stable level because nothing is more conducive to economic expansion than stable marketing conditions and stable taxation. Violent fluctuations act as a deterrent and cause not merely dislocation in industry generally but also frighten off those who might otherwise be induced to come in here to establish new industries.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Budget.  In my experience it has been received with approbation throughout my constituency.  In two years the Minister has succeeded in restoring stability, confidence and prosperity to the country.  Compare March and April of 1957 with March and April of this year.  We, in Fianna Fáil, have a good deal of which to be proud.  We have taken the country out of the economic mess in which we found it two years ago.  Credit is available for those who wish to establish industries. Credit is also available for farmers. Considerable sums have been put at the disposal of the Industrial Credit Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation respectively.  Credit for housing is also available as compared with two years ago when our building trade had collapsed.</P>
      <P>The reliefs given in the Budget are very welcome.  Pensions have been increased. Certain relief has been given to the greyhound industry.  Certain relief has also been given to the cinemas. All these prove that prosperity is abroad today.  I hope that trend will continue.  The Minister deserves to be warmly congratulated on doing a very good job of work for the nation.  I fear however that some of the industrialists whom we have helped and protected over the years are not playing their part.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the economic side of our economy. Fianna Fáil has succeeded in giving 100 per cent. protection to all our industries and has helped them in every possible way.  We have done everything possible as a Party to give employment within the nation.  We succeeded in reviving old industries and starting new industries.  We did everything possible and our general policy was not to import one pound's worth of goods that we could produce here.  Now we have reached saturation point with certain products and, from the national economic point of view, unless we can get into the export market to a greater extent we cannot succeed in giving more employment to our people.  I do not see that any good will come from short term policies for unproductive schemes which would not keep our people in constant employment. Schemes of that character would perhaps provide employment for them only for one week and let them go the next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole have tried <Col N="717" /> to encourage industrialists to avail of the export market.  They have given tax reliefs and special insurance schemes.  They have instructed our diplomatic and trade representatives abroad to assist them in every way possible.  Any industrialist going into the export market has received special encouragement by loans at reasonable rates.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker spoke of the by-products of agriculture.  We are all anxious to see that agriculture and its by-products get priority and they have got priority down through the years. However, we must be deeply concerned when we compare certain by-products of agriculture with the by-products in a small country across the water, that is, Scotland.  I am dealing with a very hackneyed subject on which I have spoken on many occasions, the export of whiskey.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an appeal here to those engaged in the whiskey trade. They have a golden opportunity to come together.  Governments cannot do everything; the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot do everything.  In a democratic State, all they can do is give advice and encouragement.  If schemes are put up to help a company or a group of companies, we can be assured that every assistance will be given, as far as the resources of the State allow it.  However, I am totally dissatisfied with the fact that our whiskey distillers have not succeeded in selling more whiskey.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with this solely as a by-product of agriculture. I am disappointed that those producing it are not making a better job of it, bearing in mind the way the Scottish whiskey distillers have achieved success in their endeavours. However, I have dealt with that matter often before.  I merely point out now that we are a very long way behind. As regards our main exportable goods, agricultural by-products or industrial products, any help for the export trade, from whatever section that help comes, <Col N="718" /> will be welcomed by everybody in the country and by posterity also.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned last week, I had just commenced to deal with a few matters relating to prisons.  The amount of useful and valuable work performed by the prison staffs is something which I feel should be given a little more State recognition.  The staffs of the various prisons have an extremely difficult job.  Their job would be impossible if they had not the co-operation of the prisoners. Generally speaking, the prison staffs are made up of men of very great ability, with a very high standard of education, who realise they have a very great national duty to perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder has the attention of the Minister been directed to the duties performed by the prison officers day after day, enclosed as they are in the prisons practically to the same extent as prisoners?  In addition to the services they have to render to their superior officers, they must endeavour <Col N="719" /> by their example, by their words and their methods of teaching, to put the prisoners back on right and proper lines in life.</P>
    <P>A good deal could be done, and it would be unreasonable and unfair on my part if I did not admit that a lot has been done in recent years, in endeavouring to avoid embittering the prisoner against life and in the endeavours to give him some hope so that when his sentence has expired, he will go out of the prison a better man than when he went in.</P>
    <P>I hope it is in order to refer to a gentleman who is now in retirement&mdash; the Governor of Portlaoise Prison, Major Barrows.  It was interesting to see the volume of correspondence which he received from time to time from ex-prisoners, expressing their gratitude and their thanks, and letting him know how they were getting on in the outside world.  Men who spend anything from three to ten years in prison cannot be compared with those imprisoned in Mountjoy for a period of a fortnight to six months. Even in short-term prisons such as Mountjoy, an effort should be made by example and method, if possible, to change the mind and the outlook of the prisoner.  That is not an easy job; it is indeed a rather difficult job. It is one that is comparatively easy in a prison where long sentences are being served.  I am glad to say, it is realised by the majority of those engaged in the work that their efforts should be aimed towards directing the prisoner, so that when he leaves, he will not feel an outcast in the world. While he is behind the grey walls of the prison, he should be equipped with a trade, with a better understanding of good citizenship, and with a better education, if possible.  His detention in prison should not be for the purpose of punishment, but should be a term in which he will be given the necessary facilities to look into and examine his life and to examine his attitude towards his fellow men.</P>
    <P>In prisons where long-term sentences are served, efforts should be made to introduce reforms to rehabilitate the prisoner so that when his sentence has expired, he will be a better <Col N="720" /> citizen.  There should be evening classes in drama and first-aid because it is very important that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to improve the character of a person in prison for a long number of years. Apart from drama classes and the exercise available to the prisoner in very limited prison space, he should get a thorough instruction in first-aid. In addition to that, all kinds of literature, on whatever subjects the prisoner may choose, should be made available and he should be given whatever time he may desire for the study of those subjects.</P>
    <P>Sufficient stationery should always be available for him if he desires to undertake a course in mathematics, or if he wishes to refresh his mind on arithmetic, or whatever line of study or thought he may desire to follow up.  Much good could be done, if a large measure of cooperation existed between the trade unions and the Department of Justice in that regard. There are competent tradesmen in the prison service and if a certain amount of cooperation with the trade unions existed, a young prisoner who has unfortunately to serve a long sentence, should be given an opportunity of being apprenticed to the prison tradesmen, whether carpenters, bricklayers, electricians or plumbers.  I hope in saying that, I am not treading unduly on the toes of the trade unions.</P>
    <P>When a man enters prison, he should not be looked upon as a complete outcast.  As St. Thomas Aquinas said when an unfortunate sinner was being carried through the streets: &ldquo;There, but for the grace of God, go I.&rdquo;  Credit is due to Deputy Everett and Deputy MacEoin as former Ministers for Justice, and to the present Minister, in that in the past 15 or 20 years, conditions have improved immensely in an attempt to make the prisoner a better man.  That is a line of action which should not be changed.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to the debate, Deputy Dillon dealt with juvenile crime.  It is most unfortunate that young children should find themselves in the grip of the law so early in their lives.  That is probably due to lack of control on the part of parents, or to <Col N="721" /> bad company, or perhaps to a little wildness or some wild strain there may be in a child who is not properly controlled. In my opinion, before those children are sentenced they should be medically examined, and whatever treatment is prescribed as a result of such examination, should be carried out.  The Department of Justice should be slow to put the stigma of imprisonment on the character of such children who may only be wild.  We know they do strange and wild things, but which one of us did not do something extraordinary or wild when we were young? We were fortunate in that we escaped falling foul of the law.</P>
    <P>When children are committed to an institution the officers responsible for them are endeavouring not to punish them but to educate and sympathise with them.  If a man gets a term of imprisonment or if a child is sent to an industrial school it is sympathy and attention he requires and I am glad to say that the outlook in the prisons and in these industrial schools has changed for the better in this respect.  I hope that will be encouraged by the Minister and that the officers in charge will be given proper pay in recognition of their services.</P>
    <P>The prison officers have a thankless job.  It is a great calling for the man who likes his job and takes an interest in the prisoners, but these officers are underpaid.  I would ask the Minister to examine this question during the coming financial year and to arrive at a new scale whereby there will be substantial increases in pay for prison officers.  I am not making that plea because of the large number of prison officers who reside in my constituency but in respect of all the prison officers throughout the country.  They have a very difficult job and it is not every man who is fitted to spend his life in the prison service.  I hope that grievance, which has been outlined by the Prison Officers' Association and referred to at a recent annual conference, will be remedied by the Minister.</P>
    <P>An effort should also be made to provide houses for prison officers.  A number of houses are already provided for them in Portlaoise but all of them ought to be provided with a residence. I do not know how many prison <Col N="722" /> residences were erected under native Government.  I presume all the prison houses erected in Portlaoise and at Mountjoy were erected when the British were in control in this country. Married prison attendants, especially the younger men who came into the service in recent years, ought not to be put in the embarrassing position of having to seek houses from the local authority.  The provision of houses for all prison officers would mean that the houses they already occupy would be available for persons who fall within the category normally housed by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to provide houses for the Garda.  The numbers of the Garda have been cut down very much in the past few years.  Whether it was the policy of the last Government or is the policy of this Government, it is unwise.  However, I shall deal with that later.  The question of housing for the Garda has been brought up in this House on more than one occasion.  A number of Garda barracks have been erected throughout the country but these barracks have living accommodation only for the sergeant and his family.  It is humiliating that a Garda should have to go from street to street looking for a vacant flat or room.  Where you have five or six members of the force attached to a station, a site should be acquired by the Office of Public Works, and the Minister for Justice ought to make the necessary provision for the building of these houses on the one site. If separate sites were to be made available there would be legal costs involved in connection with the transfer of the sites, the title, and so on. Therefore, an effort should be made to acquire a site to build a number of houses according to the Garda strength in the district.</P>
    <P>A substantial sum of money is already paid out in rent allowances to the Garda but it would be wiser to put that money towards building decent houses for them.  It would not be a great strain on the Exchequer.  A Garda, as an officer of the law, is to be respected as such.  He must maintain a certain amount of independence and dignity which he cannot maintain if he is living in the corner of some <Col N="723" /> other person's room, if he has to seek permission to have his pram carried up the stairs or to have the back door of the flat opened to gain exit or entry. We are too long tinkering with this problem.  No section of the taxpayers would grudge proper housing accommodation to the men who safeguard our lives and property, protection which is more than ever necessary at the present time.</P>
    <P>The programme in respect of new Garda barracks has progressed very much but it is far from being complete. Throughout the country there are a number of disgraceful old shacks unworthy to be called Garda barracks. Many of them are unsafe and unfit for habitation and the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, should present the Minister with proposals for an entirely new scheme of Garda barracks where required.  I referred in the last day's debate to the remote country districts and I do not desire to repeat my remarks.  However, I wish to refer to rural districts where Garda stations have closed and where Gardaí have had to leave because of the lack of accommodation.  New Garda stations ought to be erected.</P>
    <P>The present Minister, or some Minister for Justice in the future, will have to meet the Minister for Finance when the right time comes to deal with all these problems.  Matters are so complicated and so knotted with red tape that it is not possible to do all one would like to see done in a short space of time.  Nevertheless, a start must be made and I know the Minister for Justice is one who would like to see all these things accomplished. The question arises as to the money with which to do this work and there is little use in tinkering with this Estimate.  We want to do the job right, provide the money, get the money and spend the money and give at least a measure of comfort to people we expect a return from, to people in that line.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the policy of closing Garda stations.  That policy is asking for trouble and inviting crime. To close down Garda stations in wild remote areas is wrong.  It might not <Col N="724" /> be too difficult to close down Garda stations where you think you have law and order established&mdash;but how was it established?  Was it not established because the Gardaí were there and were available and were conscientious men who did their duty without fear or favour?</P>
    <P>It is only when the Gardaí are gone &mdash;it is like mice playing when the cat is away&mdash;that you will see an inclination to crime.  It will be in a small and petty way at first but it will lead to bigger things.  The new policy places too much confidence and reliance on a public spirit that is not there to the great extent we may think it is.  One or two disturbers can be responsible for the loss of the good name of a community.  This is bad policy.  It is unsound and unwise and in the long run, it will tell a sad tale.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Justice in relation to the pay of members of the Garda.  It seems strange and extraordinary that there are so many inspectors, superintendents and chief superintendents.  If there is to be a pruning or cutting-down, why cut down on the men? There is the same number of superintendents and chief superintendents now as when the force was 1,500 strong.</P>
    <P>A superintendent is in charge of so many stations.  Right over him again is a chief superintendent and there are a number of chief superintendents in every area, whether they are grouped counties or otherwise.  Is there anything the chief superintendent does that the superintendent cannot do?  I have not been told whether or not there is, but, to the ordinary man in the street, it seems extraordinary that there are so many chief superintendents and superintendents. Has a chief superintendent any additional duties to do which the superintendent cannot carry out?  It seems that the higher up you are in the Garda, the less you have to do.  Everybody is looking at the ordinary Garda and inspecting him.  People expect to see him on duty.  His crime and evidence book must be written up; his patrol book must be written up; his duty book must be written up.  He has <Col N="725" /> the sergeant and the inspector and the superintendent and the chief superintendent keeping an eye on him.</P>
    <P>What are the duties of a Garda particularly in relation to the extraordinary salary he is getting?  I am not casting a reflection on any chief superintendent; I am referring to the amount of work the men do and the sergeants do&mdash;I do not know exactly where the inspectors come in&mdash;and I should be interested to have a clear picture of the Garda.  It falls to my lot to attend the district court and the circuit court.  I am not in any way connected with the legal profession.  I have escaped that catastrophe.  However, I often have to attend court in another capacity. Some months the superintendent is there, while other months the inspector is there.  What is the difference between the inspector and the superintendent?</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the records and information, I should like to know how many inspectors there are in the Garda and also how many superintendens and how many chief superintendents. I think we have 26 chief superintendents.  I do not know in what way the Dublin Metropolitan District is divided but in the country it seems ridiculous.  We should leave the existing chief superintendents as they are.  They all did their job. Most of them came from the bottom of the ladder.</P>
    <P>I love to meet and talk with the old member of the Garda who joined in 1923 and 1924.  He can tell the stories and he knows the job.  He is the old-timer who came up the hard way and built up the police force we have to-day.  When he retired, he was not fully rewarded either in pension or gratuity.  These old-timers in the Garda were great men and are great men even to this day.  I hope the younger members of the force will take a leaf out of the old-timers' book. I should like to know from the Minister why arrangements have not been made with regard to the old-timers&mdash; the first men.  There are not very many of them left in the force because the past three or four years have weeded out a number of them.  They have a good record of proud work <Col N="726" /> behind them and I hope the younger men in the force will follow in their footsteps.</P>
    <P>The 1923 and 1924 men who joined the Garda and who had the difficult job of establishing law and order should be given some special recognition, as the first members of the force, now that they are ending their days in retirement, some of them beyond the sea, as many of them sought work when they retired from the force because their pensions were not sufficient.  Many of them had their family difficulties and family responsibilities and it was not easy for them to get along when they retired. In view of the very limited number of such men, I think we ought to do something about it.</P>
    <P>When the existing chief superintendents retire or die, I suggest there ought be no further appointments; that is an expression of opinion.  Unless the Minister for Justice has some extraordinary reason for continuing the grade of chief superintendent, the taxpayer and the ordinary Garda do not see the necessity for the grade of superintendent and chief superintendent at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Department would be well advised not to cut down on the number of Gardaí and not to close Garda stations. If there is to be a reduction in the numbers in the force, I suggest the Department should begin at the top. When the present chief superintendents retire, pay them well, give them proper recognition, give them a pension which will enable them to complete their days in contentment and happiness but do not make any appointments in their place.  If we want to economise, let us save where saving will have the least possible adverse effect on the community.  One way in which we can save is to cut down unnecessary appointments&mdash;and we have quite a number of them in the Garda and the Garda services.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to the plain clothes force, beyond saying that their job is even more difficult still.  It takes a different type of man&mdash;a man of a certain standard of education with a liking for the police force and police work&mdash; to undertake the plain clothes side of <Col N="727" /> the business.  I do not think they, either, are sufficiently paid.</P>
    <P>I do not feel obliged on this occasion to refer in detail to the transport section of the Garda but I do want to say that the officers of that section are as fine a type of men as are to be found in any part of this country and are not paid in relation to the amount of work they have to do in driving patrol cars or being in charge of State cars.  No man ought to know better than the present Minister for Justice the valuable contribution made by the members of the transport section to this State down through the years.  These men are prepared to stay out all night, to sit long hours and even days waiting. They have to care for the cars and know the mechanics and movements of the cars.  They have to live up to a standard even higher than that which the ordinary Guard has to observe. For those reasons I would ask that special attention and consideration be given to these men.</P>
    <P>I would be the least worthy person to comment in any way on the courts and I shall not comment on them in any way.  It is nearly time a change was made with regard to the titles of justices and judges.  We have reached the stage when we all have respect for the law and for the men administering the law and this business of addressing &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo; and saying &ldquo;If it please your Lordship&rdquo;, &ldquo;If it please your Worship&rdquo;, and so on, should be eliminated. This form of address, &ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo;, and appealing to &ldquo;His Honour&rdquo; and asking &ldquo;His Lordship&rdquo; to consider this, that and the other, came to us from the British and even though we are now trying to adopt the British system of election, a matter which does not come within the scope of this Estimate, we might be well advised to drop the British system of titles for judges and justices.  We can have honourable judges, we can have plain, understanding judges and we can have the judge who is steeped in snobbery. It is rather degrading for any Irish professional man or citizen to have to bend his head or his knee in court and address his fellow citizen as &ldquo;Your Worship,&rdquo;&ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo;, <Col N="728" />&ldquo;Your Honour&rdquo; and ask if it pleases him to consider this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>We know that there must be some distinction drawn between the courthouse caretaker and the judge but the use of these forms of address is carried too far.  It is high time that there was an investigation into the manner of addressing High Court judges, Circuit Court judges and other judges, particularly the snobbish type who love to hear themselves so addressed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer, if I may, to a matter in connection with judges and justices for which the Minister has responsibility, namely, the question referred to by the Parish Priest of Kilnamona, County Clare, at the Christus Rex Congress, of political pull in law appointments.  It is extraordinary that although for other public appointments there is an interview board, examination papers and a certain code of regulations, when it comes to the appointment of a judge or justice, whatever Party is in power appoints the favourite.  I want to refer, if I may, to the statement made by Father Cosgrave that the appointment of judges and district justices is in itself an injustice because they are chosen by political patronage.  Surely we have reached the stage where a man ought to be considered, apart from his political outlook and belief, on merit. Every political party maintain that their man was appointed on merit and that, on merit, their man was entitled to the vacancy.  We have known cases in which former members of this House were appointed as district justices, not because of their qualifications for the Bench, but because of the fact that they were members of this House, honourable members, and <Col N="729" /> equally honourable members of the Bench, I am sure.</P>

      <P>We shall try it on that but we shall not get away with it on that either.  Nevertheless, the whole position of appointing justices and judges, in plain language, has a strange smell and the fact that the President's name is linked up with the matter does not make it any cleaner.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one other problem before I leave the Garda.  I want to refer to a new ruling which has been made, whether with the Minister's approval or not I do not know.  It is the question of preventing members of the Dublin Metropolitan Selection Committee from having special leave to attend meetings to discuss their own affairs.  I think it is unconstitutional to prevent members of the Garda from meeting to discuss their own affairs and their own standard of living.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that the Dublin Gardaí bitterly resent a decision made by the Commissioner which, they say, will prevent them, or seriously hamper them, from holding these meetings.  Assistant Commissioner Francis Burke, in a letter says that the members of the committee must not be given leave of absence to go to their meetings.  I think that is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a matter for the Commissioner but I think it is wrong and unreasonable and something which the Minister for Justice should bring to the notice of the Government.  It is something which he should not allow the Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner is vested with statutory authority to deal with matters pertaining to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to commit himself one way or the other; he is an honourable man&mdash;and I want it to go on record that I said he is an honourable man&mdash; but I want to ask him is it fair to prevent the members of the Selection Committee attending meetings?  They can attend meetings during monthly or annual leave but they will not all be on monthly or annual leave together, therefore they can never have a meeting to appeal to their representative body to improve their conditions.</P>
      <P>Surely the Garda cannot be trampled upon in that way.  There must be someone here who can air this matter in this House.  They should not be trampled upon in this manner.  I am sure the letter has been written without consultation with the Minister for Justice, but whoever wrote the letter&mdash; it is written on the instructions of the Commissioner, as the Assistant Commissioner did not take it on himself to write it&mdash;I politely tell him that it is wrong to prevent Guards from meeting to discuss their problems and he will not get away with it.  I think if the Guards are to be trampled on in this way every Guard in the country should protest.  There are young men in the force now who are not going to be trampled on in the same way the old timers were.  The old timers were too honourable and too law abiding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To stop the Guards from discussing their own problems, from meeting to discuss matters which affect their lives and those of their families and to deal with their own work and general standard <Col N="733" /> of conduct, is wrong.  The permission to have meetings during their monthly or annual leave makes sure they can never have a meeting because they will not be all on leave together. For the Minister to state that he has no say in the matter is something which may be believed by the Deputies&mdash; realising Parliamentary procedure and realising that any Minister can be tied up with red tape&mdash;but the Guards themselves will not believe it.  I think it would be better to have the Garda Representative Body meet the Minister occasionally as it did, but if any committee which appoints representatives to the Gárda Representative Body is to be denied the right to meet, surely it would not be unreasonable for the Minister for Justice to talk to the Commissioner and to say to him: &ldquo;Give them two hours off or four hours, or give them half a day off.  They are dealing with their own work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If a Deputy has a committee meeting to attend in Room 106, or anywhere else, he is not expected to be here, and I think in the case of the Guards they should not be prevented from holding their meetings.  This high-handed act is looked at distastefully by every Guard throughout the country.  I suppose if it had not been for the amount of publicity given to it in the newspapers this matter could not have been raised here to-day.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter sympathetically and not to be too lenient so far as the Commissioner is concerned because it is not the Commissioner we want to please but the Guards in order to have a contented police force.  A contented police force is required to safeguard life and property.  You cannot have that protection if you have a disgruntled police force.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, therefore, to get the Commissioner to lift this ruling which is resented by the Guards and to allow them to attend their meetings whenever they like.  The selection committee in the Dublin Metropolitan district is not going to meet every week.  It would not be unreasonable to give the members a half-day's special leave to attend those meetings.  It is not the whole force <Col N="734" /> that attends the meetings but merely a few who are appointed by the rank and file.  To prevent them from doing so will lead to discontent and unrest in the force and we want to avoid that.  Deputies on this side of the House are as anxious to avoid such a state of affairs as the Minister is.  I raise this point in the most friendly spirit; not for the purpose of criticising the Minister but for the purpose of criticising an unjust order.  I do not want to criticise the Garda Commissioner.  I do not know whether the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would allow me to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would finally ask the Minister for Justice, now that I am leaving that point, to take this up with whoever issued it in his name or on his behalf, and make arrangements to allow the Guards to meet. That is all I want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the question of the unsolved murders.  A good deal of uneasiness prevails throughout the <Col N="736" /> country as a result of the many murders which remain unsolved.  Many queer rumours are in circulation that I do not want to mention here this evening.  The Minister ought to give the House and the country more information in this regard.  It seems to be a most extraordinary state of affairs that, in one of the big towns, at 9 o'clock at night, a man should be murdered in his shop and from that day to this no suspect has been thought of in the minds of the Guards.  It seemed a more extraordinary situation still that a farmer, after disposing of his livestock at a fair, should be brutally murdered and from that day to this no one has been arrested in connection with that crime. That does not reflect credit on the Garda, but that does not say that the Garda are to blame.  I am reliably informed that down the country, where these investigations are being carried out, certain officers of the Garda in Dublin are given instructions from the top which are driving the men on the spot from following up the clues that would lead to a successful capture.  I made an offer to the Minister.  I wrote to him on this, as I do not live too far away from where some of these crimes were committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe you did them yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that to Deputy Haughey's friends.  I have very clean hands in that respect. I will leave it to his friends, and he does not have to go outside a very wide circle.  It seems to the men on the spot who are carrying out investigations that the instructions which come from the top do not tally with local knowledge and local conditions. I wrote to the Minister for Justice on this&mdash;a long letter.  I venture to say that there is one superintendent serving in the Garda, well known for detection of crime, well known as one of the brightest police officers, not only in Ireland but in Europe; and if the Minister for Justice and the Commissioner had a discussion on these unsolved murders and, even though it might be outside Garda regulations to put a superintendent in another <Col N="737" /> superintendent's district, if they would say: &ldquo;Here are the files connected with that crime, investigate it and see what result you can get,&rdquo; I would be prepared, and am prepared, to give the Minister for Justice the name of the superintendent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who would be prepared, if asked, I am sure, to undertake thorough investigations in any of these areas.  From the amount of confidence which the general public have always displayed in the detection of crime under the same superintendent, I venture to say that before long there would be some results.  I am very sorry to say that the amount of criticism and uneasiness amongst the general public in this regard is not without foundation.  If I may accuse the Minister for Justice, directly or indirectly, there seems to be a certain amount of misguidance which is coming from Dublin, not from the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister another question in connection with these murders.  Has capital punishment been abolished in this country?  Are there to be no more hangings for murders here?  Will the Minister make a complete statement, in order that this House and the country may know the position exactly?</P>

I am talking about highway robbery and brutal murder, cold-blooded murder, that we have seen in the case of Wexford, in the case of the Cratloe farmer and in the case in County Kerry.  The people must be protected from robberies. One has only to take up the daily newspapers covering Deputy Haughey's constituency and one sees that all over Dublin terrible robberies are taking place.  Shop windows are being smashed and the contents grabbed.  A betting office was raided yesterday and ransacked and a certain amount of money taken out of it.

I know Deputy Haughey and members of his family maybe a little too well to say the things I might be provoked to say but, if I say them in the course of the debate, no matter how hurtful they may be, I hope Deputy Haughey will accept them in the spirit in which I accept the ugly remarks he made now.

      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Justice before the Deputy over there got angry.  I asked was hanging for murder stopped in this country.  It was an ordinary straight question and it is a question the Minister ought not get alarmed about.  What another <Col N="741" /> Government would do is beside the point; we are dealing with the Government in office now.  I am afraid murders have now reached such a stage in this country that we must take the necessary steps to prevent them.  I am not going to advocate that a man guilty of cold-blooded murder and robbery should not be hanged.  If the courts of this country decide on a certain procedure, I want to know what reasons the Government have for overriding the decisions of the court in those cases.  They have the right to do so but we shall find ourselves in an extraordinary position if this is allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>There have been more murders in this country than good, honourable citizens care to think about, and the Government have a duty in that respect. They must be put down and they must be stopped.  The Guards must get help, the courts must get encouragement and, therefore, it is up to the Government to review the whole situation.  Life is important. People have only one life to live and it is difficult enough for them to live it well and in some security, without their having to fear&mdash;an old man or woman, an old age pensioner or blind person&mdash;going to bed in their own houses, in the safety of the four walls of their homes.  I think it speaks badly for protection and for public spirit, and this situation ought not be allowed to worsen.  Murder must be punished; robbery must be punished, and must be stopped.</P>

      <P>The growth of the activities of &ldquo;teddy boys&rdquo; is due, in my opinion, mainly to the unemployment problem that exists in this city and elsewhere.  I feel that there have been disorderly movements and disorderly organisations that even the Garda themselves are afraid to attempt to disperse.  On how many occasions did we hear of Guards being beaten up by ordinary civilians and I am sorry to say, while I do not want to criticise the judiciary again, those responsible did not get sufficient jail sentences.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for law and order and he should take steps to see that rowdyism and hooliganism are stopped.  That is part of his job and that is what we expect from the Department of Justice.  There is any amount of law in this country.  There are heaps of law, reams of law, but there does not seem to be as much justice.  If I may, I want to enlighten the Minister about some of the hooliganism that is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His attention had been directed to the fact that a monument erected in county Louth was maliciously damaged and destroyed.  There was a statue of Seán Russell erected at Fairview, Dublin, which was first smeared with tar and oil.  It was then painted green and finally, on the third occasion, the right arm was broken off from the elbow.  There was a Celtic Cross in the Republican Plot in Dundalk Cemetery also damaged.  In Deputy Moloney's constituency, a memorial to the late Charlie Kerins, God rest him, was destroyed and another in the Republican Plot at Cahirciveen was destroyed.  In the Phoenix Park, there was a monument of General Gough and that also was blown up.  People may have their own views about those things, whether they ought to be blown up or not, but, if anyone is to blow them up, <Col N="743" /> it ought not to be hooligans, &ldquo;teddy boys&rdquo; and scoundrels out to raise disturbances.  Memorials have been destroyed in many places.  Cemeteries have been entered and tombstones damaged and this has been taking place for a number of years.  Somebody is responsible for that but we do not see anybody being caught and put in jail.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of indifference to me whether it is a memorial in my own constituency erected in a Republican plot, or one to the men who died in the 1914-1918 War.  There were many of them, highly honoured and respected in my constituency, and we take off our hats to the men who died in the 1914-18 War as we take our hats off to the men who died on all sides from 1916 to 1922.  It is disgraceful to think that in 1959 there are hooligans in this country who would try to belittle the dead by pulling down the memorials erected in their honour, endeavouring to blow them up with illegally obtained explosives&mdash;and that includes the Gough Monument and any other monument.  The activities of such hooligans are no great credit to a country where law, order and justice are supposed to prevail.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to circularise the Guards in order to look for the support of the general public and to ask every citizen who stands for law and order to see to it that whoever is responsible for explosions, for wrecking memorials and for attempting to plunder graveyards should be punished with the full rigour of the law. An effort should be made to stop that conduct, once and for all.  I am sorry that there has been reason to complain in that respect, but the reasons are well founded.  Recently there was a meeting of the National Graves Association in Dublin and the chairman made reference to the matter.  We used to have and still have, a lot of people who loved to see Nelson in O'Connell Street, Gough on his pedestal in the Park and all the other memorials. These memorials have been there long enough and I do not see why they <Col N="744" /> should be disturbed by hooligans now. I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps to see that this kind of conduct will be ended.  These people all had to die the same way and face the same God.  The same respect should be given to the dead who died for one cause as to the dead who died for another cause.</P>
    <P>It is all right to appeal to people to lock their windows, safeguard their skylights and lock and bolt their doors, but if a robber wants to enter a premises, a skylight, a window or a locked door will not stop him.  It is all right to appeal to the general public for co-operation in that regard, but it is a difficult thing to get.  It is extremely difficult for a business man not living over his premises to be on watch all the time.  If there is a cutting down on the Guards, you will not have enough Guards to keep an eye&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There have been so many robberies over the week end that it is sufficient evidence to justify taking some steps to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come now to accidents.  It is no wonder the general public are alarmed at the number of fatal accidents that have taken place, particularly in recent years.  We know that until the end of time accidents will happen, but the number of people who have lost their lives through accidents in recent years is alarming. Again, I am not blaming the Minister for those accidents.  I want to direct attention to views expressed to me by members of the general public.  Every Deputy is alarmed at the situation, and I know that no person is more anxious to try to rectify the deplorable position than the Minister.  I think it is true to say that almost 50 per cent. of the accidents are brought about by drunken drivers.  In his own way, the drunken driver is a murderer on the roads.  Steps will have to be taken to clear the roads of drunken drivers.  If necessary, the Guards should be given <Col N="745" /> more powers to deal with the menace of the drunken driver.  The Minister should make his views known to the Courts that those under the influence of drink who drive motor cars should get long jail sentences, that during his term of imprisonment that person should not be allowed see a cork, and that, when he comes out of jail, his licence should be taken from him, no matter what the circumstances are.</P>
    <P>In most cases where a drunken driver was responsible for an accident and there was loss of life, the drunken driver probably escaped himself and the sober person lost his or her life. The drunken driver is one of the greatest menaces we have today.  One would imagine that as a result of the statements made by the Minister, statements in this House and examples made in the Courts, the number of drunken drivers would be growing less, but there are more drunken drivers on the road today than ever.  I do not want to go into the question of the cutting down on Guards, but it leads back to that again.  If the Guards are not there to deal with the drunken driver, who will deal with him?  You will not get a sufficient number of public-spirited citizens to come forward and say: &ldquo;That man is drunk; he should be brought before a doctor and examined,&rdquo; and I am sorry to say that in many cases, before a doctor is found, he is cold sober.  The evidence of the Guards ought to be sufficient. A Guard has a responsible job; he knows a sober man from a drunken man, as we all do.</P>
    <P>I do not want to anticipate or criticise the decisions of district justices and judges, but is it unreasonable to ask the Minister for Justice to make known his views in future to the Judiciary, whether it be the district justice or the circuit judge?  While we know the courts are independent, the Minister should ask them to impose the severest possible sentences on drunken drivers; and it will then be up to the Minister to see that they never get their licences back.</P>

      <P>Accidents occur when people are sober.  Where such accidents occur, I am convinced that they are due either to carelessness or to overspeeding.  In cases in which cyclists have been killed, subsequent examination of the bicycles has revealed a complete absence of brakes, and other defects.  Lorries parked on main roads at night have caused accidents.  I suggest the Ministers should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and ask him to circularise local authorities, instructing them to provide lay-bys on main roads so that lorry drivers, travelling long distances from Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Sligo and so on, will have some place to pull in when they are tired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, a number of fatal accidents have occurred through private cars driving into the rear of lorries parked at night.  There were two on the Dublin-Carlow road.  In one in which there was a survivor, the evidence was that the survivor was looking out but never saw the rear of the lorry parked on the road.  Parking on the main roads should be prohibited. No county council will object to providing lay-bys.  They are urgently necessary to-day because of the tremendous increase in the volume of heavy lorry traffic on our main roads.  One accident involved <Col N="747" /> the death of a man, completely sober, who was driving his children home from school for their mid-term holidays round Hallow Eve.  He drove into a lorry parked on the road and he and the other occupants of the car were killed outright.  That accident was due not to drink but to carelessness in the parking of a lorry on the side of a main road.</P>
    <P>Facilities must be provided for parking at night and money should be made available from the Road Fund for that purpose.  I know the Minister has no responsibility for the Road Fund, but he might usefully consult his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in regard to the suggestion I have made.  If even one fatal accident is avoided by the provision of lay-bys, it will spell an improvement in the present situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that driving tests would be any advantage.  A bad driver will be a bad driver, irrespective of who his coach is.  A good driver will be a good driver because he will be cautious and careful all the time.  I see people driving in this city and it is due to the mercy of Providence that they are not killed.  I saw an old lady recently of 75 to 80 years of age driving a Morris Minor in the city.  I was convinced she would not reach her destination without killing somebody.  I thought it disgraceful that such an old lady should be in charge of a motor car.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a fair judge of a good, hardy old lady's age. I would say she was nearer 80 than 70. Perhaps there is something to be said for tests, but there are better drivers on the road than some of the people who are teaching others to drive.  I am as careful a night driver as the next. Like most country Deputies, I am on the road all hours of the night.  It is my experience that drivers will not dim their lights.  There are certain motorists who have no regard whatever for the on-coming driver.  The Gardaí should be empowered to examine cars <Col N="748" /> and see that the dimming devices are functioning.  Accidents have happened because drivers have been dazzled, due to the failure of inconsiderate motorists to dim.  The Safety First people have done a good deal to inculcate good manners in driving and possibly more lives would have been lost, were it not for their efforts.  Some lorries are equipped with a spotlight and the drivers of these are never happy unless they have the spotlight on full power. Steps will have to be taken by some competent authority to ensure good manners and consideration on our roads.</P>
      <P>With regard to parking, the Garda have a very difficult job.  I have often found myself in conflict with authority over parking.  I have told the Garda that I am going into a shop merely for five or ten minutes, and I have never found any member of the force unreasonable. The trouble is that, if one stops, the next says he has an equal right.  That is how parking regulations go by the board ultimately.  Motorists will have to be educated.  There is an organisation&mdash;the Motorists' Association&mdash;which has done a great deal of good.</P>
      <P>An effort must be made to educate motorists themselves to bring home to them the necessity for care and caution and consideration for other users of the roads.  No matter how good or strict the Guards may be or how serious the decisions of the Courts may be, unless the drivers are sufficiently public-spirited to co-operate in exercising care and caution we might as well whistle jigs to tombstones as to make appeals in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be any restriction on the issue of driving licences&mdash;I do not want to anticipate the Minister's decision&mdash;there should be a question on the application form: Do you drink?  I am bitterly and determinedly opposed to drunken driving; I hope that sometime sufficient action will be taken against drunken drivers and that, it will be so sweeping and severe that the menace of drunken driving will be completely eliminated&mdash;if necessary by revolutionary means.  The Minister will have the backing of the general <Col N="749" /> public in putting drunken drivers off the road and keeping them off.</P>
    <P>I am far from being a killjoy.  I admire a man who can take and enjoy a drink but the man to whom I refer is the man who can hardly walk but yet wants to display to everybody his skill as a driver and when practically &ldquo;in the horrors&rdquo; gets into a car and drives off.  The Garda have done good work in dealing with some of them and I hope they will devote all their energies throughout the country to capturing drunken drivers, making an example of them and putting them off the roads.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with the amount of duties imposed on the Garda but, if I may, I want to ask the Minister for Justice and the House, is it not the primary duty of a Gárda to administer the law as he finds it and do his duty in accordance with the instructions of his station sergeant?  Does the Minister not think that it is a little unreasonable to expect the Garda to carry out school attendance duties?  To administer the School Attendance Acts in certain parts of the country occupies the full attention of a Gárda.  In other cases, he has to deal with weights and measures and the Food and Drugs Act. He must go around after milk cars with a little can taking a sample of milk.  He has farm statistics to deal with.  He must go out with his bicycle and big ledger asking the farmers: &ldquo;How many acres of this and that did you sow?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should all those additional duties be piled on to the Garda?  I could never understand why the local authority could not enforce school attendance, look after weights and measures, and the Food and Drugs Act, and why the County Committee of Agriculture could not take proper statistics of crops grown in the district. A Garda has the important duties of protecting life and property, doing patrol work, detecting crime, and keeping various Garda records.  I think he is asked to do too much. Instead of looking after drunken drivers, detecting robberies and protecting life and property he is asked to go after the boy who does not go <Col N="750" /> to school and catch the fellow who has put water in the milk.  Frequently, it turns out that there was no water put in the milk but because the cows were not eating the proper grass there was a little deficiency but the result is District Court proceedings and probably a fine.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider relieving the Garda of duties such as those connected with school attendance, weights and measures, food and drugs and statistics.  I am not reflecting in any way on the manner in which they have carried out their duties.  They have done well.  A certain Garda sergeant, not in my constituency, told me that from the time he joined the force to the present day the volume of forms and leaflets coming to the barracks for his observations had been increasing to an extent he never anticipated.  Not only are they Garda but they are civil servants in the full sense of the word and must make copies of this and that and keep files on this and that. One would expect them to keep a file on the activities of an alien in their district, but to go around after Tommy Robinson because he is not going to school is I think a waste of Garda time.  If Tommy Robinson gets a slap and feels that he should mitch from school the next day and a report goes to the Garda barracks, a Garda should not be asked to leave his important duties to go after Tommy Robinson.</P>
    <P>Time and again the Minister for Justice and his predecessors have been approached about the pensions payable to widows of Garda sergeants. The records will show that I have referred to the matter in this House on every possible occasion and I have said the widow of a Garda sergeant is in a different category from the ordinary citizen.  The allowances paid to widows of Gardai are entirely insufficient and it is time the pension scheme was recast for widows of Gardaí, detective officers, sergeants and superintendents.  A decent pension should be given.  Many of these men died in harness; very many gave most of their lives serving their country with sincerity and devotion. <Col N="751" /> Many Garda who have passed away were old I.R.A. men and it is deplorable that their widows should be left with so little to rear a family and observe a reasonable standard of living.  It is most degrading if the widow has to step down as many have been forced to do.</P>
    <P>In the 16 years that I have been a member of the House I have approached Ministers for Justice on several occasions when Garda sergeants died suddenly with no money saved, leaving a number of small children.  Inside a month the widow must leave the Garda barracks even though she has no home and no place to go.  The old saying is that unless you have your own friends, you have no friends.  When people are up in the world they have many friends, but when they are going down or when they are down, nobody wants them. It is the same in all walks of life. &ldquo;The devil a lot of good her husband was&rdquo; may be what people say when the conversation turns to his widow, but when he was alive he was &ldquo;a good, decent fellow&rdquo;.  That is what happens instead of the exercise of true Christian charity.  In cases where a sergeant dies I think a reasonable time should be given to allow his widow to get accommodation.  It is, of course, clearly understood that the new sergeant must move into the Gárda barracks and take over the living quarters.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that the Department have ever been unreasonable.  In the three or four cases with which I was intimately associated&mdash;and they were grave cases of hardship&mdash;I found the Department sympathetic, but there was little they could do.  I would ask the Minister for Justice to solicit the sympathy of the Government in the recasting of an entirely new system of widows pensions for the widows of Gardai, sergeants and superintendents. It is long overdue.  The allowance is small and the widows have to pay for the education of their children and to provide for themselves.  They have to pay rent for living accommodation when they are left without the breadwinners who have served the State well.  No matter what case can be made <Col N="752" /> for widows in any other section of the community, I feel a special case can be made for the widows of Gardaí. The late Deputy Alfie Byrne spoke in this House on numerous occasions, and he always stressed the importance of a special scheme of higher pensions for the widows of Gardaí.  I trust that something will be done in that respect.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister would be well advised to consider increasing the Garda rent allowance.  I mentioned that earlier and I do not propose to repeat one iota of what I have said. The existing rent allowance is rather small and it is time that it, too, was reviewed.  The boot allowance should also be increased.  That has not been reviewed for a considerable time and it can do not harm to give, in addition to the allowance, another pair of boots.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice give a grant to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I have a feeling they give that grant, but I looked for it in the Book of Estimates and I could not find it; I know I read it in some document.  The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals may be looked on as a collection of old women who devote their time to cats and dogs.  That has been said in this House.  I shall not criticise the collection of old ladies who comprise the society.  Theirs is a most worthy job.  The members of the Garda who have taken on the responsibility of dealing with the ill-treatment of animals have done a good job and they and the society should get recognition from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>In addition, not only should an annual grant be given to the society, but on the statistics furnished, they should get a bonus, and the central executive of that society should be empowered to share some of the substantial grant with the country branches.  Many of us have seen the way in which the unfortunate travelling section of the community have treated and are treating dumb animals.  That is one reason why I think it is a good thing that we have the N.S.P.C.A.  They may cause us annoyance now and again by running with stories to the Garda; but we have all seen cases of animals being yoked to a cart and, <Col N="753" /> streaming from the ragged harness, the blood of the animal.  We have seen that on more than one occasion and the Garda who takes action, or the association that looks after these animals and prevents their ill-treatment, deserve the admiration of the Department of Justice.  I trust whatever grants are given will be increased.  The valuable work undertaken by that organisation richly deserves credit and admiration.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, reference was made to the expenses of court witnesses.  We have had the same problem down through the years.  It is most unfortunate that a person should be summonsed to court and asked to remain for one, two or three days, away from his work and other duties, without being sufficiently paid.  The rates of pay for State witnesses are entirely insufficient, and it is high time they were substantially increased, so that a witness coming forward voluntarily to give evidence, or on subpoena, will not be asked to do so at a financial loss to himself.  We have all known people who have had to attend court and were obliged to be in attendance for more than one day at great financial loss to themselves and their families.  The time has now come when State witnesses, and witnesses who are obliged to attend courts for which the Department of Justice are responsible, should be paid sufficiently so that they will not be out of pocket on the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>I see in the Book of Estimates that a sum of £330 solid cash is voted as an annual subscription to the International Police Commission.  I know nothing about the International Police Commission.  I should like to know something about it, how long we have been a member of it and how does the annual subscription amount to £330? Does that include the expenses of a delegate or two attending the annual meeting of the Commission, or does the £330 we are asked to vote go as a contribution from this country towards this Commission?  What are the benefits of the Commission and what is to be had from it?  For example, now that we contribute £330 by way of subscription to the International Police Commission, is there <Col N="754" /> anything they can do about giving expert advice on the solving of unsolved crimes?</P>
    <P>If we are a member of the International Police Commission, I should like to know, if the Minister for Justice will tell us, where this Commission meets and how often?  Do we send a delegate or two?  If we are voting money in this House, we are entitled to know the purpose for which it is voted.  What is the purpose of the International Police Commission? Have we got any benefits from membership of the Commission by sending a delegate, if we do send one, to the annual conference, if there is such a conference?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice may have dealt with that on another occasion.  I have to confess that I was not aware of it until last Sunday evening when I had an hour to spare and, reading through the Book of Estimates, I discovered this grant of £330 to the International Police Commission.  It immediately crossed my mind that through this Commission, we might get some expert advice on the solving of crime.  Would the Minister instruct our representatives on it, if any, to raise the failure to solve some crimes at the next meeting, and see if any expert advice or expert assistance be gained, or if our police force can be improved in any way?</P>
    <P>Is it true the Minister has under consideration the purchase of a number of police dogs?  I am told a number of police dogs are about to be purchased and that the cost of the proposed police dogs will be twice the cost of Tulyar. For what purpose are these police dogs required?  Is it intended to cut down the number of men in the force and replace them with dogs?  Is it intended to have a set of dogs tied up in each station?  Are we to be told that the dogs will be on duty tonight and that the men are off?</P>
    <P>I know there is a file in the Minister's office in relation to the purchase of police dogs and that this question came up before.  Whether it was favourably considered or not I cannot say, but I believe the question of their purchase has now reached the stage of <Col N="755" /> active consideration.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how many dogs are to be purchased; at what cost and from where he proposes to make the purchase; will the dogs be fully trained. where they will be maintained, and other details.  Perhaps he would also tell us what qualifications the dogs will possess.  I am sure he will not purchase them without examining their qualifications.  We should also like to know whether it is proposed to purchase these dogs during this financial year or to defer their purchase until the next financial year.  Whenever he does propose to purchase these dogs, I hope he will be in a position to answer the numerous questions he is likely to be asked about them.</P>
    <P>I do not know if police dogs will be such a success in this country.  It is all right for the Canadian mounted police to have police dogs or to have them in vaster countries than this.  However, I shall be glad to hear from the Minister whether he has reached any decision in this regard and any other information he can give on this question.</P>
    <P>Without going back to the question of the International Police Commission I hope the Minister will let us know something about it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I wish to make reference to the condition of our courthouses.  There are courthouses in parts of this country and they are not fit for dogs. There is a courthouse in Portarlington in which there is no seating accommodation. The bottom of the witness box has fallen out entirely and the windows are broken.  There is another courthouse in my constituency where there is cardboard and part of a tea chest in the windows.  There is a broken chair from which the justice has to deliberate and decide.  There is no witness box, no place for the general public, for the witnesses to sit or for solicitors to take notes.  When are we going to have decent courthouses? Courthouses are a necessary evil but, if we must have them, let us not have pig houses.  I do not know whether the local authority is responsible for courthouses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It might be no harm if some communication were addressed by the Department of Justice to the local authorities asking them to provide seating accommodation for the justice or at least to provide a witness box and seating accommodation for the witnesses.  I have seen old people giving evidence in accident cases at a district court in Portarlington and they had to stand for an hour and a half during the hearing of the case.</P>

      <P>I wish now to make reference to the Land Registry which comes within the scope of the Minister's Estimate.  The Land Registry is a very important office and one to which most Deputies from time to time have occasion to make representations. The Land Registry is efficient, speedy and most attentive but, like most State Departments, the office is slightly understaffed.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Justice, if it is possible, to try to increase the staff in the Land Registry because, although most people may not realise it, it is a very important office.  In the case of every sale that takes place, every holding that is exchanged, every folio that has to be examined, the Land Registry has to be consulted.  They are able to get through the volume of work that goes into the Land Registry with reasonably good attention, caution and speed.  I do not know whether it is because of representations I may have made.  I do not know whether every Deputy has experienced the same speed in the Land Registry.  My experience is that they have done their job well but I am told they are handicapped because of lack of space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the Registry of Deeds which also comes within the ambit of the Department of Justice. At the Registry of Deeds, there are copies of deeds dating back to 1708. These old deeds are kept at the top of the building where a staff is engaged on certain important research work.  When a person is on research work he must have peace and quiet.  What happens?  While the officers are deeply engaged on research work on those old deeds going back to 1708, right through where they are working come the staff of another section of the building, some whistling, some singing, some humming and others carrying on conversations on subjects they were discussing and engaged upon in the other part of the building.  Immediately, therefore, the officers who are busily engaged on the research work are interrupted to such an extent that they cannot concentrate entirely on the important work they <Col N="758" /> have to undertake.  A corner is partitioned off in one of the rooms, which is the main room at the top of the stairs, where a transcript of deeds, and so on, is prepared.  Any person in the research department can easily overhear the reading out of the contents of those documents.  If one of them wanted to be inquisitive enough, he could jot down the details of such documents if he wished.</P>
    <P>The whole situation relating to the Registry of Deeds requires immediate attention by the Minister.  The private financial affairs of a doctor in the suburbs of Dublin were made known because of lack of proper facilities from this partitioned-off corner of the big room at the Registry of Deeds.  That is a serious situation. It should not have happened that any man's business and financial affairs should be shouted around and, even if they were not shouted around deliberately, were shouted around in such a way that those engaged on the research work could easily hear the financial affairs of an important Dublin doctor and his title and the titles that were available in the Registry of Deeds.  The whole atmosphere of the place is wrong.</P>
    <P>A complaint was made by an English research student some time ago to the effect that he and some others could not devote their energies or get down to proper research work there because of the disturbances.  I do not know the title of the various ladies' rooms nor do I care, but there is supposed to be a room there known as &ldquo;the powder room&rdquo;.  Parading to it go the ladies&mdash;right through the research room and back again.  Is there no other means of entering and leaving the powder room than through the research room?</P>

      <P>I am a Deputy doing my job.  The job of an active Deputy takes him to many very strange quarters.  I do not know if the Minister for Justice has ever been there.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Justice should go to the <Col N="759" /> powder room but I would ask him to provide an alternative means of entering and leaving it rather than have the ladies parade, whistling and singing, through the research room in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
      <P>I also want the Minister for Justice to examine the partitioned-off corner of the big room where typing goes on concerning people's private affairs.  Whatever blemishes or flaws may be on their deeds can, when under discussion, be heard outside.  I would ask the Minister to have that corner made sound-proof so that whatever goes on there cannot be heard by the research workers outside. I urge him to go there some time.  The only time the research workers can work is from 12 noon to 2.30 p.m. when all the others are at their lunch. That is the only time there is peace and quiet in that office.  I would ask the Minister, if it would not be too much trouble or inconvenience, to look into the matter for himself.  I am sure the Secretary of the Department would have no objection.</P>

      <P>The Minister answered me and said he is busy.  I know he has been and is busy but I urge him to take half an hour off and to look at this room and see if he can find a way of directing the queue of ladies for the powder room through some avenue other than the research <Col N="760" /> office.  I shall raise the matter again this time 12 months, if I am still here. If there is a change in our method of election, we do not know how things will work out but if I am here, I shall ask if there have been any developments in this matter.  Perhaps the Minister will not mind if I address a communication to him and&mdash;for the third time&mdash;I urge him if at all possible to pay a visit to the place.</P>
      <P>There is an aliens section in the Department of Justice.  They are a very busy section and keep a watch and careful tab on the activities of foreigners in this country&mdash;some of whom are most undesirable and some of whom are most desirable and very welcome.  There should be a curb on the entry of aliens to purchase land.  I would ask the Minister to examine the entire code of permits for aliens who apply for permission to reside here and who are anxious to purchase large tracts of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with aliens' permits, I would ask the Minister not to be as liberal as he has been and to restrict them to the fullest extent possible.  The life-blood of our country is leaving and emigrating and we should bear that in mind rather than make our country a happy hunting ground and a paradise for aliens from the four corners of the earth. I trust that some attention will be given to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also trust that in the case of any alien in this country who is regarded as undesirable, whose activities are engaging the constant attention of the police, the necessary arrangements will be made forthwith to have him immediately deported.  I should like to know from the Minister, if he has the details available, the number of aliens who have taken up residence in this country on permit since this time 12 months ago.  The House should be given annually by the Minister for Justice a more detailed report relating to aliens, including name, address, <Col N="761" /> country of origin and the profession or occupation they are pursuing in this country.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I have any serious complaint to make about the Aliens Section of the Department but too many aliens are being allowed to take up residence here and to fill good jobs for which Irishmen would be well fitted.  The aliens in question may have certain technical qualifications that the Irish do not have but there should be some curb put on the admission of aliens.  Where aliens are discovered to be engaged in any form of racketeering or profiteering or other activities which give rise to suspicion on the part of the guards, steps should be taken to have such aliens immediately deported.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of immodest literature.  I do not propose to set myself up as a judge of what is good literature and what is bad literature. We all can have a joke and a smile when we see a funny postcard or even a smutty postcard, but I should like the Minister to indicate what action has been taken and is being taken by his Department in connection with the bad literature that is dumped here from England.  I have in mind particularly the immodest literature that fell into the hands of a number of school children not too long ago in Ballyfermot, Dublin.  I should like to know from the Minister if prosecutions have been brought against the people who were discovered to be responsible for bringing in immodest pictures, immodest postcards and immodest books for the purpose of weakening and demoralising the innocent minds of the young people.</P>
    <P>To the horror and disgust of certain clergy, certain Catholics and Protestant churchmen, a stream of bad literature is continuously flowing into Dublin and is being circulated by those who have filthy minds and filthy hearts, in an effort to corrupt the morals and the innocence of honourable boys and girls.  I do not know if the Minister has seen any of these documents but I would ask that action be taken in cases where it has been discovered that a newsagent sells immodest postcards.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between immodest <Col N="762" /> postcards and funny postcards which one can read and enjoy as a joke.  There is the dirty, filthy postcard and the dirty filthy literature, the immoral literature, which is let loose by an organisation for the deliberate purpose of corrupting the minds of young people.  I am sure that matter is engaging the attention of the Minister. It is a matter that should engage the attention of every Irish Catholic. Every Irish Catholic who sees bad literature on display or immodest pictures or postcards in the hands of young, weak-minded boys and girls, should take it upon himself to seize it and to burn it publicly in the street, O'Connell Street or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The attention of the Minister has been directed to this evil on more than one occasion, but I have never seen any statement made by the Minister or any officer in the Department as to the action that has been taken to prevent the spread of such literature.  Is there no power and authority in this country to close down completely a newsagent or house that engages in the sale of immodest and bad literature?  If not, the sooner such power is vested in somebody, the better.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal to be thankful for and a great deal to be proud of.  More than ever before we need Catholic action.  I am not using this House as a platform to advocate religion for political purposes but the sooner Catholics realise that they have a duty before God not to sell such literature and a duty not to read or encourage such literature, the better.</P>

      <P>This serious problem was brought to the notice of <Col N="763" /> the Minister by the Church authorities not too long ago.  I should like the Minister to make some short statement on the matter.  Bad as the practice of spreading evil literature was in the past, it exists in this city today and I would appeal to the Garda and to everyone concerned to be more alive to it and to co-operate with the authorities in stamping out this disastrous practice that could have a most demoralising effect on the young people.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a final question of the Minister.  It relates to the growth of Communism.  As the Minister's Department is the Department responsible, I want to ask him if he keeps under close observation, in consultation with the Garda chiefs, persons who are known to be advocating and endeavouring to organise Communism in this country in a small way.  I do not know if all Deputies are aware of the very limited activities which are being carried on but we all know, and we know to our great delight, that no matter what efforts are made to advocate Communism they will fail.  Thank God for that.  But there is an element which is advocating a movement secretly, particularly amongst unemployed persons, where Communist propaganda is being published and Communist expressions are being used. They are endeavouring to bring about a Communist outlook over a very wide area, particularly amongst people who do not think for themselves.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to alert his Department to the entire question of the growth of Communism.  Even though Communist activities may not be very great in this country I would urge that a close watch be kept on those suspected of circulating Communist doctrine and those attempting to have confidential meetings with a view to upsetting both State and Church.  If there are people so suspected by the Guards I trust that the Minister will make himself familiar with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this question of <Col N="764" /> Communism and literature, I feel that the Minister must have read the document which Deputies received from the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Most Deputies received copies of that document. It was a disgraceful publication and a disgrace to any Catholic who would receive it or allow it into his house.</P>

Steps should be taken by somebody to curb the spread of such documents.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House any longer.  I have made my contribution to this debate; I may have caused a good deal of amusement, gaiety and laughter to those on the opposite side of the House but I made my comments seriously and honestly in the hope that the Minister for Justice may think on what I have said and that he and his officers will take note of the matters I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that I have always found the officers of the Department of Justice courteous, obliging and helpful. Whatever the shortcomings the Minister may have&mdash;we all have our shortcomings&mdash;he is one of the few members of the Government who is approachable.  At least you can exchange views with him and talk with him, unlike many of his colleagues. I hope that the utterances I have made will not be taken merely as criticisms of the Minister's activities <Col N="765" /> and those of his Department for, on the contrary, I make this contribution in the hope that some of my observations will be taken seriously by the Minister and will be looked into by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be agreed, I am sure, that the discussion has now ranged over almost every item in the Estimate and it has covered three sittings.  As a result I have had an opportunity of reading the debates, of reading what each Deputy had to say and what he was interested in, and of taking notes which enable me to provide a detailed answer.  I propose in the course of my reply to deal with the matters in the sequence in which they were raised and therefore I shall begin with Deputy McGilligan.</P>
      <P>He appeared to criticise my opening statement on the grounds that it differed little from the statement I made last year.  Whatever truth there may be in that, the fact remains that there is little change in the items which go to make the Estimate and we can deal only with the items which are contained in the Estimate.  From my point of view, the only change that can be discussed is the rise in the price of goods which may be purchased, either by the Garda or by any of the other offices which come under the Department of Justice, the increases in pay for the Garda, gratuities and pensions, increases in the pay of Civil Servants, and so on.  How it would be possible then to deal with an Estimate of that kind in a manner that would not be the same as in other years passes my comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also criticised me for not giving what he regarded as a sufficient or true analysis of the causes of the increase in crime that had taken place, and implied, if I understand him correctly, that I should have produced some kind of plan to combat it.  He himself appeared to be satisfied that the increase is mainly attributable to economic conditions.  I should like to point out that crime waves occur in the most prosperous countries, including waves of crime against property.  In these countries <Col N="766" /> they have not been able to give a satisfactory explanation of crime waves; they have not been able to halt them.  I do not know how the Deputy expects me, or my Department, to do what those with very much greater resources at their disposal were unable to do.  I do not profess to be an expert but I do know that the causes of crime are many and varied and the first to admit that are those who have made the closest study of the subject.  I am far from denying that poverty can be a contributory cause of crime.  What I do deny is Deputy McGilligan's insinuation that the increase in crime in the last few years is attributable to a general worsening of the standard of living of the people, whether they are unemployed or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked for the figures for indictable-crime in the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  The 1958 figure was 10,294.  The Deputy quoted the 1957 figures as being 8,750, but this was a provisional figure, later corrected to 8,472.  The increase was 22 per cent., or 3 per cent. higher than the average for the whole country. Other Deputies suggested that the reduction in Garda strength was a factor or, if not, that it would in future lead to an increase in crime.  I shall advert later to this matter, when I come to deal with the question of Garda strength.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about the Solicitors Bill.  Following discussions with the Council of the Incorporated Law Society, a number of fresh amendments have been prepared for insertion in this Bill.  These amendments will mean considerable recasting of the Bill and will be in substitution for those already tabled by me.  A draft of the amendments, in more or less final form, has been forwarded to the Council of the Society and when agreement is obtained I shall have the amendments circulated at once.  I should like to say here and now that what I shall propose is an amended Bill acceptable to the Incorporated Law Society and representing the considered views of the Society.  I have no intention of forcing on the Society a Bill which they do not want and to which in fact they object.</P>

I have directed that this latter legislation be given top priority in my Department and I can assure the House that we are progressing as rapidly as we can.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan also asked why the cost of food in prisons had gone up and whether there had been a change in the diet of prisoners.  There has been no change in the diet.  The advance is largely attributable to an increase in the price of potatoes and vegetables and in the price of meat. He also asked a question about the Licensing Bill.  The Licensing Bill has taken much longer to have examined than many of us originally could foresee. It is circulating at present through the various Departments of State and when it is returned we may be in a position to submit it to the Government for final discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also raised the question of penal reform.  Penal reform and prison reform are two different things.  I tried to point out to Deputy McGilligan that, as far as prison reform is concerned, the conditions in the various prisons under our control had improved, to my mind, out of all imagination.  I pointed out that they have spring beds <Col N="768" /> now in the prisons and they have four meals a day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>And very good ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>They are good meals, at that.  They are allowed now to associate after the day's work has been finished&mdash;a thing which never happened until recently.  In some respects we might be carrying that too far.  Deputies may have varied views on it.  The fact of the matter is that conditions in prisons today are certainly not what they were some time ago.</P>
      <P>Penal reform is a completely different thing.  It could not be carried out in this country as in, say, Great Britain, for the simple reason that we have not got the prison population to enable us to do it.  In fact, if we attempted to carry it out, we would probably have more prison officials than prisoners.  Therefore, it is not possible to operate it in the way some Deputies may feel it should be operated.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of Deputies referred to drunken driving.  Deputies will recall that I said in my opening statement that I had rejected all petitions for the removal of a driving disqualification imposed for drunken driving.  Deputy McGilligan asked whether I had intended my words to be taken strictly and went on to imply that, though I had remitted no disqualifications for drunken driving, I had shown an excess of clemency to drunken drivers who had suffered other penalties.  Of course I intended my words to be taken strictly, but there is nothing to hide.  Since I took office, I have altered the sentence of the court in four such cases and in none of these cases was the trial judge or justice opposed to mitigation. I can assure the Deputy and the House that there were good reasons for my decision in each of these cases.  If his object is to create the impression that drunken driving is taken lightly by the Department of Justice, I would just merely like to say that he is trying to mislead the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> Arising out of that fact and out of what Deputy Flanagan has just said, I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, the line of action which I have taken is a line of action which will continue.  I have been under heavy pressure to remove the suspension of licences for drunken driving.  I have had to resist all those requests, in many cases from persons of some responsibility.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised matters concerning road traffic.  For the most part, however, they were matters for the consideration of the Minister for Local Government.  This applies in particular to Deputy Dr. Browne's suggestions for driving tests and blood tests which, of course, would require legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Coogan and Russell both suggested that members of the Garda should occasionally call to schools and give lectures to school children on road safety.  There may be something in that, though I must say that, as Minister for Justice, I should be very loath to agree to add one more duty to the Garda, who have enough on their hands as it is.  Despite what Deputy Coogan says, I am inclined to think this is the province of the teachers rather than of the Garda, and that regular short talks by teachers would be both more useful and more appropriate. One way or another, it would be a matter for the Department of Local Government, in the first instance, as the Department responsible for road traffic matters, to consider this proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to what he calls traffic chaos in certain provincial towns and implied, I think, that the position could be improved if the Commissioner of the Garda would take a stronger line with local authorities. Undoubtedly, what the Deputy was primarily referring to is the parking and waiting regulations in these towns.  I think the Deputy is correct in assuming that the Garda pay very careful attention to the views of the local authorities in determining in what streets parking should be prohibited and, as a result, parking may be permitted in streets where a smoother flow of traffic would result <Col N="770" /> from a prohibition.  As long as this is not carried to excess I must say that I cannot but agree with the Garda view that the people of the town, through their elected representatives, should have a say in such matters and, if local people are prepared to put up with occasional traffic jams in the interests of trade, their views should receive full consideration.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to accommodation in Garda stations by Deputy Corish and other Deputies.  All I can say is that we are making every possible effort to secure financial authority to go ahead with the improvement of quite a number of stations in which we think accommodation could be improved.</P>
    <P>The closing of Garda stations was one of the items to which a large number of Deputies addressed themselves. I should like to say at once that I share the view commonly expressed that there is no substitute for the man on the beat.  Motorised patrols are a useful auxiliary but cannot replace the man on the spot, though mechanical transport can be usefully employed in sparsely populated areas to prevent wasteful foot-slogging and to bring men from place to place for the purpose of undertaking foot patrols.  Time and energy is wasted when men have to walk or cycle for miles through uninhabited tracts of mountainous country to get to the places where they can be best employed.</P>
    <P>There are other ancillary uses to which motor patrols can be put but, as I say, the man on the beat is indispensable. I agree, too, that where there is a Garda station the people in the neighbourhood have an added sense of security and I can understand how they feel when a station is closed or its strength reduced.  The existence of a Garda station in any locality is a sort of insurance against crime and disturbances of the peace.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must have regard to our limited resources and to the fact that this country is freer from crime than almost any other country in the world, and much more so than our nearest neighbour, which is a country of much greater resources.  In <Col N="771" /> fact, there are much fewer crimes and more policemen per thousand of the population in rural Ireland than in rural Scotland which offers a fair comparison. If crime were rife and there were constant disturbances of the peace, then I would say we would have to spend money on increasing strength, and that the moneys required would have to be found, whatever the difficulties.  But the circumstances are very different.</P>
    <P>This is well illustrated by Deputy Wycherley's own constituency.  He complained about the reduction in the strength of the station at Inchigeela to that of a single Guard.  During the five years prior to its reduction to a one-man station, not a single indictable crime had been reported to the Garda in the area.  That is a very important fact to understand&mdash;that during the five years prior to its reduction to a one-man station not a solitary indictable crime had been reported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I would not be justified, and the Commissoner would not be justified, in keeping a station there with five men for whom, practically speaking, there was no work.  That applies to most of the stations which have been closed throughout the country.  There may be a couple of exceptions&mdash;I shall not dispute that&mdash;but the decision to adopt a policy of closing stations was taken by my immediate predecessor and taken, I understand, on the recommendation of the Commissioner and of his staff.  I think it would be entirely wrong for me to interfere with the judgment of these officers, who are all experts, and to oppose their points of view, unless I had first-hand evidence that the acceptance of their recommendations would be undesirable and, so far, I have not had any evidence of that type.  Any cases which have been submitted to me by the Commissioner for authority to close have, undoubtedly, been cases which I could not object to, and I was satisfied that the precautions which the Commissioner was taking in <Col N="772" /> respect of the policing of the areas concerned were, to my mind, sufficient.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of promotion in the Garda. I presume that what they had in mind was the promotion of Gardaí to sergeants, which is reserved by law to the Commissioner, rather than the promotion and appointment of officers, which is a matter for the Government. No matter what system of promotion is adopted, it is inevitable that there should be talk about favouritism, and so on, whenever a senior man is passed over.</P>
      <P>Deputies may be interested in the length of service of the 25 Gardaí whose names appear on the most recent promotion list for filling vacancies in the Dublin Metropolitan Division. Five of the 25 had 15 to 20 years' service; 16 had 10 to 15 years' service; three had 6 to 10 years' service and only one had between five and six years' service.</P>
      <P>It is doubtful if it would be possible to devise any system of promotion which would give satisfaction everywhere. We all know that there will always be men who will think they have been unreasonably passed over, but these promotions are made after the most careful type of examination and while we may hear complaints of one kind or another about victimisation, I am perfectly satisfied, from my association with the Department and with the Commissioner, that promotions are based on the superiority of one Garda over another and that there is no question of victimisation, or anything of that kind.</P>

    <P>Deputy Booth complained about the appearance of Portlaoise Prison from the outside and made some rather scathing comments about it.  The only thing I can say is that I do not think any architects have ever gone out of their way to produce an entrance to a <Col N="773" /> prison that would have the artistic elements all over the country praising it.  As far as I can see&mdash;and I speak from experience of the entrances to English prisons as well as Irish prisons &mdash;the architecture is practically the same in every prison.  I think it is intended to convey a grim type of portico, intended to make you feel this is not a place you should enter and that if you do enter and get out, you will make sure you will not enter again. We are not concerned with what the outside looks like; what we are concerned about it what goes on inside. Tonight, Deputy Flanagan praised what he knows from his own personal experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not say that representations from Deputies on the other side would not have influence. They certainly would.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett raised once again the question of the repeal of the Malicious Injuries Acts.  I have carefully considered this matter.  My attitude is the same as that of my predecessor. Any legislation to codify or amend the Acts is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government.  My duty, as I see it, is to ensure there is some form of protection for people whose property is damaged or destroyed as a result of criminal activity.  Whatever be the origin of the malicious injuries code, it must be realised that at the present day it represents a very valuable form of communal insurance for those who suffer damage to their property, and nobody has been able to assure me that if the code were abolished, insurance companies would be willing to undertake the risk at reasonable premiums.  In fact, all the information I have is to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Cork city jurors was also raised.  I have already informed Deputy Barrett that we are bringing in legislation to deal with that.  It is <Col N="776" /> another of these small pieces of legislation which we think we may be in a position to bring in before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Another question that got a considerable amount of ventilation was the portrayal of scenes of violence in films and newspapers.  Several Deputies referred to the depiction of scenes of violence and brutality in films, newspapers, magazines and so on.  The suggestion was made that children should be excluded from films of that type.  But, as other Deputies pointed out, films are not the only offenders: and I doubt that they are the chief offenders.  Besides, the question of the grading of films is a very difficult one. There are good arguments in favour of grading; but it will be remembered that there are two sides to the question. Grading will undoubtedly lead to the exclusion of children from films to which they now have access and which are not perhaps entirely suited to them; but it would also inevitably, though not necessarily, immediately lead to an alteration in the standard arrangement for the censorship of films for adult audiences.  Besides, as is well known, the &ldquo;adult only&rdquo; label would in itself attract the susceptible adolescent. Those at some arbitrary age, not necessarily connected with emotional maturity, would have uncontrolled access to films hitherto branded as taboo, not to mention the fact that for those under age it provides a constant temptation.</P>
    <P>The difficulty essentially is that people differ so much in their make up, interests and so on, that there is always the problem of the over-susceptible person who is to be protected by State action only at the expense of reasonable freedom of choice to the general adult public.  In my opinion, Deputy Giles put his finger exactly on the problem when he pointed out that this emphasis on crime and violence is all around us in all media of entertainment, perhaps especially in the comic strip.  For that very reason, it is futile to think of trying to combat it by censorship of one kind or another.  I agree with him that it is a matter which can best be tackled in the Churches and the schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> Deputy Dillon made particular reference to what is known as the &ldquo;horror&rdquo; film.  I have seen the report to which, I think, he referred.  One might, perhaps, gather from it that there is some new development in this line.  I gather that that is not so, and the particular company mentioned has been operating for some time.  It may be that there is a greater concentration on this type of film today and that we are in for a spate of them in the future. I have a great deal of sympathy with the Deputy's point of view, but I would be more inclined, perhaps, than he is to say that really horrific films should not be permitted to be generally shown even to adult audiences.  I am having the matter further examined and, if there is evidence that the commercial exploitation of horror films is likely to become a menace, I shall have to consider then whether amending legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked that, where children are sent to Marlboro' House on remand, facilities should be provided for psychiatric examination where that is requisite for the information of the district justice.  I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that such facilities are in fact provided, and have been for several years past.  There is a panel of doctors with special qualifications in this field, to any one of whom the district justice may send a child for psychiatric examination and report.  In the last year, 80 children were examined for the Children's Court in Dublin in pursuance of this arrangement.  As far as inquiry into family background of young offenders is concerned, that is done by the probation officer attached to the Courts, The information obtained by the probation officer is very helpful to the Justice when he comes to make his decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse Deputy Everett's praise of the good work being done in St. Patrick's by the Governor and staff, the chaplain and a most energetic visiting committee.  I myself visited St. Patrick's a short time ago and I was greatly impressed by what I saw; conditions there are excellent and a humane atmosphere prevails throughout.  But I should like to <Col N="778" /> emphasise that the necessary discipline is also maintained.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, Deputy Dillon, towards the end of his speech, made an observation which I want to quote in full.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to tell the Minister that rumours are reaching me that a practice is growing up of members of his Party making representations to the Garda for the purpose of deterring them from launching prosecutions against their political supporters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar suggestions were made by some other Deputies on the same side of the House.  Needless to say, they were not substantiated.  I should like to say categorically that, so far as I am aware, there is no foundation for these suggestions and that I believe them to be baseless.  At any rate, I have had no complaints from the Garda authorities that there is, or that there ever has been, such a practice. I have heard the same complaint being made against members of the Opposition when the Party to which I belong was out of office.  It has been my experience that, whatever Party is in office, charges of the kind are made by the other side.  If a Garda has entered a charge in the station records, he has, so far as I know, no power to withdraw it and, if a summons has been issued, it cannot be withdrawn at all.  Nevertheless, I wish to say here and now that, if there were such a practice as has been suggested, I would not lend myself to its encouragement, no matter which Party was involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney suggested that the retiring age of Gardaímight be extended to 69 or 70.  At present it is 63.  It is not intended to extend the age beyond that limit.  In my view, it is a pretty late age at which to be asking men to take on the type of service that Gardaí have to do in the cities and large towns.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that the present Garda division should be enlarged so as to enable the number of chief superintendents to be reduced. No opportunity of effecting economies in strength, whether of officers or men, <Col N="779" /> is being lost sight of; but the prospects of achieving any substantial reduction in officer strength do not appear to be promising.  Indeed, such a reduction might reduce efficiency unduly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney also suggested that a panel of temporary officers should be drawn up to relieve district court clerks who want to go on vacation. The cost of providing substitutes for all clerks, except by utilising the Garda, would be quite prohibitive. There are a small number of assistants but nothing like enough to supply a substitute for every absent clerk.  The pool is not large enough and it would be difficult to make it large enough without extravagance.  I endorse everything Deputy Lindsay said about the valuable services performed by members of the Garda when called upon to act as substitutes for district court clerks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay asked about law reform.  We are going ahead with the work as speedily as possible.  At present we have on hands a very complex piece of legislation providing for the formal establishment of the Courts.  The Deputy is aware of that. It is being given priority.  After that, I hope to proceed with the Charities Bill which has been brought to the stage at which the final draft is ready. Other Bills will follow later.</P>
    <P>I shall ask the Registrar of Deeds to examine the suggestion made by Deputy Lindsay that memorials and requisitions for negative searches should be typed.  That would require an amendment of the law.  The insistence on scrivenery is to secure a permanent record, writing being regarded as being more durable. Some of the records which are in existence at the moment are over 200 years old.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay also referred to the reduction to a single Garda in the strength at Mulranny, Ballycroy and Blacksod.  Each of these districts has been practically free of all serious crime in recent years.  In fact, in the five years before the reduction in strength took place, only one indictable crime had been committed in <Col N="780" /> Mulranny, two in Ballycroy and five in Blacksod.  Since the reduction took effect, I have received no representations which would suggest that there has been any increase in crime or that the policing of these areas has been impaired.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin referred to the practice, which he says is prevalent, of landlords refusing to accept rent, with the deliberate object of causing arrears to accumulate to a point where the tenant has no prospect of ever being able to pay them.  I am aware of this abuse and I hope to include a provision in the Rent Restrictions Bill now being drafted to put an end to it.  But the Deputy might suggest to the people he has in mind that a very useful way of avoiding the difficulties to which he referred would be for them to put the weekly rent into the Post Office Savings Bank.  By that means, they would have the rent and, in addition to the rent, they would have a little interest on their money.</P>

      <P>There are post offices practically everywhere.  A woman who wants to avoid the danger of eviction is only playing into the landlord's hands if she spends the money and has not got it when he asks for it.  If she puts it into the Post Office Savings Bank she not only has it available when the need arises, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a woman who sends her rent but never gets a receipt. It costs her money because she has to send it by postal order.  It costs her an extra 2/6 a week to send it and the only receipt she has is the postal order counterfoil.  She never gets a receipt from the landlord.  She has beaten the landlord at his own game, but she has to register the letter, get a postal order and go through all that procedure to make sure that it can never be said that she is not paying her rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only suggestion I can make it that which I have just made.</P>
      <P>The question of paying jurors was raised by Deputy Esmonde.  This question has been considered by several of my predecessors but, while much can be said in favour of paying jurors at any rate their out-of-pocket expenses, a fresh burden on the Exchequer would be involved.  In the Juries Bill, which I hope to introduce shortly, I hope to reduce the inconvenience and expense of jury service by sharing the burden among a larger number in certain areas but particularly in Cork city, and by not requiring jurors who live very far away from the courthouse to serve at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde also asked about the supply of a district patrol car to Wexford town.  I have made inquiries about this and I am informed that the Garda authorities consider that the Detective Branch car, which is already allocated to the town, is sufficient for the supervision of the area.  At the time the Deputy last made representations in this matter one of the cars in an adjoining district&mdash;New Ross&mdash; had been withdrawn temporarily, but since then it has been replaced.  The car in New Ross and in each of the other two districts&mdash;Enniscorthy and Gorey&mdash;in this Division may be moved to Wexford or any other part of the Division should the necessity arise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also inquired if Summer Time was put back this year. The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The information I got in reply to my inquiries will, I am sure, interest a number of Deputies.  Summer Time begins each year&mdash;unless a special Order is made to the contrary&mdash;on the day after the third Saturday in April, or, if that happens to be Easter Sunday, on the day after the second Saturday.  It began this year on the usual date, namely, the day after the third Saturday in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne spoke about children being questioned by the Garda otherwise than in the presence of their parents or some adult who would protect <Col N="782" /> the child's interests.  I readily accept that this is something which could lead to abuse and that, on that account, it should not be indulged in as a normal practice.  Where I disagree with the Deputy is that I cannot accept his contention that in no circumstances whatsoever should Gardaí question a child apart from his parents.  I am of opinion that it is highly probable that the effect of an absolute prohibition would be to interfere with, or defeat, the interests of justice in particular cases.  First of all, circumstances might arise&mdash;do, in fact, arise&mdash;in which inquiries must be made immediately if they are to succeed.  Secondly, cases do arise in which parents are hostile to the Gardaí&mdash;if they are asked to be present they will simply tell the child to say nothing.  The Deputy assumes that it does not matter much in either case, since the offence is a trivial one. I do not understand this suggestion. There is no reason to think that these circumstances arise only in trivial cases.  On the contrary, the case may well be a most serious one.  I shall, however, consider carefully the Deputy's suggestion that there should be some special restriction on the taking of signed statements from children alone, where the matter involves criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred to the closing of the Garda station at Ballickmoyler.  The landlord of the premises occupied by the Garda at this station was unwilling to renew the tenancy.  I do not think there was any question of eviction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda evacuated the premises on the 19th March. Efforts to find suitable alternative accommodation in Ballickmoyler have proved unsuccessful and arrangements for the erection of a new station are being considered.  I want to emphasise that it is not the intention to deprive Ballickmoyler of a station permanently. Pending the erection of a new one the area will be policed from the adjoining stations of Carlow, Ballylinan and Wolfhill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> Ballickmoyler subdistrict is practically free of serious crime as the following figures show: Indictable offences in 1954, 11; in 1955, 1; in 1956, nil; in 1957, 4, and in 1958, 1. There is no great urgency at the moment.  We are making arrangements to have a barracks erected there.</P>
    <P>The old annual complaint about tinkers was made on this occasion as it has been made on every occasion that I have had the honour to introduce this Estimate.  Several Deputies referred to the problem.  I can very well understand their doing so for I am keenly aware of the serious damage and annoyance which tinkers cause everywhere they go.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the debate that it should not be impossible for my Department to draw up a code of rules to regulate the behaviour of these people.  Unfortunately, the problem is not to draw up a set of rules&mdash;that would be easy&mdash;but to enforce them.</P>
    <P>May I mention, briefly, the difficulties that arise when one gets down to making concrete proposals?  There are something of the order of 7,000 tinkers on the roads.  If we prohibit camping on the roads, we force them to camp on private property.  If we restrict them to sites approved by the local authority&mdash;and can enforce such a restriction&mdash;we create, in the selected areas, permanent &ldquo;colonies&rdquo; of tinkers.  What about the residents in the neighbourhood who will find themselves pestered day in, day out, and whose property will depreciate in value?</P>
    <P>How can one get over the fact that, if one serves a summons on a tinker, he is apt to be gone to the next county before the case comes for hearing?  Are we to arrest them and keep them in custody&mdash;for minor offences&mdash;until the case comes up? How can we deal with trespass, which is a civil wrong only, when the owner of the trespassing animals is not a mark for damages?  We could, of course, make trespass a criminal offence but this would be a major change in our law and would certainly have serious repercussions <Col N="784" /> on the relations between neighbours in rural Ireland particularly.  I cannot see any Minister proposing such a step and I cannot see the Oireachtas accepting it.</P>
    <P>Are we to prohibit them altogether from keeping horses or allow them to keep only a limited number, purely for their own transport, thereby depriving them of one of their honest means of livelihood?  How can we enforce the School Attendance Acts if we do not actually take the children away from the parents altogether? Will any Deputy advocate that we do that, even if the Constitution would permit it?</P>
    <P>I do not assert that it is much consolation to know it, but I think it, at any rate, no harm to remind ourselves that we are not the only victims.  My information is that neither in England nor in Scotland have they been able to make much progress towards solving the problem. I mention Scotland particularly since conditions there are not dissimilar to our own.  Of course they have the same problem in the Six Counties. In those circumstances, I regret I cannot be too optimistic about providing a solution.</P>
    <P>Actually, one of the solutions put forward and subsequently knocked down is one which I proposed myself. I gave considerable attention to the statement made by Deputy Manley in the course of a previous debate on the Estimate and I went into the question pretty thoroughly.  I was informed by my officials that this was a matter which had been considered over a number of years, and that no solution could be found for it.  Ministers who preceded me asked the House to suggest a solution but no solution was suggested, because the problem appears to be almost insoluble.</P>
    <P>I made the suggestion that fields convenient to towns could be purchased by the county councils or other local bodies concerned, and that instead of allowing these people to camp on the roadside wherever they wished, they should be compelled to camp in those sites.  Those sites would, in fact, be types of stations through which the tinkers would pass <Col N="785" /> on their journeys through the country. That was turned down as not being possible, because, first of all, I was told no county council or local authority would pay the money which would be involved and, secondly, the people contiguous to the fields to which I refer, would be very far from thankful for having these people as their neighbours as they would probably be the first to be robbed.  The whole procedure would be abhorrent to the people who would have to live in close proximity to them.  These are the sort of problems we are up against.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Department have been seeking a solution and Deputies who have raised this matter from time to time have been asked to suggest a solution, but it appears that, so far as these itinerants are concerned, there is, in fact, no solution. The only hope is that they will move along, and keep moving, and not stay too long anywhere.  I am repeating what my predecessor repeated before me, that if any Deputy can produce anything in the nature of a solution for this very difficult problem, we shall be delighted to have it thoroughly examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan spoke for two and a half hours this evening.  I hope he does not expect me to deal with everything he raised because, if I did, I should have to speak here for another hour or more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggested that we should do away with quite a number of senior officers of the Garda.  He made special reference to chief superintendents. The Deputy must surely realise that if we were to cut down even by half&mdash;there are only 27 chief superintendents in the country&mdash;we would cause stagnation in promotion, apart from the fact that we just cannot do it, because each chief superintendent may be regarded as being in charge of a county.  It would not be possible to cut down the number of chief superintendents because, apart from anything else, as I pointed out, it would cause stagnation in the Garda from the point of view of promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> There are 127 superintendents in the Force.  They are in charge of districts and there may be five, six or eight districts in a division.  A chief superintendent is in charge of what is known as a division and, as I said, the superintendents are in charge of the districts. They are helped by the inspectors whose duties are to help the superintendents and to carry out numerous types of duties which the superintendents themselves are not able to carry out.  Superintendents and chief superintendents are supervisory officers while inspectors are, in fact, N.C.O.s.  I do not know whether or not Deputies are aware of that fact.  I only discovered it myself since I went into the Department of Justice.  Inspectors are N.C.O.s who carry out work of an important character on behalf of the superintendents.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan also referred to some kind of committee of Garda which was making representations of one kind or another until the commissioner stepped in and made some decision which prevented them from doing so.  In the course of his speech, the Deputy referred to the Representative Body which leads me, anyhow, to believe that he knows there is such an organisation.  That body deals with all the problems of the Garda, and the other body to which he refers must be a non-statutory body and it should make its representations through the Representative Body.</P>
    <P>The Representative Body can make representations to the Commissioner or to the Minister.  I meet that body twice a year and discuss their problems with them.  The body or committee to which the Deputy has referred should have brought their grievances to the Representative Body and not try to deal with them themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <P>However, arising out of the Deputy's reference to the whole matter we can have it examined to see if it is possible to do anything in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the unsolved murders, to which Deputy Flanagan referred, we ought to leave that matter out of discussion because, as I said in my opening statement, investigations into these murders are continuing and are far from being closed.  We should not say or do anything here that might interfere in any way with the investigations that are being carried out.  It may be only an unfortunate coincidence but it is only a short time ago that I was able to point out to the <Col N="788" /> Deputy, in answer to a question he asked in the House, that the record of the Garda in respect to the solution of murders was 100 per cent.  I do not think there is any Force in the world that could show anything even like that success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be an unfortunate coincidence that there are two, or maybe three, unsolved murders at the present time.  It is something we all regret but I want to assure the Deputy that the Garda are as active today as they were when these crimes were first committed.  The Deputy made a suggestion that there is an officer somewhere in the Force who could solve these murders.  Is that what the Deputy was suggesting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to me to be a suggestion that the Garda are trying to prevent the solution of these crimes.  There is an innuendo that there is an officer somewhere in the Force who will not be allowed to operate to solve these murder mysteries. That is an unfortunate suggestion. As far as I know, the most expert officers of the Force are engaged on all those murders.  They have even sent off special emissaries, if you like to call them that, to each area to make inquiries amongst the Garda in these areas and to report their findings specially to the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The other matters to which the Deputy referred were matters which could have been dealt with by correspondence. They will be reported in the debates and we shall undertake to have them examined.  If replies are necessary to any of the points raised they will be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the adjournment, I was dealing with the unemployment position and the steps the Government have been taking to relieve unemployment since they took office two years ago.  Everything possible has been done by the Government and will be done to create employment in order to keep more of our people at home.  This has been handled in a very practical way and any promises made during the past two years have been kept.  Not alone that, but the Minister has brought in a very favourable Budget which has given hope to every section of the people. The big difference between now and two years ago is that the Minister then had to clean up the financial mess and put the country in a sound financial position.  He has succeeded in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urgent need for us to get into the export market more and more. It is the concern of every public representative to see how best that can be done, and to ascertain what are the best exportable goods we can produce. We must endeavour to do what other civilised countries, who have had hundreds of years of experience of self-government behind them, have been doing.  Their policy is to produce what they are able to consume in their own country and export what they cannot consume.  While we have had many prophets in this House and outside it telling us there is a shortcut to prosperity, I have yet to be convinced there is such a short cut for any country.  Countries with unlimited resources in the way of minerals were in a different position from ours and it is the national concern that every factory producing any goods here <Col N="793" /> should strive to produce for export. If our producers are not assisting the Government and the national well-being by trying to get into the export market then they are not pulling their weight to the extent to which they should.  We have given adequate protection to all our industries.  We must now impress upon our producers that if the country is to prosper, they will have to go ahead a good deal more.  The Government and the Minister for Finance must endeavour to give them all possible help.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins will have an opportunity of addressing the House later, if he has not done so already.  I repeat that we should make every effort to get into the export market.  Our people who emigrate could assist us by buying our produce which is exported.  They should endeavour always to buy Irish goods.  We shall have to have propaganda in that regard, even in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not travelled abroad much, a few times in France and a few times in England, but in areas that were supposed to have large Irish populations, I was sorry to find that certain Irish exports could not be obtained.  Our own emigrants could help us a lot.  If there is enthusiasm and initiative on the part of our people to improve our country by buying Irish products whenever possible it will contribute a good deal toward making the country prosperous, towards the general well-being, possibly towards keeping people in employment at home and even bringing some emigrants back to employment <Col N="794" /> here.  Our semi-state industries are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House by going over these matters and I will conclude by saying that the Minister for Finance has done a very good job.  I hope he will continue the good work and lead the country to the prosperity we all so much desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably worth while to examine some of the claims made by Deputy Burke.  He says the Minister has given hope to every section of the people and done a very good job.  It will be agreed that the Budget has not caused great commotion. Even Fianna Fáil back benchers did not find much to shout about in the Budget.  Apart from some reliefs in entertainment duties, the major features of the Budget were a reduction by 6d. of the income-tax rate and an increase of 2/6d., as from August, to old age and other pensioners.</P>
      <P>Everybody will agree that the Minister could not have done less in relation to the income tax reduction.  To give anything less would clearly be regarded as an insult.  It was necessary, as Deputy Sweetman put it, that that shot in the arm should be given.  If I have any regret in the matter it is that the Minister did not take his courage in his hands and go a lot further along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one will feel particularly happy about an increase of only 2/6d. to the old age and other pensioners. The fact that that increase is being given, as someone else has pointed out already, implies an admission on the part of the Government that the increase which they gave previously, coupled with the slashing of the food subsidies, was just not enough.  The Government, by their action in increasing old age pensions and other pensions by 2/6d. a week as from August next, are going some way to make amends for the action of the same Government in their previous Budgets in removing food subsidies and forcing up prices of essential commodities on every section of the people&mdash;the various sections that Deputy Burke thinks <Col N="795" /> have been given hope by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is all that can be said of this Budget.  There is nothing very much in it.  There is nothing unexpected in it.  There is nothing in it that anyone will have any particular difficulty in talking about or not talking about, according as it pleases one.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the rest of the record of the Government on financial matters.  Let us see what three Fianna Fáil Budgets and the policy enshrined in those Budgets have brought to the people.  If we want to find out in what direction the Government set the sails of the ship of State about which Deputy Burke spoke, we should go back to their first Budget pronouncements. Because it is necessary to get this into proper perspective, I want to quote the Minister for Defence in connection with the General Financial Resolutions of 1957, when he spoke in this House on 15th May, 1957.</P>

I am dealing with the Financial Resolution of 1959 and I propose to remind the House, no matter whether the Deputies opposite like it or not, of what the Minister for Defence said on that occasion as to why this Government was elected, why the people had put the Fianna Fáil Government in office. I propose to remind them why they are in office and I propose reminding the people and the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can argue that out with the Chair.  Let me come to it in this way: The Fianna Fáil Party, before they came into office, announced their plans for ending emigration and for ending unemployment. The present Tánaiste announced the necessity for any Government who took office to find 15,000 new jobs a year for the people.  According to the statistics published this year, it appears that the number in industrial and agricultural employment in 1958, as compared with 1956, which Fianna Fáil used to paint as the black year, showed a reduction of 32,000 people, that there were 32,000 fewer people in employment in this country than in the year that Fianna Fáil used to like describing as the black year of 1956.</P>
      <P>That must be looked at in the context of what the Fianna Fáil Government claim as the aim of their policy to end unemployment.  The Minister for Defence made it quite clear.  I do not know whether I am to be precluded from quoting him or not.  I would much prefer to be quite accurate and quite fair to the Minister for Defence in what I am saying.  If I have to summarise my remarks, I shall summarise them.  I shall do it, naturally, at the risk of losing something in accuracy and I shall do my best not to embellish.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, to the best of my recollection, in dealing with the aims of the present Government on this question of employment told the House quite bluntly that the Fianna Fáil Government were elected for the purpose of ending a situation of mass unemployment and mass emigration. That was two years ago next month.  As between 1956 and 1958, a year after the Minister was speaking, the position was that, under a Fianna Fáil Government and under the policy pursued by that Government, there were 32,000 fewer people at work in this country than in the black year of 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence&mdash;again I shall summarise him if I have to; again I would prefer to quote him if I <Col N="797" /> would be in order in doing so, and to be quite accurate in my quotations rather than risk misquoting him&mdash;to the best of my recollection, speaking on the same occasion, made the assertion that the people had put their faith in Fianna Fáil to remedy the situation regarding employment and emigration. How have they remedied it?  They are now on their third Budget.  They now have had every opportunity, with an overall majority in this House, with no group of people in this House sufficiently large to say &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to any measure the Government bring in. How have they remedied the situation? There were 32,000 fewer in employment in 1958 than there were in 1956.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to the necessity for 15,000 new jobs to be found each year.  Is there any great hope for the people, when, after the Fianna Fáil Party have operated for two and a half years, unemployment is still so high and, what is even more depressing, the number of people actually in employment has gone down by so much?</P>
    <P>I was referring to the fact&mdash;I want to emphasise it&mdash;that whatever claims can be made for this Budget, there is one thing that no Deputy should overlook and one thing that I certainly do not propose to allow the people to overlook, if I can help it, that is, that this Budget maintains the position with regard to the removal of food subsidies.  Under the financial wizardy of Fianna Fáil over the last few years, £9 million has been taken off the kitchen tables of the people in the removal of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>That money has been saved to the Fianna Fáil Government.  If there were any Government in power other than the present Government, £9 million would have been found and used for the purpose of subsidising the people's food, of keeping the prices of essential foodstuffs down. Fianna Fáil, the strong Government with the overall majority, decided that they would have nothing to do with that and they cut out the subsidies, saving themselves £9 million.  What are they giving in return for the £9 million which they have taken off the kitchen <Col N="798" /> tables and out of the cupboard of the people?</P>
    <P>They are giving 2/6d. a week to pensioners; they are reducing income tax by 6d.; and they are freeing greyhound racing and professional boxing, and some other entertainments, from taxation of one sort or another.  But there is this sum of £9 million of the people's money provided by the previous Government and the people are getting back, I calculate, under this Budget, something in the reign of £3 million by way of reliefs.  I think in last year's Budget, the Minister gave some reliefs.  I have not made a calculation of the total involved, but whatever the total of the reliefs in that Budget and in the present Budget, £9 million has gone down the drain, as far as the people are concerned.</P>
    <P>It will be conceded by the Minister and his Party that their predecessors at least achieved the position in which the prices of essential foodstuffs were maintained at a reasonably low level. I do not know if any Fianna Fáil Deputy wants to contest that.  I do know that a great number of people would like to get back to the position in which their food would cost them only what it cost them under the inter-Party Government.  In connection with the price of bread and butter, the two main articles of diet in a number of houses, the Minister for Defence on 15th May, 1957, had this reference to make and I quote from the Dáil Debates for that date at column 1287:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is a fact, of course, that these subsidies were retained and that therefore the two items to which food subsidies refer, bread and butter, were kept at an artificially low level during the Coalitions period of office; but the question is at what price to the community in general were those commodities kept down and the subsidies retained?  I think it was at a price which the community were not prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>People realise now&mdash;and they showed they realised it by voting <Col N="799" /> for Fianna Fáil at the last election&mdash;that there was no ultimate advantage to the workers in having low prices and no work.</P>
    <P>What is the position now, after two and a half years of Fianna Fáil's best efforts, after two and a half years of Fianna Fáil &ldquo;cracking&rdquo;?  The Minister for Defence was able to say in 1957 that during the period in office of the previous Government, it was a case of having low prices and no work.  Will he or any other Deputy sitting behind him now deny that if that was true, the position now is a case of high prices and still no work, because there are 32,000 fewer people in employment than in the year 1956.  What of the people who, according to the Minister for Defence, put their faith in Fianna Fáil to remedy the situation?  What have they got out of a change of Government? The subsidies have been removed and there is nothing in this Budget which is replacing a penny piece of any of those subsidies.  The prices of food have gone up and up and up and the work is still not there and the people are still emigrating.</P>
    <P>Now, I think, it would be quite relevant in this context to remind the House of what the Minister for Defence said in the same volume at column 1283.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In my opinion, and in the opinion of any fair-minded person who even now goes back and looks over the speeches made in the election campaign, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and emigration brought about by the previous Government. It is useless for the Opposition now to try to pretend that the action we have taken has come as a shock to the people.  The people definitely realised that it was necessary to take decisive and tough action and it was because Fianna Fáil were the only Party who could be trusted to do this that we were put back into office.</P>
    <P>They were the Party that could be trusted to take decisive and tough <Col N="800" /> action and the decisive and tough action the Fianna Fáil Government took was to remove the food subsidies and that was for the purpose of pursuing the policy of ending mass unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy opposite who can feel complacent about the efforts of either the Minister for Finance, or the Government as a whole, towards achieving either of those objectives over the past two and a half years? Do any of the Deputies opposite seriously think that by endeavouring to monkey around with our election system and to abolish proportional representation they will achieve the goal of ending mass unemployment and emigration?  That speech of the Minister for Defence was not made on the hustings in the last general election; it was made when the election was over.  It was made in this House, an acknowledgment from the Front Bench opposite as to why that Government were in office.  Two years later, is there any Deputy opposite who feels that he can give the Government a pat on the back for having gone any appreciable distance in the direction of achieving those objectives?</P>
    <P>I have here a publication of the Fianna Fail Party calling on the people to vote Fianna Fail in the general election.  I do not know what on earth the document is called; it has a photograph of the Taoiseach on the front page, with the slogan &ldquo;Let Us Go Ahead Again&rdquo;.  On page two, it starts &mdash;&ldquo;All Energies Devoted to One Aim &mdash;Full Employment&rdquo; and on page three, from which I propose to quote, is an article headed&mdash;&ldquo;Action can Start Now.&rdquo;  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Over 90,000 people are now out of work.  The Coalition says it can do nothing for them now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; is in black type&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil believes that work must be provided at once.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is nothing in any way weak or doubtful about that.  Fianna Fáil proclaimed to the people that they believed that work must be provided at once.  Here we are, three years later, with 32,000 people fewer in employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I do not know whether you are aware of it or not, Sir, but Fianna Fáil published a document when there was a by-election in Cork, asking the people of Cork city to vote for Deputy Galvin.  This appeal contained an article telling the people of Cork city that &ldquo;quick action was needed to avert national disaster&rdquo; and that Fianna Fáil had plans &ldquo;to end emigration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lest I be accused of misquoting in any way, while I shall not give too long a quotation, I want to quote the full text of this article.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present spate of emigration is the most serious problem facing the nation.  The recent census report has shown that the situation must be righted quickly if disaster is to be avoided.  In contrast to the inaction of the present Coalition, Fianna Fáil has been preparing its plans for the day when the Party again take up the reins of Government. The full employment proposals announced by Fianna Fáil show how the Party intend to deal with the problem of emigration, by providing work for our own people at home.  The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of new jobs by 100,000. This would result in full employment and the end of abnormal emigration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people of Cork were told that Fianna Fáil were planning and that the Fianna Fáil plan proposed an increase, over five years, in the number of new jobs so as to place 100,000 people.  Fianna Fáil have gone through half the span which they allowed themselves.  They have been in office now for two and a half years. If the Fianna Fáil plan were worth a hang, we should have 50,000 new jobs created and that number of new people in employment since they came into office.  Instead of that, the official figures published by the Government disclose the sorry position to which I have referred already&mdash;32,000 people fewer in employment in 1958 as compared with 1956.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman pointed out, when he spoke last week, that import prices have decreased by 10 per cent., that <Col N="802" /> they have dropped from 117 to 107 and that, notwithstanding the advantage to the Government of that position, internal prices, the cost of living index, rose by the same figures, roughly from 107 to 116 or 117.  When Deputy Burke talks of the Minister having given &ldquo;hope to the people of Ireland and to every section of the people&rdquo;, I wonder if he is overlooking the fact that in 1958 total savings dropped by £15 millions on the year 1957, that they dropped from some £60 millions to £45 millions as between 1958 and 1957.  Is he aware that the gross national production was down by 2 per cent. as between 1958 and 1957 and was also, I think, lower than in 1956&mdash; the &ldquo;black year of 1956&rdquo;, as Fianna Fáil like to refer to it?</P>
    <P>As I said when I commenced, there is nothing Fianna Fáil can find to raise any cheer about in this Budget.  The Budget is a most disappointing effort. The Minister could not have done less on the income-tax front without being told he was insulting the people by offering a decrease of less than sixpence. From the reply given to a Parliamentary Question last week the amount which old age pensioners will be getting, even when they get this increase, will correspond roughly to 5/- in the year 1909 or 1910.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in the House at the moment.  He was responsible for giving the answer to which I refer and no doubt he will be able to confirm that my recollection is reasonably accurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 24/7 is equal to 5/-.  That is the best effort of the Government.  I remember, when I was a very young person taking an interest in politics, a number of people supporting the Fianna Fáil Party used to rejoice in interrupting the public with: &ldquo;What about the shilling off the old age pensioner?&rdquo; The old age pensioner, if he had now the equivalent purchasing power of the 9/- of those days, would be far better off than he is under the Fianna Fáil Government, who have jacked up the price of food, <Col N="803" /> taken off the subsidies and, by deliberate, positive Government action, pushed up the cost of living on every section of the people.</P>
      <P>That action naturally falls hardest and toughest on the poorer sections of the people, on the weaker sections financially, on people such as old age pensioners and others who are now being compensated by this increase of 2/6d. a week.  I cannot understand why the Government have decided that that increase should be postponed until August next.  I think that very ready acceptance would be found on all sides of the House to a proposition that that increase should become operative immediately.  I do not propose holding the House any longer. I am disappointed with the Budget. The Government, at the last general election, placarded the country with posters asking the people to let Fianna Fáil &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;.  They smothered every dead wall with posters calling upon to housewives of the country to get their husbands off to work: &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil and get your husbands off to work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In their newspaper pronouncements and advertisements, and in their pronouncements by means of public utterances and speeches, they asked the people that unemployment should be the test of Government policy. We are prepared to judge Fianna Fáil by their own measuring stick. We are prepared to accept the challenge and to ask them to demonstrate to us&mdash;measured by their own yardstick, the yardstick of unemployment&mdash;what the Government have been doing for the last two and half years.  I hope that before this debate ends the Government will make an effort to tell the House and the people how they propose operating the Fianna Fáil plan which was to give us 100,000 jobs in five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I have quite a good deal to say on this Budget and I rise for the purpose of offering &mdash;if I may do so&mdash;the most serious possible criticism.  I refer to the Budget as the Taoiseach's farewell gift to the old age pensioners.  As a matter of fact, <Col N="804" /> it can be described as his farewell to Irish politics.  If you examine the Budgets of Fianna Fáil before every single election you will find there was always some kind of a bait, a bribe of some kind, a vote-catching concession thrown out to the electorate.  That only happened prior to elections, but the moment the elections were over and they had settled down for a term of two or three years in office, you then had the real test of Fianna Fáil's policy and saw how they treated the old age pensioners, the taxpayers, the farmers and every section of the community.</P>
      <P>This Budget is no different from any other Fianna Fáil Budget introduced prior to an election and, no matter what the Minister for Finance, or any Deputy on the Government side may say, it is purely an election Budget.  It is purely a vote-catching Budget; there would be no question whatever of giving the miserable one-eighth of a £ to old age pensioners if it were not for the purpose of soliciting their votes in the Presidential election.  It puts a weapon into the hands of Fianna Fáil supporters.  They can now say: &ldquo;Vote for de Valera; he gave you the half crown on your old age pension.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sad part of it is that even after 20 years of this kind of political activity there are still people in the country falling for that type of thing. This Budget is a typical Fianna Fáil election Budget and, no matter what way the Minister for Finance may try to brush it up, it is still only an effort to attract votes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe went one better and said that this is the first instalment of prosperity, that the next Budget will be better and the one after that better again.  He forgets that we have been promised prosperity since 1932 but we seem to be as far away from it as ever. The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that at least we are around the corner and have now entered into a period of economic recovery.  If we have only now entered into a period of economic recovery, what have the present Government been doing for the past 20 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Patrick's Day is an occasion for rejoicing, a day which causes great <Col N="805" /> pride in the hearts of all Irishmen at home and abroad.  On St. Patrick's Day this year most of the Government Ministers were outside our shores speaking of and praising Ireland. There was only one speech at home, a speech of importance that sounded a very sad note.  It was a speech made by Most Rev. Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork, at a dinner given by the Lord Mayor of Cork in the Imperial Hotel in which he said that, in relation to the total population, there was less work and more emigration now than at any time since the Famine.  Members of the Government were making speeches about prosperity in America, in England, and all over the world. They were talking about Irish prosperity but they were talking to those who were prosperous outside our country.  The Bishop of Cork knew from his own experience what he was talking about.  He rules over a vanishing diocese, a diocese which is not much different from some other dioceses to-day, but he is not afraid to talk though the others keep silent for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy in this House who can say that the Bishop of Cork was telling lies to his listeners in the Imperial Hotel?  Is there any Fianna Fáil Deputy, from the Taoiseach down to someone who may be a prospective member of the Government, who can stand up to say that the Lord Bishop of Cork was wrong when he said there was less work and more emigration than at any time since the Famine? Yet, we are told we are around the corner now and are facing a period of economic recovery, but this is the type of speech we hear from one of the most distinguished Churchmen in the country.</P>
    <P>Have the Government lost all sense of reason?  Do they not realise that there is an unemployment problem in the country which is causing great hardship for the 70,000 registered unemployed?  Despite the fact that there are 70,000 registered, there are <Col N="806" /> 20,000 others not registered, for one reason or another.  There is a large section of our people in receipt of disablement benefit from local authorities. They are living on less than £1 a week, supplemented by home assistance, and they are not registered as unemployed because they cannot work.  They are living under the most desperate conditions of dire want and poverty.  Is it any wonder that only a few weeks ago, in reference to the poor in the city of Dublin, the Catholic Social Service Conference made reference to the fact that here, in this city, in its 21 food centres, they served 2,523,258 meals to the Dublin poor.  These were people who could not buy a meal. They served 130,797 special meals to poor mothers and distributed 124,585 pints of milk and 4,284 sets of babies' clothes.  Despite that, it is stated that we have reached a stage of economic recovery and progress.</P>
    <P>It cannot be humanly possible that the members of the Government have lost their sense of sight and hearing, that they have reached the stage that they are so elevated from the general public that they have brought themselves into an atmosphere of prosperity which, in their hearts, they feel exists universally.  Any Deputy in constant touch with the people in rural Ireland must know that there is an extraordinary type of emigration taking place at the present time.  Up to this you had one or two members of a family going to England to eke out an existence, but now you have reached a stage that the whole family goes. They bar the door, put a padlock on the gate, a sack across the chimney tied with a tight wire to keep the crows from building nests there, and the whole family emigrates.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 22nd April, 1959.</P>

    <P>The reasons for the suspension of operations are not known to me.  It is to be presumed, however, that the private interests who held the mining or exploration concessions ceased operations because they were not satisfied with the results of explorations, or because they found that the prices which would be obtained for the minerals would make further operations uneconomic for the time being.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to give in respect of 1958-59 and 1959-60 figures calculated on the same basis as that given in 1957.  The figure for 1957 was derived from the Civil Service Census.  The cost as shown by the 1958 Census did not include the pay increases granted in 1958-59, which will not be thrown up until the 1959 Census figures are available.  The figure taken for 1958-59 is, therefore, based on an estimate of expenditure made towards the end of that year.  That estimate, being of such recent date, has been taken as reasonably appropriate for 1959-60. Industrial staff are included.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each of the financial years 1956/57, 1957/58 and 1958/59 the domestic consumption of (a) beer, (b) wine, (c) spirits, (d) cider and perry, and (e) tobacco; the amount of duty collected from each item; and the rate at which such duty was levied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of the actual domestic consumption of the commodities mentioned are not available. I propose, however, to give particulars of the net duty-paid quantity in the case of beer and the quantities retained for home-use in the case of the other commodities as these quantities normally approximate to domestic consumption.  As final figures are not yet available for the month of March, <Col N="667" /> 1959, the information given in respect of the year 1958/59 is confined to the <Col N="668" /> eleven months ended 28th February, 1959.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the reply which I gave to the question asked by Deputy O'Malley on 3rd March, 1959, Departments when placing advertisements make their selection <Col N="674" /> from among newspapers and periodicals according as they judge that their requirements as regards coverage can most adequately and economically be satisfied.</P>
      <P>As will be seen from my reply to Deputy Moloney's question of 28th May, 1957, advertising is placed by Government Departments in a very large number of newspapers and periodicals. The special investigation that would be necessary to obtain the particulars asked for by the Deputy would require an extensive check and an expenditure of time and labour which I could not regard as justifiable.</P>
      <P>In 1955 it was decided that Government advertising should not be placed with newspapers which did not furnish circulation figures.  Seven provincial newspapers were affected and were excluded from Government advertising generally.  Three of the papers subsequently furnished circulation figures and were again accepted for advertising. Apart from this instance, there is no general directive to Departments regarding the selection of papers and periodicals for advertising.</P>
