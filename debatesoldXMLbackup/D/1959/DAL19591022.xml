    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage (resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill authorising the Minister for Finance to take shares to the extent of £1,500,000.  It also enables him to give free grants to the amount of £500,000.  While everybody in this House must welcome anything that will help to maintain Shannon Airport, I am extremely dubious that this Bill is the correct way to approach the matter.  It is very evident that Shannon Airport faces considerable difficulties on account of overflying by jets.  At the same time it is very evident that Shannon Airport is a necessary adjunct to the civil aviation of the world in relation to transatlantic flights.  That has been quite evident in the past few months when it was necessary for planes coming from other areas that had overflown Shannon to return there.</P>
      <P>As I heard the statement of the Minister yesterday, the principal purposes of this Bill appear to be to encourage the development of industries in and around Shannon Airport and to endeavour to advertise it as fully as possible throughout the world.  I do not think anybody in any part of the world who has ever taken a flight in a plane or is in any way interested in flying has not heard of Shannon Airport.  Therefore, the Minister's first suggestion that this Bill is for the purpose of aiding the advertising of this Airport really does not hold water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see that we require a Bill and all the costs associated with a Bill and all the extra State control that will come with this Bill for the purpose of advertising one of the best-known airports in the world.  There is no doubt that were Shannon Airport to go into liquidation, which I know will not happen and would not be permitted to happen by this or any other subsequent Government, it is of such vital importance to the world as a whole that other countries or other air companies would, if necessary, <Col N="215" /> intervene to see that such a state of affairs would not come to pass.</P>
    <P>It is true that, with the overflying of the Airport, there will be a considerable hiatus in the employment given to the numerous employees who derive their living in and around the Airport.  For that purpose, everyone will agree that it is necessary that any hardship that might be caused should be mitigated in every way.  Again, I do not think this is the correct approach.  I do not think it is necessary to have a Bill which, as I read it, is designed to provide a sum of £2 million to further and extend the activities of the Airport.  If industries are to be set up, as I hope they will be set up, in Shannon Airport, I largely agree with Deputies Cosgrave and Russell that it would probably be more beneficial to our economy as a whole to set them up in adjacent towns such as Limerick and Ennis, where a large number of the employed personnel of the Airport live or, if not, in other residential quarters of the area.  If it is necessary to do that, we have already the machinery and the facilities in this State for setting up these industries.  We recently passed a Bill in which it was possible by State grants to assist any of these intended projects.  Why must we have another Bill?  Why must we have duplication of what already exists?  We have An Foras Tionscal which I understand is for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Any development that is necessary can take place without this Bill.  We are getting too much into the system that practically every project, no matter what it may be, must have a Bill, a board and a company that is dependent on, and to a large extent controlled by, the Government.  While it is necessary for the State to aid in every way the development of industries here, I do not approve of direct control.  This Bill, putting the Minister for Finance into the position of being able to control £1,500,000 worth of shares in a company, is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The Federal Republic of Germany, which has shown the most startling economic revival in the modern history of Europe having been reduced to <Col N="216" /> ashes during the last war, are by legislation endeavouring to transfer back fully and completely to private enterprise anything that they intervened to support in the time of emergency.  That should be our policy and outlook.  I am not suggesting that the Government are entirely committed to State control but I do suggest that we are having too many of these Bills, too many boards and too much State interference.  Although this Bill will undoubtedly be passed by the majority the Government have at their disposal, it is unnecessary.  Shannon Airport can survive with the existing facilities in the State without all the expense of an extra Bill and the extra control by the State that it will imply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was discussed in the House before, the Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce had responsibility for the problem and I at the time suggested to him that the benefits to be conferred under this measure should be extended to other parts of the country.  I do not know whether that proposal of mine has been considered so far by the Minister for Transport and Power but I want to repeat to him that it is desirable that the advantages to be given to what I can describe now as the depressed area of the Shannon be extended to the other depressed areas particularly in the West of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The House and the Minister should be quite open and honest about the purpose of this measure.  It appears that the Government have accepted the fact that Shannon is about to be completely by-passed as far as air services are concerned, with particular reference to passenger services.  The loss of employment resulting from the withdrawal of services by air companies will leave a large number of unemployed in the area and consequently it is desirable that alternative employment be made available for those who are likely to be displaced from their present employment in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to inquire in regard to the new industries which it is proposed to set up, be they good or bad, whether the people who will be employed there will be people who were <Col N="217" /> formerly employed by the air companies or associated at the Airport as such, or people who are likely to move into this area to secure employment from now on.  The aim of setting up this company is to entice foreign industrialists to use the locality concerned as a jumping off ground for the European market.  There may and I hope there will be a certain amount of success attaching to the efforts being made in that regard but the efforts are about five years too late; the Government have wakened up when major industries that might have been available are already established in Europe, particularly in Denmark, Holland and Belgium.  For the past eight years these European countries have made tremendous efforts to secure in their territory the establishment of industries controlled and run by American industrialists.  These industries are in full swing and are prepared to reap the full benefit of the vast markets open to them.  While these countries were seeking earnestly in America for the money and skill of the American industrialists, our Government sat back and did nothing whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Is this relevant to the Bill?  I am not empowered to discuss the development of industry outside the Shannon.  The decision to set up the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has already been made by the House and this is to provide the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy McQuillan is discussing the development of Shannon Airport. Anything outside that would be irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and I fail to see why the Minister is becoming disturbed.  Of course, he is on a bad wicket at the moment. The Minister is responsible now for the Shannon area as an industrial centre.  He has the responsibility of ensuring that the money of the taxpayer is utilised in a proper manner and not wasted through any panic measures the Government may take to try to remedy a situation that should have been faced four or five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> While no members of this House will oppose measures to continue employment for the people of this area, at the same time it is the duty of those representing rural areas to suggest that priority is being given on the wrong lines of development. This in my opinion is the most desirable form of expansion at the moment. The priority list, as far as money is concerned, should be changed and other lines should receive far more attention than they do at present.</P>
    <P>If we take this area as being a likely depressed area in the case of Shannon being by-passed in the near future, we have automatically to take measures, I presume, to hold in employment those who will be displaced, but surely those people, particularly in the West of Ireland, who have been displaced during the past 20 years, also have a deserving case. Surely the huge numbers of people living in congested areas, which can only be discribed as depressed areas, for the last 30 years, have an equal right to have their position improved as the people in the Shannon area have.  None of us begrudges the idea of stabilising the position at Shannon but at the same time we are entitled to protest, on behalf of those people who have been living in miserable conditions for years past, that they are still being neglected.  I wonder why.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how that could be argued on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to suggest what could be in the Bill as well.  It is the only opportunity that we shall have on the Bill.  We shall not have it on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very specific and deals with the Shannon Airport area.  The Deputy is discussing conditions outside that area and it is doubtful if the Minister would have any responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the question of the Shannon area comes up&mdash;the <Col N="219" /> Shannon area in my opinion extends right up to Leitrim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of responsibility arises and the Minister for Transport and Power would not have responsibility in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Shannon Airport is clearly defined in the definition in the Bill.  We are all interested in that because we may have to prepare notes on the point dealt with by Deputy McQuillan.  The definition states&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;the airport&rsquo; means the entire area within the outer margin of the red line marked ABCDEFG on the map annexed to the Customs-Free Airport.&rdquo;  I think that clears up the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is also concerned with the responsibility of the Minister.  The Chair holds that Deputy McQuillan is discussing matters outside the Minister's responsibility altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir.  May I suggest&mdash;I have very little else to say on this matter&mdash;that I appreciate the intervention of Deputy Moloney who does not want to see this extended outside a very limited area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, actually Deputy Moloney does want to see this extended outside the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is scarcely a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the area is concerned I am entitled to suggest, and so is any other member of the House, that the limits imposed can be enlarged.  Any Deputy is entitled to suggest that the scope of the measure be widened to include areas outside the area immediately concerned.  I am entitled to suggest on this Reading of the Bill that its terms are too narrow and that when public moneys are involved, and a public company being set up, the Minister and his <Col N="220" /> Department should have raised their sights and included areas further afield than the particular locality mentioned and it could still be called the Shannon project.</P>
      <P>One last point.  Deputy Esmonde said that he objected to the idea of State interference in a matter like this and that it should be more or less for private enterprise.  He pointed out what has been achieved in the case of West Germany.  I think it should be clearly understood that the revival in West Germany to which he referred was brought about, to a great extent, by State interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is as a result of the efforts of the State and the help of the Government that West Germany is in a position to-day to sell back to private enterprise the shares in State and semi-State companies.  That is what took place. The position is that West Germany is a very wealthy country at the moment. Various concerns under Government or semi-Government control are now in process of being released from that control to private enterprise but, in the course of being released, a ceiling is being put on the number of shares that can be held by the people in these companies.  It is not being done in the same way as here, of dog eat dog. I suggest that if any progress is to be made here in the future the initial stages will have to be prepared or initiated by the State through various companies.  This is one such company. For that reason I welcome it even though to my mind the area could be enlarged and if desirable at a later stage, when progress has been made, that control can be eased, or I should say all the shares concerned could be made available over a very wide field if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that I am precluded from developing the points in connection with industrial expansion generally, all I will say is that I feel a measure of this nature, in so far as it is meant to attract industrialists from abroad, particularly from America, is five years too late.  Even so, now that it <Col N="221" /> has been produced I hope success will attend the efforts of those charged, even at this stage, with the task of salvaging.  The effort should have been made years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that discussions on a measure of this kind should as far as possible be strictly confined to the general limits of the legislation proposed under the Bill.  I note that the Bill before us is described as an Act to authorise the Minister for Finance to take up shares in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, and I take it that it is a measure to give the new Minister for Transport and Power the necessary authority to provide for what is required.  I think that quite a number of Deputies are somewhat at sea, as I am, in that we are not clear as to the area of operation.  The Bill indicates that the area in question is marked in red on a map with the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, and g.  I think we all have a fairly general idea that the area of operation of the company is Shannon Airport as we know it at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have occasion to go to Shannon note with satisfaction from time to time that a great deal of development is taking place in the area adjacent to the Airport.  Some Deputies who are inclined to look further ahead than others seem to think that Government anxiety at the moment is to provide a means of employment to offset any dislocation that may take place among existing staff at Shannon because of the threat to overfly it.  While it is understandable that Deputies should refer to that possibility, I think the least said about that at the moment, the better.  However, we do know that if overflying of Shannon takes place, that is a development which, generally speaking, is outside the control of the Government here.  It is obvious to everybody that anything the Government could do to entice the airlines to use Shannon to the fullest possible extent has been done, is being done, and will be done. But, if the Government have any reason to think that the overflying problem might dislocate the existing <Col N="222" /> trend of employment at Shannon, then the effort being made under this Bill is a very praiseworthy arrangement.</P>
    <P>For myself, I hope that preference for employment in any industries that will be set up by the Development Company will be given to any people who might be displaced from their existing employment.  I feel that substantial progress is being made by this State-sponsored Board at present. Only yesterday I was at Shannon and I was very glad to see that since my last visit a few months ago, several new factory buildings have been erected, and some more are in course of erection.  My business at Shannon was to see a German industrialist off from this country.  He had been here on a visit and deliberately came to Shannon yesterday, instead of Dublin, so that he might see the buildings that have recently been erected by the Development Company for leasing to industrialists anxious to come into the area.</P>
    <P>This German, whose family have been connected with industrial business in Germany for generations, and who are running a private family concern, told me that the type of factory being erected at Shannon was on the most modern lines.  In fact, this man has a project in mind for another part of the country and he came to Shannon to see the type of building the free Airport Authority have erected so that he might copy it.  I merely mention that point to indicate to the Minister that the company taking care of the matters entrusted to them in connection with the free airport development have made a very good start.</P>
    <P>Most times I am on the other side of the fence from Deputy McQuillan but on this measure I support him to a very great extent.  The Scope of this Shannon arrangement should be extended considerably.  In recent months, quite a lot of activity has taken place in connection with the purchase of land in areas adjacent to Shannon Airport. A number of farms have been bought up in trust by a firm of solicitors and the people in North Kerry, Clare and West Limerick are particularly anxious to know what is behind this new development.  Many <Col N="223" /> guesses have been forthcoming but that is not enough.  If the Minister is in a position to make any statement on that matter, I feel he might avail of the opportunity to do so when replying to the points made in this debate.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper that the people in these areas, and the people of the country generally, should be informed, at this stage, of the names and other relevant particulars of the interests engaged in the purchase of these lands, and the purpose for which they are being acquired.  The people of the areas where these lands are situated would welcome any industrial development that might ensue as a result of the taking over of the lands by this new body, but when several months have passed by without the identity of the purchasers being revealed, it is about time some statement were made on the matter at Government level.  I am glad to have got this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that he might deal with that point when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say except that I welcome the measure, not alone from the point of principle, but as being a very definite step forward by the Government in an endeavour to help a company which, in my opinion, has set out to do a very useful job at Shannon, and a company that has inspired confidence amongst the industrialists from foreign countries who come to Shannon with a view to setting up some form of industrial activity in that area.  I wish the company every success and I am glad that the Minister has introduced this measure to provide financial assistance to it to extend the scope of it activities. I think we can all look forward with a very high degree of confidence to the success of this Company in years to come, and I believe that when its progress is reviewed in four or five years' time, Deputies will have the satisfaction of knowing that it will have contributed in no small measure to the economy of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the House for the constructive <Col N="224" /> and friendly way in which they discussed the Second Reading of this Bill, and I am glad that the whole House supports the general character of the measure.  Deputy Cosgrave asked some questions about the construction of the company and I should say that up to now the capital already guaranteed under the State Guarantees Act has been £200,000.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Authority was constituted as a limited liability company rather than as a statutory body, such as Bord Fáilte or Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, because it was expected that it would have to engage directly in business such as the provision of aircraft handling services, the construction and leasing of factory space, the provision and maintenance of an industrial estate, and finally the provision of chartered air services to and from Shannon Airport.  Because it might have&mdash;and has in some cases&mdash;all those functions it was felt better to form a limited liability company.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave also asked for information on the character of the newly-established industries.  I think he will agree with me that the capital structure of these companies can be examined in the Companies' Registration office and that, in regard to the amount of capital invested by the companies, it is not usual to give private information of that sort.  There is a well established precedent for not doing so.  I need hardly say that the <i>bona fides</i> of all the promoters are carefully examined by the Shannon company and, as I indicated on the Second Reading, advice is sought from the Industrial Development Authority in order to ensure that industries are of a desirable character and that they do not compete with similar interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear in dealing with the development at Shannon that it is not my function to state here whether there should be a reduction in taxation or that other facilities should be granted for new industries in other parts of the country.  This company has been established to make the Shannon area unique as an industrial centre, to induce industries for whom <Col N="225" /> it is a benefit to import and export materials by air to come there if at all possible; to induce industries whose distribution is one which is better suited to air transport than to sea or land transport to set up factories.</P>
    <P>The objective of the company is to create a new idea in the world of an airport industrial area attuned to the idea of air transport linked with the conception of a great central stopping place for aircraft.  It is a new idea as far as I know, there is no other similar project and it is for that reason that special facilities are offered, that special taxation incentives are provided specifically to suit the circumstances of Shannon Airport and of no other area.</P>
    <P>Many things could be done at Shannon and all of them must be examined by the executives of the company and through market research and development.  For example, Shannon might become a centre for exhibitions and fairs or it might equally be found that it would not be possible to attract sufficient traffic to make that profitable, but it is essential to have a group of people who are specialists and who literally dream Shannon and eat and drink Shannon during the day, people who are real specialists in making the word &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; known all over the world and in inducing millions of people to &ldquo;drop in&rdquo; to Shannon.  They must create the idea in the minds of everybody who travels from east to west that they should stop at Shannon, that there are advantages there and equally to attract business men to bring industries where the near-by existence of an airport with customs-free facilities is attractive in their particular line of business.  That is the answer to Deputy Esmonde who suggested that we did not need to form another company for this purpose.  It would be quite impossible to ask An Foras Tionscal to become Shannon specialists: they could not do it; this requires a special Board and executives who know all the answers and who have enquiring minds and the ability to conduct market research and do advertising on a very extensive scale.</P>
    <P>The object is to give travellers the <Col N="226" /> impression that if they &ldquo;drop in&rdquo; at Shannon they can fish or hunt within 20 minutes or half an hour of the area, or that they can see, in anything from 20 minutes to two hours, the most beautiful scenery on God's earth; that they can see wonderful gardens; they can play golf, see old castles and meet pleasant people.  That is one of the objectives&mdash;to create that kind of impression.  It might be possible to establish all kinds of attractions at Shannon airport and that is a matter of market research and advertising.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Deputy Esmonde that we cannot take for granted that everyone knows about Shannon.  It is known as an international airport but the object is to make travellers want to land there and that will require advertising on a very considerable scale.  If you are going to advertise, you must have market research to find out what kind of advertising is likely to pay, and just how many people will &ldquo;drop in&rdquo; at Shannon as a result of spending a certain sum of money and what media to choose.  All that is specialist work and I was particularly concerned to make sure that there would be no lack of co-ordination between the Shannon Company, Bord Fáilte and C.I.E. and they have agreed to form a committee to work together so that there will be no overlapping, so that one executive will not be producing a whole series of leaflets with similar information to that produced by the Shannon Company and so that the whole effort can be directed towards increasing the number of travellers who land at Shannon for tourist or other purposes.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in speaking on the Bill providing the capital for Aerlinte, a number of market research companies and other authorities in America have estimated that there will be a given growth in traffic across the Atlantic in the course of the next three years and on the basis that 5 per cent. of those who travel by air across the Atlantic visit Ireland, we can envisage an increase in traffic which should make the jet service a profitable one for us eventually, other things being equal.  Examining the <Col N="227" /> whole situation of transatlantic traffic, it is obvious that we cannot automatically assume that because the number of air travellers is going to increase Shannon will get 5 per cent. all the time.  We must work very hard to establish the idea that it is worth while interrupting a fast jet service from New York to London or Paris to stop at Shannon.  We must establish that it is a pleasant thing to do, that there are advantages there, that it will mean a few unforgettable days of pleasant travel if the journey is interrupted. That is one of the supreme purposes underlying the formation of this company.</P>
    <P>I am answering a question in the Dáil to-day in regard to the scheduled winter services at Shannon Airport. Deputies will find that the reply is reasonably satisfactory and I think there is no need to deal with that here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked whether the industries established at Shannon are free to employ anybody or whether they must confine themselves to those who have become unemployed through any reduction in the number of landings. The answer is that, so far, nobody has become unemployed at Shannon as a result of any reduction in the number of flights and there is no rule of the kind Deputy Cosgrave envisaged.  Quite obviously, the company must be free to employ those whom they may regard as suitable for particular crafts and particular industrial operations.  Naturally, they would consider sympathetically people who were unemployed as a result of any changes at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked whether care would not have to be exercised in the design of industrial buildings erected in advance for a new industry.  I am given to understand that there have been six factory bays erected&mdash;four large and two small bays.  There are potential occupants for all.  These are standard types of industrial buildings but the company would be prepared to build structures for special purposes, if asked to do so.  So far anyway, no financial risk is believed to have been <Col N="228" /> taken in designing in advance buildings for industries coming to Shannon.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points raised during the course of the debate.  Once again, I should like to thank the House for the friendly reception which they have given to this measure which will provide sufficient capital and grounds to enable this company to go ahead and do a piece of vital national work which, I am sure, we all hope will be successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill provides that (a) the Minister for Transport and Power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time make a superannuation scheme or schemes for whole-time members of the Board of Coras Iompair Éireann; and (b) Coras Iompair Éireann be authorised to pay Mr. Thaddeus C. Courtney, a former Chairman of the Board, a sum of <Col N="229" /> £3,636 as compensation for the loss sustained by him by reason of his resignation as from 31st August, 1958, on the ground of ill-health, from the office of Chairman of the Board.  Mr. Courtney's period of office was not due to expire until 31st May, 1960.</P>
      <P>In the Transport Act, 1950, specific superannuation provision was made for Mr. Courtney, Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann.  The Act also provided superannuation benefits for other whole-time members of the Board.  In fact, this latter statutory provision has never been applied because, since the passing of the Act, the Chairman has been the only whole-time member of the Board.  The existing superannuation provisions in the Transport Act are not appropriate to the position of the present Chairman of the Board and accordingly substantial amendment of the Act would be necessary to cover his position.  I consider, however, that instead of, in future, legislating for named individuals, it is preferable to provide that power be given to enable the Minister for Transport and Power with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to prepare a superannuation scheme covering whole-time members, including the Chairman, of Coras Iompair Éireann. This course is in line with that adopted in legislation enacted since the passing of the Transport Act, 1950, in regard to the superannuation of whole-time members of semi-State bodies.  Similar provisions, for instance, are contained in the Turf Development Act, 1953.  This course avoids the necessity for amending Acts of the Oireachtas when there is a change of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that Dr. C.S. Andrews, the present Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann, was appointed for a period of five years beginning on 1st September, 1958.  He had previously had service with other State companies and for many years had been whole-time managing director of Bord na Móna where he had enjoyed the benefit of a superannuation scheme made under Section 5 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.  On his resignation from Bord na Móna, he lost <Col N="230" /> the right to superannuation benefit under the Bord na Móna scheme.  In equity, therefore, it will be necessary to provide in the superannuation scheme for Dr. Andrews that he be given credit for previous service with State bodies.  The scheme will be presented to the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
    <P>The superannuation position of Mr. T.C. Courtney in respect of the office of Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann is specifically provided for in the Second Schedule to the Transport Act, 1950, and, on resignation on the ground of ill-health, he became entitled to a pension of one-eightieth of his yearly salary for each completed year of pensionable service (subject to a maximum of one-half of the yearly salary) together with a gratuity of one-thirtieth of the yearly salary for each completed year of pensionable service subject to a maximum of 1½ times the yearly salary.  On his resignation on 31st August, 1958, Mr. Courtney had not become entitled either to the amount of the pension or retirement gratuity which he would have earned if he had continued in office until 31st May, 1960, when his term of office would have expired.  His resignation, therefore, before the expiry of his term of office meant that he obtained a reduced pension and reduced retirement gratuity.  It also involved him in the loss, for the balance of the period, of the difference between his pension and his salary as Chairman. It has been calculated that this loss amounts to £3,636 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I am anxious to find out is this: Both the present <Col N="232" /> chairman and the previous chairman had Civil Service service for which they were entitled to certain superannuation. Is it clear that this section will apply only to persons with superannuation service elsewhere and that it will not be possible under it to appoint a chairman for 12 months and then superannuate him unless he has had previous service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the superannuation scheme depends on the duration of appointment of the chairman. If the chairman is appointed for five years, he would have to serve for five years to earn any superannuation and, of course, the superannuation for a period of five years would not be very great.</P>

      <P>The purpose of subsection (1) of Section 42 is to provide for investigation by an apprenticeship committee of disputes between apprentices and employers.  It is visualised that these disputes might arise mainly out of the interpretation of rules, for example, those relating to training, dismissal, et cetera.

    <P>With your permission, Sir, I should like to take amendments Nos. 41 and 42 together.  The purpose of Section 47 is to facilitate the transfer of an apprentice from one employer to another where an apprenticeship committee is satisfied that this should be done in certain circumstances.  The section as drafted could be interpreted as meaning that an apprenticeship committee could facilitate transfers only within its own apprenticeship district.  The joint committee of the workers' and employers' interests, as a <Col N="234" /> result of their examination of the section, have recommended that it should be made clear that transfers can be arranged from an employer in one apprenticeship district to an employer in another.  This might be required, say, in the case of an apprentice whose family moved from one part of the country to another.</P>

The joint committee pointed out that in some industries&mdash;for example, the building industry&mdash;the employer's business might be widely dispersed and might have a number of entrances.  They recommended that the section should be amended to provide that the notices will be displayed in prominent places instead of at the principal entrances.

      <P>From the way it is phrased at the moment, I understand that the consent of the Comhairle <Col N="239" /> must be secured before proceedings can be taken.  Assuming either an employer or an apprentice feels he has a case which should be investigated and that the matter should be taken into the courts, it is brought before the Comhairle.  If it is decided on the basis of employers' and workers' representation, the Comhairle might divide evenly and the matter might have to be decided by the chairman. It is probably putting an undue burden on an individual to have to decide a matter which might or might not be a question of law.  I suggest that, between now and the Report Stage, the Minister might consider whether some means could be provided under which a person aggrieved would have the right to appeal to a court for a decision in the matter.</P>

    <P>(a)  any provisions of an employment agreement then in force registered in the Register which relate to the number of persons to be taken into employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade, for which the committee is established, in the district of the committee, and</P>
    <P>(b)  any provisions of an order then in force made by the Labour Court under section 43 of the Act which relate to the number of persons to be taken into such employment in that trade and in that district,</P>
    <P>shall cease to have effect in that district during that period.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where an employment agreement is, at a time when rules under this Act are in force, registered in the Register, any provisions of the agreement which relate to matters the subject of the rules shall not have effect in any apprenticeship district in which the rules have effect.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an employment agreement is, at any time during a period specified by an apprenticeship committee under subsection (1) of section 35 of this Act, registered in the Register, any provisions of the agreement which relate to the number of persons to be taken into employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade, for which the committee is established, in the district of the committee shall not have effect in that district during the unexpired portion of that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> (5)  Where an order is, at a time when rules under this Act are in force, made by the Labour Court under section 43 of the Act, any provisions of the order which relate to matters the subject of the rules shall not have effect in any apprenticeship district in which the rules have effect.</P>
    <P>(6)  where an order is, at any time during a period specified by an apprenticeship committee under subsection (1) of section 35 of this Act, made by the Labour Court under section 43 of the Act, any provisions of the order which relate to the number of persons to be taken into employment by way of apprenticeship in the trade, for which the committee is established, in the district of the committee shall not have effect in that district during the unexpired portion of that period.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the Register&rdquo; means the Register of Employment Agreements maintained by the Labour Court under section 26 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, certain agreements registered with the Labour Court and Employment Regulation Orders made by the Court are enforceable at law. Matters touching on apprenticeship are sometimes covered by these agreements and Orders.  The purpose of Section 60 is to ensure that nothing in such agreements or Orders dealing with apprenticeship shall have precedence over rules made by An Chomhairle or by an Apprenticeship Committee.</P>
    <P>The section, as originally drafted, applied only to matters covered by rules made under the Bill.  It is also necessary, however, that the section should apply to decisions taken by an Apprenticeship Committee under Section 35 relating to the number of apprentices to be taken into employment in the specified period.  The section has been re-drafted to take account of this point.  This amendment, in effect, substitutes a new section for the existing Section 60.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to improve in certain respects the machinery provided by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, for the investigation of restrictive trade practices and for the taking of remedial action in respect of those practices which are found to be unfair or to operate against the public interest.</P>
      <P>It may be of assistance to the House in considering the Bill if I recall briefly the main provisions of the Act of 1953.  That Act provided for the establishment of the Fair Trade Commission, and the Commission was duly set up with effect from 12th June, 1953.  The Commission have the power to investigate restrictive trade practices in regard to the supply and distribution of goods and the rendering, in the course of carrying on any trade or business, of any services affecting such supply or distribution. In the discharge of their functions, the Commission are empowered to summon witnesses and examine them on oath and they may require a witness to produce any documents in his power or control.  Witnesses before the Commission are entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if they were witnesses before the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation of restrictive practices may be approached by the Commission in two different ways. First, the Commission may prepare and publish rules&mdash;known as fair trading rules&mdash;representing, in the opinion of the Commission, fair trading conditions with regard to the supply and distribution of any kind of goods and the rendering of any services <Col N="243" /> affecting such supply or distribution. Such rules have not the force of law, but they represent a code of conduct for the particular trades concerned. The trade interests involved have the opportunity of voluntarily adhering to the rules and abandoning unfair restrictive practices.  The Commission are obliged to keep under review the operation of fair trading rules and to report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the rules are not being observed.  The second method which the Commission may adopt for the investigation of restrictive practices is to hold a public enquiry into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of the goods concerned.  The Commission may hold such an enquiry on their own initiative, and they must do so if the Minister so requests.  The Commission are required to submit to the Minister a report of every enquiry.</P>
    <P>A report submitted to the Minister by the Commission in relation to the non-observance of fair trading rules, or following the holding of a public enquiry, must describe the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of the goods concerned. The report must indicate whether these conditions prevent or restrict competition or restrain trade or involve resale price maintenance. If, in the opinion of the Commission, any such interference with trade or competition is unfair or operates against the public interest the report must given reasons for the Commission's conclusions.  The Minister, having considered such a report, may make an Order prohibiting specified arrangements, agreements or practices in the trade concerned.  An Order so made by the Minister does not have the force of law unless and until it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To date 19 sets of fair trading rules have been made relating to the supply and distribution of a wide variety of commodities, and six public enquiries have been held in relation to the supply and distribution of radio and television sets, building materials, motor vehicles, grocery goods, chemists' preparations and carpets. <Col N="244" /> Reports of all six enquiries have been submitted to the Minister, and five of these have been published.  The other report, relating to carpets, is at present under consideration by me. Orders have been made in relation to the supply and distribution of radio and television sets, building materials, motor cars and grocery goods.  In the case of chemists' preparations, the Commission recommended the making of an Order, but the then Minister decided not to act on the Commission's recommendation as he felt that an Order on the lines recommended would not entail any marked alteration in the manner in which the trade was being conducted.  The operation of the Orders relating to motor cars and radio and television sets has been reviewed by the Commission, and reports have been submitted in this matter to the Minister.  In both instances the Commission's recommendation was that the Order should not be altered, and this recommendation was accepted.</P>
    <P>In regard to goods which are subject neither to Orders nor fair trading rules, the Commission give advice, on request, to manufacturers and traders and seek by negotiation to procure a satisfactory settlement of complaints concerning the operation of restrictive practices.  The Commission also keep themselves informed of new ideas and developments in regard to restrictive trade practices in other countries and maintain relations with other similar bodies abroad.</P>
    <P>An examination has been carried out of the operation of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, in the light of experience over the past six years. In the course of the examination, consideration was given to the question whether legislation embodying a different approach to restrictive trade practices, such as is followed in some other countries, would be more suitable to conditions here.  The conclusion reached was that the fundamental structure of the 1953 Act has stood the test of experience and that it should be retained.  The Act has undoubtedly enabled substantial progress to be made in a relatively short time in eliminating some of the more objectionable <Col N="245" /> features of restrictive practices in many trades.  Experience has shown, however, that some modifications of the Act are desirable in relation to the scope of public enquiries and the procedure for the review by the Commission of the operation of Ministerial Orders.</P>
    <P>A public inquiry must deal with all the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of the goods, and all restrictive practices affecting their supply and distribution. This arrangement precludes the holding of an inquiry of limited scope, for example, an inquiry confined to one particular practice.  I consider it desirable that the Commission should be empowered to hold such limited inquiries and Section 2 of this Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The review of the operation of existing Orders is obviously an important part of the Commission's functions. Conditions in trades are liable to change and it is desirable that the effect of Orders should be closely watched by the Fair Trade Commission. The 1953 Act requires the Commission to keep the operation of Orders under review and provides that the Commission may submit to the Minister a report in the matter together with their recommendations as to what action should be taken.  If a report by the Commission should indicate the necessity for amending an Order, it would be necessary to have a further public inquiry.</P>
    <P>This procedure for the amendment of Orders is cumbersome and unsatisfactory. I have considered this difficulty and I am satisfied that it can be surmounted by the introduction of the new procedure which is provided for in Section 6 of this Bill.  That section provides that the Commission may on their own initiative, and shall, at my request, hold a special review of the operation of an Order.  The Commission are required to publish notice of their intention to hold a special review and give interested parties an opportunity of making submissions in relation to the subject matter of the review. It will be open to any interested person to ask the Commission to hold a <Col N="246" /> public inquiry instead of a special review, and if the Commission decide against holding a public inquiry, they must inform the party concerned of the reasons for their decision.</P>
    <P>The Commission will be required to submit to the Minister a report of every special review and, if they are of opinion that the relevant Order should be amended, they must recommend accordingly and indicate the form of amending Order which they consider necessary.  A copy of the Report of every special review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I propose to take advantage of this occasion to introduce a new provision authorising the Fair Trade Commission to investigate restrictive practices imposed by employers or employees affecting the use of specific materials or methods for manufacturing or construction purposes.  Section 4 of the Bill provides the Commission with the necessary power to undertake enquiries into these matters.  Enquiries of this kind may be undertaken only at my request.</P>
    <P>In essence, the aim of Section 4 is to enable the Commission to investigate complaints that restrictive practices relating to the use of specific materials or methods prevent the reasonable development of trade and business and inflate costs.  It is not the intention that Orders will be made on receipt of a report from the Commission dealing with practices of this kind.</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that it will serve a useful purpose if practices of the kind involved are enquired into and reported on by an impartial body such as the Fair Trade Commission. As stated in last year's Government White Paper on Economic Expansion, restrictive practices, whether by employers or labour, inflate costs of production and distribution and retard the expansion of output and employment. The development of the economy depends on our being able to offset the competitive advantages of other countries by more efficient production.  It is essential, therefore, that restrictive practices of this nature be abolished and it will be an object <Col N="247" /> of Government policy to secure enlightened co-operation towards this end.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also for a few minor amendments of the Act of 1953 which are, in the main, consequential on the principal amendments which I have already mentioned.  I am satisfied that this Bill will improve the procedure established by the Act of 1953 for the investigation of restrictive trade practices and for the elimination of those practices which are unfair and are against the public interest.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are any objections to the proposed amendments.  There are, however, two matters arising out of the Minister's remarks to which I want to refer.  The Minister referred to the Order dealing with motor cars and I should be glad to know if he can say why the cost here of assembled cars is so high when no purchase tax is payable, whereas in Britain purchase tax is operative. Can he say whether the unassembled cars cost more here and, if so, what is the reason for their costing more? What other factors are responsible for the price of cars being high here, as compared with Britain, where the purchase tax is operative.  The difference is very slight and the purchase tax there is quite a considerable element in the price structure.</P>
      <P>Section 4 empowers the Commission to cause an inquiry to be held</P>
      <P>&ldquo;whenever so requested by the Minister ... into the refusal or alleged refusal by employers or employees (or any combination of employers or of employees or of employers and employees) to use particular materials or particular methods for manufacturing or construction purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will this section apply to a problem such as that which exists for container traffic at the Port of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some welcome features, if not precisely in the Bill, in the Minister's statement, <Col N="248" /> upon which I should like to comment. The first is the proposal for improving the machinery for the review of Orders.  That is a move which is highly desirable.  Orders in the administrative way, and perhaps particularly affecting trade and commerce, are made by the Minister on the advice of his Department in particular circumstances. Nobody will complain that these matters, which are made the subject of an Order, are not gone into to the best of the Department's ability. What can happen&mdash;and I have no way of knowing how frequently it can happen&mdash;is that an Order is made in a particular set of circumstances.  Grant for the moment it is the best in those circumstances, but changing circumstances bring about another situation and it could be that within a comparatively short space of time there is occasion for its review.</P>
      <P>It is true that at present if representations are made to the Department, Orders and circumstances will be reviewed, but perhaps the very fact that one sometimes has to wait for specific representations makes the problem all the more difficult.  A routine, if I may call it so, or a systematic scheme for the revision of such administrative orders is called for and, in so far as the Minister's proposal moves in that direction, it is a very welcome one, and one which will commend itself to the public in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it may be argued that there will be uncertainties in the situation.  It may be argued that an Order favours an interest that had an element of uncertainty right from the beginning, but specifically, if it is a question of a duty or an Order of that nature, I do not know whether these would come within the category considered here.  I am talking of Orders generally, and they should be reviewed. If an Order of that nature is made, it is made for the benefit of the community as a whole and, inevitably, for the benefit of some active section of the community.  If, when it is made, there is, so to speak, a threat over it that it will be unmade, it may be argued that that takes away from the advantage of the Order in the first <Col N="249" /> instance.  I do not think that is so. The actual position is that any ordinary Order can be unmade and this provision does not in any way affect those circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the provision for review as well as being administratively of help to the Department is good from the public point of view and the Minister's attitude is to be commended.  There is something else that appeals to me in the second remark of the Minister.  It is in regard to public inquiry.  A person can call for a public inquiry and if he does not get it, he must get the reasons. That is both a good and a courageous provision.  It is a good thing that, wherever possible, information on public matters is available to the public and that the reasons for decisions affecting the public should be given to the public.  It is one of the safeguards of a democratic system.</P>
    <P>Within all reason&mdash;the reasonable demands of administration; you cannot have a public inquiry to determine everything and everybody realises that&mdash;the provision for doing these things in public and doing as much of the administrative business of the State in public is a good one. Further, as that, to some extent, recognises that principle, the Minister's remarks in that regard should be underlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the very difficult and, one might say, touchy problem of internal restrictive practices, restrictive practices touching production.  As everybody with experience of them knows, they are difficult problems and cannot even simply be stated.  There are so many pros and cons in any particular case that you take up that it is extremely difficult to legislate, even in the particular instance, let alone generally.  It has to be recognised that at the present day any restrictions on useful production here must be extremely embarrassing to our economy.  Under present conditions and if peacetime conditions are to continue, as we all hope they will, we can live as a community only if we are competitive now.  That means that, insofar as our exports are <Col N="250" /> concerned, the wherewithal with which we earn our livelihood, we must be competitive and if it is only a matter of internal costs and a matter of living within our means, we must be equally competitive.  It means new methods, in many cases.  It means modernising processes, and so on.  Perhaps it would not be the best time to go into the details of some of these things but, in those circumstances, it inevitably means problems of the nature the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this Fair Trade Commission will be in a position to deal effectively with this matter. We can understand the caution of the Minister's statement in regard to it. Although some people might say now at this stage that there has been too much caution, this problem is best solved in a spirit of co-operation for the ultimate well-being of the community as a whole rather than legislate for such things, and therefore the Minister has been cautious.  Nevertheless, it is a nettle that in some way or another will have to be grasped, if we are to get ahead.</P>
    <P>Insofar as this commission may perhaps allow some examination of the problem and inform the Department, if nothing else, of specific circumstances, it is perhaps a useful mode.  I hope I am not misinterpreting the position when I suggest that it is to be the function of the Fair Trade Commission in this regard.  Perhaps an impartial or detached body which has the power to make these inquiries and can find out the circumstances in particular cases will be a useful thing.  I only hope it will be usefully operated in such a regard.  I do not think that in present circumstances I would help by being more specific.  I think I can understand why the Minister has not been more specific in this, either.</P>
    <P>With the recognition that competitive trade is essential to our economic setup&mdash;we have to live in a competitive world; maximum efficiency has to be attained at home for two reasons. namely, for the export reason and from the point of view of home costs, home employment and all these other things that are involved&mdash;this Bill, if <Col N="251" /> properly administered&mdash;I do not mean to be censorious when I say that but it will require a good deal of intelligent administration to make it effective&mdash; will be a real contribution to the problems of our time.</P>
    <P>Especially in the Minister's speech do I find something which, as I mention a few points, gives us a lead in our thought on this matter.  With regard to the latter problems&mdash;the problems affecting production, whether you call them restrictive practices or whether it is fear of investment, on the one hand, or fear of loss of employment, on the other hand, whatever they may mean, these problems which stifle improvement in production methods and inhibit the greater production which is required&mdash;if some move can be made at first to inform us and the Minister and the Department accurately in such matters, then that is perhaps the best move that can be made initially towards grappling with these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an opportunity when we must review generally the operation of the restrictive trade practices legislation in order to decide whether the amendment now before the House is in order and whether it is sufficient.  I have stated before here and must state again now that the operation of this legislation, to my mind, leaves very much to be desired and to some extent appears to be based on a complete misconception of the ultimate public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech this morning, the Minister, when referring to reports submitted to him by the Commission, said the report must indicate whether the conditions as set up prevent or restrict competition or restrict trade or involve resale price maintenance. We have already had a report from the Fair Trade Commission on cross-Channel freight rates in which it was disclosed that these freight rates were arranged collectively by all the various transport concerns involved and it was stated by the members of the Fair Trade Commission that, in their view, this collective price fixing was not contrary to the public interest.  In spite of that we find this constant reference to <Col N="252" /> the iniquity of retail price maintenance by a supplier.  This view, adopted by the Fair Trade Commission, with the full backing of State legislation, has resulted in cut-price shops being set up all over the country to the great detriment of those engaged in legitimate trade who are performing a useful service to the public and providing proper conditions of employment for their staff.</P>
    <P>Anyone who tries to maintain a retail price is apparently condemned outright.  I myself had a discussion with the Fair Trade Commission on this point.  I pointed out to them, in regard to my own business, that retail price maintenance of motor vehicles was still being attempted and though I was informed this was strictly illegal and was not happening, the member to whom I was speaking eventually agreed that there was some price maintenance in the motor trade.  He could only explain that he did not know of it officially; he knew of it unofficially and was proceeding to take no action.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a hopeless way of running such an organisation as the Fair Trade Commission.  It is unjust to say that the activities of the Commission so far have been of any great service to the public.  The Order made in respect of builders' providers caused chaos and confusion in that trade, which was a legitimate trade, and caused a great deal of unemployment. It caused chaos and confusion in the motor trade also and resulted in unemployment, leading to the setting up of people in the motor trade who were unqualified, who did not employ properly qualified staff and who could not give proper service to the public.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a misconception that retail price maintenance is an abomination and against the public interest.  I deny that absolutely and I think a mounting degree of public opinion is being directed against the activities of cut-price establishments. Unless and until the Minister really grapples with this and informs the Fair Trade Commission by legislation or otherwise, that retail price maintenance is not necessarily against <Col N="253" /> the public interest, this situation can only cause further hardship to staff and further dislocation to business generally with disimprovement in service to the public.</P>
    <P>If it is permissible for the large transport organisations collectively to fix freight rates for cross-channel freight, I cannot see why it is illegal or improper for a supplier or a distributor to fix the retail price at which the goods shall be sold to the public and which will give to the retailer a reasonable margin of profit which is essential if he is to stay in business.  I make no excuse for pleading that profit should be made in the retail trade because anyone who runs a business otherwise than on a profitable basis is heading for trouble.  He cannot provide security of employment for his staff and he cannot make any provision for expansion in the business giving increased employment.</P>
    <P>The whole procedure by which matters are referred to the Fair Trade Commission needs further review.  I would much prefer that investigation should be undertaken by the Fair Trade Commission only where the Minister has satisfied himself that it is in the public interest that such an inquiry should be carried out.  I am disappointed that there is not in the proposed amendment some restriction of the right to hold an inquiry. Anyone who is in business will know that you are apt from time to time to run into an awkward customer.  A typical case occurred in my own business only a few weeks ago where we had supplied a vehicle under certain conditions to a motor dealer.  He did not propose to conform with the conditions on which the vehicle had been supplied, which were conditions that were not repugnant to any fair trading rules.  However, his reaction, when we tried to restrict him in his activities was immediately to say: &ldquo;If you do not do what I want you to do I shall report you to the Fair Trade Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many reasons which one can give for refusing to supply an article to another trader but all the time you have the threat being held <Col N="254" /> over you that if you do not supply an article to a certain person he will report you to the Fair Trade Commission. Then you get into a long and rambling discussion with the Fair Trade Commission to justify your action.  I do not see why people in business should be compelled to submit to cross-examination of their ordinary trading methods unless it can be clearly established that they are acting improperly or against the public interest.</P>
    <P>At the moment anyone may be summoned before the Fair Trade Commission and asked to account for his actions.  In the particular case to which I refer, only a few minutes after we had put the 'phone down we got a 'phone call from the Fair Trade Commission to say: &ldquo;We require a full explanation as to why you are not prepared to supply a motor car to a certain person.&rdquo;  We explained to them the situation as we saw it.  They said they would look into it further.  They made further inquiries, 'phoned us back and we gave them further information. At the heel of the hunt they said: &ldquo;We have now satisfied ourselves that, in all the circumstances, you were completely justified in what you did.&rdquo;  That was a complete waste of public time and money as well as my own time and money simply because a man who had a personal grievance against my firm used the machinery of the Fair Trade Commission to try to put pressure on my firm to do business with him which we were not prepared to do.</P>
    <P>That was not the purpose for which the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1953 was passed.  In actual fact, I do not believe that any real restrictive trade practices have been revealed or been stopped by reason of the Orders made under this Act so far, but the maximum amount of dislocation to business has been caused.  I say that speaking as an employer but it has also caused the maximum amount of dislocation to members of the staff in well-established businesses.  I cannot see that there has been any reduction in costs by reason of the activities of the Commission and I do not think there will be either.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I hope the Minister, either now or at a later date will reconsider the whole question of this legislation just as the price control legislation was considered last year.  I was very much in support of that legislation which completely wiped out price control except where the Minister was satisfied that some element of price control should be reinstated.  In the same way, there are undoubtedly restrictive trade practices both on the part of employers and employees and it is probably wise that there should be some Act which would enable the Minister to take action where he decides that the public is being adversely affected.  However, the present situation is that anyone who is aggrieved because of non-supply or because of price may raise the father and mother of a row through the Fair Trade Commission which will get nobody anywhere.</P>
    <P>If it was necessary to approach the Minister in the first place to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry, a lot of public time and money would be saved and quite a lot of unnecessary dislocation of ordinary trade and business would be avoided.  The Minister is working very hard to make this legislation work.  I feel that he has not gone far enough and I hope that as he becomes more settled in his new appointment&mdash;which is one of the most difficult in the Government&mdash;he will keep this whole matter under constant review to see whether the whole purpose of this legislation is in fact being carried out.  I am satisfied that it is not.  I should hope that a full and constant inquiry by the Minister and his staff would reveal that further amendment is still necessary if this legislation is likely to prove effective in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to oppose the present amendment in any way but I feel in all conscience I must use this opportunity to protest against the unforeseen development which has taken place. It has resulted in cut-price shops, in sub-standard conditions of employment and a very low standard of service to the public by those engaged in this practice.  I hope the Minister will keep these matters under review and I sincerely <Col N="256" /> hope it will not be too long before he sees his way to recommending to the Government a further and much more drastic review of this legislation generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to ask the Minister one question.  On page 6 of the typescript of his speech, he says in the first paragraph:&mdash;&ldquo;I propose to take advantage of the occasion afforded by this Bill to introduce a new provision authorising the Fair Trade Commission to investigate restrictive practices imposed by employers or employees affecting the use of specific materials or methods for manufacturing or construction purposes.&rdquo;  Would the Minister make clear, whether this section merely applies to methods of manufacturing or construction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that we in this country are not unique in having this system designed to offset restrictive practices. Most countries have a similar problem and have legislation designed to deal with it.  As regards the Fair Trade Commission, I do not think it can be alleged that it acts indiscriminately or without full regard, not only for the public interest but for vested interests, if I could call them such.  The suggestion that any complaints to be investigated by the Commission should first be submitted to the Minister in order to obviate public waste of time or public expense is hardly justified because the Minister if he received such complaints, would have to submit them for examination to some group of officers in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think no body is better equipped under present circumstances than those who have been specially appointed for such a purpose and who have experience of dealing with these matters. If the Minister was first required to examine each complaint before permitting the Fair Trade Commission to take it up, I do not think it would in any way avoid waste of time or expense or indeed, as Deputy Booth suggests, eliminate possible annoyance to businessmen, manufacturers or anybody else because the questions that would be asked by the Fair Trade <Col N="257" /> Commission would have to be asked by the Minister or his officers.</P>
    <P>I want to say that there is no general condemnation by the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Fair Trade Commission of price maintenance. It is widely admitted, however, that price maintenance does in some respects create a problem and in some respects does operate against the public interest.  It is only in cases where the Minister or the Fair Trade Commission is satisfied that there is such a danger to public interests that Orders are made and ultimately confirmed by legislation passed in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked, in relation to the cost of motor cars in this country, whether there might be any degree of price maintenance or, I imagine he suggested too, of restrictive practices.  I think it must be admitted that the duty on the imported parts of motor cars must have some effect on the price of cars assembled in this country.  The fact that the number of motor cars assembled here is by comparison with Britain, so small might also in some way account for the greater cost of production.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether this legislation was designed to apply to the particular problem of container traffic.  In the first instance, as I think I explained, Section 4, which provides for inquiry by the Commission into refusal by employers or employees in manufacturing and construction to handle certain goods, can be applied only at the specific request of the Minister.  It is not my intention to request the Fair Trade Commission to consider the specific problem of container traffic.  The obvious reason is that it is well-known that the Labour Court is actively considering this question at the moment and it is hoped that it will be able ultimately to produce a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera was quite right in saying that the matters sought to be dealt with under Section 4 are very difficult and complex.  One has to be realistic and accept that such practices do exist and that, so long as there is machinery for investigating whether <Col N="258" /> or not they do exist and for highlighting their existence, something would have to be done to deal with the problem.  The intention here is not so much to legislate against these practices but, first of all, to establish whether or not they exist and, in that manner, to highlight them and then, if possible, by inducement and by an effort to get a degree of co-operation, to eliminate them.  That is the extent to which this legislation goes and Deputy de Valera was right in appreciating that there had to be some caution and some reserve exercised in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Corish's question, manufacturing and construction are specifically referred to in Section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Its purpose is to transfer Johnstown Castle Agricultural College from my Department to An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July, 1945, when the then Minister for Agriculture moved the Second Reading of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Bill, 1945, he expressed to the donors, Mr. Maurice Victor Lakin and Mrs. Dorothy Violet Jefferies, the Dáil's appreciation of their generosity in presenting Johnstown Castle and its demesne to the <Col N="259" /> nation.  I think I can say that very good use has been made of the property. During the fourteen years which have elapsed since the property passed to the Department of Agriculture, Johnstown Castle Agricultural College has acquired an international reputation as a scientific centre.  The lands, nearly 1,000 acres in extent, have been used by my Department for the conduct of extensive and detailed programmes of field experiments touching on very important aspects of practical agriculture.  Since my Department took possession of the property, roughly £250,000 has been spent by the State on its development, including the provision of buildings and equipment for the well known Soils Laboratory there.  The total staff employed there at present is over 140.</P>
    <P>Now that An Foras Talúntais has been set up for the purpose of furthering agricultural research, it is considered desirable to transfer the College and Estate to it.  I have already transferred to the Institute the Department's farm at Grange, County Meath, which had been used for research on cattle breeding and which now forms the headquarters of the Institute's Division of Grassland Research.  I have also transferred the Peatland Experimental Station at Glenamoy, County Mayo, and certain facilities my Department had from Bórd na Móna at Derrybrennan and Clonsast bogs.  In each of these cases, all the Department's buildings, with the equipment and stock on the lands at the date of transfer, were also handed over without charge.</P>
    <P>The transfer of the Department's properties at Grange and Glenamoy did not require special legislation.  The position in regard to Johnstown Castle is different.  This property was donated to the country to be held by the State for the purposes of a lay agricultural college, and was accepted as such by the Act of 1945.  In order to vary the terms of the trust and Statute so as to permit the transfer of the property to An Foras Talúntais, and its further development by that body as a research centre, it is necessary to amend the 1945 Act.  The donors have, of course, been consulted and have agreed to the <Col N="260" /> transfer.  We are very grateful to them for their agreement.</P>
    <P>In giving his consent, Mr. Lakin has asked that certain conditions be observed, and I have accepted these. They are, so far as is necessary, included in the Bill.  He has asked that, in order to preserve the architectural quality and historic interest of the castle and its surroundings, no exterior demolition or alteration to the castle or the main gates shall be undertaken without consulting him, and that no construction shall be undertaken within view of the castle or of the main avenues which is not architecturally in harmony with the castle.  This is provided for in Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>He has also asked that the present Jubilee Nurse who, by virtue of the 1945 Act, occupies a cottage free of rent and rates on the estate, should retain tenure of the cottage on the same terms for her lifetime.  This is covered by Section 5 of the Bill.  In addition, the Institute has undertaken to make certain improvements to the cottage at Mr. Lakin's request.  It has also been thought desirable to safeguard certain interests of the donors by specifying in particular that Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Act of 1945 shall continue in operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the safeguards granted to the former employees of the Johnstown Estate who were taken over by the Department in 1945 shall not be affected by their transfer to the service of the Institute.</P>
    <P>Under the Counterpart Agreement with the United States Government in regard to An Foras Talúntais, the Irish Government has undertaken to make grants annually to An Foras, in respect of any services transferred to it from my Department, of amounts not less than the amounts currently spent by the State on such services before they were transferred.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle Agricultural College has been one of the proudest possessions of my Department, and I am certain that under the new Institute it will earn even greater lustre not only for itself but for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the provisions <Col N="261" /> of this Bill.  I should like to avail of the occasion of its being presented to the House to recall with pride certain facts relating to Johnstown Castle.  One is that it was originally built by the ancestors of a member of our Party, Sir John Esmonde, and in the very recent past it was owned and occupied by family connections.  That is a fortuitous circumstance and I am glad to observe that the Minister in the course of his introductory remarks said:</P>
      <P>During the 14 years which have elapsed since the property passed to the Department of Agriculture, Johnstown Castle Agricultural College has acquired an international reputation as a scientific centre.</P>
      <P>I think that is true and I want to recall here in Dáil Éireann that that international reputation as a scientific centre, of which I saw abundant evidence when I was Minister for Agriculture, was acquired while this Institute was under the direction of the Department of Agriculture.  I believe that all the trained personnel, including the Director of the Agricultural Institute itself, were trained in their present skills in the service of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to suggest to some of those who are given to thoughtless and ill-informed criticism of the Department of Agriculture to realise that if they have to-day an Institute which, in the words of the Minister, has an international reputation as a scientific centre, that was built up from nothing except a house with 1,000 acres of land into what it is to-day, under the direction and control of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I am very proud of what Johnstown Castle is to-day.  Deputies and the public at large should not forget that it is merely one more of the very distinguished achievements of our Department of Agriculture quietly worked upon and completed as a result of very hard labour, great skill and distinguished public service by those who helped to build up this scientific centre of international repute from nothing into what it is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> The Minister refers to the well-known Soil Laboratory that is functioning there at present.  I can well recall that in 1947 the entire soil testing facilities of this country then existing were of a very primitive kind in one room at Ballyhaise Agricultural College in County Cavan.  We have today in Johnstown, I think, a soil testing service which is equal, if not superior, to that available to any other country in the world, but that is only one part of a vast complex of work that is proceeding at Johnstown Castle at present and every bit of that work was inaugurated, all the equipment for that work was provided and the vast bulk of the personnel trained and recruited by the Department of Agriculture, to their eternal credit.</P>
    <P>The Minister also refers to the fact that in the recent past he has transferred the Peatlands Experimental Station at Glenamoy, County Mayo, certain facilities developed by the Department of Agriculture and Bord na Mona at Derrybrennan and Clonsast and also the farm at Grange.  All that was also assembled by the Department of Agriculture and I recall these facts today for the purpose of expressing the sincere hope that An Foras Talúntais will render as good an account of their stewardship at the end of 15 years as the Department of Agriculture is entitled to be proud to render today when this Institute is being handed over to the Agricultural Institute.</P>
    <P>I note the special conditions mentioned by the Minister which, I understand, are a necessary part as the basis of the agreement under which these premises were acquired by the generous gift of the donors but I should like to ask the Minister about one detail.  Section 9 of the Bill provides that subsection (3) of Section 14 of the An Foras Talúntais Act, 1958, shall not apply in respect of the estate.  That section means that the Institute may not sell or lease any land or other property held by it and no longer required for the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>Possibly it is necessary in order to secure agreement to insert that provision but it could be a material inconvenience. <Col N="263" /> If it is necessary it can be got over, but we can well imagine that it might suit the Institute on some future occasion to exchange one piece of land for another or to do whatever is necessary to make it part of the ground necessary for the widening of a road or some necessary local service in which the Institute would wish to play its part.</P>
    <P>I can remember questions arising when I was Minister for Agriculture about local charities and local activities where ordinarily a property of the size of the Institute would be expected to play its part and I seem to remember we made exceptional provisions so that the local charity or amenity would not suffer as a result of this large property being in the hands of the State.  The College was allowed to make whatever would be the normal contribution to whatever local activity was proceeding.  I could see here that if the Institute is forbidden by statute from ever selling anything or leasing any part of its property, even where that part is unnecessary for the work of the Institute, difficulties might arise which could not at this time be foreseen.  I mentioned one type.  If there was a road-straightening operation going on in this area and it suddenly became apparent that we had overriden by statute the general proviso that a tenant can make a strip of land available for public works of that kind, we might be involved in an embarrassment that could be avoided if it were foreseen.</P>
    <P>However, the circumstances surrounding Johnstown Castle are peculiar and I recognise that if you want to accept a gift of this kind, it very often carries conditions with it. Whether that is an essential condition or not I do not know it is a matter into which the Minister may look at his convenience.  I advise the House to pass this Bill and in passing it to pay a tribute to our incomparable Department of Agriculture on another of the very many enormous achievements it has to its credit, and for which it rarely gets thanks from the people whom it serves.</P>
    <Col N="264" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be superfluous to repeat what has been said by the Minister for Agriculture and by his predecessor in their tributes to the work done in Johnstown Castle in the past 15 years or to try to add in any way to what has been said in praise of the officers of the Department of Agriculture by those directly employed at Johnstown Castle.  Nevertheless, I should like to place on record my approval of the provisions contained in this Bill and my tribute to what has been done by the Ministers for Agriculture in the past 15 years and by the officers in the Department.</P>
      <P>We are taking an unusual step to-day. It has been usual for Governments, when taking over other concerns, mainly to take over dying concerns. Here we are passing a measure which hands over a very active and live concern to the Agricultural Institute. It is a necessary step.  It is a step of which the whole House approves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the fact that Johnstown Castle was presented by the Esmonde family.  I think that is an interesting fact to be mentioned in this debate.  I should like also to mention in my tribute to Johnstown Castle the fact that, as far as I know, every worker there is a Wexford man. The Director of the Agricultural Institute now is a person born and reared in the parish in which Johnstown Castle is situated.  He is Dr. Tom Walsh.  I believe that, as Director of the Agricultural Institute, he will have regard to all the things which Deputy Dillon says are not in the Bill.  He will have particular regard to all those things because of the fact that he is of the parish and knows the history and the tradition of Johnstown Castle for the whole of his lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has in his proposals here embodied a section to safeguard the existing pensioners at Johnstown Castle and to provide for those who will become pensioners in the years to come.  It occurred to me that there is no provision for the perquisites that have been granted to the employees ever since the Castle was established. <Col N="265" /> I appreciate not alone the difficulty but the practical impossibility for any draftsman and the Minister to legislate for those perquisites.  Again, I believe that the Agricultural Institute will have regard to those things and that those perquisites, especially to the agricultural workers, will be freely granted as they were by the Department of Agriculture and as they were granted by the owners of the Castle in previous years.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying, too, to see embodied in this Bill Section 6 which restricts the demolition of any part of the Castle and restricts the Agricultural Institute from making any sizeable alterations.  I presume that a similar section was embodied in the Principal Act.  I think that, to their credit, the Ministers for Agriculture strictly adhere to the provisions which are now embodied in Section 6.  Johnstown Castle has been altered over the years but I do not think that anybody could say that the physical character of the Castle or of any of the outbuildings has been radically changed.  That, as I say, is to the credit of the Ministers for Agriculture and Departmental officials.</P>
    <P>It would be no use for me to talk about the conditions of the agricultural workers there or of those who are engaged in scientific research because from the time this Bill is passed the Minister will have no responsibility. However, I believe that, when the Bill is passed and this college is handed over to the Agricultural Institute, the workers there will not be regarded, as they are now, as a type of civil servant who cannot have recourse to the Labour Court but as employees of the Agricultural Institute they will have that right.  I do not know whether the Minister has any function in even answering me on that point.  It is possibly not anything upon which he will be asked to adjudicate.  It will probably be a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I do hope that the Agricultural Institute, and its Director in particular, will devise some scheme to provide some type of permanency and some sort of pension scheme for the laboratory assistants and others engaged in research down there.  As it is, they are somewhat in <Col N="266" /> the nature of casual workers and they find it very unsatisfactory indeed.</P>
    <P>It is true that they were recruited locally.  As far as I am aware, the competition for the position was not a national competition.  In that I suppose they were favoured but they have their lives to live and their work to do. They have been working for the State over the past 15 years and they will be working there for what we can regard as a semi-State body from now on. Therefore, I think that they should have some permanency.  Some effort should be made to establish them and provide pensionable status for them as well.  Similarily, I think that the Institute ought to have regard to the particular type of work the agricultural workers have to do in Johnstown Castle and not to regard them as agricultural labourers in the ordinary sense but to regard them as people who have to do a particular specialised job and to compensate them by a betterment in their wages.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by congratulating the various Ministers for Agriculture over the past 14 or 15 years and the Departmental officials on the magnificent way they have built up Johnstown Castle to make it, as Deputy Dillon has rightly said it is to-day, a research station of international repute&mdash;a research station and college of which we can be justly proud.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the Leader of the principal Opposition Party, Deputy Dillon, and my colleague, Deputy Corish from Wexford, in welcoming this Bill. We are very glad to know that the advance in agricultural science is another milestone in the progress of the good work which the Department of Agriculture has done for this country in setting up this Institute.  It will be in the County Wexford.  It is only fitting that agricultural research should find its home in Wexford which has always been a centre of tillage and agricultural advancement in every way.</P>

    <P>The question in which I am particularly interested is that the Department of Agriculture are transferring Johnstown Castle to the new Institute. <Col N="267" /> As such, they probably will not have any further control over the employment of personnel there.  That is as it should be and everyone will be satisfied but there are to my knowledge in the employment of the Department of Agriculture certain officials, temporary civil servants, who have reached a stage in their careers and who, in spite of their ability, their knowledge and vast experience, are not in a position to secure any further advancement.</P>
    <P>That in itself is not peculiar to the Department of Agriculture but I know that there are certain officials employed in the research departments and in agricultural colleges generally who are in that position.  I would be anxious that the Minister would, in so far as it is possible for him and his Department, see that those officials who are transferred to this new Institute might have an opportunity, which they are denied at present, through no fault of their own but through circumstances existing in the State, of advancement in their profession.</P>
    <P>Section 3 states that the estate shall be used exclusively for the advance of agricultural science and for no other purpose.  If we are to have a college such as this, where research will be carried on, which will operate all the up to date methods of agriculture which are so vital to farmers today, where there will be a wealth of talent and which will be led by so distinguished a professor of agricultural science as Dr. Walsh, would it not be possible also to provide courses of instruction at the college?  That may be the case, but from this section, it would seem to me that the Institute is bound so that it can undertake agricultural research only and cannot provide tuition or lectures for people interested in farming.</P>
    <P>If the agricultural industry in Ireland is to be kept up to date with the progress made elsewhere so that we may compete with other countries, it is essential that the extension of education in this sphere should be as wide as possible.  It may be that I have misconstrued the Bill or this section of it. <Col N="268" /> If that is not the case, I would ask the Minister and his advisers to reconsider it and to see if it would be possible to extend the aegis of this Institute so that they may be in a position to impart the knowledge they have to those who could most usefully receive it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in the point made by the last speaker.  As I understand it, the original deed of transfer of the estate provided that the property shall be used exclusively for the purpose of a lay agricultural college and for no other purpose whatever.  We have been informed by our legal advisers that the words &ldquo;for no other purpose whatever&rdquo; have a limiting effect and the removal of those words and the insertion of the words suggested by the Deputy would have the effect of broadening the purposes for which the Institute can be used.  Therefore, I think there is no reason for fear under that head.</P>
      <P>One of the matters mentioned by Deputy Dillon was his fear of the possible future embarrassment that might arise from the limiting effect of Section 9.  As the Deputy is aware, this property, of course, is not in the same position as another property might be. The original gift was on trust in perpetuity and the donors never wished that the estate would be reduced in size.  It may be that 14 years' experience is not sufficient to make one feel certain that a provision of this nature would not prove an embarrassment later, but as a result of those 14 years' experience, we feel that no embarrassment will arise.</P>
      <P>On the other matter mentioned by Deputy Corish, I am informed here that the perquisites to which he referred are, in fact, made secure under Section 8 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The questions presumably refer to five European Air Lines about whose winter schedules there have been recent Press reports.</P>
      <P>Two of these companies scheduled no flights to land at Shannon in the winter of 1958/59.  The same situation will obtain in respect of these two companies in the winter of 1959/60.  Two of the companies who had flights scheduled to land during the winter months 1958/59 have indicated that they will have no scheduled landings during the winter 1959/60. The fifth company, which scheduled flights to land during 1958/59, has indicated that scheduled landings will also be made during the winter of 1959/60.  None of these companies operates jet aircraft on the transatlantic routes.</P>

Comparative figures for 1958-59 were 30 and 26 flights a week respectively. Deputies will note that, in fact, more flights are scheduled for this winter than for last winter.  In the same period, these companies landed (transit and disembarked) 71,850 passengers, embarked 6,340 and disembarked 4,199, representing respectively 18.8 per cent. 14.5 per cent. and 12.2 per cent. of total relevant activity at the airport.</P>
    <P>The total amount paid in landing fees by the five companies concerned during the year ended 31st July, 1959, was £76,639, which represents 17.5 per cent. of the total fees in the period.</P>
    <P>During the same period total takings and net profit for the Sales and Catering Service as a whole were £1,215,653 and £113,606 respectively.  These figures are subject to audit.  It is not possible to give separate figures for the Duty Free shop.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that the introduction of the Winter schedules of the five air lines referred to will have any effect on employment and other activities at Shannon Airport apart from very limited organisational changes within the company staffs employed at the Airport.</P>
    <P>While the schedules for the coming winter reveal no adverse effect for the Airport compared with last year, there is no doubt that overflying of the Airport is a real problem and in the current financial year is expected to result in a decrease of about 25% in landing fee receipts.  It is in the face of this situation that the Government have established the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and have charged the Company with responsibility for the taking of all practical steps to preserve the level of activity and employment at the Airport.</P>
    <P>Plans for attracting more U.S.A. tourist traffic through the combined co-ordinated effort of Bord Fáilte, Aer Linte, and C.I.E. are also being prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that C.I.E. have recently published notice of the termination as from 1st January, 1960, of train services on railway lines in Co. Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1958, empowers C.I.E. to terminate any particular train service provided they are satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  The Act also imposes on the Board of C.I.E. the general obligation to conduct the undertaking so as to eliminate losses by 31st March, 1964.</P>
      <P>Under the Act I have no function in regard to the termination of train services by C.I.E.</P>
      <P>It is open to the Deputy or any other persons or bodies concerned to make representations to C.I.E. during the period of notice which C.I.E. have given in accordance with statutory requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, while he may have no duty under the statute referred to, surely he has a duty as Minister for Transport to satisfy himself that an entire county is not deprived of all rail services, passenger and freight, without adequate alternative provision being made, bearing in mind that the transfer of a volume of work of such a character on to the roads of the county may involve the ratepayers of the county in staggering burdens in relation to road repair?  Apart from the actual duties referred to under the statute, has the Minister not a general duty to ensure that transport facilities in any given area in the country will be maintained at a tolerable minimum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy well knows, even before the passing of this Act, there were no passenger services on these lines except for occasional <Col N="280" /> excursions.  There was a freight service and C.I.E. have stated that they are supplying substitute lorry services to meet the demand.  In reply to the Deputy's further submission, I intend to leave to C.I.E. responsibility for closing lines.  I intend to have only a general supervisory responsibility over the operations of C.I.E. and to watch its progress from year to year.  I definitely envisage that, if the company is to pay its way, the Board will be bound to pay attention to the Act under which it was directed, by the Deputies of this House, to close railway lines the operation of which are found to be uneconomic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Acknowledging the duty and obligations of C.I.E. under the Act referred to, would the Minister have no responsibility (1) to satisfy himself that the people of an entire county have adequate transport facilities; and (2) that the provision of alternative adequate transport facilities by C.I.E. do not throw an intolerable burden on the ratepayers of the county concerned as a result of over-use of the roads?  It does not seem to be fair to transfer any prospective loss on that section of the railway off the back of the country at large and unload the whole of it on to the ratepayers of County Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>All that was examined in connection with the passing of the Transport Act of 1958.  Naturally I and the Government collectively have a general responsibility for watching the effect of the 1958 Act on all sections of the community and on the economy generally.  I certainly do not intend to interfere with the closing of individual railway lines.  I intend to watch the general picture unfolding and to examine the result of the general trend over the next two or three years.  The Deputy will understand that it is quite impossible for me to set down on one side of the page the things I will not do and on the other side the things I can do.  He will understand that I will not interfere with the operations of C.I.E. in the closing of a particular railway line.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish pharmaceutical industry produces a wide range of tablets which comply with the standards laid down in the British Pharmacopoeia, the British Pharmaceutical Codex and the British Veterinary Codex, and the recent duty was imposed to assist the development of the industry.  In <Col N="283" /> accordance with established practice there were no consultations regarding the duty with third parties prior to its imposition.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable misunderstanding in certain quarters about the effect which the imposition of the duty may have on the prices of tablets to the public and some misinformed statements have appeared in the public Press on this subject.  Before the duty was imposed, an undertaking was given that the Irish made tablets would be sold to the pharmaceutical trade at prices corresponding to those at which similar tablets are sold to the pharmaceutical trade in Great Britain by British pharmaceutical manufacturers. There is, therefore, no reason of which I am aware why prices to the Irish public should be higher than in Britain. In some cases external firms may have been &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; tablets on the Irish market at prices lower than those charged on the British market; the effect of the duty in such cases would be to protect the Irish industry against such unfair competition.</P>
    <P>The Order provides that the duty will not be charged on tablets comprised in an importation of not more than 100 tablets.  The Order also contains a licensing provision which will ensure that tablets not produced here may be imported free of the duty.  In the period immediately following the imposition of the duty a very liberal attitude was adopted towards the granting of applications for licences in order that there would be no dislocation of supplies and joint discussions have taken place with representatives of the Irish pharmaceutical industry and of importing interests with a view to working out a licensing procedure which will be satisfactory to all the parties concerned. In view of the fact that supplies of such tablets as are not manufactured here will continue to be freely available there is no reason why the price of such tablets should be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that so far as the duty is concerned it applies to and affects tablets not manufactured <Col N="284" /> in this country?  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in so far as sick people are concerned, some of them may have a belief in a particular tablet and that the effect of this duty in relation to those sick people is that the price of the tablet in which they believe has been increased from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there are adequate alternatives available to these proprietary tablets to which the Deputy refers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned about is that the Minister and his colleagues seem to have acted on the basis that the important thing is the industry sought to be protected. I would suggest that the primary consideration in this matter is the sick person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a consideration in the fact that it is possible to get two tablets which have perhaps identical British Pharmacopoeia components, but, for some reason not understood by the medical profession, one tablet may have a greater therapeutic effect than the other.  In that case, a doctor may order a particular drug because he believes it will do good to the patient&mdash;who is to arbitrate? Is it the Medical Association or a committee of the Medical Association whose advice will be acted on before importing these tablets, or who is the authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The interests concerned with the distribution of these tablets have had free access to my Department, and, as I said in my original reply, the duty-free facilities have been very liberally given and I have no doubt will continue to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a simple question to bring this down to a practical point?  There is a variety of people travelling the roads of Ireland whose twinges of rheumatism are relieved only by veganin.  You <Col N="285" /> can give them all the drugs in the Pharmacopoeia and it will not give the same relief.  Their next-door neighbours are dependent on disprin or something of that kind.  God knows how these simple people get relief.  The effect of this tariff is to deprive them of that relief.  Is there any proportionate advantage to the economy of this State to compensate for the accumulation of minor sufferings involved in the lives of people who experience recurring pain?  I suggest to the Minister that the thing is monstrous. I suggest that most of the tablets manufactured in 12 months are consumed in one year.  There is no proportionate employment compensation for the accumulation of the minor sufferings of a multitude of people.  It seems to be out of proportion to any conceivable benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to understand that it was not for the purpose of shifting preference from one brand of these tablets to another that the duty was imposed. There was positive evidence of dumping which was seriously affecting genuine Irish industries which were producing goods of a standard which I was satisfied compared favourably with British products and also compared favourably as to price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in regard to dumping, but I still suggest that this is not simply a pharmaceutical problem.  No doubt, there is a pharmaceutical element in the problem but there is one medical aspect on which I wonder if the Minister would seek some advice from the authorities, an authority on <i>Materia Medica,</i> chemical therapeutics or some such specialist in this question who would give advice in an authoritative way on this rather complex question.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Wexford County Council have made application but they have made their application on a basis which is not acceptable. They contended that earlier schemes on these rivers which were carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act were not completed but were only partly completed, and the last scheme is I understand, a development of an earlier scheme under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, which was begun in 1950.  As I have said schemes under the Act must be complete in themselves.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 <Col N="294" /> together.  The attention of all registration officers has been drawn to the fact that local elections are due to be held in 1960 and special instructions have been issued to them to ensure that the register is compiled with the greatest possible degree of accuracy so that there will be no reasonable grounds for complaints such as are sometimes made, especially after elections, about errors and omissions.</P>
      <P>It has been left to the discretion of each registration officer to decide whether or not to distribute the forms E.B.1 to each householder as experience has shown that an indiscriminate distribution does not bring about any commensurate improvement.

      <P>The rearrangement of boundaries envisaged in the reply to the previous question on 22nd July last, has been discussed with the occupiers concerned but the consent of all parties has not been forthcoming. Investigation is continuing in an effort to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say when it is anticipated this matter will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion? Seeing that it has been going on for four years we cannot be accused of peevishness in asking for a water supply after that length of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission, who made a complete mess of the allocation of this estate, should not object to endeavouring to find a speedy settlement of this man's difficulties. There is an abundance of water there.  There are four other allottees on the estate.  Three of them have got water but this man, who gave up a well-watered holding in Kerry, has a holding in Kildare where he has <Col N="303" /> no water except such as he can get from a pump on which he is spending 25/- a week.  Surely the Minister ought to undo that in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the conditions were when this man was migrated.  I understand he has a pump on his holding which many farmers have not got.  I also understand the E.S.B. will have that area connected inside the next month or so and that the pumping of water will solve the difficulties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this man was brought to this farm and told: &ldquo;Here is your farm and there is your water supply&rdquo;? At the end of three weeks the water disappeared.  The Land Commission has spent a considerable sum of money trying to find water on the land and cannot get water out of the land.  Now they have managed, by the use of a pump and 25/- a week of this farmer's money, to get water.  However, he was promised a holding on which he would not have to spend 25/- a week in perpetuity for getting water on the land when the supply offered to him disappeared after three weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many promises were made at that time. However, in so far as the Land Commission can ease this man's difficulties it will be done.  They are actively engaged on that at the moment and if the consents they are looking for are forthcoming, I think the problem will be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so, but having regard to the way in which the Land Commission messed up the division of this holding, would the Minister kindly see that they bestir themselves and bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion at an early date?  It is a scandal that it should be going on for four years.</P>

      <P>In the Monasterevan area the Forestry Division of my Department has acquired a total productive area of 2,371 acres of which a total of 2,055 acres has been planted to date, leaving a balance of 316 acres unplanted.  Of the unplanted area, 133 acres at Moore Abbey and Maddenstown are scheduled for planting in the current season.</P>
      <P>20 areas totalling 520 acres have been offered for afforestation purposes in the Monasterevan district.  Agreement to purchase 4 cases comprising 110 acres has been reached with the owners and title is being cleared. Negotiations for the purchase of a further area of 13 acres are in progress.  Preliminary investigations are being conducted in the remaining cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Rathangan area the productive area acquired for State forestry amounts to 978 acres of which a total of 773 acres has been planted so far. Of the unplanted balance of 205 acres, <Col N="305" /> the planting of 181 acres at Christianstown and Oldgrange will be undertaken this winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a reference to this matter and understand that the fish in question was sprat which had been caught in the mistaken belief that a cannery would be in a position to take it.  I am not aware that there is demand for sprat throughout the country.  Nor do I think that this isolated incident indicates a chaotic state of organisation in the fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <P>It is my firm belief that in this matter of access by anglers to fishing waters the dictates of common sense, co-operation and good citizenship will prevail.  I do not propose to seek any powers by way of compulsion or of penalty against riparian owners.</P>

      <P>(a)  for the supply of the equipment which will be required for the television-transmitter station which is to serve the Dublin area, for temporary Dublin studios and for the link between the station and the studios,</P>
      <P>(b)  in co-operation with the Commissioners of Public Works, for the provision of the building for the transmitter station which is to serve the Dublin area and of the building for the temporary Dublin studios, and</P>
      <P>(c)  to have the acquisition of the land which will be required for sites for, and for any necessary approach roads to, television-transmitter stations to serve areas outside the Dublin area put in hand immediately by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>No remuneration has been fixed in respect of membership of the Committee.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, it is the present intention that the members of the Committee should be invited to accept membership of the Authority when the latter body is being constituted and that the present Chairman of the Committee, if then available, should be invited to accept appointment as Chairman of the Authority.</P>

      <P>The arrangements made were similar to those which had proved entirely satisfactory in previous years.  However, during the first two days while the new Directory was being distributed there was some congestion at times in the Directory Enquiries service resulting, unfortunately, in unavoidable delays.  The case was one of more enquiries being received than could reasonably have been foreseen on the basis of previous experience.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 54, 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is general dissatisfaction with the type used in the new Telephone Directory.  The size of the type is the same as that used in the telephone directories issued in Britain and several other countries and, in fact, this kind of type (known as Bell Gothic) was specially designed for keeping telephone directories to a manageable size consistent with legibility.  In our case, the new type was adopted primarily to reduce the size of the volume which with the larger type was presenting serious difficulties in binding.  The cost of producing the 1959 issue is about 12 per cent. less than what it would be if the former type were used, but I should like to say that cost saving was not the major consideration in making the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been possible for the Minister to keep to the existing size of type and divide the Directory into two parts?  That would have been one solution and it would have solved the binding problem.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there was any such grave dissatisfaction.  Every effort is made by my Department to issue the results of the Intermediate Certificate examination as soon as possible after the completion of the examination. I should explain, however, that this year there were 15,205 candidates for the Intermediate Certificate examination and 7,309 candidates for the Leaving Certificate Examination. This involved the marking of about 260,000 answer books.  The first concern of my Department must be to ensure uniform and good marking and, therefore, it must afford ample time to the examiners and to the office staff to achieve this end.  I am satisfied that it is only with a very big effort on the part of all concerned that it is possible to have the Leaving Certicate results issued early in August and Intermediate Certificate results available about the beginning of September.</P>
