      <P>We object to the nomination and propose to vote against it.  We do so not merely&mdash;in fact not at all&mdash;on the personality of the Taoiseach designate but on the fact that he and the Government who have resigned, and who are now in office awaiting re-election, have been guilty in recent times of grave dereliction of public duty and gross breach of the confidence that was imposed in them by the electorate on the occasion of the last general election.  I think it is rather obvious to say that the Taoiseach <Col N="3" /> designate, the person nominated, is coming before the Dáil for nomination not merely in unusual circumstances, but, I think, in unprecedented conditions.  If circumstances were different from what they actually are, we possibly could find it in our hearts to have some sympathy for the person who is now, for whatever length of time remains to the life of any Government, appointed here to-day or tomorrow. He will have very arduous and serious tasks but, in the light of the circumstances in fact existing, no such sympathy can be extended.</P>
      <P>In the normal way, a person nominated here in the Dáil to undertake the serious responsibility of head of a Government comes to the Dáil immediately after a general election.  He comes here and is nominated as the nominee of a majority of the Deputies duly elected to the new Dáil.  He has himself the comfort and support of the fact that he has recently secured a victory at the polls.  That is his encouragement and his inspiration.  He has also the knowledge that he has behind him a majority of the Deputies in the Dáil, each one of whom has come to the Dáil having been elected in his particular constituency, and secure in the knowledge that he has been preferred amongst all other candidates who presented themselves in his constituency, so that we have the position that the Taoiseach designate and those who support him in the Dáil have come fresh from the people with a clear mandate.</P>
      <P>No such conditions exist here at the present moment, but, in point of fact, the Party whose nominee the present Taoiseach designate is, has just come from experiencing a very severe rebuff from a big majority of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>In that state of affairs, there is nobody to blame for <Col N="4" /> the conditions in which the Taoiseach designate and any Government may be appointed.  They have nobody to blame but themselves that any Taoiseach elected now will be elected into an unstable position, one in which he cannot feel the confidence that he would have felt had there been a general election and we were now electing a new Government and a new Prime Minister, following upon the mandate given by the people in such a general election.</P>
      <P>I want all Deputies to consider, and I am sure our people throughout the country will consider, what would have been the position in March, 1957, if the Fianna Fáil Party, during the general election campaign of that year, had gone around the country conducting their election campaign asking, as they then asked for a clear majority to do the work of the nation&mdash;what would have been the result had they, in a burst of unaccustomed honesty, told the electorate that if elected with a clear majority, they would in the course of a few years submit to the people a referendum on the question of the abolition of proportional representation, and also that it was the intention of the then leader, now Uachtarán na hÉireann, to become a candidate for the Presidency?  What would have been the result of that election compared with what the actual result was?</P>
      <P>The Government who have resigned and who are now, in one shape or another, seeking re-election here, secured a clear majority from the electorate on the definite assurances and clear promises that if they got what they were asking the country to give them, namely, an over-all majority in this Dáil&mdash;a strong Government&mdash; they would then be in a position, not on a long-term basis but within a comparatively short space of time, to deal with the pressing problems of unemployment, industry, agriculture, emigration and social matters that so urgently await solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time when the Fianna Fáil Party sought that mandate from the people for a clear majority and a strong Government the only issues in that election were economic issues. This country was just emerging from <Col N="5" /> a serious economic crisis and there was every hope that the problems which had afflicted the former Government were all well on the way to solution.  The Fianna Fáil Party at that time sought a strong Government and a clear majority in conditions that were politically most favourable to them.  They were given a clear majority to form a strong Government with a precise mandate that their duty if elected was to deal with, and deal only with, the pressing economic, financial and social problems of the country.  They were to deal with unemployment and emigration, to lower taxation, to provide increased stability and increase confidence in the country and operate a policy not of restriction but of expansion.</P>
    <P>When we sat here in these benches two and a quarter years ago, on behalf of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party and speaking for them alone&mdash;although, I think, I did voice the sentiments of other members in Opposition&mdash;I directed attention to the fact that we knew that any Government facing the difficulties then existing would have a serious and difficult task and that, while we would be a vigilant and constructive Opposition, we would give them every help in our power to secure a solution to those problems because we felt that no question of Party political consideration should be allowed at that time unduly to enter into the deliberations of this Assembly or the operations of the Government in the tasks entrusted to them by the people.</P>
    <P>We offered them our co-operation. Two and a quarter years have now elapsed since that strong Government was elected by the people with that clear and decisive mandate.  Instead of doing what they were told by the people to do, instead of carrying out the mandate they were directed to carry out, dealing exclusively with economic matters, they have wasted the time of this House, the Seanad, of public officials and of the people of the country.  They have spent vast quantities, not merely of the ordinary peoples' money, but of public money <Col N="6" /> in advancing an entirely irrelevant issue and one which was in no way brought to the attention of the electorate at the last general election.  They have by the action they took nearly nine months ago, now brought this question of the referendum and the abolition of P.R. athwart the problems, economic, financial and social, of the country.  They have diverted all the efforts of the people, all the energy that the people wanted to direct or to have directed and led towards the solution of our difficulties into an entirely irrelevant issue.  They have been defeated on this issue by a very clear majority.</P>
    <P>That is why I said at the outset of my remarks that the Government now seeking an extension of powers were guilty of a gross breach of trust and a serious dereliction of duty.  For nine months now this country has been given over to academic and philosophical discussion of the various electoral systems and the advantages and disadvantages of electoral systems. The former Taoiseach, now President of Ireland, and, his personality, his prestige, all the old loyalties and allegiances that grew up around him in the years past, were all harnessed not merely for the purpose of getting him into the Park but also for the purpose of getting the people who were supporters to believe they were letting him down if they did not vote for the abolition of P.R.  All that was a diversion of effort, was irrelevant and a gross breach of trust.  For that reason we could not possibly give any support to the present nomination or to any Government that would be nominated as a result of what has been done.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Taoiseach designate, the person nominated for this post, will be elected after the division bells have rung in this House but the Government, at enormous expense of time and money and diversion of effort, disunity throughout the country and resurrection of old bitternesses, brought the matter before the entire country.  The division bells of the country have rung and rung unmistakably and a greater thing than the Dáil has spoken and the &ldquo;noes&rdquo; from the country have it by a very <Col N="7" /> decisive majority.  Therefore, any Taoiseach or any Government that emerges as a result of the overall majority which, as we now know, was obtained by false pretences at the last general election, will find themselves in a very unstable condition indeed, because they cannot feel sure that they have the confidence of the people behind them.</P>
    <P>I assert they have lost that confidence. We have had the position now during the last nine months that the country has been divided.  There has been uneasiness and worry; there has been lost time.  What is going to happen in the future?  In the last nine months conditions in this country were very favourable to economic expansion. We had conditions obtaining that did not obtain here before they got the clear majority and the strong Government. Conditions were very favourable to economic advancement in those circumstances.  The Government have lost the opportunity presented to them by these favourable conditions.  That, again, is about as gross and flagrant a breach of trust as any Government could have been guilty of.  Time is slipping by; those lost opportunities may never again be secured, or taken advantage of.  It looks now as if the economic circumstances of the country are subject to change; they are not as good as they were six months ago.</P>
    <P>Nine valuable months have been lost.  What of the future?  Nobody knows.  Something that could have been achieved in the last nine or 12 months has not been achieved nor has advantage been taken of the opportunity that has presented itself for the solution, or partial solution, of our economic problems.  Now, we have the situation here that for the last nine months there has been uncertainty in the country.  People wanted to know why the Government were not getting on with the job they were elected to do.  In spite of every effort the Government made to appeal to old party allegiances, old personal feelings&mdash;all the old bag of tricks&mdash;to secure a verdict, the attempt failed and failed miserably and signally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The generality of the people are asking: &ldquo;What of the future?&rdquo; The Government can carry on or they can do what is the logical thing for them to do having regard to the severe rebuff they have got&mdash;seek a mandate from the people.  That is the logical conclusion. What is going to happen if they do?  Will they not inflict further losses on the country?  That is the result of their action; that is what they have brought the country to.  The man who is now Taoiseach designate was asked to comment on Saturday last when it became known that he, his Party and his former leader had received from the country a rebuff that no other Government had received since this State was founded.  I shall leave out of account his unfortunate remarks about the contrast between the rural constituencies and urban constituencies in the knowledge that he had to say something and probably it was the best thing he could have said at a difficult time.  This is what he said and this is the paragraph I object to.  I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday last, 20th June.  He is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the light of the outcome of the referendum... proposals for the revision of Dáil Constituencies.... will be submitted to the Dáil....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was there any word there saying: &ldquo;I accept the verdict of the people.&rdquo; Was there any word there saying: &ldquo;I accept the verdict of the people and now we will get on with the job we were elected to do and which we interrupted.&rdquo; Not a word.  Does anyone not think that, if there was any sincerity in the person nominated for this post, he would have said: &ldquo;Very well; we did our best; we had a fair fight; we did everything we knew; we put in even the personality of our Leader; we mixed the people up; we did everything we possibly could to secure a verdict, and we failed; we accept that now and we will go on with the work.&rdquo; There is not one single word in that comment I quoted, about accepting the decision of the people and saying, that having accepted that decision, they will go on with the work they were elected to do and for which they got a mandate two and a quarter years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> That is the greatest comment I can make in condemnation of the Taoiseach designate.  There is not a single word about accepting the decision.  The people will have to face this, if there is not a general election now: &ldquo;We are not going on with the job we were elected to do, but we are going to try, by this redistribution of constituencies, to frustrate the decision of the people given at this referendum.&rdquo;  Is there to be any confidence in the man who is to be Head of the Government, who gives that, immediately after election, as his policy: &ldquo;We are going to frustrate, so far as we can within the Constitution, the decision of the referendum.&rdquo;  There is no talk about the work to be done.  There is no acceptance of the decision.  It is: &ldquo;Either we will gerrymander or we will frustrate the decision of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of that will be that, if we do not have a general election&mdash; as logically we ought&mdash;in the months to come, while we discuss this plan to frustrate the decision in the referendum&mdash;which was the severest rebuff this Government could have got, in the circumstances in which it was held &mdash;there is going to be uneasiness and lack of confidence.  Everyone will think that, even if there is to be no election now, there is a by-election every month ahead, and immediately this goes through there must be a by-election.  What possible chance can we have of economic progress?  What possible chance can we have of obtaining that stability which is very essential for economic advancement, in these circumstances, when the individual who is to head the new Government can say, immediately after this, not: &ldquo;Go on with the work.  Select the best men to do it; try to secure the co-operation of all sections of the community; now that we have been defeated in this, we will accept it,&rdquo; but&mdash;as he says: &ldquo;We will do our best to frustrate the decision of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, we on this side of the House refuse to give any credence or support to any man, or any Government formed by him, whose policy it is to do this; and I <Col N="10" /> think a very big majority of the people will follow us in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With this nomination before us to-day, we must all realise that we are entering on a new era in political life in this country.  It is but one week since we were in the midst of testing the people as to whether or not we would continue our work here under proportional representation. It must be admitted that the Deputy who is proposed for the important post of Taoiseach may be considered as the joint architect&mdash;or, if not, at least the draftsman&mdash;who planned the campaign to deny to the Irish people their just right, under proportional representation, to select individually those Deputies who in turn form the Parties to represent them here in Dáil Éireann.  We in the Labour Party are proud that the Labour Party, fighting in the front line trenches, helped to protect the people against this vicious plan to deny to the people of the Twenty-Six Counties the freedom to choose for themselves which they have enjoyed for approximately 40 years.</P>
      <P>Let it be remembered that, by being the joint architect or the chief draftsman of this vicious plan, the Deputy now proposed as Taoiseach was prepared&mdash;as were every one of his colleagues in the Cabinet, and the back benchers&mdash;to put back the hands of the clock, to introduce into public life here a system that in the early years of this century brought bloodshed, hatred and bitterness into the hearts of Irishmen over politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the system prior to 1918.  That was the system which, in rural Ireland, as well as in Dublin, caused Irishmen to fight bitterly just because one man was elected under a straight vote system. Thanks be to God, we in the Labour Party have fought for what we are entitled to&mdash;justice.  No man has the right to ask for justice without being prepared to give it to others.  The tragedy here to-day, at this hour, is that the Deputy now proposed as <Col N="11" /> Taoiseach is one who was responsible for fighting to the very end to deny justice to hundreds of thousands of people in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

We are entitled to ask: &ldquo;What of the future?&rdquo; We are entitled to ask whether or not this Government, and the man who is to lead it, will continue to forget their promises and pledges of two and a quarter years ago.  Eight or nine months have passed during which little or nothing was said about unemployment or emigration.</P>

      <P>Shall we continue in that strain in the months ahead?  Are we to waste the time of the House again in dealing with the proposal that, as we are told, will come before us here in Autumn in relation to the chopping up of constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us all remember one thing&mdash;that we were all, as individuals, elected to serve the constituencies we represent and combine to serve the Twenty Six Counties.  It is about time it was realised that helping to solve unemployment, to solve the curse of emigration, is far more important to the everyday lives of the people in the Twenty Six Counties than wasting the time and the finances of this State in fighting to gain for one political Party power over all others.  It is immaterial to us in the Labour Party whether we have a vote of confidence to-day or a vote on this motion.  It makes such little difference. The strong battalion have it; they are entitled to it, we know; they were elected as the majority: we do not grudge them that majority.  We face <Col N="12" /> the facts, but we remember this.  The responsibility is imposed upon them to act as Irishmen should act, and not to act as individuals who, like some of the people prior to the Act of Union, were prepared to sell all for the strength of their own Parties.  If they want to sell all, if they want the greed and the power that apparently go now with the man prepared to take over the position of Taoiseach, then we may not beat them in this House but the people cannot be fooled, and the people are entitled to judge.  Deputy Booth and others who tried to tell us what we were, who tried to say that P.R. should be damned, got their answer from the people.  All the people want is justice and fair play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the nomination of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach for, amongst other reasons, the reason that there was no member of the Fianna Fáil Party who so consistently made promises to the people and so consistently refused to keep them.  He was the first to mention, away back 20 years ago, that the Fianna Fáil plan for solving unemployment and emigration was so magnificent that there would not be ships enough to carry back all the emigrants. It cannot be denied that at the last election Fianna Fáil got a majority on the strength of two promises made by the Taoiseach-elect.  One was that the food subsidies would not be removed and the other was his aim of creating 100,000 new jobs.  They got into power on purely false promises and after 2¼ years they have not made any attempt to redeem them, even in part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then the Taoiseach-elect has not stopped making promises.  About a year ago we were amazed by his announcement that he had £220,000,000 to spend.  Unfortunately, we have not seen any of it since.  We find emigration and unemployment are higher than ever and that the cost of living has gone absolutely sky high.  All that engaged the Party opposite during all that time was to try and devise some scheme <Col N="13" /> by which the people would deny themselves voting rights.  That finally culminated in the infamous Referendum Bill, which the people have discarded. Even now, when the ill-fated bid for dictatorship has been blown sky high by the people, one might expect the Government to get down to business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the record of the Taoiseach-elect in making promises without any intention of keeping them, I and my Party could not see our way to support him. Fianna Fáil Deputies may laugh but we know quite well what to expect. We know that if this Party last as a Government for the next 2½ years, until their statutory term of office expires, nothing will be done.  As Deputy Costello pointed out, Deputy Lemass gave us a foretaste of what we might expect.  He made no reference to the fact that the people had had their say in the referendum or to the business of running the country and trying to eliminate some of the evils confronting us.  That is not what is troubling him. What is troubling him now is how to bring a Bill before the House so that he can get, again by a trick, what the people denied him in the referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the nomination of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach one must examine, presumably, the credentials of his Cabinet colleagues. In doing so, one is so overwhelmed by the mediocrity of most of his Cabinet colleagues that it would appear to me to be clear that the Government had little alternative but to put forward Deputy Lemass.  I feel we owe him a certain sympathy for the very serious predicament in which he finds himself, if the Dáil agrees to this motion, in attempting to resuscitate or restore the morale of his Party consequent on the recent serious electoral defeat in respect of the P.R. issue which was brought about by the, I believe, wilful and irresponsible decision of his predecessor to have this matter considered by the Dáil in the first instance and by the people later on by referendum.  His task in that respect will be a formidable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> In considering his merit and considering our decision on whether or not to vote for him, one is faced on the one hand with the very solid achievements of Deputy Lemass in his years of office. There was his understanding in the early years of the Government of the great need for the establishment of Irish industries in order to attempt to make Irish consumers independent of British manufacturers.  He proceeded with his plan with great determination in the face of considerable opposition of the Irish <i>entrepreneurs</i> of these British companies.  There are further his remarkable achievements in the number of State or semi-State groups which he either initiated or so encouraged as to make them quite the most remarkable success on the industrial side&mdash;Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, Irish Steel Holdings, the development of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and so on.  They all must stand to his credit. No matter who is examining the record of this man, they must stand to his credit in any assessment of his merit.</P>
    <P>I think also there is something that is forgotten in considering his achievements and his qualities and qualifications for this very important and responsible position.  That is his record during wartime, his success in meeting the food problems for our society at that time.  Any fair-minded analysis of the realities of the position must lead one to place at least those on the record.  They must be used to weigh in his favour.</P>
    <P>On the other side there is of course &mdash;I suppose he must now come to accept it&mdash;his overall failure to devise a plan whereby Irish industry could create the wealth which would give to his colleagues, in Social Welfare, Health and Education in particular, the means whereby they might provide a modicum of social justice in our society for the under-privileged.  While Deputy Lemass must take the credit&mdash; and I freely give it to him&mdash;for his achievements I think he must also accept a considerable degree of responsibility for the failure to create an Irish industry that would have through expanding its export markets not only supplied our home needs but created that national wealth which <Col N="15" /> would have allowed him to give his colleagues the opportunity to provide fair and just allowances for the old age pensioner, for the blind and the widow, to provide for better health services and better and wider educational opportunities for all our children.  I believe that that is a failure of which he must himself be becoming more and more conscious daily.</P>
    <P>His dependence on private enterprise exclusively on the productive side of capital investment in Ireland has obviously proved to be an outstanding failure.  In addition to the great weaknesses of the rings and cartels and price monopolies of one kind and another to which, unfortunately, he appears to give a certain tacit acceptance, which have all led to great weakness in Irish industry and which have led thereafter to failure in our national economy, and in the social structure of our society, Irish industry under Deputy Lemass has left us with a constant and near constant 10 per cent. unemployed and has led to the best part of three quarters of a million of our choice young people getting out of the country.</P>
    <P>All one can hope for is that Deputy Lemass will be honest enough and, I hope, shrewd enough, to understand that that is the real measure of his failure and the failure of the test which he has asked us from time to time to apply&mdash;the failure to give employment to those who need it.  In that context, his handling of the creation of an Irish industrial arm has failed signally.</P>
    <P>In trying to decide what Deputy Lemass may do in the future, one has very little to go on.  There is a relatively recent statement by him, when in Opposition, of his ambition to create a new social order and a state of prosperity by the provision of 100,000 new jobs in the country.  I do not mention that to sneer at him in any way.  I mention it to remind him of it and to hope that the reason we did not see that plan brought to fruition was probably the conservatism of his leader, to the jealousies of his colleagues, or one reason or another.  At any rate, those reasons will no longer <Col N="16" /> exist when he becomes Taoiseach, in which case, the validity of that plan can be tested when the problem of unemployment is in the hands of Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>May I ask him&mdash;I am sure he has done so&mdash;if he has taken fully into account the implications of the recent election?  Most responsible Deputies will have been terribly shocked, not by the failure to elect Deputy Mac Eoin and the election of the Deputy de Valera but by the mass voters' strike in this terribly important election.  The significance of the abstention of one-third of the electorate, under the circumstances, when both major Parties attempted to bring them all out by every possible means open to them, and the refusal of an electorate, which has been noted over the years for its intense interest in political matters, to come to the polls in such large numbers is, to my mind&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Lemass also accepts it&mdash;one of the most frightening, shocking and damning condemnations of our activities here over the past several months.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that not only, is the policy of his political Party at his mercy or in his hands but the whole ideal of parliamentary democracy which has been greatly discredited in the eyes of the people, is also on trial. I honestly believe they are in Government for the last time and the new Taoiseach, should he be elected, is the last person who will have an opportunity of restoring public confidence in it.  Should he be elected, I wish him luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be unnecessary in this Assembly to disclaim any personal opinions against any Deputy proposed for the responsible position of Taoiseach.  We speak here of policy and not of persons.  When we seem to speak stringently of persons, we speak of the policy they stand for and not of their personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is a public figure and you may vote for or against a public figure because you agree or disagree with him, or you may vote for or against a public figure because you trust him or you do not trust him.  I shall vote against Deputy Lemass in <Col N="17" /> this election by Dáil Éireann because I do not trust him.  I think his whole performance in the public life of this country leads any rational observer to believe that he promises what he does not intend to perform, and that he seeks the franchise of our people by fraud, and it is that which keeps our people from the polls.  It is the realisation that there are political leaders in this country who seek the franchise of the people by fraud which dissuades a number of persons from taking their proper part in general elections.  It is disastrous for the country that all of us should be tarred with the same brush of fraudulent misrepresentation because Deputy Lemass has played his part in securing for the Fianna Fáil Party the clear majority in Dáil Éireann which they now enjoy by three specific promises which all of us here heard him make, in association with his leader and the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last general election, he proclaimed that it was a nauseating falsehood to suggest that he would be responsible for the abolition of the food subsidies.  He was not elected three months as a result of that promise before he had introduced legislation into this House to abolish them all.  He had effectively persuaded our people that he would carry on the policy which the inter-Party Government had been following to keep down the cost of living and, yet, within three months, by his act and with the complacent majority he commands in Dáil Éireann, he had swept away all the food subsidies and increased the cost of living to our people by 14 points.  His alibi was that he had to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not trust him because he did that.  I do not trust him because I remember when, at a time of acute economic difficulty, when every section of the House was jointly concerned to protect our people from the possibility of mass unemployment as a result of the serious deterioration in our balance of payments situation, and when the Government of which I was a member took steps to prevent that happening&mdash;and, fortunately, created a situation which resulted in a surplus in our balance of payments, in the <Col N="18" /> following year, 1957, which made it possible to raise many of the restrictive measures which it was our duty to impose&mdash;at that time and with full knowledge, for he understood the situation, he plastered this country with posters calling on the women of Ireland to vote for him so that he might get their husbands jobs.  Of the unemployed then, half he drove into emigration and the remainder are still looking for work.  It may be that he was not able to do what he promised, but he knew what he was doing and he suffered that poster to be put up with a dual purpose.  One purpose was to get votes for him and his colleagues; and he got them from people in deep distress, people who are always prepared to turn to anyone who promises them that which their hearts desire most.  He got the votes, but he let down the people who were deceived into giving him those votes and, in doing so, he injured Parliament. He injured everybody in the public life of Ireland.  He called in question the honesty of us all.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Dr. Browne speaking, as is his wont, with the voice of doom, warning us that Parliamentary institutions now are to have their last chance.  Parliamentary institutions will be operating, with God's help, in this country, long after everybody here is dead, buried, and forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Deputy who is now nominated that he has just come back from the country from a campaign in which, I submit, he resorted to exactly the same system of fraud.  Remember the picture. When the Presidential election was first envisaged and the ex-Taoiseach announced his intention of raising the issue of proportional representation, the ex-Taoiseach, then speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, said that he thought it undesirable that these two issues should be confused. Will Deputies remember that?  He said that it was his earnest purpose to secure that the issue of the abolition or preservation of proportional representation should be put separately to the people and the issue of choosing the President by election should be held upon another day.</P>
      <P>That is what the ex-Taoiseach and the present candidate for the office of Taoiseach declared to be their considered judgment.  On what propaganda was this campaign fought by the Fianna Fáil Party when they sought to strike proportional representation down?  &ldquo;Yes and de Valera.&rdquo; Now, they were either honest when they said these two questions should be strictly segregated or they were honest when they said: &ldquo;Our real purpose is to confound them as far as we can.&rdquo;  Remember the story the people were told was that Fianna Fáil wanted them kept apart, but the long debate in Oireachtas Éireann brought them so close together that the segregation thought desirable in the initial stages was no longer effectively possible.  But that does not tally with the campaign based on &ldquo;Yes and de Valera.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They sought again in this campaign to perform the same confidence trick they had so successfully worked in the general election.  They sought to get the people to vote, not on the issue of proportional representation but in sympathy with a venerable figure who was fading out of active public life. It is conduct of that kind that brings us all low in the public esteem.  It is because he was responsible for conduct <Col N="20" /> of that kind that I shall vote against the nominee proposed.</P>
    <P>I remember pointing out to this Government in the very early stages of the conspiracy to abolish proportional representation that, whatever the issue in this matter would be, its direct consequence would be a greater instability than we had known for many decades.  I remember saying to the Government during that debate: &ldquo;Even if you win this by a narrow majority, you take from half our people that which they greatly treasure and you emerge as an Ascendancy denying the rights of a minority.&rdquo;  I remember saying to them: &ldquo;If you succeed the true democratic character of your Government must be judged not by the size of your majority but by the respect you show for the rights and feelings of the minority; and you will stand self-condemned with the consequent instability that will attend on that.  But, if you are defeated, you will come back to this House forced to admit that a defeat on this issue in Dáil Éireann would have forced you to the country and you will be protesting that, since you have appealed from Oireachtas Éireann to the people and there been defeated, you ignore the consequences and stagger on.&rdquo;  Do the members of the Fianna Fáil Party really believe they can stagger on?  Do they know what they look like to us at the present time?</P>

I will tell you why.  Not long ago, at a special function, Deputy Lemass made a statement that the people on the land are engaged in a feather bed industry.  I represent the people on the land.  Deputy Lemass, when he said that agriculture is a feather bed industry, created the impression that the people on the land, the tenant farmers, are not paying their due share of taxation.  It is because of that statement, even though I regard Deputy Lemass as the decentest Deputy in Dáil Éireann, that I will vote against him.  Deputy Lemass has only a city outlook, a city mentality.

      <P>We have been summoned here to-day to elect a Taoiseach. One would imagine that we would have a second nomination before us. Statements have been made to the effect that the Government have been wasting time for the past nine months. Even at this late hour, it would be a good thing if we would practice what we preach and not continue to waste time.  It is absolutely indifferent what name the Government decide to put before us to-day.  The people know the substantial majority the Government hold in this House.  I do not believe the people will appreciate or approve of the time that is being devoted to delaying the election of a Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Government as such, in their policy, sustained a major defeat, particularly in Dublin, and indeed I am very pleased they did.  I had hoped to gain wisdom from the elders of this House but I must say, without apology, that since I have come into this House I have not been able to gain any of the wisdom I had hoped to gain in this respect.</P>

    <P>Discussion has been prolonged.  I understand that each Deputy has the <Col N="26" /> right to speak.  It was suggested to me that a second candidate should be named.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, as dispassionately as I can, to review the facts on which we are asked to elect Deputy Seán Lemass, the nominee of the Fianna Fáil Party, as Taoiseach to-day.  We are asked to do it in the circumstance that the former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party went forward and failed to secure much more than one-third of the vote of the electorate in the recent Presidential Election.  We are asked to do it after a campaign in which not merely the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the former Taoiseach, but every single member along that Government bench, made it his policy, made it the Government policy, made it the Fianna Fáil policy that there should be only one particular system of election in future in this country.  For the past nine months, every member of the Fianna Fáil Party has been drumming that as the sole point of Fianna Fáil policy, of Government policy.</P>
      <P>We meet to-day after that sole point of policy has received a decisive reverse at the hands of the people. Surely that shows that the Government of which we are now asked to elect Deputy Lemass as leader has lost the confidence of the people and that they have lost that confidence on a vote&mdash; how obtained?  They lost it on a vote obtained by the method that they themselves, every one of them, suggested was the only proper method for the country, the single non-transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This defeat that the Government have received, this lack of confidence that has been expressed by the people <Col N="27" /> in the Government, has been expressed not under the system that they were criticising but under the very system that they wished to foist on the people for the future.  Is it not clear, therefore, that, for that clearly-shown lack of confidence, there can be no excuse whatsoever?  In the face of that lack of confidence, in the face of the situation in which it was shown that the people had no confidence in this Government, the only thing Deputy Lemass, as the acting head of the Government, could suggest was that, having been beaten in the country, he would now change the constituencies to suit the present Government better in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>There could not ever have been in the country a more cynical approach by any political Party, after receiving the setback in the country by the single non-transferable vote which the Fianna Fáil Party received, than that of turning around and issuing such a statement.  But, apart from that, apart from having completely lost the confidence of the people, apart from its being obvious that they could not get out more than one-third of the electorate to vote for <Col N="28" /> their Leader, apart from the fact that there are obvious implications in the loss of that confidence, we have heard not one reason from Deputy Lemass or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party why the obvious implications should not be carried into effect.  I suggest it is up to them to give those reasons not merely to the House but to the country.</P>
      <P>This Government was elected two and a quarter years ago.  It was elected after a general election campaign in which there were three main issues put to the people.  First, there were the issues that arose out of the balance of payments difficulties which had occurred in 1956.  We were told by every member of Fianna Fáil at that time that the measures that we as a Government were taking to rectify the balance of payments were not adequate and were not going to be effective.  They made that their catch-cry during the whole campaign.</P>
      <P>Did any person who voted for Fianna Fáil in March, 1957, believe that when this Government came in they would not vary to any appreciable degree, the measures that had been taken, that they would merely adopt the measures we had taken before? Did any person who was cajoled into voting for Fianna Fáil in March, 1957, realise that on the 8th May, 1957, Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Finance, would say: &ldquo;In the financial year 1956/57 there was a balance on external account&rdquo;?  There was a balance on external account, a balance on external account which was achieved by us but a balance which has been lost by this Government.  Not withstanding the fact that the Government have lost that balance we are now asked to support them by this nomination to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office issued the other day the figures for the first five months of this year.  They show that compared with last year the import excess has risen by £11.3 million.  Let anybody who likes work that out for the rest of the year.  Last year on current account there was a deficit of £1 million.  Make whatever excuses you like for some of the heavy imports in the early part of this year. <Col N="29" /> Whatever way you work it out the Government of which Deputy Lemass is now nominee has lost the balance on external account that had been achieved with great difficulty by us before we left office.</P>
    <P>The second means by which the Fianna Fáil Party achieved power in March, 1957, was by constant and continuous criticism of the cost of living.  Since they went into office the cost of living has risen by no less than 12 points from February, 1957, to May, 1959.  On that record how can they reconcile in their consciences the propaganda and the attacks they made at that time on the previous Government? They showed a cynical disregard of what the people really wanted and that they were anxious only to obtain power at any cost.</P>
    <P>The third point, and perhaps the most important one during the whole of that general election, was the question of employment.  What is the situation in relation to employment? We know from the statistics that were furnished about a month ago that there are today fewer people employed in Ireland than there were in 1957, and that there were 32,000 fewer people employed in 1958 than there were at the time we left office.</P>
    <P>Is that the employment record on foot of which we are asked today to vote for this motion?  Even taking the more recent statistics we find that in the first quarter of this year there were fewer insurance stamps sold than there were in the first quarter of 1958 or in the first quarter of 1957 when we were in office.  How can they suggest that they have done anything but fail miserably in respect of their promise in relation to employment?</P>
    <P>Gross national expenditure, at constant prices, that is to say the national product, the constant price, has gone down under this Government.  On every single aspect of our economic life they have shown not an improvement but a disimprovement and a decline.  Yet they ask us today, having been repudiated in the country, to accept the situation that they are still carrying out the mandate they got in 1957, a mandate which they got by <Col N="30" /> fraudulent propaganda and by deception.</P>
    <P>I cannot do other than object to the nomination of Deputy Lemass as the nominee of the Fianna Fáil Party because I believe that in our present economic circumstances it is utterly essential that we would get away from a high cost economy, that we would ensure that we would build up particularly our raw materials in agriculture which we have at home.  The whole political life of Deputy Lemass has been contrary to that view.  The whole political life of Deputy Lemass has been that agriculture did not matter and does not matter in this country. It is only in the last very few months that there has been perhaps some face-saving by him in that respect.  I want far more evidence that he has changed his tune.  I want far more evidence that he has changed from the Deputy Lemass we have known for the last 25 years, the Deputy Lemass who is prepared to put any blister, any burden on the backs of farmers, before I would support him in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose not to vote for Deputy Lemass but I do not intend to vote against him.  It would not make sense to vote against him as there is no one else to take his place.  To me a bad general is better than no general, although I do not look upon Deputy Lemass as a bad general. There are certain reasons why I do not intend to vote for him.  First of all, we have just emerged from a battle, a conspiracy, to deny individuals like myself the right to be a member of the House.  It is put to me by members of the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;You have a good chance.  You are all right.&rdquo;  However, I am not so much concerned with that.  I may be on a horse but when I was on the ground it might not have been all right.  There are many people on the ground who may aspire to be members of this House but who, if P.R. had been abolished, would have very little chance of being elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of Deputy Lemass was to have two big Parties which would have meant that individuals like myself would be denied their rights.  Of course, we are invited to join one or other of the big Parties which are <Col N="31" /> honeycombed with individuals with everything all fixed for themselves. Therefore joining one of the big Parties made no sense to me.  The conspiracy in a nutshell was that there was to be power here for two groups and their associates and there was to be a denial to all others of that fundamental principle enshrined in every revolutionary constitution, equal rights and opportunities for all.  That is what made me fight against the abolition of P.R.  I did not just talk about it.  I fought against it and I did more harm to the advocates of the abolition of P.R. than they may realise.  The results in Dublin and County Dublin speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is, in my opinion, a good general.  He has served the country well as a Minister, but whether he will make a good national leader is a different matter.  It does not follow that a good general will make a good Taoiseach.  Deputy Lemass has yet to prove himself in that capacity. History has proved that, when the Big Chief goes, everything flops.  When O'Connell went, the Repeal Movement flopped.  When Parnell went, his movement flopped.  Even when Cromwell died, his son got panicky and handed back full control to the generals.  All that is history.  Nevertheless, while admitting that Deputy Lemass has proved himself to be a good Minister, he has got to prove he is a good national leader.  The former Taoiseach had certain qualities which I think Deputy Lemass does not possess.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Taoiseach had that little knack of getting down to the level of the smallest person in the land but Deputy Lemass has been much too aloof.  I have one other fault to find with Deputy Lemass.  He never makes any statements about Partition. At least the former Taoiseach did, but Deputy Lemass is wrapped up in industry and economics and according to rural Deputies, seems to have little interest in rural matters.  To me, it seems he has little interest in Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All is quiet now on the northern <Col N="32" /> front, but that does not prove that it may remain so.  In fact, history again has proved that it will not always be quiet on that front.  That is the problem which Deputy Lemass will have to face.  I should like a statement from Deputy Lemass in regard to Partition.  I hope it will not be just an annual speech in protest.  I would refer Deputy Lemass to Cavour&mdash;the man who succeeded in uniting Italy, which at one time was divided into seven parts, in his life time.  I would ask Deputy Lemass to take a lesson from Cavour in Italy.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other reasons why I do not propose to vote for Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach.  A short time ago a member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;he was a big shot in the Party&mdash;said to me that when Deputy Lemass was Taoiseach, he would send them upstairs.  What that implies I do not know.  Does that mean he will be a dictator?  I do not know.  That makes the Minister suspect.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I will not support Deputy Lemass is that during the last election, at least as far as my area is concerned, gangster tactics were used by his Party to fight the election. If they were used in my area and in other areas, there is a doubt that he represents all he claims to represent. I shall not pursue that matter further but I should astound the House, were I to do so.  In any event, I am capable of overcoming any tactics which might be used.  I am like a ball that hops. That is why they said I would get in. I am not thinking of myself.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the recent decision of the people, the Fianna Fáil Party have met their Stalingrad.  There will be no more advances.  They know that and just as they sneered at the small Parties and Independents in the past, they will be rubbing them up in the future with an eye to the next general election.  While I am not going to vote for Deputy Lemass, I am not going to vote against him.  I have given my reasons.  I do not see any reasons for voting against him.  Somebody must run the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the most ardent admirer of Deputy Lemass must admit <Col N="33" /> that his nomination as Taoiseach comes at a time and in circumstances that cannot be regarded as the happiest.  As a Dubliner, it must have been know to Dubliners during the recent campaign that he was the likely successor to the incoming President of the country and it must be a cause of uneasiness and even a certain amount of unhappiness not alone to himself but to his Party to realise that on an important occasion such as this in his life his major proposal within recent years has been so decisively rejected by his own Dublin people.</P>
      <P>It might be said that Deputy Lemass is coming into his inheritance when the assets are dwindling but whatever dwindling there may be and whatever faults we may have to find with his nomination, I want it to go on record that while, politically, I shall oppose him in this vote and continue to oppose him on policies resembling those of the past and those which he at present adumbrates, personally he will always have my warmest commendation for whatever success he achieves.</P>
      <P>I, probably more than any of the other younger members on this side of the House or on the other side, have had the benefit of his friendly advice and the benefit of his experience and enjoyed to a very great extent what is so characteristic of him, his personal generosity in this country and abroad. He has been described in the newspapers of this country and, I think, at least in one outside paper in the last few days as a person whose success is due to energy, ability and the taking of calculated risks.  I do not quarrel with his energy.  In fact, it is one of his attributes.  I do not quarrel with his ability, much as I might quarrel with the method by which it is applied from time to time, but I do think that in the post of Taoiseach which he will undoubtedly attain this evening, there should be more of the calculation and less of the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It depends on what one means by &ldquo;calculated risks&rdquo;, whether it is the actual risk itself which is being calculated or whether it is the circumstances in which it might be safe to take a risk with certain objectives in mind.  I think the people deserve that <Col N="34" /> any risks taken either on their behalf or with their money should be approximations or even calculations which so far as the fallibility of the human mind can encompass them, could be regarded, in the language of racing, as almost certainties.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody should try to take away any credit that is due to Deputy Lemass for the part he has played in Irish industry and the development of Irish industry as far as it goes but there are people who would say&mdash;and there might be some degree of sense in the argument&mdash;that success is easily attained when money is readily available for projects; but whether that be the case or not, I think that the compliment must be paid that at least steps were taken, irrespective of the cost and very often irrespective of the results.</P>
    <P>During the recent campaign, the Government suffered a very severe rebuff.  I do not think that can be denied.  The Presidential election victory is quite another thing altogether having regard to all the circumstances, but I think when people went so far as to say that our economic survival depended upon the adoption of the single non-transferable vote in single member constituencies and when the people did not accept that doctrine, there would appear to me to be only one course open and, like Deputy Sweetman, I should like to know the reason why that course has not been taken, namely, to give the electorate an opportunity of deciding once again whether our economic survival depends upon the adoption of what they were pleased to call the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Sherwin who said that Deputy Lemass referred very infrequently to the problem of Partition. I would much prefer to hear people referring infrequently, if not at all, to problems unless they refer to them sincerely.  I have been asked by people outside this House whether the Taoiseach designate, Deputy Lemass, knew Irish, and I was urged to make a point as to whether he did or not.  I am not making any such point.</P>

      <P>When he comes to nominate his Ministers after his election I shall elaborate on that a little more fully.  It is not necessary that the common welfare or the common good should be subservient to the use of any one particular language.  Within each man's heart can beat a patriotic beat whether he speaks English, Irish, French, German or any other language, and I thought even today, on the proposing and seconding of Deputy Lemass, that it was consummate hypocrisy on the part of Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Ryan to propose and second him with their little rehearsed pieces in the Irish language, leaving it at that.</P>
      <P>Once Deputy Lemass is elected as Taoiseach, as he will be, all we can say to him is this: &ldquo;You have failed in your most recent major proposals to the people.  You and your leaders have told the people that economic survival was dependent on the referendum going through.  It has not gone through; will you now mend your hands and proceed towards economic survival on the system which has been maintained in spite of you?&rdquo; Finally, I ask the Taoiseach designate to be particularly mindful in what will now be a less arduous task than that to which he was elected over the years, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the standard obtaining in the political life both inside and outside the House as well as in his own Party and in the vast Civil Service organisation of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The business before the House is the election of a Taoiseach on the nomination, not of a Government, but of the Fianna Fáil Party.  One wonders if this same Party, which has sustained such a signal defeat in its attempt to do away with the existing system of proportional representation, some months ago at its annual Ard-Fheis had among its members one single independent spokesman who had the hardihood to get up at that assembly and question the wisdom or the justice of the proposal, we would be here to-day dealing with the election of a Taoiseach in the circumstances which now obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> Everyone in this House and in the country will agree that at the beginning of 1957&mdash;whatever the means by which Fianna Fáil were again returned as a majority Government&mdash;if the then Taoiseach, and now President-elect, had indicated his desire to step down and suggest that the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, with an over-all majority in the House, should take office in the critical position facing the country, not a Deputy would have questioned that decision.  While a vote on the issue might have been taken, and members of the Opposition might have voted against the motion, certainly there would not have been any great need for speeches on the proposal. However, that did not happen and the Fianna Fáil Party must bear the eventual responsibility.  The Fianna Fáil Party insisted, through their Government, that they would continue and in the middle of a period of office, instead of devoting themselves to the economic problems of the country, they met in solemn conclave and decided to introduce this question of a change in the electoral system and in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland have given Fianna Fáil their answer.  I am very proud to speak from these benches to-day and to be able to say that the people of the City of Dublin in particular gave Fianna Fáil their answer in each and every constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my reasons for my opposition and that of the Labour Party to the nomination of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach.  We are elected representatives to this House and we are entitled to consider&mdash;and I think Fianna Fáil are entitled to consider&mdash;a decision when it is taken by the electorate at any general election or any referendum.  As I said, in other circumstances I do not think there would be any great opposition to the motion before the House.  Even to-day, the querying and opposition to the proposal does not involve any question of personal animosity or personal <Col N="37" /> criticism of Deputy Lemass for the simple reason that it would be unfair and unjust to criticise the election of an individual to the position of Taoiseach. It is only when a person has been elected and has carried out the duties of that office for a period that one is in a position to criticise the handling of the office.</P>
      <P>The record of Deputy Lemass as Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce over the years is well known to all of us, but he is not being nominated for that position to-day.  He is being nominated for the position of Taoiseach and I feel that on one matter in recent times he has not spoken in a manner worthy of his stature.  This quotation which I am about to read is from the <i>Irish Press</i> of June 20th and, in the course of a statement attributed to him, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An analysis of the voting shows that the majority in favour of retaining the Proportional Representation system was predominantly an urban one.  In rural constituencies a majority voted in favour of the straight vote method. It is, of course, in the large rural constituencies that the disadvantages of the P.R. system have been most obvious to the electorate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the light of the outcome of the Referendum it is now necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, to submit to the Dáil proposals for the revision of Dáil constituencies having regard to population changes since they were previously defined.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not suggested and I do not suggest that he made any promise, or any threat, but I do not think it is worthy of a man of his stature to comment upon the results of a referendum by distinguishing, in any way whatever, between votes cast in urban and rural constituencies.  Surely a referendum must be, and is, a decision of the Irish people as a whole?  While people with less experience and less stature might well adopt that line, it is not worthy of a Deputy of the standard of the Deputy who has been proposed for Taoiseach, and I trust <Col N="38" /> the reference is no more than a casual one because floating around the Chamber of Dáil Éireann, and other places, there has been a suggestion from time to time that advantage should be taken of the Constitution to ensure the election of more Deputies from the rural constituencies.</P>

There is no doubt whatever that Deputy Lemass will be elected Taoiseach and if he, as Taoiseach, carries on for the remainder of the life of this Government and endeavours to carry out the promises made at the beginning of the term of office of this Government, he will have the good wishes of all, but, if he, as Taoiseach, carries on as his predecessor and the Fianna Fáil Government carried on during the past two and a quarter years, then, when another election comes, I am afraid that what occurred in the referendum will be only of minor importance, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, compared with what will happen to that Party then. It is quite clear that the Fianna Fáil proposal has been defeated.  They endeavoured to carry that proposal in the referendum by every and any means and it is of particular pride to me, as a Dublin Deputy, to say that every constituency in Dublin played its part in bringing that proposal to naught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the nomination of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, the House should remember that we are at the end of a political era.  The passing of Mr. de Valera from the scene brings with it new problems which demand new men <Col N="39" /> and new personnel to tackle them.  I think our function as a House here today is to be realistically objective in our assessment of the qualities of the man who is put forward by his Party to succeed Mr. de Valera, who, whether we agreed with him or not, certainly dominated the political scene in this country for almost 40 years.</P>
      <P>Tributes to Deputy Lemass's capabilities, to his energy and to his competence, particularly during the war years, have been paid by Deputies who have announced their intention of voting against his nomination. Candidly, I do not understand that procedure.  I take it that we must have a Taoiseach and, if the present nominee is not acceptable to the House, then some other nominee must either be acceptable or Dáil Éireann must dissolve, and we must have a general election to give a new Dáil an opportunity of electing a Taoiseach. In spite of what has been said, I do not believe that on any side of the House there is a genuine desire for a general election and I am quite certain that if an election were to be held, it would not be a good thing for the country.  I should not like to forecast the outcome of such an election, but I think it would be most unwise to base the probable results on the results of the referendum to abolish proportional representation.  It might conversely be argued that the outcome of such an election would be nearer to the result of the Presidential election, in which case we would have a return of the present Government Party to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of the two Independent Deputies who supported the Government's proposal for the abolition of proportional representation.  As such, I should like to say, here and now, that I accept the verdict of the people in that regard and I should like to congratulate our very mature, very sensible and very sober electorate on the assessment they made of the many conflicting proposals put before them. I think too much is being made of the defeat for the Government's proposal. A difference of 30,000 votes in 900,000 <Col N="40" /> votes in any responsible gathering cannot be regarded as a resounding defeat and again, when we speak in expansive and exaggerated terms, one is always faced with the converse argument that if the referendum had been carried by 30,000 votes would those members of this House who did not support it regard it as a resounding victory? Though I supported the proposal I certainly would not in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think that each of us in our minds should appraise the qualities of Deputy Lemass and his ability to shoulder the very difficult economic burdens and the other different difficulties which face the country at this time.  There is no doubt that with the passing of the former Taoiseach, we are going to see radical political changes in this country perhaps even more quickly than we anticipate.  As I see it at the moment we must give prior consideration to economic conditions in this country and all others, cultural problems and problems concerning the reintegration of the country, to my mind, must take a secondary place to the problem of economic expansion.  I do not know any man among the Government Deputies better qualified by experience, training and by his own natural energies and intelligence to tackle those problems than the present nominee.  I do not honestly know any other Deputy who would be prepared or competent to undertake those problems.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Lemass will succeed in his task.  I am afraid I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne's strictures on the men who sit behind and beside Deputy Lemass.  I think his task is going to be a very heavy one and I suggest that when, as we all anticipate, he becomes Taoiseach, in the interests of this country he should be quite realistic and quite ruthless in selecting Ministers, where he can find them among his own Deputies, who will run the country efficiently and honestly in the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>Some very uncomplimentary reasons have been given by some Deputies who propose to vote against Deputy Lemass. I feel inclined to ask if there is anyone <Col N="41" /> in this House who is without political sin or if there is any of us who can afford to cast a stone.</P>

      <P>I think it would be far better to bear in mind the realities of the situation and leave personalities out of it.  I think there have been far too much personalities down through the years in Irish history.  I hope that, at least from today onwards, we shall have an opportunity of leaving that aside and building up our nation in the interests of all the people.  I am quite certain that the people outside were not unduly influenced during any of these elections by much of the talk that goes on in this House.  I think our people are solid and sensible, far more sensible than many realise, and the assessment they made of the recent issues indicates their political maturity.</P>
      <P>I intend to vote for Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach.  I know his failings and I know that some of the criticisms levelled against him are not without foundation but it would be senseless, and less than realistic, to leave this House with a purely negative attitude of just voting against the only nominee put forward for the position of Taoiseach.  In saying that I reserve to myself complete freedom of action to criticise the new Taoiseach whenever I feel he is not playing the part that I personally hope he will play in the rejuvenation of the economy of the country and in establishing here what we all want, an independent, happy, prosperous and united people.</P>

      <P>I feel that the motion that Deputy Lemass be appointed Taoiseach, if passed by this House, will be one of the most disastrous on its records.  I object to the motion vigorously and bitterly; I think he is an unsuitable person and that it is unwise for this House to have a man of his type as Prime Minister. If we are to judge him on the record of the past 25 years &mdash; and he has been Tánaiste for the greater part of 25 years &mdash; we must associate him with failure, graft and dishonesty and I would like to prove to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to prove that dishonesty, and that the present nominee for the post of Taoiseach has made false promises to the people.  Not alone that but he has exercised political Fianna Fáil jobbery and he is carrying it out in Bord na Móna where I have knowledge of it.  He is carrying it out in the E.S.B. and has carried it out in C.I.E.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was Minister for Industry and Commerce then and I feel I am entitled to refer to his failures.  There is no person with a more dishonest public record than Deputy Lemass.  We all know quite well that the difference between the present nominee for the post of Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach is that the former Taoiseach was believed down the country to be honest&mdash;the people were deceived&mdash; but the present nominee is known not to be straight.  There can be no confidence nor will there be any confidence in a Government led by a man <Col N="43" /> with the record of Mr. Lemass over the last 25 years.  Can any Deputy deny that while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce he was responsible for the Wages Stand-still Order that made it a criminal offence for a worker to seek an increase in pay and made it a criminal offence for a decent employer to pay an increased day's pay to an honest worker?  Is that the type of man to have as Prime Minister and are the workers of the country to look for protection to a Taoiseach who was responsible for making it a criminal offence to seek an increase in pay?  That is the record the prospective Taoiseach has so far as the workers are concerned.</P>
      <P>Let us come a little bit more up to date.  Do we not all know quite well that the present nominee for the post of Taoiseach removed all controls in connection with the cost of living and that, by his deliberate act, the cost of living was allowed to go sky high, point after point, until it has reached the present stage in which the people of Dublin have revolted in no uncertain manner against the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce? He alone must take responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>Surely, after 25 years of Fianna Fáil Government Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who are now looking gloomy and sad must know that they are in the course of being transferred from Dev's team to Lemass's team and that that will not sound too well at the next general election.  At the last general election which resulted in the return of every Fianna Fáil Deputy now sitting opposite they were elected on a personal vote obtained by the leader of the Party who is now gone but from this day on that will not be the case.  No Party or no Government can stay in office and pretend to have the confidence of the people when they have lost the confidence of the people.  That has been displayed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present nominee for the post of Taoiseach is anxious to know whether or not he has the confidence of the people I am sure there is nothing whatever to stop him from being <Col N="44" /> elected by his House this evening and then asking for a dissolution of Dáil Éireann and within the next three weeks consulting the people.  We will then see the vast difference.  Remember, tens of thousands of people voted for Fianna Fáil because of the man who led them.  That fact was reflected in the voting last Wednesday.  May I say also that there were thousands who voted for Mr. de Valera for the Presidency because they wanted to get him out of this House and they were not actually Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage in which a new Taoiseach is about to be elected. What mandate has that Taoiseach to form a Government?  None from the people, none whatever.  He was never elected by the people.  The Party of which he is a member were elected on the votes of an individual and if they had to stand on their own feet, as they will at the next general election, it would not have happened.  I hope that even the prospective Tánaiste will convey to the prospective Taoiseach that the people are waiting for a general election and they expect it, that the people know the position quite well, no matter how long the present Government is going to cling on or hang on to office through either place, pensions, or power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing my remarks to the motion, in saying that the Taoiseach about to be elected has not the confidence of the people. If he wants the confidence of the people let him test the matter forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that when the Taoiseach is elected this evening, as he certainly will be, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that a Government is being appointed and a Prime Minister is being elected to administer the affairs of this country without the confidence of the people.  That, in my opinion, is bad, particularly so when one reflects on the statements of many distinguished people outside this House <Col N="45" /> who are viewing the workings of the Government in a most impartial manner.  May I say, for information on this motion, because it is one of the reasons why I feel Deputy Lemass should not be elected Taoiseach, that the Bishop of Cork, as reported in the papers, has stated that relative to the total population there was less work and more emigration now than at any time since the famine.  The present nominee for the position of the Taoiseach cannot disclaim responsibility for that extraordinary and deplorable state of affairs.  In view of the many promises &mdash; false promises, misleading promises and deceitful promises &mdash; made and uttered by the person now mentioned in this motion, is it any harm to ask what has happened to the 100,000 new jobs?  If he promised 100,000 new jobs at the last general election, surely he will be in a position now to implement that promise?</P>
    <P>I want to give this House another reason why Deputy Lemass should not be elected Taoiseach.  Only a few weeks ago, he wrote a blackmailing letter to people, company directors and others, associated with his Department.  He put the gun to their heads and asked them for money to fight an election.  He was not a trustee of Fianna Fáil, an Honorary Treasurer of Fianna Fáil, or anything else.  He got the book of the names and addresses of company directors, he consulted the files in his Department of Industry and Commerce, and he got down to work on those who got licences, permits and facilities from his own Department, and there and then they had a personal letter from him asking for money.</P>

In an effort to rake in money, that letter was sent to certain people who had dealings with the Department of which he was Minister.  I give that as one of the main reasons why this House should not elect a person of that type.  If he has succeeded, or if an attempt at blackmail is being made on certain people, what is going to happen when he is Taoiseach?

      <P>I want to know whether or not our prospective Prime Minister is to control three newspapers. The most dangerous weapon in the hands of any Prime Minister is a newspaper.  I am told&mdash;and we have facts to bear it out&mdash;that the only Prime Minister in the world to-day who controlled newspapers was our former Prime Minister.  Are we now to have the new Taoiseach, Deputy <Col N="49" /> Lemass, as the controlling director of three newspapers?  If that is so, let us hear it; give us the bargain.  Has it not been proposed that the controlling directorship pass on to the next in line for Taoiseach and that from to-morrow the new Taoiseach is taking over the controlling directorship of three newspapers, which, I think, would not be tolerated by any free people in the world?</P>
      <P>We have now reached the stage at which, at last, the Irish people are commencing to see through Fianna Fáil.  They are doomed and their day is near.  The end has dawned at last. No matter what they do or do not do, in the next general election, whether it is weeks or years away, we will have a new Government.  If Deputy Lemass is elected as Taoiseach, he must realise if he is a lover of freedom and democracy, which he is not, it will be his first duty to pluck up sufficient courage and energy to allow the Government he will nominate tonight to be tested by the people. Whatever may have been said by our friends in the Independent benches, the general public, the agricultural and business elements, know that a period of instability and expectancy of a change of Government faces them. The quicker that is over the better. The people expect a general election. They have given Fianna Fáil notice to quit and that notice to quit is but the first instalment of many notices to quit.</P>
      <P>I feel Deputy Lemass is not a suitable person to be Taoiseach in view of the reasons I have given, his record in the past, the dishonesty with which he has been associated, the strange suspicion, the dark shadow over all his activities during the past 25 years, the suspicion in the minds of those people who do not want him as Taoiseach and who do not want to be associated with any Government he is associated with and, above all, the people who are anxious to have good, clean government and to be disassociated from the trickery and skulduggery with which Deputy Lemass has been associated for the past 25 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that <Col N="50" /> we in the Opposition have not the majority to select one of our number to be Taoiseach.  Fianna Fáil, by reason of the majority accorded to them by the people in March, 1957, have the right to select one of their number for the position of Taoiseach and they have selected Deputy Lemass, whose name is before us to-day, for the position of Taoiseach of a Fianna Fáil Government.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Lemass.  When I think of him, I think of Sir Anthony Eden, who was not recognised until relatively late in life. I have much more sympathy with Deputy Lemass when I remember the circumstances in which he is proposed and will probably be elected as Taoiseach.  If I were a Fianna Fáil Deputy, I would say that, as far as the Party are concerned, he has not got a fair crack of the whip.  I certainly would support the attitude of some Independents who said that Deputy Lemass might have been much more acceptable to the House if a month or two after the last election Mr. de Valera had resigned as Taoiseach and allowed Deputy Lemass to become his successor.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Lindsay and others, I do not oppose Deputy Lemass's nomination for any personal reason or because of any failures he has had, if he has had any.  I oppose him because he has been chosen as the standardbearer of Fianna Fáil policy, as a symbol of the policy carried out by Fianna Fáil over the past two or three years, but a policy which we hope will be changed on his appointment as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I do not think it can be denied that the Fianna Fáil Party and Government sought a vote of confidence from the people on Wednesday of last week. They sought an endorsement of their strength and were rebuffed.  It is all very well for Deputies to say it was only 38,000 votes, but if one has regard to the majority Fianna Fáil had in March 1957, it certainly does show that there is a certain swing. The people are resentful of the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party over the past two and a quarter years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, no matter what any individual member may think, that the <Col N="51" /> former Taoiseach has been responsible to a very large extent for that behaviour and the lack of results over the past two and a half years.  Fianna Fáil have become quite cocky since March, 1957.  They sat as a smug and complacent Party from 1932 until 1948, when the people revolted.  The result of the referendum represents a minor revolt by the people again against the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>It is true that Deputy Lemass has a majority in this House but I think it would be correct to say that a majority of the people would not elect him as Taoiseach.  Fianna Fáil regarded last Wednesday's referendum as a very important fight.  The former Taoiseach gambled practically everything he had on it.  I think he went almost as far as to gamble his reputation.  As Deputy Desmond has said, Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Aiken and all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party must take a certain amount of blame for the gamble they took and ultimately lost.  That they regarded it as important is shown when we consider the tremendous resources they put into last Wednesday's fight, the financial resources, cars, manpower, advertising &mdash; everything that goes to make a successful election.  In my memory, it was the biggest fight ever put up by the Fianna Fáil Party.  As somebody said, they even threw in the Taoiseach for President, and it is true to say, that apart from politics, many people for various reasons wanted him to be President, some to honour him and some, as Deputy Flanagan said, to get rid of him.  There they had their Chief, their leader for 30 or 40 years, thrown into the fray with all their financial resources, advertisements, cars, and all their manpower, and they received a rebuff in what Fianna Fáil themselves said was one of the most important issues which was ever before the country.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the referendum was held by the method of election which the Fianna Fáil Party had been advocating for six, seven, eight, or nine months &mdash; the X vote &mdash; and even with the X vote, the much lauded X vote, they were beaten by a majority <Col N="52" /> of something approaching 40,000. Apart from the decision of the people to retain P.R., there in another result of the referendum.  So far as I can judge, the people have said to the Fianna Fáil Party and to the Taoiseach-elect: &ldquo;Get on with the job and stop cod-acting.&rdquo;  In the opinion of many people, the proposal to change the electoral system was merely a diversionary move to take the minds of the people off the things that really matter.  That was the real reason for the introduction of the proposal to change the electoral system.  The people resented that and they have told Deputy Lemass, the Fianna Fáil Ministers, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to give up this play-acting and get on with the job which they said they would do prior to the election of March, 1957.</P>
    <P>The result of the referendum, as I say, is an ultimatum that the mandate which Fianna Fáil received in 1957 will not last forever and it is a gentle reminder, and more than a gentle reminder, to Fianna Fáil that if they do not implement the policy which they promised two and a half years ago to carry out, the people will be forced to change the Government at the very first opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am under a misapprehension, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle but I cannot imagine in a debate on the nomination of a Deputy for the office of Taoiseach that it is possible to be out of order.  I do not want deliberately to go outside the terms of the motion, but I understood from past debates that a certain amount of latitude was granted on an <Col N="53" /> occasion like this.  However, I shall try to confine myself&mdash;to what, I do not know, because if we are absolutely confined, we can only say that we are for or against Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>The people have rejected the allegation by Fianna Fáil that P.R. makes for instability, and that P.R. makes for coalitions which, Ministers have said are bad in themselves.  They have rejected the idea that all our difficulties are caused by P.R.  I noticed in one of Deputy Lemass's speeches prior to the referendum, that he took the trade union movement to task for their intervention in the referendum issue.  Why he did that I do not know.  Whether he knows it or not, I should like to tell him that the decision of the trade union movement in deciding to support P.R. as our electoral system was a spontaneous one.  Whether he believes that or not, I do not know, and I do not care, but I know it was a spontaneous move on the part of the trade union movement and, therefore, it is quite legitimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass said, speaking, I think, in Cork, that they had no right to interfere in a political issue, but he did not define what was or was not a political issue, and what issues the trade union movement can make statements on.  I remember at the beginning of the debate on P.R. here Mr. de Valera himself, speaking as Taoiseach, said that this question of changing our electoral system was not a political issue.  Therefore, if we are to believe the former Taoiseach that P.R. <i>versus</i> the straight vote is not a political issue, the trade unions have every right to make their feelings known, and to opt for one side or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the trade union movement should be felt far more in this country.  There is no objection to the trade union movements in Britain or the United States making statements before general elections, coming down on one side or the other and intervening for one Party or the other Party. I am inclined to think that Deputy Lemass imagines that he can, by a few speeches or a few words here and there, control the trade union movement. <Col N="54" /> The sooner he gets that notion out of his head, the better.  It is true that in his own constituency he has a substantial number of working people, members of trade unions, voting for him and his Party but he should not be under the misapprehension that he can control, direct or kick the trade union movement around as he pleases.</P>
    <P>It was perfectly all right when the trade union movement made a statement in commendation of what is now popularly called the Lemass Plan by which it was proposed to spend £100,000,000.  There was no protest then from the Fianna Fáil Party that the trade union movement could not, or should not, make a comment on what was then a policy plan, a political plan of Deputy Lemass's and of the Fianna Fáil party.  Unfortunately even though they did comment, they were very much deluded.  That plan was announced four or five years ago but, as yet, we have not had any results from it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not Deputy Lemass considers that his Wages Stand-still Order back in 1941 was, or was not, political, but whether it was or was not, the trade union movement, again as a spontaneous gesture and in spontaneous organisation, protested very strongly by way of statement and public demonstration all over the country.  They were entitled to make that protest and they were entitled to make a statement on what was then considered to be an acute political decision by the then Government.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement should not be regarded &mdash; nor should the Taoiseach-elect regard them&mdash;as merely negotiators of wages.  If they were merely negotiators of wages, they would be mere cyphers or machines.  If they cannot open their mouths about prices and different aspects of Government policy, whether we have a Fianna Fáil or an inter-Party Government, then they have no real function in this country.  The time has gone when they were mere negotiators in respect of wages, hours and general conditions of employment.  In this country and in other countries, the trade union movements can be, not a hindrance but a help, to the Government and, so far <Col N="55" /> as I know, the trade union movement, no matter what Government are in power, are prepared to confer and consult with the Government for the greater good of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the total abolition of the food subsidies was a political move.  It was done as a matter of policy by the Fianna Fáil Party for reasons which they gave in this House and, at that time, there was no objection to the intervention of the trade union movement by way of statement or protest.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Russell said, one cannot judge Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, in view of the fact that he has never been Taoiseach before.  We can only judge him on the results he achieves.  The whole policy of the Government will not, I hope, be dependent upon the personal decision of Deputy Lemass.  I believe that was the position that obtained when Mr. de Valera was Taoiseach, and that has been the undoing not alone of the Government now constituted of the Fianna Fáil Party but it has been the undoing of the country over the last 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass will have his Cabinet. I respectfully suggest that he will have to tell the Members of his Cabinet to behave differently in future if we are to get results and implement the policy adumbrated prior to the election of 1957.  Deputy Lemass will have to have a Minister for External Affairs who will give up the middle-of-the-road policy as far as the United Nations Organisation is concerned.</P>

I am merely asking Deputy Lemass, if he becomes Taoiseach, to change Government policy in respect of certain things. I think I am entitled to do that at this stage.  I think also that, if we are to get progress as far as Health is concerned, Deputy Lemass will have to induce his Minister for Health, whoever he will be, to be a little bit more generous in his administration of health services.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, it is not the person of Deputy seán Lemass to which I object.  I oppose him because he is a symbol of Fianna Fáil policy in the past and we assume, whether rightly or wrongly, that he will continue that policy in the future. For that reason, I oppose him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Corish, I certainly have no objection, and do not propose to make any objection, to Deputy Lemass on personal grounds or for reasons of personal animosity, or anything like that. I object to the nomination of Deputy Lemass &mdash; or, indeed, to the nomination of any member of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; as Taoiseach in the circumstances which exist at the moment. We have at the moment four Government Ministers sitting on the Front Bench.  In each and every one of the four constituencies that these Ministers represent the Government on a matter of importance, and a matter which Deputy Lemass, I suggest, made an issue of confidence, were defeated.  In three of the constituencies&mdash;that of Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Traynor &mdash; the vote against the issue and against the Government was an overwhelming one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the debate on proportional representation, but it is fair to say that, while some of the Government spokesmen avoided <Col N="57" /> saying anything which would give any Deputy on these Benches an opportunity of challenging them, as I now challenge that they made this an issue of confidence, Deputy Lemass, now nominated as Taoiseach, did make the issue an issue of confidence and did go on record as saying that this proposed change in the voting system was essential for progress in this country and essential for the Government economic policy.  Deputy Lemass made the issue one of confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party have received their answer in no uncertain way from the people.  Deputy Lemass also went on record &mdash; Deputy Corish has referred to this &mdash; as asserting that the issue which the people were asked to decide in relation to the electoral system was a political matter.  It was a political matter.  It was engaged in a political battle, in an atmosphere of political controversy.  The Government have been severely defeated on that issue.  In those circumstances is it not only right that Deputies should query the position when we find Deputy Lemass drawing his mandate not from the people but from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party only?  So far as the people are concerned, they had an opportunity of expressing their views on a matter of major Government policy submitted to them on the 17th of this month.  By a substantial majority the people decided against the Government.</P>
    <P>I said that, in my view, Deputy Lemass made the issue an issue of confidence.  I want to support that assertion now by referring to two speeches which Deputy Lemass made charging the people to change the system of election, to abolish proportional representation and accept what was described as the &ldquo;straight vote.&rdquo; He is reported as follows in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Monday, 1st June, when speaking in Carlow: &mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass, who was speaking at the annual dinner of the Carlow Fianna Fáil Cumann in the Crofton Hotel, said that Fianna Fáil had planned their course with care.  They knew where they were going, and they knew where they wanted to <Col N="58" /> lead Ireland, so that the welfare of the people and the future of the country could be secured.</P>
    <P>He was sure that everyone would accept without hesitation or question an assertion that in deciding upon the course of changing the system of electing Deputies which had now been proposed, they had one aim and one aim only, and that was to protect the future of the country and to provide for its progress.</P>
    <P>As reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on Monday, 8th June, speaking at Cork, Deputy Lemass said: &mdash;</P>
    <P>This Constitutional reform, said Mr. Lemass, had been proposed because the Government were convinced that it was a necessary step to promote the welfare of the country, and that meant the interests of the wage earner in particular.  He called on all workers while remaining loyal to their trade unions in trade union affairs, to make their individual decisions on this political issue by the use of their own judgement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made it quite clear there &mdash; at the time he was speaking as Tánaiste in the Government of the former Taoiseach&mdash;that this was a step political issue and that it was a step the Government considered necessary to promote the welfare of the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that those two statements of Deputy Lemass make it quite clear that he regarded this matter, not merely as a matter of importance but, as he himself says, as a necessary step to promote the welfare of the country. The welfare of the country, presumably, is what the Government were aiming at in the policy, if we can find one, which they have been pursuing since the last general election.  The people have made it clear by their votes on the 17th of this month that they do not agree with Deputy Lemass, that they do not agree with the policies which have been pursued and for which, according to Deputy Lemass, the proposed change was a necessary step.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have pointed out that during the course of the debate in this House before the referendum was held <Col N="59" /> the case was made from these benches &mdash; and it was justified in the result &mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party were throwing everything they could into the campaign to change the electoral system, that they intended using all the strength and wealth of their organisation, that they intended using their string of Party newspapers, that they intended using the personality of their then leader, in an effort to influence the people to vote in favour of the proposition which they were making.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has already adverted to the now notorious poster placarded on every hoarding in the city urging the people to vote &ldquo;Yes and de Valera.&rdquo;  Was there a more blatant effort to confuse and mix the two issues set before the people on the 17th of June than that slogan?</P>

      <P>I have no intention of going into any detailed discussion on this matter but, like yourself, I must have regard to the voice of the people and the voice of the people has been heard in no uncertain manner.  This, I said, Sir, was a political battle fought in the atmosphere which I have described and every effort was made by the members of Deputy Lemass's Party to dragoon the people or, in any event, to persuade the people into voting for the change in the electoral system by the methods which I have described.  The people stood firm.  They said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Fianna Fáil.  They made it clear that they had not any confidence in the Government <Col N="60" /> which was proposing what the Government painted as an important and major matter of policy.</P>
      <P>It has already been pointed out, and I think it is necessary that we should bear it in mind, that during the discussion here immediately following the election of the Government two and a quarter years ago, or during the election campaign which preceded their election as Government, no mention was made of the Government's proposal to change the electoral system. I have no hesitation in saying &mdash; I said it during the course of the discussions in this House on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill &mdash; that if that intention has been disclosed by the Fianna Fáil Party at the time of the last general election the people would not have trusted them with a majority in this House over all other Parties.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were elected to this House to do what they themselves described at the time as &ldquo;to get cracking&rdquo; to solve the problems of unemployment and emigration.  It may be said to the credit of some of the Government spokesmen that in the course of discussions in this House they did not conceal their belief that the people had elected them as a Government for the purpose of ending unemployment and emigration.  That was 2¼ years ago.  As Deputy John A. Costello has pointed out, nine months out of the period since then has been taken up by discussion and debate on an electoral system and the final submission of that issue to the people for decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, Sir. I do not think that any Deputy or any former Minister can withstand the argument that, having regard to the importance which the Government attached to the question, having regard to the pronouncements of Deputy Lemass in the course of the campaign and having regard to the amount of time and money which the Government felt it was necessary to utilise in an effort to change the electoral system, a defeat on that issue by the people is a vote of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in the <Col N="61" /> Government.  I do not think any member of the Fianna Fáil Party can deny that.</P>
      <P>Instead of getting on with the job which the Government were elected to do, they themselves deliberately chose to put this important issue before the people and, whether they like it or not, they have to take the decision of the people.  Because they did not disclose their intention at the time of the General Election to bring this issue before the people, there is nothing we can do now by our votes in this House to put the present Government out of office but I sincerely trust that they will have regard to the views expressed by the people on this issue in the referendum, that they will have regard to the fact that the people have given a clear and decisive answer to the proposition made by the Government. I hope that the Government will have regard to the fact that in Deputy Seán MacEntee's constituency 13,109 people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that while Deputy Lemass is contemplating the referendum results he will glance at Deputy Booth's constituency also and take note of the fact that over 8,000 more persons in that constituency voted against the Government's proposal than the number that voted in support of it.</P>
      <P>In face of these figures, in face of the very definite, clear-cut decision of the people not to support a matter of major policy of the Government, I do not see how even Fianna Fáil can have the nerve to suggest that they should remain on as the Government of this country.  If we could get any assurance from them that they were now prepared to &ldquo;get cracking,&rdquo; that they were now prepared to implement the hope held out to the wives of unemployed persons in 1957 in the poster: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands out to work&rdquo;; if we could even find in the next few months that there is any realisation in a Government over which Deputy Lemass hopes to preside that they regard unemployment as the test of Government policy then there are people in this country who might be prepared to adopt the attitude that there is a new broom coming in, particularly if Deputy Lemass takes the decision to have something of a clearing in the ranks of the Cabinet and brings in some new blood.  It might very well be that people would be prepared to adopt the attitude that perhaps he should get a chance to carry on, to get back to the programme put before the people at the General Election by means of the Fianna Fáil posters and propaganda.  We have no evidence whatever that the Government propose to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had two or three words in Irish from Deputy MacEntee and another <Col N="63" /> couple of words in Irish from Deputy Dr. Ryan when proposing Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach.  Neither of them made any reference to the work Deputy Lemass will do as Taoiseach. We heard no speaker from the Fianna Fáil Party who let us know whether there will be any change in the attitude of the members of that Party or in the Government to the problems which face this country.  We have no idea whatever what policy Deputy Lemass, as Taoiseach, with a new Government proposes to follow.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to argue with the Chair, it would seem to me that Deputies on this side of the House are entitled to request, if they cannot require, the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to give some indication of why they are proposing Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, what hopes they repose in him, what policy they want him to follow, what targets he is setting up, what aims the Government he proposes to lead have.  In the absence of any statement from any member of the Fianna Fáil Party as to what policy Deputy Lemass and the Government which he hopes to lead intend to follow, it seems to me that we on this side of the House are entitled to put our requests before Deputy Lemass and to advise him of the type of policy which we believe he should follow and to require him to answer, before this debate concludes, whether or not he intends to comply with those requests.</P>
    <P>In that sense, it seems to me that most things are relevant to this discussion but I do not intend to travel further along those lines.</P>

      <P>In view of the complete reversal the Government have met at the polls within the past few days, neither Deputy Lemass nor any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party should be nominated as Taoiseach at least without an assurance that the views of the people as expressed in the ballot boxes will be respected and that the people will be given an opportunity under P.R. of electing a new Government.</P>

      <P>Both political <Col N="64" /> Parties can claim victories after this election and each can accuse the other of defeat.  The greatest victory after these elections was the victory of the Irish people who asserted themselves in retaining the system of election which elected every Deputy to Dáil Éireann. It proved the confidence they had in the elected representatives they sent to Dáil Éireann.  It showed the confidence they had in the system of election and it showed that they were reasonably pleased with the manner in which the country was progressing.</P>
      <P>Some of us may not always agree with what the Government do but, nevertheless, once this Government were elected by the majority of the people they have their responsibilities. Their big responsibility on this occasion is to select the best man from within their own Party to be the head of the Government and to lead that Government along the right road. It is not for me, as an Independent, to say to them whom they should elect.  They have the experience of Deputy Lemass as Tánaiste in the Government for a long number of years.  It is indeed a tribute to him that he should be selected unanimously by his Party to be the new Taoiseach.  I congratulate him on that fact.  It is a great honour to him and I only hope for and wish him every success in his new office.  I shall not oppose him.  We all know that it is only a waste of time.  On the other hand, I wish him the best of luck.</P>
      <P>The result of the election is a very clear indication that the people have begun to think for themselves.  The day of the flag waving is over.  The day when the Irish people will blindly follow leaders and politicians is gone. They have begun to think for themselves. They will vote on results and, on results, every one of us must stand or fall in this House.  This Government also will have to stand or fall by the results they achieve in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that rural Ireland voted a majority in favour of the abolition of P.R., I cannot agree with that view.  I come from a rural constituency in which a very big majority voted in favour of the retention of <Col N="65" /> P.R., the system the people were accustomed to and the system under which this Government and every member of this House were elected. My area of rural Ireland was in favour of retaining the system of P.R. I think they were wise in that regard. I believe it will stay for a long time with us as I do not think any Government will ever again undertake the risk of facing the people on that issue. I think the people were good judges in that respect and, in their choice of President I would say they gave credit to Mr. Eamon de Valera for life-long service to the country.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Lemass will be as successful as Mr. Eamon de Valera in the end of his career and that he will get the same support from the Irish people as Mr. de Valera has got.  I wish him the best of luck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add just a few words to what has been said from these benches in relation to this motion.  I think we all have the greatest sympathy personally with Deputy Lemass in relation to the manner in which he is proposed as the head of the Government.  He is asked to take over the leadership of the Government Party and to head the Government at a time when, by the deliberate action of his predecessor and of members of the Government, a situation of grave uncertainty and instability has been created in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been usual in the past number of months for the Leaders of Parties to emphasise the importance of stability to the nation.  Everything that has been said with regard to that should now be borne in mind because we in this country are now unnecessarily in a condition of grave uncertainty and instability.  That situation has been brought about by the deliberate action of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is something that must raise in the public mind grave questions as to their suitability for continuance in office.  Nothing happened in this House; nothing happened in the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to any disagreement in policy, I assume, to have led to the present political situation which came about unnecessarily <Col N="66" /> at the end of last year when, without anyone asking them, the then Leader of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party, proceeded to propose to the people a question the people did not require proposed, and indeed the people who made that issue have created for themselves a first-class problem.  It is in those circumstances that this House is asked to approve of the nomination of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Our position has been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition.  We cannot support this motion because in the past week the people have been forced to give a serious rebuff to the Government.  I have no doubt that, as a result of the vote, Deputy Lemass will be elected as the head of the Government.  I hope that when he is elected he will have regard to the reason why he and his Party are sitting on the Ceann Comhairle's left.  They were sent there over two years ago to do what they asked the people to entitle them to do&mdash;to build up the economic strength of the country, to provide 100,000 more jobs for Irish boys and girls, to give to the people the actuality of the prosperity which was outlined so forcibly by the Tánaiste in the last general election. Those are the things that brought about the defeat of the last Government. Those are the reasons why the Fianna Fáil Party are now in a majority in this House.  It was for the achievement of those aims that Fianna Fáil were given a majority in the last election.  They were not sent here to engage in redrafting our Constitution. They were not sent here to provoke before the people philosophical discussions on the merits or demerits of particular electoral systems.  Those were not part of the reason they were sent here.</P>
    <P>They were sent here to do what the Tánaiste himself asked the people to permit them to do, to do a job of work.  For the last nine months they have not been doing that and the result is clearly to be seen in the financial and economic situation in the country.  It is to be hoped there will now be a change of pattern by the Government and that they will seek <Col N="67" /> to make up for the time that has been wasted in recent months and get on with the job they were sent here to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to give briefly the reason I do not propose to support Deputy Lemass's nomination.  It is not merely because I am a member of the Fine Gael Party and have to follow them up the steps.  It has been noteworthy that, beyond the brief proposal by the Minister for Health and its seconding by the Minister for Finance, we had not a word from one member of the rank and file of Fianna Fáil in support of the nomination.  I wonder is it merely because they feel that Deputy Lemass is not worthy to step into the boots of the ex-Taoiseach or is it that he has not got the confidence of the rank and file?</P>
      <P>Before this Government got the answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; from the people in the recent election they said that P.R. was the greatest obstacle to economic progress. I submit that that is an admission by Fianna Fáil of their inability to deal with the major problems that concern this country.  In view of that admission, I hold they have no right to ask this House to give them a new lease of life by electing a new Taoiseach, by electing the head of the Government from a Party that came into this House with the greatest strength of any Party, failed to carry out the promises on which they were elected, and failed to &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo; on the major issues on which they were elected&mdash;the 100,000 jobs, the £100,000,000 plan, the plans that were put forward in Clery's ballroom.  I hold it would only be proper that people should be given a chance of deciding, not only in relation to the position of the Taoiseach but in relation to the entire Government.  Let them go before the people.  They have got a vote of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo;.  Let them throw in the towel decently and say: &ldquo;Yes.  Let the people decide.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass is not prepared to accept that ultimatum from the people I ask him to make a statement over which he is prepared to stand and which this time 12 months will bear fruit.  Reference has been made by some of the Deputies from my constituency <Col N="68" /> to the recent vote there.  They may be trying to keep their hearts up but I would remind them that one swallow does not make a summer.  I would welcome an election in my constituency. I shall come in here and I shall not be ashamed to open my mouth like ten members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have not yet made their maiden speech here.  I call it a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>Within an hour the House will be called upon to elect a new Taoiseach and in those circumstances it is unfortunate that some more information is not being provided relative to the position of the Government. I realise that a Taoiseach must be elected and must then form his Cabinet, but surely Deputies, before they go into the Division Lobby, ought to be told something about the occupant of the most important position in the State, that of Taoiseach, Prime Minister, and also the duties that in themselves may demand the full attention of a Cabinet Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>We know that when this Government were formed two and a quarter years ago, they came into this House with a majority unequalled in the history of the State.  Despite the fact that the former Taoiseach had that extraordinary number of Deputies to draw upon to fill his Cabinet, in his opinion, he did not have within the ranks of his Parliamentary Party in Dáil Éireann sufficient men to fill the Cabinet.  He had to go outside Dáil Éireann to get a man to fill a major Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating a positive fact.  If the stage is now reached at which the new Taoiseach finds that he may have to carry out duties other than those of Taoiseach, it reflects poorly on this House if the major Party holding the number of seats it holds is not in a position to provide from within its own ranks the personnel in Dublin.  We are asked to vote not knowing whether the Taoiseach proposed will be enabled to devote his entire attention and duties to the tremendous task that lies ahead of him as Head of the Government. That is information that it would be <Col N="69" /> well the House should have before the Division is taken.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the Party elected two and a quarter years ago have four fewer Deputies in the House today than they had then.  Consequently, they cannot claim they are in a better position to look to their ranks for the personnel to fill the vacancies which now exist in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I hold one thing in particular against the Deputy who is proposed as Taoiseach.  I think it was one of the most regrettable instances in the history of the State.  It was something I regretted.  It was dragged across the political scene in the course of the recent referendum.  We were anxious that capital would be given freely by the people so that the Government might go ahead with various schemes as quickly as was humanly possible to provide our people with employment and houses and to operate the various schemes that are still being undertaken and which require to be undertaken so that we might achieve our economic goal.  In an atmosphere in which an inter-Party Government sought to secure money in this country for such schemes, Deputy Lemass went out to the dead walls of this city and placarded the dead walls with the pawnbrokers' sign and that at a time when the National Loan was in progress.</P>

      <P>I claim that the Party now in opposition offered this Government at the time the National Loan was launched every encouragement. They came forward and invited the people to participate in these loans. Again, in regard to the abolition of proportional representation, they used the chapel gates and public places to make charges that are unsustainable in this House.  They were never made within the walls of this House but within the course of the recent campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> If the Government find themselves in the embarrassing position at this moment of facing political instability, they have brought that down upon their own shoulders.  I am sure there are many men sitting on the benches across the floor of the House who would dearly wish they had accepted the advice of the Party on this side of the House when the problem of the amendment of the Constitution was thrown up.  It was suggested that it might have been a better thing if they had submitted the matter to a commission. We felt that much of the abstention during the recent referendum was indicative of the desire of the people not to be bothered at this time by this question.</P>
    <P>We have wasted nine months of the time of this House, as if no other problem remained to be resolved.  We have spent over a quarter of a million pounds of the taxpayers' money&mdash;on what?  Is there an additional man employed today in consequence of the expenditure of that time, energy and money?  The people have expressed their resentment.  The difficulties facing the country still obtain.  The referendum was a diversion created unnecessarily. It resulted in a serious political rebuff for what the Government said was an integral part of their policy. They were the people who were responsible for so closely aligning the difficulties of the country with what they claimed was the all-out necessity, to resolve those difficulties by changing the electoral system.</P>
    <P>The people have decided emphatically that they want P.R. to stay and the Government have experienced that rebuff.  It is one which they asked for themselves.  They did not listen to the voice of people removed from this Chamber&mdash;people outside this House who advised them to watch their step, that they were trying on something that the people did not want.  In particular parts of the country, there is complete dissatisfaction with the inactivity and failures of the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass was deputy leader of the Government over the past two and a quarter years. The rebuff which his Party has experienced is an indication to him and his Government that the people do not wish the Government to carry on with the play-acting they have pursued, particularly during the past 12 months and that they require them to go ahead with the job of work they said they would undertake.  We offered cooperation when this Government were formed.  We expected that the Government who promised to get cracking would do so.  Deputy Lemass was the architect of such phrases as &ldquo;Get cracking&rdquo; and &ldquo;Get your husbands back to work&rdquo; which indicated that he would be the spearhead of this dynamic drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that Deputy Lemass was not inactive. He had a quarter of a century to do all the things which the Deputy may feel he can still perform.  I feel that the Deputy is deserving of the remarks passed in regard to his energy and his capacity.  I think they have been expended down through the years at the expense of agriculture.  I feel that he has succeeded in completely dominating the Minister for Agriculture in his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of concern to the country that our major Ministry has suffered so much at the hands of a Party of which he was such a very prominent executive for so long.  When the election was over and the referendum was defeated, there was then an opportunity for Deputy Lemass to show his capacity as a future Taoiseach by making a constructive statement: &ldquo;Well, here is an issue which has been resolved.  It is now incumbent upon us to take up where we should not have left off and complete the job of work this Government were elected to perform.&rdquo;  Instead of that, we had the public statement which he made recently and which coincided with the announcement of his Government that the proposed Third Amendment was now dead, a statement which was published on the radio and in the <Col N="72" /> Press, in which he indicated that what was now paramount in the minds of the Government was the revision of the constituencies.</P>
    <P>The people are sick and tired of the high level constitutional discussions ranging over the past twelve months which arose from absolutely no suggestion or appeal from the electorate. They want this House to do the job of work which Deputies were elected to perform.  It is certainly no encouragement to learn on the heels of the definite rebuff that the Government received to their proposal to amend the Constitution, that what is now uppermost in the minds of the Government is the immediate introduction of a Bill which, in the minds of many, is regarded as being intended to nullify the decision of the electorate only a week ago.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Tánaiste sought to draw some consolation&mdash;and no doubt it was intended to revive the flagging spirits of his supporters&mdash;that there was some doubt in the minds of the people inasmuch as the preponderance of opposition was in the urban areas.  If that argument were carried to its logical conclusion, the answer would be that the rulers in the Six Counties, because they have a majority, are entitled to regard it as a separate State.  If that argument against their contention holds good in that respect it should also hold good in this present issue.</P>
    <P>When this House divides on this motion, some six Deputies will troop in loyally to elect the new Taoiseach but in fact the six Deputies to whom I am referring were never elected on the basis that they were supporters of the Fianna Fáil policy.  All the posters for them and all the speeches made on their behalf indicated that a vote for them was a vote for Eamon de Valera. Deputy Russell, one of the two Independent Deputies who supported the Government in its attempt to change the Constitution, accepted the verdict but on the other hand he was inclined to belittle the 37,000 majority who favoured the retention of proportional representation and said that that should not be taken in any way as being indicative of the situation of the <Col N="73" /> country as it was such a negligible proportion of the votes.  I would remind Deputy Russell that only 12,000 votes in the last general election gave the present Government its majority in this House.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons we feel that Deputy Lemass should be opposed in this election to the position of Taoiseach.  During the last two and a quarter years there has been a miserable response to the confidence which the people reposed in the Government at that time and the indications in recent weeks have been that the Government are aligning their economic policy with the issue that it would be necessary to change the electoral system in order to bring their hopes to fruition.  For those reasons we feel that the majority recorded as being opposed to them in the referendum was also indicative of the lack of confidence in the country in a Government that has so miserably failed to stand up to the obligations which they accepted so freely two and a quarter years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the appointment of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach.  I am not doing so on personal grounds because I consider that he is one of the few men in the Party with intelligence, energy and ability and a very great capacity for the kind of work that he will be required to do in future.  I am surprised that there was ever any doubt about the choice of person for the position of Taoiseach in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am quite satisfied that Deputy Lemass was streets ahead of others in that Party when it came to the election of a person to act as Prime Minister.  However, we must examine the record and ascertain the position at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Less than a week ago we saw a very definite vote of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; expressed by the people.  Are we going to disregard the vote of the people by having a majority, which was secured by promises to end unemployment and emigration and create prosperity in the country, used to nominate Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach?  I think he deserves better and that the Fianna Fáil Party should go to the country and ask the people if they are prepared <Col N="74" /> to support Deputy Lemass, or any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party, as Taoiseach on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is unfair for the Fianna Fáil Party to use their majority now.  Instead of appointing a Taoiseach they ought to have given the people an opportunity to change the Government if they want to, or re-elect the present Government.  The figures showed that the people have changed considerably in their views.  In my own constituency there was a change of 8,000 votes, which is nearly as many thousands as there are in many of the constituencies. I feel that we should have an election so that we would have the voice of the people expressed in this House. The majority which the Fianna Fáil Party have was secured by promises which have not been carried out.  Let them now face the people and admit that they did not carry out these promises, or were incapable of doing so. Let them put a policy to the people instead of a personality as they did in the past without making their policy known.</P>
    <P>In the Presidential election we notice that the former Taoiseach secured less than one-third of the votes of the electorate.  That in itself expressed the disgust of the public in general.  Remember that Deputy Lemass was associated in the past with the biggest promises which have not been fulfilled. He was reminded today of the 100,000 jobs which so many destitute, unemployed families were led to believe could be secured and could be provided by a Fianna Fáil Government, through the promises which they got from Deputy Lemass.  In Dublin City and County&mdash;for various reasons Dublin is Ireland&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party were beaten.</P>

      <P>In this House he was one of the leaders of the campaign attempting to strip the electors of their ordinary democratic rights to vote under the P.R. system and intending instead to supply them with a strait-jacket. That was a major policy issue on which the Government were defeated and Deputy Lemass was a very prominent supporter of the straight vote system.  Though it was rejected by the electorate I assume that, when he took that view at that time, he still holds it. From his recent statement he has indicated in fact that having failed in getting away with the strait-jacket system, it is proposed to bring in a system which will bring nearer to the actual position the system that they tried to implement.</P>
      <P>I hope that when Deputy Lemass is selecting his Ministry he will not give the House the &ldquo;Old Brigade&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>He was critical of Irish agriculture many times and the question is whether he will be critical of agriculture in future or will he, instead, put his hand to a progressive agricultural policy?  For many years we have been without a Minister for Agriculture except in a nominal way, and it is of great importance to the country that we ought to have a practical approach to agriculture.  Therefore, the question arises whether Deputy Lemass will have that kind of helpful attitude to it, remembering that agricultural exports are the mainstay of our trading balance?  It will be important to have a person in the position of Taoiseach who will realise that agriculture is our main industry, our most important industry, that it should have the sympathy of any policy he proposes to implement within his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has been associated with several major blunders.  For instance, he has been associated with <Col N="77" /> the Wages Standstill Order which was vigorously opposed and which did not appear to be justified.  He was also associated with the bringing in of a ten years' supply of fuel into the Phoenix Park, nearly three years after the war had ended.  As a result of that, coal and turf were allowed to waste in the Park at considerable public expense.  We remembered, too, that he put through the Transport Bill.  I think it was in 1943 or 1944.  It was a major issue and, of course, he was the architect of it and was the person who determined policy in relation to it.  The question arises would it have been better to leave the citizens of Dublin City and County with the very efficient old service that they had?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is that the Dublin people are paying higher bus fares now.  They would have a much cheaper system of transport had the old system been kept.  In many ways the question arises as to whether in fact Deputy Lemass was the architect of Fianna Fáil policy and, if so, a great number of people do not agree with that policy.  The question is whether he is going to persist with the policy that has been proved to be a failure and which has been rejected twice in the last ten years?  Is he going to persist with that policy or is he going to devise a new one?  I believe he is a man of intelligence and ability and would be able to devise a new policy but, if he is to carry on the policy that Fianna Fáil had in the past, I consider he would not be a suitable person for the position of Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>However, as I say, with the departure of Mr. de Valera from active political life it is possible that Deputy Lemass will take a new look at the national situation and that he will implement a new policy.  I consider that he is a very capable person and, if he is given the opportunity, I hope he will implement a new policy because the policy that has been operated has been rejected twice by the people during the last ten years.  If it is that type of policy he intends to pursue then we are entitled to a general election.</P>

They can elect any nominee of their own with the majority which they have got in this House but, in the public mind, that majority was secured under false pretences. For that reason, that majority should not be used for the purpose of electing any Prime Minister.  Let us instead heed the message which we got through the ballot boxes last week. Let us have a general election now and let the people decide for themselves what Government ought to take over under a new Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass starts his race for the office of Taoiseach without at least one disability&mdash;that is we have not had a description of him by the Minister for Health or the Minister for Finance, who proposed and seconded him.  I congratulate him on escaping that.  I think his unanimous selection by the Fianna Fáil Party, and the various tributes paid to him are perhaps a more satisfactory adornment of his case in this House than anything we might have had either from the Minister for Health or the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Nobody knows better than Deputy Lemass the legacy offered to him, and nobody will know better where that legacy comes from.  He has an inheritance, or rather the country has an inheritance which will help it to face whatever there is of loss or difficulty in the legacy.  Far be it from me to hold any of the various Ministers who have been speaking recently about either the political or the economic situation to an explanation of some or any of their words, but in the case of Deputy Lemass, there is a statement of his which, in relation to its implications, requires to be commented on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> In my own view, the implications are such that his nomination is to be opposed.  The country has suffered back over the years to the date this State was founded through a political philosophy held by the former Taoiseach, and that political philosophy has operated to destroy the full potential of this Parliament to deal with the problems the country was left with in 1922 and the problems that have arisen since.</P>
    <P>When, in the debate that has taken place in the past few months, Deputy Lemass, referring to Arthur Griffith, describes him as &ldquo;an immature political mind&rdquo; and some of his philosophy as the result of an immature political thinking on the back pages of Griffith's paper, it discloses a philosophic approach to the functions of this House that, to my mind, make him completely unsuited to handle the political leadership of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Lemass was present when I was saying he was left a legacy of serious problems but he has also been left an inheritance in this institution.  If this institution is not accepted in the spirit in which it was created, and built up freely and harmoniously, on the foundation on which it was laid, then no leader can deal with the problems that beset the country because the people will be left without the type of parliamentary institution they require.</P>
    <P>We have said before that the political school from which our present generation came was inspired and encouraged by the political philosophy and writing of Arthur Griffith and there is no person who contributed in any way on any side of this House in the formation of policy here, to the building up of this House, who does not derive from the teachings and inspiration and example of Griffith's political philosophy everything that went to the make-up of his character, his ability and his mental approach and the make up of the comradeship that went to deal with the problems. That philosophy was split&mdash;at least the harmony of the organisation and solidarity of that philosophy was split <Col N="80" />&mdash;by the philosophy of the former Taoiseach and now we are asked to support for appointment to that post a Deputy who condemns the philosophy that was our strength.  That recalls to us that the 17th of June this year is one date and on 17th of June, 1919, Dáil Éireann met and on the proposal of Cathal Brugha, seconded by Joe McGuinness of Longford, Arthur Griffith was nominated substitute President because Eamon de Valera, the President of that time, had successfully landed in America and was to be there for a year and six or seven months.</P>
    <P>The shepherding and the guiding of the work of Dáil Éireann&mdash;at any rate, from the position of President&mdash;was committed into the hands of Arthur Griffith at that time and he was the man who was asked when the fruits of the work of Dáil Éireann were to be reaped around the council table, to undertake the laborious job of sitting in council with the British and doing his best.  His approach was that men and women of every Party, creed and class working in Ireland, all loved Ireland in their own way and in waiting through 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, his policy was to give the road to the Irish Parliamentary Party at that time who were going to get some kind of Parliament in Ireland.  His teaching was that everybody in the country had a contribution to make from their experience and their wisdom and love of the country and that what was wanted was what he called the consensus&mdash;that was a Parliament of some kind, a representative body of some kind of men and women of every creed and class who could come together and give of their experience and advice and of their work, so that the love of country present in all of them would fructify and that the harmony that would develop as they worked together would strengthen the country as a whole and wipe out the animosities and divisions that had been created here because of the fact that they had no such representative centre in which they could get together and work before that.</P>
    <P>This Assembly is now in a more effective and sovereign way the type of assembly that was looked for and <Col N="81" /> worked for then and the most recent action of the Fianna Fáil Party was an action in definite sequence with previous actions of theirs from the beginning against this Assembly.  It was done when they went only the other day in their most recent action to destroy the spirit in which this Assembly was created and change it from being the kind of Assembly that it is, an Assembly of the people.</P>
    <P>I want to recall this in making the point that this was Griffith's approach to it.  Looking back into the past, he had come through the Parnell debacle and had been a supporter of Parnell but he pointed out that O'Connellism and Parnellism were dangerous expedients because while they were the only things one could have at that time, you had the people leaning on one man.  He wanted to create conditions in which not even the decadence or downfall of leaders would result in a broken or mutinous front of the people.  This House has demonstrated from the beginning of its establishment that you have here an institution that has left the people where they were not dependent on one man or a great man.  They were not dependent on one man who, for one reason or another might break down in any way and fail the people.  We have only just now, by our work in the Parliament and the opportunity given to the people, saved this Assembly for what it was meant to be and held it for what it is.</P>
    <P>We are in this difficulty, that when we are asked to support Deputy Lemass as the new Taoiseach, he is presented to us by the Party opposite, he being an effective leader of that Party, which set itself out to destroy the very basis of the fabric that was here.  There are two implications in that.  The first is that he does not understand what the people have done since they were challenged by the Conservative Party long ago, in 1911, 1912, or 1915.  If the Deputy does not understand that, then we are in a very unhappy position.  Secondly, he does not understand how necessary it is that this House should be one where every Party, creed and class <Col N="82" /> could come together, in whatever way the electorate propose to send them here.  Then as a representative body, in honest and fair-minded discussion of things, we would get the best out of ourselves as individuals and as groups.  Out of the work which could be done honestly here, in the light of that responsibility, there would be such integration of individuals and groups into parties which might in a natural way give reality to the expression of the people's strength.</P>
    <P>I react absolutely against the election of a leader of a Government to-day which understands so little of the past and which has so little understanding of what this House is for and what it can do in the reconciliation of the divisions which have taken place internally here since 1922, on the one hand, in the reconciliation of the points of view and in the linking up of the energies and the capacities of the various sections of our people, to do the work that requires to be done.  If any leader of a Government attempts to direct Government affairs without using this Parliament in that type of spirit, then he is cutting off his arm, he is cutting off his voice and he is cutting himself off from inspiration from the people.</P>
    <P>For that particular reason, I absolutely oppose the election of a person as Taoiseach who approaches political tradition in Ireland in the spirit in which Deputy Lemass approaches it. We have heard of the speeches he made and the work he did to try to abolish fair representation of the people and the fair vote here.  The second thing that troubles me about the present situation is the dilemma in which the people are.  They have been presented with that attack on their tradition and on their liberty. They have been presented with it by an absolutely rigid, uncompromising move on the part of the whole Fianna Fáil Party, behind a leader who professed, and acted upon, a policy that has completely stifled the voice of an organisation and a Party here.  That has divided and bewildered the whole people and led them into the political and economic upset in which I am sure Deputy <Col N="83" /> Lemass understands we all are at the present time.</P>
    <P>The proposal to tamper with the spirit and the structure and the power of this House was, in my opinion, embarked on for two reasons.  First, it was a pursuit and a continuance of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to make this country a one-Party State. Secondly, it was escapism from the problems they found and had to face when they settled themselves into office.  That was the second reason for the move in August last&mdash;Mr. de Valera looking into his heart and telling his Government and organisation what he thought and getting the <i>nihil obstat</i> from them without a word of criticism.  This, Deputy Lemass himself admitted, was something unique in the whole political history of Europe.  This second reason was to escape, to mark time, to allow them to make up their minds as to what policy they could adopt to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>The last nine months have not solved or eased any of the problems &mdash;of production, of trade or of unemployment. The Government's outlook, as far as we know, is no clearer than it was in August last.  We find the people looking to the Government and to this Parliament.  They find the Fianna Fáil Party asking in that Parliament that Deputy Lemass be made Taoiseach, without any indication as to their approach to the situation.  The people know that the Fianna Fáil majority was based upon their promises to deal effectively and radically with the problems which existed then, which have existed ever since they came in, and which exist now. The people look at a situation in which all that Deputy Lemass has to say is that he proposes to rearrange the constituencies in accordance with the Constitution.  In the meantime, the Government have a substantial majority in the House, but are evidently incapable of dealing with the various problems with which they are faced. The proposed leader of the Government has stated that the wiping out of P.R. is necessary for the economic development of the country, but those opposite seem to have no idea of what that may mean.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> Without reviewing their attitude with regard to this House, without reviewing the unrepresentative character of the House by reason of the fact that their majority is based upon false promises and false representations made to the electorate, is it the position that the Government are asking us to accept a situation in which they just reform the ranks and jog along, in circumstances in which vital considerations and vital discussions have to take place at parliamentary level, affecting the interest of nearly every section of the people, because of the economic developments in Europe and elsewhere, apart altogether from anything that may arise out of political developments elsewhere?</P>
    <P>I do not emphasise the outside economic situation or the outside political situation as the thing which should drive us to face this Parliament properly, and to see our political work was carried on in the way the people understand and that it had their confidence.  I think that our own personal sense of responsibility for our own work, for the development of education and the strengthening of the minds of our people, both morally and spiritually, to face the difficulty of whatever kind of work that involves should be the driving force.  But all the discussions we are likely to be induced to have are likely to be discussions that will induce us to consider outside trade, the financial situation and so on, whereas what is vitally wrong is the whole approach at the political level to the machinery of discussion, the machinery of the assembly of facts, the machinery for linking our discussions here with the opinion and work of the country generally.</P>
    <P>If we are electing a Taoiseach here tonight, we are electing him absolutely blindfold and we are electing him simply because the majority Party in the Dáil are going to steamroll a nomination through here without any approach to looking at the things that have immediately happened and considering, in the light of their implication, the work of this Parliament.  I feel that the country has been bewildered by the wastage of time for the past nine months.  It has been bewildered by the wastage of the attack on <Col N="85" /> the electoral system.  It has been left completely without any idea as to what plans or what advice the Government have to give the people with regard to any of their problems.  As has been said here, the people see a Government going to tinker with the constituencies and jogging along but without any feeling that they can settle down to a settled political situation and to any kind of understanding of a settled economic programme.</P>
    <P>The Government Party must understand that they have to clear that political situation at the earliest possible moment.  I do not know how that political situation can be cleared until you reach a position in which the people are again given a chance of seeing that the representation in this House is changed from the distorted representation here at present.  If they want a Fianna Fáil Government, they are entitled to a Fianna Fáil Government. If they do not want it, they are entitled to say they do not want it.  But if they want a Fianna Fáil Government, then they should be in the position, and everybody else should be in the position, to know that it is a Government elected by a Parliament which the people say is a representative Parliament.  I do not believe they do want it.  I do not believe they do want it, not because I want to interpret in any way the results of either the Presidential election or the referendum, but the very atmosphere of the country tells you that they do not.  They do not want to walk blindly into the <Col N="86" /> future after being mobbed, bludgeoned and bulldozed by the political antics of the Government Party for the past nine months.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem facing the head of the new Government to be selected tonight is this: not only has he to face looking at the various problems sitting at the doorstep of every one of his Departments, not only has he to face discussions and getting his Party to realise what their attitude to this assembly, individually and as Party members, will be, but he has to consider the position in which he stands with regard to the people as a whole whom he has to get to understand that this Parliament must be one that they have confidence in, that they know is doing its best as a deliberative assembly and that they know is giving of its best as a Government.</P>
    <P>I oppose the nomination of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach because of these things&mdash;lack of complete understanding of where our political strength came from that enabled us to make this establishment what it is, lack of understanding of how this establishment should be worked, lack of understanding of many of the problems and the magnitude of them, left to the hands of any leader of Government today, by reason of the fact that the spirit and intention of this Parliament has been trampled on by his Party from the time it was established. For that reason, I oppose the proposition before the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Dáil for having nominated me as Taoiseach.  I deeply appreciate that a high honour has been conferred upon me, and a very great responsibility also.  I do not think it is possible for any man to face the prospect of becoming Head of the Irish Government without having doubts as to his personal ability to discharge properly the responsibilities of the office and anxiety as to how the country may fare during his term.

      <P>I have been honoured by the confidence shown in me by my Party.  Their unanimity and the support given to me by my colleagues in the former Government may, to some extent, reduce my doubts and ease my anxiety, but they cannot remove them entirely. With their assured support, I hope that the country will have reason, when the time comes for me to stand down again, to say that we did our duty well.</P>

    <P>PÁDRAIG Ó hIRIGHILE (Patrick J. Hillery).</P>
    <P>As the need to re-nominate the members of the Government arises in the middle of a Dáil Session, with work in progress in every Department and many Bills and Estimates still to be dealt with before the Summer Recess, I have decided that the only practical course is to make the minimum of changes in the Government at this stage.  It will be appreciated that, otherwise, much important business would be unavoidably delayed.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the allocation of Departments to the care of Ministers is a function of the Taoiseach, that the Dáil approves of the appointment of Deputies to be Ministers but it is in the power of the Taoiseach to decide the Departments of which they will be in charge and to make changes in that regard on his initiative at any time.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements which I am proposing must be regarded to <Col N="91" /> some extent as provisional.  While I have decided that only the minimum of changes should be made at this stage, nevertheless, one member of the former Government, Deputy Seán Ormonde, has informed me that his doctors have advised him that it is essential to his recovery to full health that he should give up his Ministerial duties.  I have, of course, to accept his request, therefore, not to be considered for reappointment.  I may say that I do so with very great regret indeed.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ask Deputy John Lynch to take charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Dr. Hillery to take charge of the Department of Education and Deputy Michael Hilliard to take charge of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I have long been of the opinion that the proper performance of Government business would be facilitated by dividing up the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There are so many matters to be dealt with in that Department that the time of the Minister, as I know from experience, is necessarily very fully occupied with matters of administration, to an extent that top-planning, which is the main function of a Minister, is made a great deal more difficult.  I therefore propose to introduce legislation to provide for the setting up of a new Department of State which will take charge of transport, fuel, power and matters relating thereto.  I hope that proposal will be acceptable to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>However difficult it might be for a Minister to come into that Department after a general election, going through the process of deciding upon the legislation that he would sponsor and the measures he would put in train, I think it would be virtually impossible for a Minister going in at the present time in the middle of a Dáil term, to take over the work of that Department.  Therefore, I propose to introduce this Bill for the setting up of this new Department forthwith.  I hope the House will agree to secure its enactment before the end of this session.  When that Bill is enacted, <Col N="92" /> some further changes in the Government will be involved.</P>
    <P>I propose to ask Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Health, to be Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate that it is the function of the Taoiseach to allocate the various Departments amongst the Ministers he nominates.  I am glad he has at least given some indication of the provisional allocation of the various Departments but certainly they do not inspire any hope or give any reasonable prospect of the dissipation of the extraordinary cloud of dullness that has hung over the Fianna Fáil Government for many years past.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has announced that Deputy Ormonde is no longer able to assume responsibility for the Department that he occupied for some short time.  We all regret the cause for his inability to continue in that position. We hope his health will improve and that he will continue to give service as an ordinary Deputy.</P>

      <P>As regards the suggestion by the Taoiseach that the Department of Industry and Commerce should be divided, we must reserve our decision on that matter until we see the Bill.  I think even the Taoiseach would not be so unreasonable as to ask us to give that benediction.  I recall the howls of rage that came from this side of the House when we set up the Department of the Gaeltacht.  The suggestion was made with tremendously eloquent fire and vituperation, that we were imposing more civil servants, more bureaucrats, more expense upon the country.  There seems to be something in the point, though.  My colleague, Deputy Norton, used to describe the Department of Industry and Commerce not as a Department but as an empire.  It is a vast Department but why it was ever so directed as to become such a top-heavy structure we need not at the moment examine.  It has far too many subdivisions and it is a herculean task for anybody to handle that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I understood the <Col N="93" /> Government were committed to decreasing public expenditure.  We know the laws that govern increases in public servants.  Set up a new Department and you set up a train of events that no Government, even this present dull Government or any inspired Government thereafter, can ever hope to catch up upon because they will increase and multiply upon the Irish earth.  We will have officials of every class and description for transport and all the other matters to which the Taoiseach has referred which are to be set up in this connection.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether at this stage the Taoiseach intends to stretch out his clutching hands towards the Board of Works and to bring about some much-needed economies in that general direction or whether that will still remain as a Department of its own. However, we must reserve our judgment until we see the proposals and have them considered.  In the meantime, I am sounding the note of warning that what we want is not an increase in civil servants but fewer public servants, at no sacrifice to existing civil servants.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Government that has been nominated by the Taoiseach, there is little inspiration to be gained from them.  The Minister for Health has been nominated as Tánaiste.  Though I have a certain regard for the Minister for Health personally, I think, having regard to his somewhat astonishing statements from time to time, he is unfitted for that position.</P>

      <P>I do not regard anybody who, in the course of the last elections, had the effrontery, in order to try to get votes either for the present President-elect or for the abolition of P.R., to repeat the slander that my colleagues and I in the first inter-Party Government put this country in pawn, is a proper man to be Tánaiste in this or in any Government.  That was one of the foulest slanders and one of the most irresponsible statements that even the Minister for Health made.  He said we had put this country into pawn because we had taken the <Col N="94" /> American money and had left nothing behind us.  I do not know whether he was present at the opening of the Agricultural Institute a few weeks ago. Was that not a tremendous asset that was left to this country as a result of our putting this country into pawn?</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into details on any matters of that kind now.  I think it is proper that I, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and also on behalf of those colleagues with whom I had the privilege and pleasure of co-operating in both inter-Party Governments, should repudiate that statement that should not have been made and, having been made, that should not have been used in the course of the last campaign. It besmirches the Minister who is now the Tánaiste and it besmirches his colleagues.  It gives a very bad headline to any future politician in criticism of political opponents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no more to say about the personnel of this Government.  When the members of the Government who have resigned were appointed in March, 1957, I made no criticism or comment upon them then.  I felt it was the responsibility of the Taoiseach to appoint his collegues and that, if they failed, it was his responsibility and his loss.  At that time, there was a temptation to pass <Col N="95" /> some remarks upon the character of particular individuals who formed that Government but we knew and felt we were under a deep obligation, in the circumstances then confronting the country, to take a responsible attitude and to assure the Government, then starting on their very difficult career, that we would be a vigilant Opposition, a watchful Opposition, and a constructive Opposition. We hope we have fulfilled that role in the two and a quarter years that have since elapsed.</P>
    <P>The members of this Government start their career under the shadow of the rebuff that their Party sustained from the people on the referendum. They start their career with that very grave disability.  They have received from the people a vote of censure for turning aside from the business of the country, from the solution of the economic problems that confronted this country and still confront it, and indulging in a piece of political pyrotechnics. When the former Taoiseach nominated his Ministers and gave the names to the Dáil, we searched for any indication from the particular individuals then appointed as to what the policy of the then Government was or would be.  We could not get it.  At the General Election of 1957 we sought by every means to ascertain from them and to wring from them if possible what their policy was.  Of course we knew they had no policy.  The formation of the Government at that time revealed they had no policy.  I described it as the most closely guarded political secret of modern times.  It was so closely guarded that it did not exist and the fact that it did not exist has been demonstrated in the last 12 months in a most signal manner.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach, when he was a Minister and particularly when he was in Opposition, issued many plans and policies, over the years, starting from the famous Fianna Fáil plan of 1932 coming down to the most recent one for the expenditure of £100,000,000 without any increase in taxation.  All these plans and all these policies were like dud cheques.  They &ldquo;bounced.&rdquo; We found they had no policy but in order that they should do something <Col N="96" /> they had to get their cheque&mdash;a cheque which would not be accepted by the people, a cheque which was supposed to be their policy&mdash;marked good by the most distinguished civil servant we have in the service of this State.</P>
    <P>Some time after they came into office this present Government carried on, as we were glad to see them carrying on, the policy we had left them there for agriculture and increased exports.  Then they sought the assistance of the most distinguished civil servant in this State and he, in the course of his duty, produced something which could have amounted at least to the ground work of a national policy.  The White Papers that have been introduced in the last few months were the groundwork and could be not merely the groundwork but the basis upon which, if there was any sort of inspiring Government to do it, a very strong economic structure could be built which had for its principles those principles which over the years Cumann na nGaedhael and Fine Gael had as the basis of their policy&mdash; agriculture and increased exports.</P>
    <P>The very fact that they have no policy except the policy set out in the White Paper demonstrates that they never had a policy until they got that policy as the groundwork from the distinguished economist whose name is on the outside of that document.  That could have been the groundwork for an all-out effort.  We offered our co-operation here in all good faith in March, 1957.  During the 2¼ years that have elapsed since that time that co-operation has been spurned.  Because of their strong position, their strong voting power, they have regarded this Assembly not as a deliberative Assembly but merely as a machine for registering the decisions of the Government.</P>
    <P>I would hope the Taoiseach is sufficiently realistic&mdash;at least that can be said for him&mdash;to know that however he may be able to push through any Bill by virtue of the voting power he has in this House, there is only one sure way in which we can solve the problems that afflict this country&mdash;by getting the co-operation of all sections of the people, united and working together. <Col N="97" /> That ought to have been very apparent to the last Government.  I hope it will become apparent to the Taoiseach and his colleagues.  So far as they seek our co-operation they will get it.  They will get our constructive help and our constructive criticism as a constructive Opposition.  They had here the groundwork and White Papers were produced as the Government plan and Government economic policy.  Some of the Ministers went around the country extolling them. The people were looking for inspiration, looking for some betterment of their position and for guidance and the Government had these documents as the groundwork upon which a policy could be framed and on which our problems of unemployment and emigration could be solved and an expansion in industry and agriculture secured.</P>
    <P>We find the Taoiseach, if we are to believe his words, asserting that self-sufficiency, after 25 or 30 years in operation, is of no use to the country. We find him, if we are to take his words at their face value, stating he now believes in the agricultural industry as the basis of the prosperity of this country, although for many years the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce were like two Kerry Blues fighting for each other's throats, and Industry and Commerce always won. We are glad to know that at last he professes to see more value in the agricultural industry and perhaps there is some hope, with the co-operation of all sections of the community, for the prosperity of the country.  But we cannot perhaps withstand the temptation of thinking that the present Taoiseach is something like a prisoner at a Russian trial confessing in public his faults.  He confesses that his policy of self-sufficiency, his policy of high tariffs and quotas has not resulted in any real prosperity in the country or any hope for economic prosperity and that he was all wrong when he did not give the emphasis to agriculture which he could have given.</P>
    <P>Instead of taking that groundwork policy, or whatever you like to call it, as something on which to work and <Col N="98" /> something from which hope could be gained by the people, this Government, each and every one of them from the Taoiseach down to the most recent appointment, all engaged in this futile and fruitless effort to do something which the people did not want, about which they were not consulted and upon which they have now given a very distinct verdict&mdash;this question of the referendum.  We have wasted time; we have wasted far more money than can ever be definitely ascertained or pinpointed.  There has been wasted effort and many missed opportunities. This Government is starting now with that cloud around them and we only hope in the national interest they will forget their past sins and with a firm purpose of amendment bend themselves to the work which the people wish them to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party regret that Deputy Seán Ormonde is not to remain a member of the Government, because of most, if not all, Ministers in the Government we could always expect courtesy and guidance and no arrogance from Deputy Seán Ormonde as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  We only hope, whilst not making this a political hope for the Fianna Fáil Party, that some time in the future, when his health permits, he may again occupy the office which he held so well for such a short period.</P>
      <P>I have often advocated to Deputy Lemass when he was Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Department of Industry and Commerce ought to be sub-divided.  It seems to me that his then Chief did not agree either with me or with Deputy Lemass.  However, I think I can speak for my Party&mdash;I must confess I have not as yet consulted them &mdash;in welcoming this change of front by the Taoiseach in his proposal that Industry and Commerce be sub-divided into at least two sections.  It is an admirable proposal that transport, aviation, fuel and shipping should have, if not a separate Ministry, certainly a separate Parliamentary Secretaryship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said earlier on this evening that it is too soon to judge Deputy Lemass as <Col N="99" /> Taoiseach, but, unfortunately, we must judge the other Ministers who have been re-appointed in the Government. If we are to judge them on their performance over the past two and a half or two and a quarter years, we cannot give them any great commendation but we do hope that Deputy Lemass may be able to inspire them to greater activity and, might I say, to less arrogance.</P>
    <P>I tried to say this on the debate for the nomination of the Taoiseach but it seems I was out of order.  At least, I can say now that the previous Taoiseach, as we are all aware or were led to believe, had a tremendous influence on the whole Fianna Fáil Party and on the individuals in it&mdash;an influence which I always believed was bad for the Fianna Fáil Party and bad for the country.  However, I trust that Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach will use influence, not to the same strong extent but to some extent with, for example, the Minister for External Affairs and try to induce him to give up his middle of the road policy and tactics in the United Nations' Organisation and to decide for one side or another and not to be running a little bit of the way with both sides.  His intentions may be all right but the mass of the Irish people do not believe that he represents the views of the Irish people in his pronouncements in the United Nations' Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has certainly been a colourful figure but still a controversial figure.  I think it was an admirable opportunity for the Government to get out of the embarrassment that there is at present between the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Association.  The Minister has a strong point of view in which he possibly believes.  I do not know whether he was ever a member of a trade union and negotiated as a trade unionist, but I know that to resolve a difficulty two sides must talk, but the Minister for Health believes that there should be a let down on one side and that he should continue to refuse to try to resolve a situation that has a grave detrimental effect on the people generally.  Therefore, I think <Col N="100" /> the Taoiseach would do well to advise Deputy MacEntee, now the Tánaiste, to change his tactics and also change his tactics as far as the general administration of the health services are concerned.</P>
    <P>I say this not in criticism but in an effort to be helpful.  I know that the Deputies on this side of the House know&mdash;I am certain the Deputies on the other side of the House know also &mdash;that as far as the administration of the health services is concerned, there is grave dissatisfaction which only a Minister for Health can resolve.  For that reason, I would advise the Taoiseach to have a talk with his Tánaiste and Minister for Health to try to see how better the health services and the Health Act, 1953, can be administered for the benefit of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The defeat of the Government proposal to adopt the straight vote was significant for many things other than the fact that the people preferred proportional representation.  I think they showed their resentment of certain things and of certain Ministers who should change their tactics and policy. I believe that the Government, and, in particular, the Minister for Defence, were told off in no uncertain manner by a section of the community which on this occasion were important in view of the 38,000 of a majority, should I say, against the Government who did not and do not agree with internment without trial.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Taoiseach should also change his tactics in that respect.  He should be determined and tell his Minister for Defence, the Government, or whoever is responsible, that the people of this country generally do not agree with internment without trial.  If an offence has been committed or if there is a suggestion of an offence, those alleged to be involved should be charged and should have a trial.  That is something upon which the Labour Party have felt strongly over the past two or three years and upon which they feel strongly at the present time.</P>
    <P>I remember&mdash;this is the third time I have said it in this House&mdash;when the former Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera. <Col N="101" /> in speaking on the Estimate for his Department, whilst he looked at Deputy Blaney, said the Minister for Local Government was now actively engaged in his Department in stimulating the building industry to create employment. I think that is as near his words as I can remember at the present time.  If anybody wants it, I can get the quotation.  I think it is right to say this.  Since this Government took office and since Deputy Blaney became Minister for Local Government, there has been virtually stagnation in the Department of Local Government, as far as house building and employment are concerned.</P>
    <P>I remember, when Deputy O'Donnell was Minister for Local Government, there was severe criticism and abuse levelled by Dublin Deputies and Cork City Deputies about the slow-down in the house-building industry.  Fianna Fáil gave the impression that time and gave the impression in the campaign during the election of 1957 that if they got back to power, the house-building industry in Dublin, Cork and all over the country would be revived and that there would be many more in employment in the house-building industry.</P>
    <P>Such is not the case.  There are thousands fewer employed.  Members of the present Government may have a reason for it.  It has been said that the housing needs have been filled and that, consequently, we do not need more houses, but they made a promise to the people that they would build more houses and give more employment.  What did they do? They cut out what we regard as a very valuable source of employment, the Local Authorities (Works) Act. That Act was described by Ministers of the Government as being a waste of money.  I do not think it was. It can be pointed out in this little area or that that money was wasted. If it is wasted there, it is also wasted in industry.  It has been wasted in grants for the repair of houses and over the years it has been wasted in grants to farmers.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that there can be waste in regard to money given by the Government, but, by and large it is <Col N="102" /> admitted, even by Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party, that that Act gave valuable employment and it tied up the reclamation of the land with the reclamation scheme introduced by Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was part and parcel of the scheme of land reclamation. It was very necessary because it gave employment.  The cliché in recent years has been: No employment unless it is productive.  I think there is so much cod about that.  I think it is important to keep Irish people at home.  For that reason, I do not think that any money raised, whether it is £2 million, £5 million, or £10 million, to keep thousands of Irish people at home, is wasted, because the road worker who gets £5 or £6 into his hands or the city dweller who gets £7, £8 or £9 into his hands will keep that money in circulation.  In 90 per cent. of his purchases, he is purchasing Irish goods.  The circle revolves. He is giving employment to Irish workers in Irish boot factories, foundries, breweries and different Irish industries.</P>
      <P>That is not my justification for work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes.  I think it was good work; I think it was productive work.  I have seen places where rivers were drained and cleaned which had subjected adjacent land to flooding.  On that land wheat is now growing.  Therefore, the Taoiseach should consult with the Minister for Local Government with a view to advancing a certain amount of money to do that type of work and to keep rural workers not alone in Ireland but in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I shall be brief, so far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned, and ask the Taoiseach to get him to implement the promise he made to the farmers in February and March, 1957.  I am one who is concerned about the revival of the Irish language but I always believed that the revival was approached in the wrong way.  The Taoiseach should consult also with the Minister for the Gaeltacht and ask him to do less about political hand-outs in the name of the Irish language and to think more about a voluntary revival. I believe that if people have to get grants or loans, the £5 for speaking Irish, and all this sort of State aid, the language will never be revived.  The only way the language was ever revived in any country was when the people had a love for it, but if it is to be merely on a mercenary basis, I do not believe we shall ever have it revived.</P>
      <P>There is a certain antagonism in parts of the country, other than what are regarded as Gaeltacht areas, by reason of the fact that money is being spent on the Gaeltacht and on what are regarded as undeveloped areas. The people of the country regard themselves as being equal to those living in the Gaeltacht areas and any encouragement for the revival of the language should be given over all of the 26 Counties or not at all.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to wish every Minister well.  I know how arduous and strenuous a task they can have and will have in the future.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned, I can only say that we do not and will not oppose merely for opposition's sake.  We are not opposed to Fianna Fáil because they are Fianna Fáil.  We shall oppose measures which we believe are not in accordance with Labour Party policy.  Any measures or proposals introduced by any member of the Fianna Fáil Government will have the approval of the Labour Party, if we believe they are good proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insofar as the two new Ministers are concerned, I should like to congratulate them on their elevation and wish them well in the task they have before them.  I would say that not alone have all the Ministers received a rebuff but they have received a warning from the <Col N="104" /> Irish people.  They cannot now continue in the lackadaisical way of the past two and a quarter years.  This proposal to change the voting system was a &ldquo;try-on&rdquo; and I think Fianna Fáil went a little too far and the people said: &ldquo;We are not going to be led by the nose either by Eamon de Valera or the Fianna Fáil Party.&rdquo;  A Party can be so strong and go so far, but on this occasion they went a little too far.</P>

      <P>The record of the Government over the past two and a quarter years has been a bad one.  It is a record of nothing done and of no intention of doing anything.  It is a record of unemployment, of a rising cost of living and a record of emigration. The Taoiseach&mdash;and I wish him well in his post&mdash;has a formidable task in front of him and if it is not a waste of time I would ask him to change completely the style which the Party have had not alone for the past two and a quarter years but which they have adopted since they were first elected to power.  It is a strange thing that emigration figures soar, unemployment figures soar, and the cost of living soars every time the Fianna Fáil Party gets into power.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is man enough not to run the country for the sake of the Party but to make the Fianna Fáil Party work for the benefit of the country, which is as it should be. That was the attitude adopted by the first and second inter-Party Governments and it is a headline which the Government would do well to follow. Before proceeding I should like to say that I regret exceedingly that Deputy Ormonde's health has necessitated his withdrawal from the Government. He was courteous and the most approachable Minister and I hope in the very near future his health will be restored again in full.</P>

      <P>In appointing the Minister for Agriculture, the Taoiseach has perpetuated what I regard as an insult to the farming community.  The Taoiseach has a few practical farmers in his Party, one of whom he could have appointed as Minister for Agriculture instead of Deputy Smith. The present Minister has a pretty sorry record as far as the farmers are concerned and if the Taoiseach moved among the farming community, he would know it.  The bottom has completely fallen out of the cattle trade; eggs have almost disappeared; and so has bacon which was once know for its quantity and quality.  All these things are tied up with the state of disequilibrium that the balance of payments has got into.</P>
      <P>Since they got into office two and a half years ago, Fianna Fáil have laid a heavy hand on the farming community. The Taoiseach, when Tánaiste, was constantly asking for harder work and more production.  What is there to be gained from that?  What benefits are to be gained from harder work except greater poverty on the small farms?  As far as I can see, and as far as the farmers can see, the flight from the land and empty houses all over the country are proof that the Fianna Fáil policy has not been a very successful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> I want to point out that Fianna Fáil have the same country, the same people, the same land and the same climate as the inter-Party Government had and how is it that such a pall of gloom and deadness has descended each time Fianna Fáil got into power? How is it that the prosperity the inter-Party Government brought to the country cannot be carried on by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach this question: where is the £220,000,000 he told the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis about some time last August?  Where is that?  It is badly needed in many directions.  It is badly needed for many purposes, if only he produced it.  I hope that he will make some effort at fulfilling his promises, made during the last election, that he would provide 100,000 new jobs.  That was the time he told wives to put in Fianna Fáil to make sure their husbands and sons would get work.  All these things are wanted; all of them are in front of him now.</P>
    <P>I think the verdict of last Wednesday, the verdict in the referendum particularly, was a jolt to the Taoiseach and to the Government who, I presume, will be appointed to-night. They would do well to take notice of that verdict. Would it be any harm to ask what was the extra power that referendum would give to Fianna Fáil, had it been in their favour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They have had a good policy down through the years, that is to run the country for the Fianna Fail Party.  All that has been very successful for them but it is not the decent way or the Christian way to run a country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Ministry of Local Government, I want to ask would the Local Authorities (Works) Act be restored, even at this late hour?  I think it is something that should be done. Everywhere I go throughout the country, there is absolutely no employment. There is absolutely no work in many parts of the country.  Even forestry, which was the only hope in some of the poorer districts, was cut down. Unemployment is a terrific problem and if we are to have any hope of keeping our youth at home, we have to employ them.  We cannot ask them to be patriots, to stay at home and starve under a Fianna Fáil Government. At the present time, there are 61,000 persons unemployed, and I think the first thing the Taoiseach and the new Government should bend their attention to is to spend more money on public employment, particularly in rural districts.  I am asking for that and it is not too much to ask.</P>
      <P>All of the impositions placed on agriculture during the past two years should be removed.  They reduced the subsidy on ground limestone and I think the Taoiseach and the Government would be very well advised to go back on the various things which they have seen fit to carry out and restore them to the position in which they were in March, 1957.</P>
      <P>We have a Ministry of the Gaeltacht and it was widely felt that a vast amount of useful work could be done by it, but it seems it is tied up for want of money and want of policy. The Taoiseach should do something about that.  There is no use in having a Ministry of the Gaeltacht if we cannot do anything for it, and we cannot do anything without some expenditure. The only way to save the Gaeltacht is to give employment and thereby keep the youth in the Gaeltacht at home. Unless that is done, it will be a completely depopulated area.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands has a big job of work to do in the Land Commission.  It is a hard and difficult task but, nevertheless, it is not beyond his power, the power of the officials in the Land Commission, to do it.  There is a remnant of congestion that should be cleared up and cleared up rapidly, and I want to point out that while there are certain excepted matters&mdash;there are certain things the Minister is precluded from interfering in statutorily&mdash;he can give an indication both to the Commissioners and to the inspectors that he has an interest in certain things, if he takes an ordinary, active interest in the day to day work of the Land Commission. The last remnant of congestion could be cleared up if a bold effort were made in the next three, four, or five years.  From experience, I know what I am talking about and it could certainly be wiped out in four or five years, if a bold effort were made.  I left him the material to do it, just as my colleagues in the inter-Party Government left the material to their successors.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I think the Taoiseach should change the Ministry of Agriculture to some of the other Ministers who are being appointed.  Give us a practical farmer.  Do not give us a man who said he would fill the fields with inspectors, drive tractors and machinery over the walls, and smash down the farmers' gates at a time when it was a case of flogging a willing horse.  That was the encouragement which that Minister for Agriculture gave us at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the way Agriculture has gone since it changed hands from Deputy Dillon is proof to the Taoiseach that something should be done about it. It is our principal industry yet and it will be our principal industry for 50 or 60 years to come.  It is getting no help whatever from the Government. Every one of the useful schemes that Deputy Dillon started from 1948 to 1951, and from 1954 to 1957, just because they were the production of an inter-Party Government, just because they were Deputy Dillon's production, has got the axe.  They got <Col N="109" /> the axe for no other reason than that they were formulated by Deputy Dillon.  What was good for the farmers in his time is equally good for the farmers in Fianna Fáil's time, and the Government would be well advised to examine the policy of the inter-Party Government in respect of agriculture and restore that policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to congratulate Deputy Lemass on his appointment as Taoiseach.  For many years before I came into this House, I never heard a disparaging word spoken regarding his administration, during the critical years, as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Charges have been made that he has not, up to a very recent period, given much attention to agriculture. In his wisdom, he has now divided the Department for Industry and Commerce.  I repeat the appeal I made on three occasions in this House to his predecessor that he should consider the wisdom of dividing the Department of Local Government and appointing a Minister for Labour. The Minister need not be reminded that his own constituency, the Liberties in Dublin, which depend so much on the building industry, had in the first Dáil as Minister for Labour, the first woman elected to Parliament in these islands, the late Countess Markievicz.  They say that the old people knew what they were doing, and I trust that the Taoiseach will give serious consideration to the appeal I now make for the fourth time.</P>
      <P>The Department of Local Government, in administering what was introduced as Section 12 in order to alleviate the unemployment situation, has been an absolute failure.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  It has not in any way contributed to the purpose for which it was proposed.</P>
      <P>I offer the new Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the other Ministers, every good wish.  I should also like to take advantage of the opportunity to mention, since it was mentioned, I think by Deputy Corish, that the majority of 38,000 votes which turned down the Government's proposal came mainly from Dublin.</P>

      <P>And Dublin does not depend so much on agriculture. Dublin is mainly dependent on the building industry and it is lack of work in that industry that is the main cause of emigration.  Risking the charge of repeating myself I say the Taoiseach should consider this as an emergency situation.  It is the existing situation and it has not improved since his Government came into office. It requires emergency powers or it requires to be dealt with as was the situation during World War II when, let it be said to the credit of the Opposition, they undoubtedly came to the platform and said: &ldquo;We will co-operate in every way because the nation is in danger.&rdquo;  There is no doubt that the nation is in danger now, unless some emergency action is taken by the Taoiseach.  I have every trust that he will do so and I wish him well in his new post.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot find it in my heart to congratulate the Taoiseach who has been the Tánaiste of a Government for the past two years that has facilitated the situation which Deputy Carroll compares with the crisis of the World War.  If that has been the measure of his achievement as Tánaiste, God help us all when he has become Taoiseach with the Tánaiste he now has.</P>
      <P>This Government is really a most farcical spectacle and it reminds me of the Spanish Armada after the storm when it was at the loss of its chief admiral and had dashed on the rocks. It is floating off in a rather discouraged and shipwrecked condition but it has acquired a new rudder of a most facinating character.  One can picture the present Taoiseach wrapping his head in a cold towel to choose from the whole Fianna Fáil Party two Deputies singularly suited to be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Education.  And, lo and behold, a miracle takes place.  There is a by-election in Clare and Dr. Hillery is to be Minister for Education, a man who has spent his whole life, of course in the study of the philosophy of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is to be a by-election in <Col N="111" /> Meath and, miracle of miracles, Deputy Hilliard is a Daniel come to judgment and he shall be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs! Now, I want a word of explanation.  There is to be a by-election in Dublin South West and the <i>Irish Times</i> recently said that one of the Taoiseach's most brilliant young men is Deputy Briscoe.  Come now! Can we not do something for him? Deputy Carroll says his heart expands at the thought of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce being divided &mdash;could it be that this is for the Taoiseach's young men?

I started looking round for my cradle when I heard that.</P>

      <P>It does seem fantastic for any Government of our people who are a people of quick wit and to whom a nod is as good as a wink, to start out on their career by trying to purchase three by-elections by distributing largesse among their sitting members.  Has the Taoiseach any sense of decency at all, Is there any sense of decency in that?  Can the Taoiseach not imagine what the people will say to-morrow morning when they read that the Taoiseach, within one hour of his appointment, chose two new candidates for his Government, one from a by-election, a second from a by-election, and declares that he has another to come.  There is always a chance for the dashing young Deputy from Dublin but that is going to be kept secret until the by-election is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not even dignified, never mind decent.  It is not becoming and it is a nasty taste in the mouth of everybody at the beginning of a new <Col N="112" /> Government.  We must not deal in terms of supererogatives but I know that Deputy Ormonde will understand that all of us who are opposed to him vigorously and energetically deplore the ill-health which has caused him to resign with the same sincerity as we offered him our congratulations when he was appointed Minister.  I personally congratulate him on his decision to take the rest required to recover his full health rather than put that vital matter in jeopardy by excessive loyalty. Happy it is that on an occasion like this we can at least find one matter on which there is unanimity.  We are unanimous in our good wishes that Deputy Ormonde's health shall be completely restored but not in order to resume his Ministry, unless his eyes be opened for a Ministry in the next inter-Party Government which I hope to see established in this House in the not far distant future.  I only say that in referring to Deputy Ormonde because I look forward with such confidence to the early dissolution of the Government that confronts us.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in the short period which the Taoiseach has, great damage can be done.  I should like to ask him&mdash;and I think he has a duty to tell us now that he is Taoiseach and head of the Government&mdash;is the whole <i>fata morgana</i> for which he is primarily responsible of economic self-sufficiency for this country, dead and gone?  If it is, and if he now realises that his first 25 years of effort have been largely wasted and have cost this country dear, what does he propose to offer as an alternative?  It was his decision that at a meeting of the nations of O.E.E.C. we should align ourselves with Iceland, Turkey and Greece and proclaim to the world that after 25 years of his policy of economic development on the industrial side, we were an undeveloped country.</P>

      <P>I consider that to be a most vulnerable position for this country but I do not believe it is beyond being retrieved now and I should like to hear what the Taoiseach's Government intend to do because it is in the immediate future, within the next six months, that irrecoverable decisions will be taken that might isolate us completely and leaves us more dependent and more vulnerable without any suitable bargaining counter to purchase the economic security which we most urgently require and which, when we had it consequent on the 1948 Trade Agreement, we demonstrated our capacity to exploit by doubling the volume and trebling the value of our exports.  The great danger is that all that may be lost through incapacity in facing the situation that has arisen from the abandonment as impracticable in modern conditions of the policy of economic self-sufficiency and a reluctance on the part of this Government to face the inevitable consequences of the realisation of their past folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Taoiseach to a matter mentioned by Deputy Sweetman and myself and other Deputies in the course of the debate on the Estimate for his Department when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Does he advert to the situation that is developing in connection with the balance of payments? We are running a balance of payments deficiency for the first five months of this year at the rate of something between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 per annum.  There may be hope that towards the end of the year we may have a reasonable prospect of anticipating an improvement in that rate.  If that is the Taoiseach's hope, then let him expound it but we ought to face the fact that in the first five months of this year the balance of <Col N="114" /> payments deficiency has run something between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 per annum and we are bereft of many of the instruments that the Inter-Party Government had to use, and did use most effectively, with minimum dislocation, because we retained the levies which were in our power to impose and to withdraw for the purposes of the control of imports.  This Government no longer has that weapon, because they have converted them into revenue producing duties without which they have no prospect of a balanced Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this House is blinding its eyes to the fact&mdash;and let it be recalled, Sir, because it is a very grave potential danger&mdash;that if the balance of payments situation gets into a state of dislocation, the consequences of it will be mass unemployment for the industrial workers.  We fought that, we controlled it, and we protected them from that consequence.  The measures we took in 1956 resulted in a credit balance of payments in 1957.  That credit balance is now degenerating into a substantial deficit in the balance of payments and unless it is kept under control, the inevitable resulting consequences will be mass unemployment amongst industrial workers which we will have no means of meeting.  That is the situation with which we grappled in 1956, with demonstrable success. With much of the slack that we had in hand, and were in a position to pull in, now lost to the present Government, I warn that the situation is developing along the same lines, that there is great danger; and it is the Taoiseach's duty to tell us, on the threshold of his term of office, what he proposes to do about it or what his estimate of that situation truly is.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word to the Taoiseach, who up to this, as far as I know, has not interested himself much in foreign policy.  I am appalled at the foreign policy of this Government.  I understood the foreign policy of any Irish Government was to serve the vital interests of Ireland and if I understand the vital interests of any small country at the present time it is to multiply the number of its friends amongst the nations who constitute the comity of nations in the world.  I ask <Col N="115" /> the Taoiseach is it not true that since the present Minister for External Affairs has represented this country at the United Nations, he seems to spend his time kicking our friends in the teeth in the hope of conciliating people who could not ever be our friends and whose friendship we do not want. Now, mind you, I think that is pure ineptitude.</P>
    <P>I think the unfortunate Minister for External Affairs is living in a kind of childish illusion about what his functions are as Minister for External Affairs.  He is not sent out by this country to reform the world.  He is not sent out by this country to tell everybody else in the world what it is their Christian duty to do.  As Minister for External Affairs of this country, his primary function is to serve the vital interests of Ireland.  He will naturally put Ireland on the right side in all matters of fundamental principle; but in heaven's name, does the content of the agenda of the United Nations constitute a matter of fundamental principle to this country?  Is it necessary to kick the United States of America in the teeth, in order to go on record that we thought that the agenda of the United Nations ought to be different from what it is going to be?  That cannot be a matter of fundamental interest to us.  We may take the view that certain things should never appear on the agenda, or we may take the view that certain things will inevitably appear on the agenda some day; but is it necessary, in order to fix the day on which it is to figure on the agenda, that we should alienate our friends and shock and dismay those who want to be our friends and who want to give us a hand in any situation in which we may require assistance in international affairs?</P>
    <P>Nobody wants the world destroyed by an atomic bomb; but, in the name of heaven, is it necessary for Ireland to kick General De Gaulle all over the lot, in order to be the first to put down on the agenda of the United Nations that France is not to be admitted to what is called &ldquo;The Atomic Club&rdquo;?  Maybe they ought not to be&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but is it <Col N="116" /> necessary for Ireland to accept the role of giving another old traditional friend of this country a kick in the face?  Is there no more diplomatic way of going about a matter of this kind than putting down on the agenda what appears to be, before the world, a direct slap in the face to the Government of France?  Is that serving the fundamental interest of Ireland&mdash; which is to multiply its friends and at least to show some spirit of reciprocation for those countries who have been traditionally our friends?</P>

      <P>I believe I am going into Government policy on the United Nations.  I am sure the Minister for External affairs never said a word or did an act at the United Nations without the express approval of the Government. Am I not correct in that? I think I am correct in that.  He referred back to the Government at every stage and his actions were approved and sponsored by the Government. From time to time it may become Ireland's duty to take a different path from that of an old and trusted friend at the United Nations or in any other sphere of diplomatic <Col N="117" /> activity.  Surely there are two ways of going about it?  You can go to that old friend and say: &ldquo;We do not want to be the first to cast the stone, but if this thing comes to an issue we cannot be with you on it.  If we can, we shall abstain, but it may be that we shall be obliged to vote against you, but at least know that anything we can do to spare you embarrassment and distress we are concerned to do.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have never found on the few occasions I was privileged to represent this country that if I got instructions from that Government which I represented it gave rise to the slightest misunderstanding among the kind of friends we had.  We had not to go to any Soviet Russia or Communist Peking for permission to do it.  We found ourselves approaching the American Government, the British Government, the French Government and all our old friends who, on hearing the situation and understanding why circumstances constrained us to take a different view, bore us no hard feelings.  I can well remember that when the headquarters of F.A.O. was being determined in Washington, the Government of the United States were most eager that it should be located in Washington.  I was charged by the Government which I represented to explain to the Government of the United States that at that time, in the circumstances then obtaining, we felt we had a grave duty to give Italy the helping hand to overcome the crisis which was then confronting her by voting to have the headquarters put in Rome.</P>

That is a simple proposition, vital to the policy of the Government now in office.

I despair when I hear of the present Minister for Agriculture, but I shall deal with that in greater detail on his Estimate. It looks to me as if the Department of Agriculture is preparing to lay down and die altogether.  It has virtually ceased to function and one of its principle activities at present&mdash;the eradication of bovine tuberculosis&mdash;is grinding to a stop.</P>

      <P>I am not without hope that the Government policy on health is about to change.  I do not want to inflame the vanity of the Tánaiste or to deter him from proceeding on more conciliatory lines than those which <Col N="119" /> produced the existing crisis.  I am not so sure the Taoiseach was wise in imposing upon this vain man the spancel of the office of Tánaiste.  It is a despairing effort but, if he had to keep him, it was an effort worth making to try to reduce him to some kind of order in this House.  I hope the effort will be a success for, if it is not, chronic anarchy and pandemonium will prevail here if he has the ordering of business.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far the concert of Ministers will function as it becomes abundantly clear from the Ministers' own pronouncement that one does not know what the other is doing.  The Minister for Local Government, taking a leaf out of the book of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, discovered that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was enacted by the previous Government and wound it up.  As a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Davern, whom we see beaming at us from the Lobby, came in here and tore passion to shreds in the awful crime committed against the people of South Tipperary for whom he sheds salt tears because the Anner draining was suspended.  Who suspended it? Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government.  Yes, he did.  I know because I got the money from Deputy O'Donnell under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, to carry out that degree of drainage that has been carried out on the Anner and which Deputy Blaney stopped.</P>

      <P>I cannot imagine why. I did not then belong to Fianna Fáil in order to come in and get an old age pension before my time.  If that is the burden of the worst allegation the Deputy can make against me, I am scathless in this exchange.  What I want to urge on the Taoiseach is that out of the chaotic state of incomprehension in which Deputies find themselves today in trying to find out what the policy of this Government is, he ought to make a statement which will clarify the matter with special reference to our economic prospects, to our diplomatic activities, to the hope of securing some maintenance of the progress that, I think, was being made in the development of agriculture and what remedies he has in mind to provide alternative employment for the people in rural Ireland whom the activities of his colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government, are throwing into unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough to say, in the classic words of the Minister for Finance, that they are emigrating and that that will solve the problem.  I do not believe this Government were elected two and a half years ago to solve the unemployment problem by exporting the unemployed and to meet the aggravation in unemployment in rural Ireland, which two Ministers have created, by urging those people to emigrate as well.  On this occasion the Opposition has a right to hear from the Taoiseach how does this Government work in co-ordination when half their members are destroying employment and while the rest profess to be creating it.  While we can see on the evidence of our own eyes the creation of unemployment by the activities of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government, we can see no corresponding effort to create employment by the other members of the Government.  It is the duty of the Taoiseach to tell us <Col N="121" /> what plans he now has to meet that situation, seeing that the Minister for Lands has told us that his famous £100,000,000 plan was not a plan but a blueprint to be reviewed.  Has he completed that review?  Does any part of the blueprint still survive and, if so, what part?  When will we see it and when may we hope it will operate in Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that this debate is largely in respect of the suitability of the members of the Government.  I have a feeling that for too long we have been hearing the same names as members of the Government of this country, and although the Taoiseach says there will be some changes, there has been no change except in one Department, and that was due to the ill-health of Deputy Ormonde.  I hope the Taoiseach will encourage as many as possible of the older members to retire.  Every time there is an election, we hear just the same names.  I am sure that some of the backbenchers of his Party have gone to seed, and some good men I know have gone on the beer&mdash;to put it straight&mdash;they got so tired waiting for an opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should encourage as many as possible of the older members to retire.  I do not want to refer to anybody in particular but there is an old saying, which is quite true, that new brushes sweep clean.  I know it is difficult for the leader of a Party to encourage or force his old associates to retire, but it is in the interests of the country that they should.  This business of tying up the higher positions with just one set of people and, at the same time, endeavouring, as was the case recently when it was hoped to abolish P.R., to tie up the Party with the same set of people, is a denial of initiative on the part of the younger people. That is a bad principle and, as the Taoiseach himself is a comparatively young man, I hope he will look around and encourage as many as possible of the older members to retire when this change which he mentioned here tonight comes about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of that, I should like to refer to a little bit of history, and to remind the House that the Emperor <Col N="122" /> Franz Josef was so many years in power&mdash;50 years, I think&mdash;that his son, the heir, died of old age before he got his chance.  That is what I mean.  I think the backbenchers should be given a chance.  In connection with the Taoiseach's decision to divide the Department of Industry and Commerce, perhaps it is just as well, because I cannot imagine any other man doing the amount of work which the Taoiseach did in that Department.  I am also glad that the Taoiseach is going to take up one job because I do not think one man can do two jobs successfully. In paying attention to one, he neglects the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a failing of many other people in political Parties who hope to create success for their Party but do not give all their time to that success.  They give a large amount to their own success and that results in their going stale.  The Taoiseach, I am sure, will find his new office rather strange because, to me anyway, he appeared to be so wrapped up in the Department of Industry and Commerce that he seemed to have no opinion on other matters, especially matters of a general political nature. However, I am sure he is qualified and capable of comprehending what he may not have experience of, but I agree with Deputy Dillon in his reference to the Minister for External Affairs spending most of his time selling Deputy Aiken at the United Nations instead of selling Ireland.  The Taoiseach should put a little pressure on the Minister for External Affairs to think only of Ireland all the time, and of Partition, and to devote his time to ending Partition and to work hook and crook to solve it, and to leave other matters to people with influence in world affairs which I am certain little Ireland cannot influence.  It is rather &ldquo;cocky&rdquo; of the Minister to think he can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with unemployment, I am quite satisfied that the Taoiseach has done his very best.  If there has been no improvement, it is because there has been unemployment amongst <Col N="123" /> the agricultural community and that unemployment was due to mechanisation, automation and other modern improvements.  I believe that science will make it more difficult in future for men to be kept in employment because the work can be done by machinery and other means.  The Taoiseach will have quite a problem, and even if he is depending entirely on what he calls productive work, I do not think that many will be employed in future&mdash;certainly not many adults, fathers of families.  They are the type he should aim at employing and not children and girls who appear to be the main source from which the employment he visualises is created.  The work that is done by the fathers of families is largely of a constructive nature but he does not seem to believe that.  For instance, in respect of housing in Dublin, the Corporation alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach appears to think in terms of what he calls productive employment but he seems to have very little faith in the constructive work which gives major employment to the people I represent in Dublin anyway.  I would ask him to think in terms of constructive employment or at least, not to forget about it.</P>
      <P>I shall not criticise the rest of his Ministers.  I do not know the new Ministers.  I would ask the Taoiseach, at least, to advise the Minister for Defence not to spend so much money on Defence and I would also ask him to request the new Minister for Industry and Commerce not to have so many unessential goods imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although other Deputies seemed to go to town on every aspect, as the <Col N="124" /> Ceann Comhairle has said, that the matter for discussion is only the suitability of the nominees, I am confined to a few more words.  I come back to the point on which I began.  I would ask the Taoiseach to rejuvinate his Government and to give his backbenchers a chance.  I believe in the principle of giving people a chance. That is my main reason for saying that I opposed the attempt to abolish P.R. I believe in giving a chance to everybody. The Taoiseach should give a chance to his own Party.  For too long we have had this question of old comradeship and people dying with their boots on.  It is time to make a change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the Taoiseach's election and the presentation to the Dáil of the Members of his Government, one might well be tempted to commiserate with him because he has presented to Dáil Éireann, in the main, a team who have shown themselves to have little regard for the economic troubles of the Irish nation in the past 2¼ years when they were members of the former Government. However, we cannot entirely commiserate with the Taoiseach because, unlike the captain of a football team whose team is selected for him and who has to march out on the field and do the best he can with the material at his disposal, under our Constitution, the Taoiseach has the power to select those whom he will nominate as members of his Government to Dáil Éireann.  In view of the fact that for the last 2¼ years the former Government spent so much time in considering by what means they could perpetuate themselves and their Party in office, I am afraid that the Taoiseach has not been particularly successful or happy in his choice of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1957, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, and most of those whom he submits to the Dáil for approval as members of his new Cabinet, entered into office on the basis of a declared determination to deal with the endemic economic situation, to take steps to provide a more secure future and, in particular, more employment for our people.  At that <Col N="125" /> time, it must be admitted, the climate for an incoming Government was optimistic and nobody knew that better than the persons who formed that Government.  But, does the climate at the present time look as hopeful as in the beginning of 1957?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of the balance of payments. Possibly, there will be further discussion on that matter.  Is the prospect now more hopeful, from the point of view of creating conditions which will produce more employment for Irish workers in Ireland or which will prevent the fairly steady creep upwards of the cost of living, which has begun to show itself again?  Is the climate now any healthier than it was at the beginning of 1957? I think the siuation is more difficult and promises to become more difficult in the months that lie ahead.  At this time the Taoiseach asks the House to accept as part of the team that will look after the affairs of the nation for at least some time to come members of the former Government who were conspicious by that lack of success.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that it was necessary to make the minimum of changes in the Government at the present time because of the fact that there is so much business still to be done by the House, that there are Estimates and Bills of which various Ministers have been in charge which must be dealt with in the near future. He did give some indication that when the present programme of business was completed there might be some hope of a re-shuffle of his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Sherwin that all wisdom lies in youth.  Youth suffers from a lack of experience. Sometimes one of the most necessary qualifications for responsible positions is experience.  I do agree that if there are members of a Government who have the necessary qualifications, apart from age, but who have demonstrated their lack of concern for the people over previous years, their age should not prevent them from being relegated. In this regard I would recommend the Taoiseach to think initially of the person whom he has asked to occupy the post of Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Reference has been made to the fact that, due to illness.  Deputy Seán Ormonde was not able to accept the request to continue as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Regret has been expressed from all sides of the House that this courteous Deputy who was a most courteous Minister, has found it necessary to lead a less active political life for some time.  Therefore, I am sure the Taoiseach will not think I am reflecting in any way on Deputy Ormonde if I suggest that there are two Ministries that could well be administered by a Parliamentary Secretary instead of a Minister.  One of these is the Department for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is my conviction that the ordinary business of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could continue most successfully indeed under the supervision of a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The second post which I should like to mention in this connection is that unnecessarily exalted post of Minister for Defence.  We are a peaceful nation. We do not need all the trappings of militarism that go with a large army. In the event of a deterioration in the world situation to a point at which there might be another world holocaust, surely it is farcical to think that the position of the Irish nation would be made more secure because we had a person calling himself Minister for Defence, and, of necessity, a small army ?</P>
    <P>The Chair has ruled that discussion should not take place as regards any matters that would more properly be dealt with under the Estimates.  I accept that ruling, as we all should. However, I should like to say that, having reached the point in the development of our country at which a new Taoiseach has been elected who has introduced to this House the names of the persons to form his Government, I hope we can now, in dealing with political and economic matters in this House and in this country, proceed on the basis of genuine political or economic principles or philosophies.  While I would have no objection in joining in Deputy Dillon's hope that Deputy Ormonde will soon be restored to health and possibly be afforded an <Col N="127" /> opportunity of administering in an inter-Party Government might I make it quite clear that the type of inter-Party Government I think Deputy Ormonde might adorn as a Minister in some Department would be one made up by the reunification of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael?  As Deputy Corish has stated, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, any proposals which we feel are for the benefit of the people we represent or for the people of our nation generally will receive, as they have received in the past, our commendation and support.  We do not propose to act as members of this Dáil purely on a basis of opposing for the sake of opposing.  When any positive constructive measure which we feel is of benefit to the people comes before us it will be supported by the Labour Party.  I trust that 1959 which, in this month of June, has been noteworthy for the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party received a serious rebuff from the Irish people may also in the future be significant as the starting point from which political and economic matters can be dealt with on the basis of the benefit of the proposal to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Might I commend to the new Taoiseach in particular the general problem of unemployment in our country&mdash;unemployment in our cities, in our towns and among the rural community.  This is one of the most serious problems that faces him in his new Government.</P>

I should hate to be forced to discuss, shall we say, the personality of the Tánaiste or of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the latter particularly.</P>

      <P>We on these Benches will await with great interest the developments in the coming months. We will await in particular with great interest to see whether the fact that there has been a change of Taoiseach will also mean that there has been a change in the approach of those who are now Ministers of this Government and were Ministers of the previous Government to questions affecting the interests of our people.  I hope the fact that Deputy Lemass has been made Taoiseach will have some effect on some of his colleagues.  However, it is a hope that in a very short time we shall see either realised or blasted.  But from the experience we have had here in recent years and the experience of the people over many years previously, I am afraid that if progress is to be made under this Government and under Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, he will have to make up his mind very soon to cut some of the dead wood out of his Government and give us a Government that will do some work for our people.</P>

      <P>I was present during most of this debate and the previous one today and what surprised me was that not one of that Party great in number, supporting the new Government stood up to defend their new Leader against the attacks that were made on him or to say a word for their new Government or their policy.  They probably did not know anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> As far as the policy is concerned it seemed to be a matter of some merriment when it was mentioned from these benches.  It is a very serious matter that the Taoiseach's Party has been in office for nearly 2½ years and they have not carried out one part of the policy that put them into office.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach now does he intend to make a statement to this House and to the country as to what he proposes to do. I have been asking him for a good number of months now what he intends to do about the plan for £100,000,000 and 100,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the Government that came into office on what was an obvious confidence trick.  Looking at the members of the Government, I do not think anybody mentioned the Minister for Justice to-night but I shall mention him.  The present holder of that Ministry, I suppose, was given that post because it was a most difficult one.  I did not agree with the way he performed his duties but I admire him for the way he did the job.  He had courage and I should like to say to the new Taoiseach and to the old Ministers present that they should get the Dáil Debates and see the manner in which the Minister for Justice introduced his Estimate here, the manner in which he dealt with the debate, the courtesy and the competence with which he answered the questions he was asked by the members of the Opposition.  I complimented him that night on it; I compliment him again now and I hold him up as an example for the rest of the Government.</P>
    <P>As far as our policy in External Affairs is concerned it has brought us nothing but shame, shame with our friends in America, shame with our friends in France and in England&mdash;I repeat, &ldquo;in England&rdquo;, where most of our people are working whether they have separation allowances or I.R.A. pensions.  The Taoiseach should immediately make a statement about our policy on external affairs so that it should not be possible again that great Churchmen, of whom we are proud as being of Irish descent, would come to this country and snub the leaders of the Government.  We hope that will not <Col N="131" /> take place under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spent some time considering the policy of free trade, and before he goes any further in this policy I suggest that he should direct the Government, or whoever will be responsible for it, to go to England, the people with whom we do most of our business, and make a proper, longterm trade agreement with them before we tie ourselves up with other countries with which we have no favourable balance of trade, which never made any effort to buy anything from us, and which refused to sign trade agreements with us.  As far as our policy on agriculture is concerned, I think it is disgraceful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in that respect in saying that the present Minister for Agriculture is not suited to be a Minister at any time.  His record has proved it over the past two years and also his record in other Ministries.  He was at one time Minister for Agriculture in a previous Fianna Fáil Government and they had to take him out of it.  He is only put into it now as a makeshift.  He should be taken out of it immediately.  It is a very serious crisis that we are in at the present time and we cannot be sure whether the T.B. campaign can be brought to a successful conclusion because the Minister for Agriculture is having a row with the veterinary surgeons in the same manner as the Tánaiste is having a row with the doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as our policy on local government is concerned, this Government got into office and they claimed to be the builders' Government.  I do not think that the builders will claim them as their Government, having regard to the manner in which the policy of building has been carried out.  I would <Col N="132" /> say to the new Taoiseach who is a man of energy that he should look into this matter and see to it that his Minister for Local Government will again start building in places where houses are needed.  There are many places where houses are needed.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister for Defence is concerned, I think he should be stopped from making speeches with such clap-trap in them that he wants an all Irish-speaking Army.  This country needs decent Irishmen, whether they can speak Irish or English.  I do not see why a young man should be debarred from serving his country, if he is not able to speak Irish.  I do not want anybody to misunderstand me about this.  I have had members of this House say to me that I was against the revival of the Irish language. I am as much for the revival of the Irish language as anybody over there and they know how much they are for it themselves.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much some qualities which this new Taoiseach has.  I never heard him going round with this clap-trap.  I give him credit for that. He is a realist.  He was chided in the House that he never made speeches about Partition.  What good is making speeches about Partition?  That is the kind of dope which was handed out to the people by the previous Taoiseach, and which we should forget. If we are to bring in our people in the North of Ireland, the best thing to do to unite our people is to unite our people in the South first.  I think that, perhaps, there is a good chance in this new era of uniting our people in the South.  We will not unite them, as long as we have people who are looking for revenge and rancour. Some Deputy said &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;.  We will not unite our people so long as we have Taoisigh who will prevent the members of the Army from paying a tribute to our first Commander-in-Chief.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  In this matter of defence and in this matter of only allowing people who can speak the Irish language to wear this country's uniform, I think the Taoiseach should intervene.  I do not think it is a good thing that the young men of Ireland who may not be able to speak the Irish language should say to themselves: &ldquo;We will not join our own Army because we do not belong to the Brahmin class.&rdquo; We used to laugh and jeer at what they used to do in Britain where it was only a certain class who could get a commission.  Are we to have a Brahmin class here now that will be drawn from the Gaeltacht, people who can speak the language?</P>
      <P>In the matter of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I deeply regret that my colleague from Waterford, Deputy Ormonde, was not able to accept office again as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I can only compliment him on his short term and I can only say to him that he had the confidence of the Opposition that no other member of the Government had.  I never heard anybody in this House take him hardly to task on Supplementary Questions because he answered courteously and gave as much information as he could in his first answer.  That is an example which a good many of the members of the Government could take to heart. When they are asked Parliamentary Questions, they should give proper information to the best of their ability and give it with reasonable courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are here today without a policy.  They have only a White Paper which was produced by a distinguished civil servant.  That White Paper is based on Fine Gael policy. The people who remain silent and can only grin and interrupt cannot deny that.  I will say now to the Taoiseach <Col N="134" /> that he has a great opportunity of keeping faith with the people of this country.  He has no obstacle.  He has a large majority and a strong Government. He is at the head of that Government.  He said he could do it. I hope that he can employ the people of this country.</P>
    <P>He said he would maintain the subsidies. I hope he will look into that matter and see what can be done to bring down the cost of living for our people.  Finally, I hope he will direct his attention to three things&mdash;the employment of our people, the stemming of emigration and the reduction of the cost of living&mdash;and that for the next few months we will not have the time of this House wasted by legislation brought in to gerrymander the constituencies of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Reverting to matters that were mentioned earlier in today's discussions, I think it is well to remind the Dáil why today's proceedings are necessary at all, the election of a new Taoiseach and the renomination of the members of the Government.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Eamon de Valera, has been elected Uachtarán na hÉireann by popular vote.  I find it difficult to follow the reasoning which interprets that event as implying some undermining of public confidence in the Government.  Indeed, it would be far more reasonable to interpret it as an indication of public approval of the work the Government are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that work, I hope we shall have the benefit of constructive criticism from the Opposition Parties.  I welcome the assurance of Deputy Costello that we shall have constructive criticism from his colleagues, although I must confess that his assurance appeared to come wrapped in a rather strange package and did not altogether conform with some of the speeches from that side of the House.  Personally, I have a liking for the rough and tumble of the Party conflict and indeed I do not think it does harm to the national interest.  Generally it is through the disputations of political Parties that the people become aware of the political issues that are under consideration here and get the information which enables them to assess the merits of particular <Col N="135" /> proposals.  I should, however, like to see political Parties competing in ability to plan constructively for national progress rather than in personal disparagement.</P>
    <P>I am prepared on this occasion to announce my personal intention to avoid&mdash;even, I hope, in the heat of debate here&mdash;saying any word which could be regarded as being personally offensive by anyone.  I am not asking for reciprocity in that direction and indeed I recognise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if I am to fulfil that intention, there may be occasions when I shall have to leave the Dáil when some speeches are being delivered.  A number of Deputies, notwithstanding the efforts of the Chair to circumscribe them, made comments on specific matters of administration and policy.  I do not propose to deal with these matters now.  The Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department will be before the House next month and that will be an appropriate occasion on which to deal with these matters.  There is no need for Deputies to seek to impress on this Government the urgency and the importance of getting under way development projects which will give employment and improved conditions generally in the country.  The whole purpose of the Government has been and will be to make the people better off, to raise living standards and to reduce unemployment and emigration. That aim has predominated and will continue to operate in every Department of the Government.  It would be a reckless man who would guarantee success, but I hope we shall be able, by our efforts to deserve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was perhaps inevitable that amongst my many deficiencies it should be mentioned that I was born in Dublin and therefore can be alleged to have an urban mentality. Well, I had to be born somewhere.  If I had been born on a farm, no doubt the allegation would have been that I had an outlook that was inimical to the urban interests.  I have argued all my life that there is no necessary conflict <Col N="136" /> between agricultural and industrial policy.  The economic progress of this nation must be achieved over a broad front and as I conceive it, the function of the Taoiseach is to ensure that that will happen.</P>
    <P>It was said that recent events have introduced an element of uncertainty into our political life.  There is one uncertainty which I want to remove. There is not going to be a general election.  I do not believe that the people either expect or want one, and for a reason which I hope to explain. I think that it would be not merely unfair to the country but unfair to the Government.  The Government have, in the course of the past eight months or so, published a programme of economic expansion as an official White Paper.  That programme has won expressions of approval from organisations representing all important economic interests.  I hope indeed that the Government will have the active help of these organisations through consultation and advice in bringing that programme into full operation.  The arrangements, legislative and administrative, required to put it into effect are now in course of completion.  Some of the necessary legislation is at present before the Dáil and it is hoped to secure its enactment before the end of this session.</P>
    <P>The whole process of putting that programme into operation, and reaping the benefits for the people, will take time to complete.  The Government which prepared the programme have the intention and the power to complete it and intend to do so.  That programme gives, for the first time in the history of the State, the prospect of the united action of all sections of our people along clear lines to define objectives and I think it would be wrong to allow any Party considerations to destroy that prospect new that it exists.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it is relevant to remark that the motions for the issues of the writs to fill the present vacancies in the Dáil will be moved next week.  I ask Deputy Dillon to believe me&mdash;I do not know whether he will or not&mdash;that in selecting Deputy Hillery and Deputy Hilliard for appointment to the Government, I <Col N="137" /> was concerned only with their ability as Cabinet Ministers and not with the constituencies they came from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>With regard to the referendum which was recently held, I just want to say this, that I do not regard the issue that was then in debate as in any sense irrelevant to the country's problems.  If we had not regarded it as important in relation to the general situation here, we certainly would not have brought it before the public at all and it is entirely incorrect to suggest that while the matter was in progress the work of the Government was neglected in any way.  I find it hard to credit that Deputy J.A. Costello really believes that holding that referendum revived old bitterness and introduced new divisions amongst our people.  Let us be realistic about this.  It has been the experience, I am sure, of Deputies on every side of the House that the main problem during the past few weeks was to get the public sufficiently informed about the issues that were in debate to become interested in them.  We urged the people to make the change which was proposed and we gave them the opportunity of doing so, if they wanted to do it.  I think we were quite right to have given them the chance, and doubly right to have proposed that they should have altered the system of election to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go back over the argument again.  I accept that by a small majority the people have decided against doing it, and that their vote settles the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much surprised by the interpretation put upon the statement I made regarding the need for legislation to revise existing Dáil constituencies. The many Deputies here know that the reason that constitutional change was proposed in this year rather than in some other year was that in this year, under the Constitution, a revision of constituencies must <Col N="138" /> be made anyway in the light of population changes revealed in the latest census, and it was obviously wrong, if a change in the method of election was in contemplation, to proceed to give effect to that revision if the people wanted a change in the system of election.  The purpose of the statement I made was to make it clear that the Government were going to fulfil their constitutional duty in that regard.  I do not think that anybody who knows the facts could say, or anybody could believe, that in carrying out the revision of constituencies the aim of the Government would be to defeat the decision of the people in the referendum, and in any way to make alterations which would be unfair to any Party in this State.</P>
    <P>In the light of all the known facts as to population changes revealed in the last census, the requirements of the Constitution, and the practical necessity of adhering as closely as possible when defining Dáil constituencies to existing county boundaries and local government areas, it is to be assumed that only very minor adjustments will be involved over by far the greater part of the State.  The problem which arises is mainly a Dublin one where, as Deputies know, there has been a very large scale movement of population from the central city areas out to suburban estates.  In Dublin, some revision of constituency boundaries is inevitable.</P>
    <P>For example, there is a constituency in Dublin where the quota required to elect a Deputy is less than one half the quota in the neighbouring constituency. There is no justification for continuing a situation in which the vote of one citizen is worth two votes of another and clearly, apart altogether from the constitutional obligation on the Government to submit proposals to the Dáil in that regard in this year, that is a situation which should be rectified before another general election is due.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I think I should refer.  It has been suggested in some newspaper articles and, indeed, in some speeches here this evening that because of the great importance which the Government attach to economic progress at <Col N="139" /> the present time, we are now less interested than heretofore in other national aims such as the promotion of the Irish language.  That is completely incorrect. Personally, I believe that national progress of any kind depends largely upon an upsurge of patriotism&mdash;a revival of patriotism, if you will&mdash; directed towards constructive purposes. Patriotism, as I understand it, is a combination of love of country, pride in its history, traditions and culture, and a determination to add to its prestige and its achievements.  Anything which tends to strengthen patriotism is good from every point of view and love for the national langage is a most potent force in that regard.</P>
    <P>I think it is short-sighted in the extreme to suggest that the promotion and development of our national language could ever be a deterrent to the country's economic growth.  Indeed, I regard the prevalence of the opposite and mistaken view&mdash;that love of the language, our cultural inheritance and the historical traditions of our race are encumbrances to our national development or are unnecesary to our national welfare&mdash;as the real handicap.  I hope to see that mistaken viewpoint wither away.</P>

      <P>Specifically, I want to make it quite clear that in these matters, there will be no change of policy now or at any time so long as this Government are in office.  On Sunday last, I went to the grave of Wolf Tone and there laid a wreath.  In doing so, I remembered what Wolf Tone declared to be the means upon which he had decided to achieve national objectives in his day, to unite the whole people of Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissensions and to bring together Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter under the common name of Irishmen.  These means, backed by that long Republican tradition, will be ours also, both in regard to our internal affairs in this area and in regard to the wider questions of reuniting <Col N="140" /> in one nation all the Irish people, north and south.</P>
      <P>The problem of restoring national unity is, in essence, one of breaking down the barriers of suspicion, antagonism, prejudice and misunderstanding which now divide a minority in the north-east from their fellow countrymen.  Anything which tends to break or lower these barriers is good; anything which tends to raise or strengthen them is bad.  I think it is as simple as that, and certainly that outlook will continue to settle our policy and determine our actions.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the possibility of a change in policy.  Policy is a loose term which may mean different things to different men and, as I understand it, there will be no change in policy, but only a very foolish man would consider that decisions taken, or plans made in the past, would always remain valid and applicable in the future.  The main principles of our policy have been settled and the immediate programme of the Government is known.  We shall continue our efforts to implement it, in the future as in the past, with all the vigour that we can command and, indeed, we shall not hesitate to modify and extend that policy as changing circumstances appear to open up greater prospects for national development.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, desirable that I should make the position of the Government clear now in regard to these matters to which I have referred, but, as Deputies know, this nomination of a Government taking place today is entirely different from that which takes place after a general election. We shall, I hope, by Tuesday next be back into the ordinary day to day routine work of the Dáil and certainly opportunities for elaborating on Government policy, or answering queries that Deputies may wish to make regarding it, will be as numerous as heretofore.  I think it is therefore undesirable, particularly at this hour, that I should deal further with these matters at this stage.</P>
