    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In connection with this amendment, the House will recall that during his speech on the Second Reading the Taoiseach suggested that the placing in the constituencies of the two seats it was still possible to allocate might be considered.  As a result of that, discussions took place between the <Col N="1061" /> representatives of Fine Gael, the Taoiseach and myself and also between the representatives of the Labour Party, the Taoiseach and myself in regard to the allocation of the two seats that remain.  I think it is fair to say it was generally agreed that if there was to be a further allocation of seats to any part of the country, at least one of those two remaining seats should be allocated to Dublin city or county.  As a result of that general agreement, the proposals now contained in this amendment were gone into and the constituencies south of the Liffey revised as here indicated.</P>
    <P>The effect of this change in the overall picture, on figures at any rate, is satisfactory from the point of view that the general averages in Dublin are not now showing the same wide disparity between the lowest average ratio per member in one constituency and the highest in another.  Whereas there was an average of something over 21,000 as the lowest ratio per member in a constituency in Dublin as against the highest then obtaining in County Dublin of over 24,000, on this amendment before the House we shall now have better averages, namely, 22,000 to 23,000.  As a result of these changes the figures range from 22,366 to 23,128.  That gives a better and more uniform average ratio per member in constituencies south of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>Before the introduction of this amendment, the averages south of the river were in the main higher than they were north of the river.  It was for that reason we decided that, were we putting another seat into Dublin, that seat should go south of the river. South of the river it has gone.  It is proposed that an additional seat be added to Dublin South (East).  In order to arrive at the figures necessary for the fourth seat, an area was taken from Dublin South (West); the districts of Rathfarnham and Rathfarnham South, on the one hand, were added to South (East), and another area was taken in from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, around Dundrum, containing approximately 5,500 voters.  The result of this was that, while Dublin South (East) could stand on its figures, as we had them, this <Col N="1062" /> reduction brought about a situation in which Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown could not stand the subtraction from it.  We went then to County Dublin and brought the boundary back to where it was and thereby compensated Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown for the part given to Dublin South (East), and the resultant overall position is as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>We have brought the figures into more uniform proportions and overcome the telling objection to the division of Dundrum village.  The village is no longer divided.  All of Dundrum area is now together in Dublin South (East).  If the House approves this amendment, Dublin South (East) will in future have four seats.  It will have the additional seat agreed upon, in the main, by the representatives of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, in discussion with the Taoiseach and myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated the results of the discussions. There is nothing I wish to add to that except to ask him if he could give us the population figures for the revised constituencies.  As I understood, he says the ratio is now 22,366 per member and 23,128 respectively.  I am not sure if that applies to South (West) or South (East), or whether it includes South (East), Dublin County, Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  He mentioned that it was proposed to transfer 5,500 voters approximately from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and to compensate the latter by reverting to the old boundary.  Perhaps he would now indicate the population figures per member and also the actual estimated number of electors on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  In the schedule in the old register it is stated: &ldquo;The portion of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire which is comprised in the District Electoral Division of Blackrock No. 1&rdquo;.  I understand it is proposed to transfer the portion of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire which is on the Booterstown register.  In a previous electoral list Blackrock No. 1 register includes part of the district of Blackrock.  Perhaps the Minister, in consultation with his advisers, would <Col N="1063" /> consider that point between now and the Report Stage in order to ensure that there will be no confusion about the proposed area.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is the appropriate stage at which to mention this matter but, as a result of this Bill, some electoral areas will be altered Will the Minister ensure in that connection that returning officers will take steps to ensure, in turn, that people will vote at the most convenient centre?  Most of the fringe area is compiled on the basis of townlands. That was a satisfactory method when the area was predominantly rural.  As a result of extensive building over the last ten or 15 years, people often find now that they have to travel farther than should be necessary were more convenient polling stations located adjacent to the new housing areas.  The inconvenience is, I think, caused entirely by the method of compiling the register on a townland basis.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that might be considered between now and the Report Stage, with a view to bringing in some amendment; alternatively, the Minister could issue instructions to returning officers to ensure that no unnecessary inconvenience will be caused to voters as a result of these changes, more especially as these changes will alter, in some cases, the actual register itself.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to mention is that some minor boundary change may be necessary as a result of the Minister's amendment in the electoral divisions of Rathfarnham and Whitechurch.  I mention it now because of the possibility of an amendment to meet the situation on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It may possibly solve the difficulty if I give the figures for the proposed constituencies south of the river.  They are as follows: Dublin South (East) 22,958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>These are population figures of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio per member is: South (West) 23,128; South (Central) 22,383; Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown 23,024; Dublin County 22,366.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> The boundary changes involve the addition to South (East) of the Rathfarnham and Rathfarnham South Wards from South (West), as well as the townlands of Churchtown Upper, Dundrum, Drummartin, Mount Merrion South, Kilmacud (West) and Stillorgan (North).  Those are from the Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown constituency which gains the district electoral divisions of Rathfarnham and Whitechurch from the county constituency as proposed in the Bill.  This latter change means that the boundary of the Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown and Dublin county constituencies at this point reverts to what it was or now is.  It just merely goes back to the boundary as we have known it for the past 12 years.  The boundary between Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown reverts in this amendment to what it has been and to what has operated in the past 12 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what is the effect of the reduction in population in these three constituencies set out in the amendment? As a result of a division of the areas and the putting of four seats in Dublin South (East), what is the new population figure for that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of an Opposition Deputy, I feel it right to say, particularly to the Taoiseach, that I feel the Government have certainly gone a distance within the framework of the Bill, as drafted, to meet the points of view put forward here.  I do not want to be in any way churlish in making that acknowledgment because I believe it is due to the Taoiseach.  But from the point of view of a Dublin Deputy, I still feel that full justice has not been done to Dublin city and county as a district.  It seems to me that there were certain increases in Dublin which entitled them under the constitutional provisions to additional representation.  My feeling is that the Government are not doing full justice <Col N="1065" /> to them.  As one of the Deputies concerned, I appreciate the fact that our point of view has been met within the framework of the Bill, as drafted, and I appreciate the manner in which it has been met by both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might have some further information available now but, if necessary, I can get it by means of Parliamentary Question.  I should like to find out from him, if I can, first, the total number of voters and secondly the population involved in the transfer from Dublin South (West) to South (East), that is, the portion of the Rathmines West Ward, the Rathfarnham, and Rathfarnham South Wards which are now going from Dublin South (West) to Dublin South (East).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene to comment on Deputy O'Higgins's remarks?  When the Bill was under discussion on Second Reading, the view appeared to be general in the House that the two additional seats which, under the Constitution can be provided, should be incorporated somewhere in the Bill.  I expressed the opinion, having regard to the constitutional requirements, that it seemed to me that these two seats would have to be in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I do not think, however, that view was general, and indeed, in the course of discussions which we had with the representatives of the different Parties, I think the view was expressed by Fine Gael that while it was accepted that one of those seats would have to be in Dublin, the other should be elsewhere, and I think the Labour Party view, as I understood it, was that the two seats could be outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that we cannot avoid putting one additional seat in Dublin and indeed there was need for reconsideration of the Bill to readjust the proposals for the south side of the city in any case.  The effect of this proposal on the south side of Dublin would be to level out the constituencies there, in respect of the ratio of population to members, and make them comparable with the north city constituencies. <Col N="1066" /> In so far as there is one with a lower ratio than the other, it is the county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have only one more seat to allocate and the proposals put forward were alternatively to put it in Wexford or in Cork.  What I undertook to do was to have both amendments drafted and submitted to the House.  They are both on the Order Paper in the Minister's name.  There are three seats mentioned in the amendments but we can allocate only two.  There is the proposal, subject to any minor amendments which may be considered necessary, to put an additional seat in the south side of Dublin, and only one more seat and the question to be decided is whether that will be in Wexford or Cork.  The first amendment relates to Wexford and if it is carried, of course, the second amendment will not be moved.  If it is defeated, the second amendment relating to Cork will be moved.</P>
    <P>I can understand that Deputies may have difficulties in deciding which arrangement is preferable and we have had our discussions on it.  It seems to me to be the only practical course.  I accept that we have to put these two seats in the Bill.  One must be in Dublin, on the south side, and the remaining seat must be in Wexford or Cork.  That is what has to be decided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments before us would have the effect of increasing the membership of the House by two.  They are designed to provide additional seats in the constituencies of Dublin South (East) and Wexford or Cork.  To my mind, it is rather peculiar, in the first place, that they should seek to have two additional seats&mdash;I understand the Constitution does not provide for more&mdash; and that the two seats&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to explain&mdash;it was appreciated by the Deputies whom we met that the drafting of amendments would be a matter for the official draftsman and it was considered that it would be more convenient for the House to have these amendments drafted, even though we recognised that only two could be carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that when there are three amendments and only two seats, the three amendments should, if possible, be taken together.  If the first amendment relating to Dublin is passed, it means that there is only one seat left. If the second amendment, relating to Wexford, is passed, it means that Cork is out.  That is obvious to everyone. I have no personal interest in the seat but it is very unfair of the Government to put down an amendment relating to Cork which may not be taken at all.  I am asking the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if it is correct procedure to deal with the three amendments before taking a vote on any of them.  In that way, the case for the different constituencies can be made before taking a vote on any of them. I want to prevent the determination of the cases of Dublin and Wexford, thus possibly bringing about a situation in which there would be no seat for Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  Here is how I look at these things.  I suggest that if any amendment is to go, it should be the Dublin one.  It is time for the rural Deputies to get the seat for themselves <Col N="1068" /> as Dublin is already very well catered for as compared with the rural areas. In the Estimates recently, particularly the Estimate for the Office of Public Works, the whole schedule of works is cut out.  I suggest that during my experience 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of that money was spent in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This Dáil is being run on a completely Dublin bias.  When you consider the difference between the difficulties of a Deputy running any rural constituency as against the Deputy in Dublin City, with all the facilities of this Dáil at his disposal and requiring nothing but a bus to take him to and from this House, it will be realised that the Dublin Deputy is in a far better position than any rural Deputy who has to travel maybe 160 or 170 miles, in the first instance, to Dublin and, not alone that, but who may have to travel 140 miles from one end of his constituency to the other.</P>
      <P>I suggest that, as there are only two seats to spare and three applicants, the area that can more easily bear the loss of a Deputy should suffer the loss of the seat, the area that can be served by the bus.  There is an entirely different position between that of a rural Deputy and a Deputy in Dublin who is in the favoured position that a threepenny or fourpenny bus fare will take him to any corner of his constituency. He has a far easier and a far softer job than a Deputy representing a rural constituency.</P>
      <P>I, for one, am not prepared to see the rights of Cork cut out by one Deputy even though that may or may not suit the former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Sullivan.  The constituency is too large.  A five-seat rural constituency at present is practically an impossible task for any one Deputy to work, particularly if that Deputy is a lone member of a Party. It is wrong on the face of it.  Therefore, as you have undoubted facilities in the hands of Dublin Deputies, facilities that do not exist in any other constituency, the extra seat should go to the rural areas.  It is only fair and just and I can see no justification for doing otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One man would have no trouble in doing the whole of a Dublin constituency. Take the position of Deputy <Col N="1069" /> Manley, for example.  If he is elected at the next election for the constituency that was marked out here last week, he will have to go down to the bounds of Kerry, maybe, on one day, then as far as Charleville on another day, and so on, and it is an impossible and an unfair task to impose on any Deputy.</P>

In honesty and justice, the two seats should be given to Cork and to Wexford. I am appealing to rural Deputies to get on their feet now, to ignore all bias or anything else and to do the job.  It is the rural Deputy's job.  Let us clear the road and put the Dublin fellows in their places for once.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage there was a considerable amount of inaccurate comment concerning the position of Dublin Deputies as against that of rural Deputies.  Obviously some of those who made those comments have never travelled on the City bus services. The bus fare from one end of my constituency to the other amounts to 1s. 2d.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The least important aspect of the Bill is the convenience of Deputies.  Deputy Corry seems to think his own personal convenience and the convenience of all Deputies is what this House should consider.  I do not believe that.  The most important principle which an Electoral Bill should try to establish is to give precisely the same political power to <Col N="1070" /> a &ldquo;Jackeen&rdquo;, a Corkonian and every other Irishman.  This Bill as it was originally framed and as it now stands introduces a geographical qualification. Despite the one paltry extra seat given to Dublin, when it would need five more to make it equal to some areas in the country, there would still be 5,000 more people per Deputy in Dublin than in the rest of the country. Deputy Corry has the audacity to say that Dublin does not deserve the extra seat.  I can only assume, in charity to him, that he cannot do simple arithmetic, through the medium or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I cannot stir within myself the same sentiments of gratitude to the Taoiseach as those voiced by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins for the simple reason that there is only one more seat given to Dublin and it would have needed five to make it equal with some parts of the country.</P>
      <P>There is another point which I stressed on the Second Stage and which I again stress, that the Taoiseach said his main object so far as Dublin was concerned was not to change the borders of constituencies. The peculiar thing is that the only constituency in all Dublin city and county which has not had anything taken from it to substitute somewhere else is the constituency which the Taoiseach represents.  He has drawn artificial borders in his constituency, a constituency which makes more twists and turns than a conger eel would make in 24 hours.  It is the most awkward, artificial constituency ever devised in Dublin city.  The reason is, of course, that the Taoiseach's Party has in that constituency four representatives out of five and it is hoped, by higgledy-piggledy gerrymandering, to retain these seats. However, despite the best efforts of the Taoiseach and the Minister to achieve that, they will find it will go otherwise, when the election comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I ask this House to be concerned not about their own convenience but about the basic principle of democracy that every man should go to the polling booths in the full knowledge that his vote has the same strength as the vote of any other Irishman, <Col N="1071" /> whether he comes from Ballydehob or from Ballyfermot.  That is the important principle which this Bill has ignored.  On the Second Stage, we appealed to the Government to redraft the Bill <i>in toto</i>, not just to distribute the two extra seats which are allowed under the Constitution, but to redivide the whole country as the Constitution lays down ought to be done. It is certainly an ironical situation that it is the Government whose Party introduced the present Constitution who are flouting it and we have to stand up and appeal to them to have respect for the Constitution which they introduced.  As I have said, if it is not done in this House, there are still two other places in which it can and will be done, if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in this Bill have done a grave disservice to the two Cork constituencies, that is, North Cork and South Cork and they have been particularly vicious in their treatment of the constituents in these two electoral areas.  It is only a few months since the members of the Government were telling us of the marvellous virtues inherent in small constituencies. We all recollect being told about how nice and tidy constituencies would be if each of them returned only one member, how easy it would be for the constituents to see the member, how pleasant it would be for the member to be able in the small constituency to meet his constituents frequently, how matey everybody would be if the constituencies were reduced in size and the Deputy enabled to keep in close and intimate contact with his constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, having whistled that tune during the referendum debate, decided that in Cork they would do violence to whatever virtues they previously saw in small constituencies and they have merged the South Cork and North Cork constituencies together for the purpose of creating, instead of two constituencies with three members each, one constituency returning five members.  This is a complete <i>volte face</i> by the Government. They have completely changed their tune in regard to small <Col N="1072" /> constituencies and in Cork, they are proceeding deliberately to create an elongated constituency of five members. That is completely at variance with the reasons they gave a couple of months ago for creating small, single-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>No effort is being made at all to justify this merger.  There is no need for this merger and this Bill can be altered in such a way as to allow these two constituencies to retain their existing representation of three Deputies each to enable the local people to maintain the service which they got from three Deputies in each constituency.  But apparently&mdash;I am bound to say I think it is for political reasons&mdash;the Government have decided to make one single constituency out of the two three-member constituencies and to give that constituency five seats instead of the six which the two constituencies now have.</P>
    <P>The Government are creating in Cork a single constituency with five members.  That constituency will be approximately 110 miles in length.  Let that be the background against which the honesty of the Government's statements on the referendum is judged.  To get a picture of it: it is a constituency equal in length to the distance from here to Cashel, from here to Ballinasloe or from here to south of Wexford town.  I do not think that can be justified.  It is an outrage on parliamentary democracy to imagine that a Deputy, giving his attendance to whatever private business he has, his attendance here in the Dáil, and travelling up and down twice a week to that constituency, can hope to serve such a constituency in the remaining few days at his disposal in the week.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what grounds the Government purport to justify a proposal of this kind.  I should like to see some of the gentlemen who drafted it having a constituency of their own and being representatives in an area covering 110 miles in length.  I take the view very definitely and frankly that if there is to be any preference or any bias in this matter, there is a strong case for bias in favour of the rural area.  It is one thing to get 600 <Col N="1073" /> people living on a long road in an urban constituency and another thing to find 600 people scattered over ten villages in a rural area.  Nobody will contend that representing 600 people on one road is the same as representing 600 people scattered over ten small villages in all kinds of inaccessible districts, with houses perched as they are on all kinds of roads and hillsides.</P>
    <P>If I had to make a choice between giving Dublin South (East) four seats instead of three seats and leaving the Cork constituencies as they are with three Deputies each, I would come down strongly on the side of Cork.  I would feel myself morally coerced to do so because I believe the merits lie on that side, and Dublin South (East) will not perish for want of parliamentary representation in having three Deputies in an area which is miscroscopic territorially compared with the constituency of 110 miles in Cork. When Deputy Ryan talks about concentration of population in Dublin, let him do the exercise of representing a constituency 110 miles in length.  How would he like to have a constituency which started at Merrion Gates and ended south of Wexford?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Cork Deputies are getting and what the Cork people are getting.  I put it to the Minister very strongly that in all equity&mdash;forgetting the politics of the matter&mdash;if Parliamentary democracy is to work in North and South Cork then it is essential that the people of these two constituencies should be served by Deputies who will have some reasonable chance of attending to their requirements.  Deputy Corry put the case excellently for the retention of the present representation in North and South Cork.  I think the case for it is unanswerable.  While one has to make up one's mind about giving an additional seat to Dublin South (East)&mdash;whilst depriving two constituencies in Cork of one representative&mdash;it should be pointed out that deprivation is purchased at the cost of merging two constituencies to constitute a new constituency which <Col N="1074" /> will be impossible adequately to represent. I think all the merits lie on the side of leaving the Cork constituencies as they are.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Government have decided not to allow a free vote on this matter.  I must say I am surprised at that decision.  Surely the members of the Government Party are not so intellectually impoverished that they must be prohibited from deciding according to their own minds, their intellects and consciences, where they think equity lies in this matter.  I believe equity lies on the side of the Cork constituencies being left as they are.  The Government Party should claim for themselves the right to be protected against having to go to the Division Lobbies to vote for something which they know in their own hearts is doing a disservice to Parliamentary democracy in Cork and doing it under circumstances which are not necessary for the implementation of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are examining this revision of constituencies very soon after one of the most protracted debates in the history of the State in relation to the system of election.  It is only natural that, that debate having taken place so recently, the arguments advanced should still be fresh in our memories.  Those of us on this side of the House who spoke at that time in favour of the retention of proportional representation advanced certain arguments in favour of the multiple seat constituency with particular reference to five-member constituencies most faithfully representing opinion in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being consistent in welcoming the retention of five-member constituencies in this revision, but I wish to say that when I now criticise, and strongly criticise, the Government's proposals on this stage of the Bill, in relation to the creation of this new constituency of Mid-Cork, I do so quite consistently with the views I expressed, and that I still hold and will continue to hold, in relation to the general advisability of having large-member constituencies.  That consistency cannot be shared by the people supporting the Government <Col N="1075" /> because they have just been through a campaign in which each of them advanced, day in day out, and in fact night in and night out, the attractions of the small, single-member constituency to which Deputy Norton referred before I rose to speak.</P>
    <P>If in this revision of constituencies the Government decided to be fair throughout the rural constituencies&mdash; and I shall confine my references to the rural constituencies&mdash;and if they had shown equity in regard to all the rural areas, then I would agree to what the Government proposes to do in relation to the creation of the mid-Cork constituency.  But how can the Government stand over their arguments, with which I have a certain sympathy, in relation to a bias in favour of rural constituencies, if they decide to create this constituency in Mid-Cork extending over an area in excess of 100 miles in length?</P>
    <P>I ask the Connaught Deputies, on their way home today, to stop when they reach Ballinasloe and think for one moment that this proposal is to create a constituency of exactly that size.  I ask them to put themselves in the position of a Deputy elected in that area and to realise what would be entailed if that Deputy had to represent all the people throughout that area. This morning the Taoiseach and the Minister faithfully reported to the House the discussions they had with members of other Parties but I am somewhat aggrieved that the Taoiseach departed from the alphabetical placing of the constituencies.  He mentioned Dublin&mdash;I can understand that all right because there was a certain amount to be said for giving a seat to Dublin&mdash; and then he mentioned Wexford and Cork, which were not in the running at all.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the Deputies sitting behind the Government will be permitted to do as their consciences, wisdom and experience require them in this matter, to vote one way or another on the issue between Wexford and Cork.  In the revision there has been only one change of any consequence territorially and that is in the creation of this new mammoth constituency of Mid-Cork.  Any other little <Col N="1076" /> changes territorially were mere niggling in comparison to that.  If it were a five member constituency with an obvious centre, with a natural hub, with a large town in the centre of it, maintaining social, economic and cultural contacts throughout that area, then something could be said for its creation.</P>
    <P>However, if we take the Southern part of the proposed Mid-Cork area, the old constituency of South Cork, that in itself was a very difficult constituency to administer because many arterial roads cut through Cork city which was a small island within its confines.  That was, even as a three member constituency, more difficult to represent than the normal three member constituency.  Now what is being done is that the constituency will extend right up to the Limerick border. Seven arterial roads will now cut through this new constituency going into the city of Cork.  Any resident on any of those roads will have no contact in any way with the people resident in the other sectors.  That is an important point when you come to decide whether Cork or Wexford should get the extra seat.</P>

      <P>The position of Dublin has been clearly explained to the Deputy.  The whole decision could be reversed in the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds if the Government did not do something for Dublin. All our work here could be negatived if we did not do something to meet the position.</P>
      <P>That is the situation.  We are practically presented by the Government with a <i>fait accompli</i> in relation to the Dublin seat and it now appears as if impartial attention has not been given to the remaining problem which is whether mid-Cork or Wexford should gain.  It is notable that Deputies opposite who favoured Wexford were allowed to put down an amendment but there is no amendment from Cork Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it is to be hoped that Deputy Corry's good <Col N="1077" /> nature in relation to anything Corkonian will be reflected in a way he will vote.  Undoubtedly it will be very difficult for him, in face of the speech he has just made, to do anything but support us who also agree that the seat should be restored to Cork county, and that the two old constituencies of North and South Cork should be left as they are.  If there was anything like an amalgamation of other three-member constituencies, then we would be quite agreeable.  We welcome the fact that the Government are implementing proportional representation to the extent to which they are doing so in this Bill, but we ask them to look again at the creation of this mammoth constituency which is out of step with what the Government are doing in maintaining three-member constituencies with less than 17,000 of a population per Deputy.  This new constituency is outrageous in extent, and in relation to the various walks of life, social and otherwise, of the people in it.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Deputies who may not know this area&mdash;how can you provide in the Mid-Cork constituency members who will be in close touch with all its problems, members who will be interested in the fishing in Kinsale, in the small farmers of Rockchapel, in the graziers of Charleville, and the suburban industrial residents of Cork city? We appreciate the honour that is reflected on the Deputies representing Cork by asking five Corkonians to look after the interests of such a varied and such an immense population. If we accept the Government's contention that there must be fair consideration for Deputies representing large chunks of country, in comparison with Deputies representing concentrated populations, may I ask the Minister one question?  How does he reconcile the maintenance of the city constituency of Cork with 111,000 of a population in a small concentrated area, with the creation of an island 110 miles in length, with a population of 109,570?  If the Government want the House to accept their attitude in relation to all the rural areas, then I would ask them to apply that attitude to Mid-Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> As is pretty well appreciated, I am leaving aside all personal considerations in the views I have advanced.  I am making the case in justice to those who will be elected to represent that constituency, in justice to those who are now elected to represent both of the old constituencies, and I ask the House to remember that even though we sympathise, and would fully support the claims of Wexford to retain their five members, at least there is no territorial change in that constituency. They suffer a reduction in representation, like Roscommon and some others, but I do claim that Cork certainly has the better case because there we have a violent territorial change in the creation of the largest constituency in Ireland, both in population and area, a constituency which has nothing to offer by way of a cohesive group of people with a natural centre at which they can come together.  That is the reason why the Dáil should give the additional seat to Cork county, and leave the constituencies there as they have been for the past 12 years.</P>

      <P>There have been quite a few points raised by various Deputies and possibly, before those points are obscured by further points raised by other speakers who may follow, I might deal with them in so far as I can.  I think it was Deputy M.J. O'Higgins who raised the question of figures and of the numbers proposed to be taken from Dublin South (West) and other areas and added to the constituency of Dublin South (East).  In so far as the actual changes in population figures are concerned, the would-be totals are as follows: Dublin South (East) would gain under the amendment a total of 13,261 of a population from Dublin South (West), and in addition, 6,675 from Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.</P>

      <P>If there is any further breakdown the Deputy requires, we can try to work it out.  That brings me to another matter I omitted to mention, which was raised by Deputy Cosgrave quite early on in the debate, in regard to any changes that are proposed from our present situation&mdash;that is up to the moment&mdash;that we should try to ensure that the voters are given the greatest possible consideration in siting the polling stations for their convenience. As Deputies will appreciate, strictly speaking, that is a matter for the local authorities concerned, but we shall bring it to the notice of these local authorities, particularly in relation to any constituencies where boundaries have been changed.  I think the Deputy mentioned in particular the area around Booterstown or Williamstown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall bring that to the notice of the local authorities concerned, if and when the House agrees to the proposed changes.  A point was also raised by a Fine Gael Deputy, that it is the convenience of the constituents that should be considered, and he made a very determined case as to why Dublin should have got very many more seats.  It is because of the very fact that we are so placed that Dublin has not got that extra number of seats available to it.  It was because of our consideration, given in so far as was practicable, of the convenience of our constituents and the service of <Col N="1080" /> those constituents throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We then move to the question of Cork.  I think the last few speakers dealt almost exclusively with the Cork situation, with odd references to their particular views on the proposal to give away another seat to Dublin city. Let me say straight away in so far as my own personal feeling and my outlook are concerned, if I were free to do this, I think I would certainly place a greater value on the difficulties of the people of rural districts, and particularly the people of the western seaboard, than on the circumstances of the urban dwellers and the more concentrated units of population and, if I were entirely unfettered by any conventions, legislative considerations, or anything else, I would most certainly go a long way to meet the most extreme views expressed here by those Deputies who feel that rural Ireland and the more remote parts of rural Ireland should, in fact, have greater representation than is now given to them, and to which they are entitled under the constitutional limits imposed upon us.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that it is within the existing limits that we must try to work, and, in working out this present plan, I think the House will agree that, without taking any particular isolated case or any particular isolated constituency, a case can be made for something additional.  That criticism can be made of any constituency. That is all too easy, but it by looking at the overall plan of the constituencies related to the overall regulations under which we must evolve these constituency boundaries that the picture really should be regarded rather than by taking isolated cases and making either criticisms or further claims for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not in any way envy the Deputies who can get up in the Opposition and make these extreme and exaggerated cases in regard to particular constituencies or areas.  If I were over there, I should do likewise, but I put it to the House that it is so very easy to do this where we are dealing with different parts of the proposed 144 seats.  It is too easy to make a very exaggerated but possibly a very <Col N="1081" /> telling case in regard to any 20 or 30 of the constituencies concerned.  One can even break down a constituency and make a good case for part of it, showing how it is not being fairly treated as compared with an extreme on the other side in some direction or other.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputies Norton and O'Sullivan, in so far as they have expressed their views very strongly on the proposals in relation to Cork, I say this.  First of all, they suggest that the constituency of Mid-Cork now proposed&mdash;it is really an amalgamation of the old South and North Cork constituencies&mdash;is the worst of everything that could possibly be thought up.  They said that various reasons and considerations brought about that result and not the least of their arguments is the charge that it is a purely political move.</P>
    <P>That is natural enough as a charge when you do not agree with a proposal such as this and when you come to discuss it here, but it is only fair to realise that under the Constitution we are entitled to have constituencies of not less than three seats.  Therefore, we can start off with three, four, five or six seat constituencies or whatever we like, but in the main we have got completely away from any idea&mdash;I do not think there ever was any such idea: certainly not in recent years&mdash;of nine-seat constituencies.  We have five and seven and four and three-seat constituencies.  The seven-seat constituency has disappeared entirely in recent years.</P>
    <P>We are left then to deal with constituencies in terms of three or four or five seats.  When we come to the breaking-up of rural Cork, we find that in reducing Cork by one seat, we have a total of 11 seats.  Do with those 11 seats what you will and you can have only the following alternatives&mdash;two fours and a three or two threes and a five.  Possibly you can juggle those around and put last what I have put first and put first what I have put last; it does not really make much difference.</P>
    <P>We decided to make it two threes and a five and the reason it is two threes and a five as we suggest, rather <Col N="1082" /> than the two threes and a five as suggested of old, is that it makes the least possible amount of change in the constituency boundaries.  Allowing that we have knocked out the middle partition between South and North Cork, taking it otherwise, by and large, around the city boundary, down along the western division, we have made the least change possible and despite the enlargement of the constituency into Mid-Cork and the disappearance of North and South Cork as two separate entities, we have not confused the issue so that people will not know to which constituency they now belong.</P>
    <P>If, in the main, we may say they belonged to South or North Cork in the past, in which constituencies they will have voted in the past, then it is a 99.9 chance out of 100 that those people will now have their votes, if this measure is agreed to by the House, in the new Mid-Cork constituency. That was considered in addition to the other consideration that in considering a five-seat constituency in rural Cork, the first picture that would present itself was of the old constituency which included, we might say, South and West Cork in the past.  It might be considered that we should go back to something that was known in the past and search out the boundaries which were then known and which existed some time ago.  But I put it to the Cork Deputies considering the geographical lay-out of West Cork and its territorial appearance and construction, the amalgamation of the North and the South is a better and more convenient arrangement than the amalgamation of the West and the South.</P>
    <P>Further, the mileage was not very far removed from my mind or the mind of the Government or of my officials when we were trying to get this plan arranged.  If we take the distance from Kinsale to Rathluirc which one would consider to be, perhaps, not the full, extreme length of the constituency, we find that the mileage is far short of that quoted by Deputy Norton here.  Instead of being 110 miles the distance from Rathluirc to Kinsale is 57 miles.  I am not suggesting that he said that was the <Col N="1083" /> mileage between those two points but between some two points or other, he got 110 miles; I am not disputing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what is the distance between Rockchapel and Crosshaven?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to develop my argument. I am not saying that the mileage quoted here is not a mileage that can be followed but what I am saying is that in considering this matter, we were not unconscious of or blind to the mileage question.  In fact, we took two points which I feel that those outside of Cork, at any rate, if looking at the map would regard as two points they would immediately notice in considering this constituency&mdash;Kinsale and Rathluirc or Charleville.  The distance there is somewhere in the region of 57 miles.  Assuming it is 110 miles as may be worked out in some way from one point to another, there would be five Deputies in that constituency if the proposals in the Bill are agreed to. Assuming it is 110 miles&mdash;the very extreme limit of miles that can be assumed&mdash;there will be five Deputies to 110 miles in a county, mid-Cork, the terrain of which is not unduly severe or unduly broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compare that with a constituency where there may be many more journeys up to 88 miles and how many seats are there?  I am talking now about my own constituency.  There are four seats in East Donegal.  We have journeys ranging up to 88 miles from point to point within that constituency and there are only four seats.  I am one of four Deputies who represent a constituency the terrain and general layout of which is such as not to be compared with those met in travelling through mid-Cork county.  My mileage from my home in Donegal to the Malin Peninsula is 88 miles, single journey.  What is even more difficult to understand is that looking from the Head of the Fanad Peninsula where I live across to the head of Malin Peninsula is but a short distance.  In fact, it is only 12 miles but it means 88 miles of a tiring, long, hard road journey over mountains.  There are four <Col N="1084" /> of us there.  If some Deputies, including Deputy O'Donnell from West Donegal, had their way, there would only be three of us representing that constituency.  Any possible piece of the East Donegal constituency that could possibly be moved into the west would not in the slightest degree reduce the long mileages.  We would still have to travel.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, in talking about a plan, an overall picture of the entire distribution of 142 or 144 seats, I prefaced my remarks by saying that it is all too easy for any Deputy to pick out the extremes in any direction.  An extreme having been picked out, I am now comparing that extreme with another extreme of a similar character at the other end of the country, of which I have personal knowledge.  I talk about that because I know it better and I know the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as is possible.  In considering a five seat constituency in Cork, I put it to any fair-minded person here that the amalgamation of North and South Cork is a far more convenient amalgamation than the amalgamation of West Cork and South Cork.  The constituency of mid-Cork has now been mentioned and the extreme mileages.  I regret those mileages but they are not as difficult as or any greater than those in existing constituencies in respect of which cases have been made by members of the Opposition that they should be still further reduced in mileage in order to meet their views.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that the Taoiseach, in talking here this morning, departed from the alphabetical order of things in reference to these three constituencies of Dublin South (East), Cork and Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well then&mdash;two. <Col N="1085" /> The Taoiseach mentioned Dublin, then Wexford and sort of played down Cork.  The fact of the matter is&mdash;I know this only by seeking about for another reason earlier&mdash;the amendments placed on the Order Paper refer to Dublin, Wexford and Cork.  I can tell the Deputy and the House that that is purely accidental, coincidental or whatever you like to call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was that and the paper in relation to the amendments which was in front of the Taoiseach which accounts for the way the matter was put to the House.  I had nothing to do with the way they were placed on the Order Paper.  I did not know, until I checked on it, what order they were in.  My advisers tell me that the amendments followed the order of the Bill.  That is how it may have come about.  No sinister or ulterior motive or reason should be attributed to what the Taoiseach said in his remarks about these three matters before he left the House this morning.</P>
      <P>The question was asked by Deputy O'Sullivan how one could justify Cork city with 111,000 people and five Deputies&mdash;I am quoting his own figures&mdash;in relation to 109,000 people, as he said, in the rural constituency of Mid-Cork represented by five Deputies. Again, I shall just ask the Deputy a question which is as difficult for him to answer as this one would be for me.  Does he want the Cork city representation reduced?  Is that the implication of asking me to justify five seats for Mid-Cork with those figures of 109,000 people as against five seats for concentrated Cork city with 111,000 people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I contended that there was no loss of population comparable with the losses in other areas. There is no case at all for a reduction of a seat in Cork county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at it another way.  The Deputy has made that point.  It has been suggested that if there are constituencies below the ratio of 17,000 per member, that is an <Col N="1086" /> outrageous situation or that the proposal for a five-seat constituency in Cork is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With 22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point the Deputy made.  The Deputy does not have to leave Cork to see an undisturbed constituency.  West Cork, which borders on the low ratio he has mentioned, is undisturbed.  The reason it was left undisturbed is, as I said earlier, that consistently in that type of country, you have a difficult terrain, long headlands and a mountainous type of territory right up to the western seaboard, including West Cork and North Donegal.  We have left them undisturbed because we feel it is not practicable to change them, by reason of the good arguments put forward not only from this side of the House, but by many Deputies on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>West Cork is being extended now.  I know it is slight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very slight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of practicability.  If the Deputy looks at it, he will see that we have extended it in such a way as to leave it somewhat more convenient for certain people in that area than it now is.  As I say, you can take any changes and make a hundred arguments against them.  Even in the matter of Mid-Cork and in our treatment of part of Cork county which is West Cork, we have given to West Cork the extreme treatment in the one direction of leaving it practically undisturbed because it is our consistent argument that from West Cork to North Donegal, the indented coast, the mountains and the difficulties of travel are such that their representation should not be reduced, if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The follow-on is that, having done that in that whole strip, consequential changes in some other parts of the country of less difficult terrain of the order we are now proposing to the House are necessary.  These things are <Col N="1087" /> consequential on each other rather than on decisions taken isolated from the entire picture.  The whole plan has had to be developed under regulations, constitutional requirements, outside of which we cannot go.</P>
    <P>In having the proposals here to-day for the allocation, by amendment, of three further seats, by adding two of these three amendments and passing them here, we are again up against the question of the constitutional requirement which precludes us from going beyond 144 seats.  Those regulations and those constitutional requirements, superimposed on the difficulties we have encountered in trying to get these constituencies straightened out and, at the same time, to make as little change as possible, to add as little confusion as possible to the electorate at the next general election as a result of changed boundaries, have been difficult to work with, but in bringing to the House the proposals we now have by way of amendment, we feel that we have met some of the early criticisms raised in the House.</P>
    <P>In that way, we have not been hard and fast in our outlook and approach to this matter.  If we allocate these two further seats now, we cannot allocate any more because the Constitution precludes us from doing so, but we are, in fact, with that little leeway that was left to us, bowing to the wishes in a general way of the Opposition as expressed on Second Reading.  It is in that context that I should like the House to give further consideration to our various amendments and to the discussion of the proposals.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that Deputy Corry contributed to this discussion in the manner in which he did.  He has done a grave disservice to the consideration of this Bill.  In the minds of many Deputies who might have approached the consideration of the Cork question differently, had Deputy Corry not spoken, he has done a great disservice to the cause of the spokesmen of Cork and, in particular, Deputy Desmond, who made a powerful case here on Second Reading as to why Cork should be allowed to <Col N="1088" /> remain as it is.  If there were anything that would influence me against accepting the views and the judgment which were so powerfully and so reasonably expressed by Deputy Desmond, it is Deputy Corry's contribution here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that every one of us should avoid whether we represent a rural or an urban constituency, that is, deliberately to approach a Bill of this sort with a narrow, sectional, local outlook. This is a matter which every one of us, whether personally affected or not, should be big enough to regard from the point of view, as Deputy Ryan said, of the people whom we are supposed to represent and not from our own point of view.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and other Deputies who spoke from the point of view of the people we are supposed to represent in this House were correct. If there is any consideration to be given to geographical features, to topographical features, to difficulties of access by constituents to Deputies, all that should be approached, not from the point of view of the Deputy but from the point of view of his constituents. I have endeavoured in considering this Bill as a city Deputy to be sufficiently broadminded to make allowance for the arguments&mdash;even though I do not believe we are entitled by the Constitution to have regard to them&mdash;which were advanced, as I said and repeat, very reasonably and very mildly by the Taoiseach on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our hands were not tied by the constitutional provisions&mdash;and I say this deliberately, although I am a city Deputy&mdash;I would certainly feel that every Deputy should have very particular regard to the difficulties encountered in large rural constituencies from the point of view of the constituent who is trying to reach his Deputy and who is trying to have provided for him the service which a Deputy should provide.  I would regard that as a reasonable argument.  I would even regard that, were it not for the constitutional provisions, as a matter <Col N="1089" /> which might outweigh the question of maintaining the ratio between seats and population in one constituency as against another, where, in one constituency, an urban constituency, you have possibly a large population but a small belt of country and where, in another, a rural constituency, you have a large area to cover, even though the population is less.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that there are very definite constitutional requirements which must be fulfilled.  It is all right for Deputy Corry to jeer at bog lawyers or anyone else he likes to jeer at, but the fact is that everyone who comes into this House comes in by virtue of the provisions laid down in the Constitution which was accepted by the people on the advice of Deputy Corry and the other members of his Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And against you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and against the advice of a number of people of my Party.  It has been accepted by the people, accepted by my Party and accepted by every other Party in this House.  The constitutional requirements are that the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall so far as it is practicable be the same throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any Deputy who approaches the consideration of this measure in a calm and fair-minded way, having regard to that constitutional provision, could argue that the Bill as originally introduced, providing as it did, in the constituency of Dublin South (West) that the population per seat would be practically 26,000 and in other, rural, constituencies that the population per seat would be something over 16,000, could say that that ratio which is required by the Constitution was being maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As against that, the Taoiseach argued that the House was entitled, in interpreting the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; to take into consideration geographical boundaries, topographical features, and all the rest of it and I <Col N="1090" /> felt that he made a reasonable case with those arguments, but that that case fell to the ground <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Constitution, so long as there were still two floating seats which could be utilised for the purpose of balancing up the discrepancies which existed in the Bill as it stood.</P>
    <P>While the Government have not gone the whole way in answer to the arguments put to them on the Second Stage, I feel&mdash;notwithstanding what Deputy Ryan has said, I do not mind expressing it&mdash;that they have made a reasonable effort to meet the point of view put forward and that it would be churlish on my part as a Dublin city Deputy not to accept and appreciate that.  I do accept and appreciate it, but I think it would be fatal, and particularly fatal for the battle Deputy Corry is fighting, if he tries to channel this debate into a collision between Dublin city Deputies, on the one hand, and rural Deputies, on the other.  I give him this warning, and I give it to him fair and square, I shall not hesitate, if necessary, to urge that recourse should be had to the other constitutional provisions to settle this matter, if Deputy Corry succeeds in the particular line he was on here this morning.  It is very poor service to the people of this country that we should approach the matter in that spirit and from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I have been in this House for a considerably shorter period than Deputy Corry, but I have been in it sufficiently long to know and to appreciate the difficulties and the hardships which many rural Deputies have to put up with in endeavouring to represent their constituents; but I am afraid we cannot legitimately take that into account because what we should take into account is the position of the people they are required to represent. We are only doing our duty by the people who sent us here if we consider this Bill from the point of view of constituents, and not from the point of view of Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we have reached the stage of the survival of the fittest because there are only two seats and we have three claimants for them. Some of the remarks here this morning <Col N="1091" /> from both sides&mdash;from Dublin as well as from the country&mdash;have been of little help in straightening out the matter.  In regard to the remarks of Deputy Ryan, who is a new member, travelling expenses do not repay country members because, out of their allegiance to democratic institutions, they have decided they cannot do two jobs at once.  If we are to debate this important matter on the basis of city versus country, we shall not get very far.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the remarks of the Minister.  Naturally he has done his utmost to show reasons why Cork may have to lose a seat, while other rural areas will not have to do so.  In my speech on the last occasion, I wished good luck to every rural constituency. I do so again.  I realise that the people in rural constituencies, be it in Donegal, Kerry, Galway or elsewhere, are entitled to the service Deputies try to give them, but all we are asking is that the fair play given to them should also be given to Cork. The Minister mentioned the mileage between two points, when speaking of North Cork and South Cork constituencies. Nobody has control over where a Deputy shall live after the election.  We should consider, not the mileage between two points suitable from the Minister's point of view, but the overall mileage in a constituency such as the Minister has been doing in relation to his own constituency in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the position in South Cork constituency.  If we want to discuss this matter on the basis of rural or urban population, I should like to point out that there are only three small towns in the whole of this constituency, each with a very small population.  All the rest of the constituency is made up either of mediumsized villages or rural areas.  When we hear of the distances in other constituencies and the difficulties of people wishing to contact their local Deputy, we know that the same has always applied in South Cork.  It may be said that there are a few large towns in North Cork, but if anybody cares to inspect the maps available in the <Col N="1092" /> Library, he will see that this constituency also has a very large rural area with a very scattered population. Every member voting against Cork on this should realise that he is voting against people in large, thinly populated rural areas.  A few weeks ago, on the Second Stage, the Minister gave the figures per acre in Cork as against Donegal and other counties.  Did he include Cork city in these figures?  Did he consider it on the basis of rural areas versus the city?</P>
    <P>I would not oppose a seat for Dublin or Wexford if I could see the justification for that further representation. We have before us two amendments brought in by the Minister in relation to rural areas, one for Wexford and one for Cork.  Cork is not carrying any Christy Ring and Wexford is not carrying any Nicky Rackard, but&mdash; let us be frank about this&mdash;Wexford is carrying a Minister for Finance and Dublin South (East) is carrying a Tánaiste and Minister for Health. That is where the difference comes in. Has any consideration been given to that aspect of the matter?</P>
    <P>Let us consider the figures shown by the census returns in relation to Wexford and Cork.  I have not the Dublin figures because, like Deputy Corry, perhaps some of us in the country would not be able to divide too well when dealing with the city constituencies.  But let us take the figures for Wexford versus Cork.  In Wexford, the ratio is 17,452 electors per Deputy.  If the Minister's amendment is carried, the position there will remain unchanged.  I shall give the Minister a present now of the lowest figure for county Cork: the figure for West Cork at the moment is 17,158 electors per Deputy.  It is true there is a very small balance in favour of Wexford as compared with West Cork, but West Cork is only one constituency in my county.  I shall give the figures for East Cork, North Cork and South Cork.  In East Cork, the figure is 19,448 electors per Deputy; in North Cork, it is 18,867; in South Cork, it is 19,382 per Deputy.</P>
    <P>Where do we stand then on these figures?  Is there any hope of securing fair play for the people in those areas? <Col N="1093" /> Is there any hope either in relation to constitutional rights or from the simple point of view of fairplay?  All these constituencies in Cork are rural in character.  There are naturally a few towns included in them, but their character is, as I say, mainly rural. Yet these constituencies, as we know them now, are to be scrapped.  East Cork is to carry an increased ratio, although there are over 19,000 electors per Deputy at the moment.  West Cork will be likewise increased, although at the moment it is above the ratio in some of the western and north-western constituencies.  With the suppression of one seat in Cork and with 11, instead of 12, Deputies representing county Cork, each Deputy under the new proposal will in future have to represent 20,415 electors as against 17,000 odd in Wexford and even lower numbers in other constituencies.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to regard Cork county and city as one unit.  With a total of 16 Deputies representing the city and county, each Deputy will, if this proposal is carried, be called upon to represent 21,041 electors.  We heard a good deal this morning about constitutional rights.  Surely, Cork is just as much entitled to consideration from that point of view as any other area. Candidly, we are asking for charity from no one.  I go further: I say that no Deputy has a right to either charity or sympathy, but the people he represents have a right to both justice and fairplay.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Local Government is in a difficult position.  I know that the Taoiseach is in a difficult position.  When speaking here on 28th October, as reported in the Official Report, at col. 411 of vol. 177, the Taoiseach said that this Mid-Cork constituency, carrying five members, will not be any larger than Laoighis-Offaly, Longford-Westmeath or Sligo-Leitrim. It was very kind of him to make the comparison, but he conveniently forgot to mention that it would be much bigger than some of the other constituency propositions before the House.</P>
    <P>It is hard to have to say it, but I know there are honest men on my right in this House who will be driven into voting for something in which <Col N="1094" /> they do not believe, and not because of the vindictiveness of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Local Government, but because of the machinations of four Corkmen and one ex-Corkman.  I know who they are.  Deputies on the Government Benches know them as well as I do.  They did this before in 1947.  They split West Cork and they took from that constituency then a large area&mdash;an area that was represented so ably and so well by the late T.J. Murphy.  The evil genius advising the Minister then, a man who belonged to his own Party in Cork, and others with him, were determined to unseat the late T.J. Murphy, may God rest his soul, but they failed.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not complain.  But what of the people whom we are supposed to represent?  Will they be represented by the committee of five who, even at the last hour last night, insisted on denying a free vote to those men who want to vote for Cork as honourable representatives of their constituents?  Everything has gone by the board now.  The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government know the decision as well as we know it, but I assure the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister now that the people will know the position before we finish. All we are anxious to do is to serve the people.  All we are anxious to do is ensure that our successors will serve them to the best of their ability.  In striving to secure justice and fairplay, I have in mind one honourable Deputy sitting on my right who will be facing possible defeat if this goes through.  I shall not mention his name.  Others know who he is as well as I do.  He is as honourable a man as ever sat in this House or in the Cork County Council, but he is not liked and the committee of five are satisfied that he must go.  A Fianna Fáil Deputy representing South Cork may have to go.  There are two men earmarked for those seats.  I know who they are.  Other representatives from Cork know them.  They have forced the Minister so to revise the constituencies as to achieve the election of two new Deputies for Cork after the next election.  I appeal to those Deputies on my right to think of their own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> In the past few months, I had hoped that we could discuss issues here in a manner somewhat further removed from the political bitterness of the past. I had hoped that, though we might have our differences on economic policies, purely political bias would no longer operate.  I must now admit that my hope has been dashed in the light of the Bill and the amendments before the House.  The secret power behind the scenes has dictated to the Minister; the position is the same as it was in the past.  That will get us nowhere.  It is a sad situation that honourable Deputies on my right should be forced into the Division Lobby to support something in which they do not believe.</P>
    <P>All the figures go to show that an injustice is being perpetrated on the people of North and South Cork.  That is being done for a certain purpose, not for the benefit of the people, not for the overall difference in the change in Party strength.  The only difference it will show at the next election is that one Party will lose because there are only five seats, but the overall strength of the Government Party will not be altered.  Therefore, it is simply being done for political bitterness within a Party that is controlled on this issue from Cork, not by the Minister as I said at the start&mdash;and may I make it clear that certainly nothing is being done against Cork by the officials who have advised the Minister&mdash;but by the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; for the benefit of two members of the &ldquo;big five&rdquo;, against members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have been sitting in these benches for some years past and also against members of another Party.</P>
    <P>The same was done to the late Deputy T.J. Murphy.  Because he was hated by one of the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; an effort was made to oust him.  That attempt failed.  It may succeed now but it makes no difference to me.  It will make a difference to the people in Rockchapel or Kinsale.  It will make a difference in so far as, in these new proposed constituencies, the Deputy who will represent the people in Parliament must attend to the wants of people in six different electoral areas&mdash;in the Kanturk, Mallow, Cork, Bandon areas and part of Clonakilty. <Col N="1096" /> That Deputy is paid to serve the people and he must try to serve people in five or six different councils areas as well as trying to serve them in Dáil Éireann.  That cannot be done.  Who is to be the victim?  None other than the unfortunate man in the rural area who wishes for service but, in future, will not be able to get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned with regard to the threat that has been issued from two members of the Front Bench on the other side of the House. They have made a statement which amounts to saying that a Minister of this House came in here with a Bill that was contrary to the Constitution of this State, that this Bill in its original form as brought in here does not comply with the provisions of the Constitution.  That statement has been made by Deputy O'Sullivan and repeated by Deputy O'Higgins.  It is a rather serious charge against a Minister of this Dáil and I had hoped to hear the Minister reply to it before now.  It will have a very serious effect on the manner in which we shall vote with regard to the Dublin constituency&mdash; whether or not Dublin is to get this seat.</P>
      <P>We had a threat from Deputy O'Higgins about another place and another court.  It reminded me of nothing else but the fellow looking for a fight who, when he got a slug in the jaw, said: &ldquo;I will have the law on you.&rdquo;  For the past half hour Deputy O'Higgins was like an old woman saying: &ldquo;I will have the law on you. If our amendment is not accepted, we shall go to the Supreme Court because the Bill, as brought in by the Minister, does not comply with the Constitution.&rdquo; That was his statement and it was a straight challenge to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said that Deputies should consider the constituents rather than the constituencies.  I represent my constituents and I have never represented my constituency by living in Dublin.  I live in my constituency and I serve my constituents morning, noon and night, and they do not have to come to Dublin to meet me.  I feel very keenly on this matter because at one time or another I have represented <Col N="1097" /> all those areas.  From 1927 to 1937, I fought four general elections in a five-seat constituency in an area which comprised Charleville, Bandon, Mallow, Cobh, Midleton, Youghal, Fermoy and Mitchelstown.  It was a hard constituency to work.  It was a five-seat constituency and it was a tough job to do it.  I patted myself on the back when, in the fourth general election, I got within 77 of 13,000 No. 1 votes there.</P>
    <P>I lived in my constituency unlike Deputy O'Higgins, and that was the result.  I next took over a portion of South Cork in the area which is at present represented by Deputies Desmond, MacCarthy and Manley.  I represented that area for 10 years and I saw the difficulties alluded to here to-day by two Deputies in connection with the city and the central area and the awkwardness of working there.  I found that difficulty also.  I know the difficulties and the practically impossible task facing a Deputy who represents that constituency.  If I were cute, I would perhaps shut my mouth but I know I could walk in there in the morning and head the poll.  I have no doubt about that; it would be no bother to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister was attacked to-day and it is a pity that the Deputy did not make the argument he made to the Minister for the two Benedicts who were having that quiet &ldquo;confab.&rdquo;  The Minister was so sympathetic about a person getting married down in Bandon that he shifted the constituency and included Bandon in North Cork.  That is what we are putting against Deputy Desmond's allegations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am discussing what has happened in Cork and I am anxious to hear from the Minister&mdash; because I know how it will affect a vote in this House&mdash;whether there is any truth in the allegation that the Bill is contrary to the Constitution. That allegation has been made by Deputy O'Sullivan, followed by Deputy O'Higgins.  Is it true or is it not?  Deputies have a right to know the position so that they may consider it fully.  I know why that allegation was made.  It was made in order to create difficulty between the two rural constituencies and to save Dublin out of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan, that child over there, spoke about his constituency and of the difficulty of travelling it.  He said he has to pay 1/2d bus fare to travel his constituency.  Take Deputy Desmond. If he is elected for the new five-seat constituency in Mid-Cork, he will have to pay not 1/2d bus fare but very considerably more.  In fact, he will need a helicopter.  If Deputy Desmond starts from Crosshaven, where he lives, to go to the Kerry boundary to have a chat with Deputy McAuliffe and if he hires a taxi the cost will be more than the cost of going to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difficulty arises there.  That is why I say that, unless the Deputy's <Col N="1099" /> allegations that this Bill is unconstitutional are corrected, the two seats should be given to the two rural areas. I got a lecture 1½ hours long from Deputy O'Higgins.  I know what has happened here.  I have not the slightest confidence in this House as far as justice is concerned.  Last week I had to give an example of what happened here in regard to my constituency before and what did happen here in regard to the South Cork Board of Assistance and Cork city.  The act of this House, despite the fact that Deputies challenged a division, cost the ratepayers in my area £3,250,000 in the past twenty years.  The figures are there and cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, Deputies do not give a hang.  The attitude seems to be that Dublin is safe; the baby is to be looked after and to the dickens with the country.  There are three amendments before the House.  Every Deputy is here to do what he considers is right.  A Deputy who can travel his constituency at a cost of 1/2 on the bus, as mentioned by Deputy Ryan to-day, has far fewer rights to an extra seat than a Deputy in a constituency which is about 110 miles long and who has to travel through the constituency by car at a cost of £7 or £8 per trip.  Consider the convenience of your constituents.  A Dublin city Deputy can sit down in his home and bring in any of his constituents who may come to his door.</P>

      <P>I am asking this House to wipe out the first amendment, to get rid of Dublin.  I am asking all the country boys to marshal themselves together and to do the job.

Suppose a man from Rockchapel says: &ldquo;I voted for Deputy Desmond and for Labour in the last election; I shall go and consult him,&rdquo; he has to hire a car at a cost of about £10 to take him to see that Deputy. There is a great difference between that case and that of Deputy Ryan and his 1/2d. bus.  Yet we find this House marshalling itself under a Whip &mdash;I do not care what Whip it is&mdash;to vote for giving an extra seat to Dublin.  Then we have the insidious threat by two Deputies opposite that the Bill as brought in by the Minister is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.  This is only an amendment.</P>

I know every part of that constituency and the impossible situation of a Deputy facing all that.  If I have to choose, I must decide against the case in which the least hardship and the least difficulty is involved and that, to my mind, is Dublin.  Therefore I am suggesting that the amendment in respect of Dublin should not be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with any of the three constituencies but I should like to put certain considerations to the Minister.  First of all, we spent over 2¼ hours asking: &ldquo;Are we going to add two seats to this House?&rdquo; I believe that instead we should be discussing reducing still further the number of seats.  However, if we <Col N="1102" /> intend to add the two seats I should like to support the Cork Deputies on both sides of the House.  If we take Cork county as an entity with a population of 224,500 people represented by twelve Deputies, the average number works out at 18,714 for each Deputy and if the Minister is to implement the suggestion expressed by the Taoiseach that as few changes as possible should be effected in this Bill, the best thing would be to leave the Cork constituencies as they are.  With the exception of West Cork the other Cork constituencies show an average much higher than the rest of the constituencies and, with a little adjustment in the case of West Cork, Cork should be left as it is with twelve seats.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion on the relative merits of the cases for Dublin and Cork but I have a great deal of sympathy with the view put forward that Dublin is under-represented. As a country Deputy my main submission would be that on the basis of the figures the Minister has at his disposal, it would be unjust and unnecessary drastically to alter the present set-up in Cork.</P>
      <P>During the debates in connection with the abolition of P.R. I supported the Government, and one of the arguments I put forward was that the smaller the constituency the greater the stability of Government.  I may have been right or wrong in that but I still hold the same view about it.  If the Government proposals are carried, we shall be creating a new five-seat constituency and we shall be increasing the number of Wexford seats from four to five.  I submit that is completely contrary to all the arguments put forward on the P.R. debate and certainly contrary to the views I expressed on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three-seat constituency for a rural area is the ideal size.  My own constituency has four seats but it is part city, part county.  As Deputy Corry said in his first speech here this morning, a three-seat constituency in a rural area gives a better opportunity to constituents to keep in touch with their representatives.  That is about the only thing Deputy Corry said during his two speeches with which I <Col N="1103" /> would agree.  However, I strongly support his advocacy for retaining four three-seat constituencies in the county of Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the need for giving Dublin an extra seat. The Minister and the Government should themselves have settled this matter of the two floating seats.  Reserving the discussion of this problem for the House is like throwing a bone to a number of dogs.  It stands to reason there will be a considerable rivalry on this score.  The reason I make a case for the city having an extra seat is that the amount of work imposed on the urban Deputy is far greater than that imposed on the rural Deputy.</P>
      <P>An argument is made in favour of the rural Deputy on the basis of geography.  In other words, it is assumed the rural Deputy goes out of his way to travel all around the area looking for trouble.  I do not accept that at all.  I can assure Deputies that I do not go anywhere; the people come to me and I have an army of 40,000 people around me in my area. The number in that area will now jump to 64,000.  I should complain of having another 24,000 people to cater for.  Like Deputy Corry, who I believe works hard, I word hard and that is the reason I am here.  I should complain about having so much extra work to do but I am happy that the extra constituents I shall have are all Sherwinites and I shall not object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the amendment to the Bill, it is all right to say that a Deputy has to spend only 1/4d. but he has to spend many such amounts. Apart from that point of view altogether, it is the people who do the spending.  The constituents come to us.  They come in vast numbers and they are there morning, noon and night.  They meet you in the street and on buses and elsewhere because they are all around you.  At least the rural Deputies know that the bulk of their constituents are 50, 80 or 100 miles away.  They may correspond by post but that is much easier than having <Col N="1104" /> people personally asking you to do the impossible and delaying you from your work.</P>
    <P>The work of a Deputy for an urban area is six times greater than that of a Deputy for a rural area because the constituents of the rural Deputy are not on his doorstep.  I am not trying to make any bones about the work I do but I can assure the House that constituents come to me at the rate of 700 a week.  I am pretty sure that a rural Deputy's constituents do not come to him to that extent.  They may write to him but the rural Deputy has an excuse if somebody complains about something.  He can say: &ldquo;You did not see me.&rdquo;  We have not that excuse.  Do not forget that a lot of the work done by members of this House is work that should be done by local representatives but once you are a Deputy people think you can do more for them than anybody else.</P>
    <P>In the city you also have the problem that there are 42,000 people living in Corporation dwellings where they are always in trouble and always contacting you.  The rural Deputies have not got that trouble.  Therefore the matter should not be thought of in terms of the size of the constituency but in terms of the number of people you have to serve, whom you cannot avoid serving.  One Deputy may be an active man and get around his area but I am quite certain the average Deputy does not look for trouble.  He may visit his area during an election but he will not do so otherwise.  In the city the people come to us.  While this House is sitting rural Deputies, or the Deputies from the country generally, have not much trouble.  They have a good excuse that they are here on Dail business but they will not be annoyed while they are here.  We are; we are annoyed before we come in here, when we go home to dinner and when we go home for tea.</P>
    <P>Looked at from that point of view it can be realised that the urban areas should be better represented on that score.  Deputy Russell mentioned that he referred to the size of the constituencies on the Second Stage.  I asked the Minister on the Second Stage why had they stressed the <Col N="1105" /> importance of single-member constituencies, and pointed out that we did not have single-seat constituencies with P.R.  His argument was that the Constitution did not allow it, but the Constitution allows us to have three-seat constituencies.  It does not compel us to have five-seat constituencies. I do not see what the excuse is for not breaking up the Twenty-Six Counties into three-seat areas but I suppose there are political reasons for it.  I am not involved in this matter but I am making the case that the urban Deputies have considerably more work to do than rural Deputies for the simple reason that we cannot avoid our constituents.  They will be in my home when I go home but the rural Deputies are safe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this Bill on Second Stage, I expressed the hope that it would be left as it was.  I have certain convictions about representation in this House and I appealed to the Minister to use all the pressure at his disposal against the inclusion of these two seats.  I regret that has not been done.  We are wasting our time and the time of the country.  No seat is worth that but since it is inevitable, since the Government have made up their minds that these two seats are to be included, I appeal strongly on behalf of the rural areas that the seats be allocated to them.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enter into any controversy between town and country but, in regard to the comments made here this morning, I think there is still a misunderstanding.  Dublin Deputies will have to remember that it is very easy for them at all times to represent this city in the Dáil.  They never have to leave home and have not to incur personal expenses on the scale that country Deputies have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What amazes me about this Bill is the complete inconsistency and illogic shown by the Government in their approach.  If the Government were logical and consistent from the start, <Col N="1106" /> they would have gone into the areas where the population has dropped considerably. Prior to this rearrangement were there 30 constituencies where Deputies represented a population of fewer than 20,000?  Under the change contemplated in this Bill, before these amendments come into operation, there are 19 constituencies where members will represent a population of fewer than 19,000 per head. The inclusion of these two seats brings us very near the danger line when each Deputy on average will represent 20,126 persons.</P>
    <P>Naturally, being a Cork man, I speak from no selfish motive or no personal ambition but for the sake of those who will represent North and South Cork in future years&mdash;I think that Cork, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, is the only area that has faced a complete territorial change.  The utter unmanageability of that area for one Deputy is completely preposterous under this arrangement.  For that reason I appeal in all earnestness that the Cork constituencies be left as they are and to give extra representation to Wexford.  The two seats should go to Cork and Wexford.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not like putting town against country but there is a strong feeling that the preponderance of Dublin Deputies has given the Dáil a Dublin rather than a national complexion. These Deputies can be here at all times as against the man who has to travel 200 miles from the west or south of Ireland.  The personal expenses they have to incur because of the terrain over which they have to travel are reasons why they are entitled to that consideration here when this opportunity arises.  I regret it has arisen but once it has become inevitable let us give the representation to the rural areas.  It is much easier for Dublin Deputies to represent 30,000 people than for many rural Deputies to represent 20,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, in the second column of the entry relating to West Limerick, to delete &ldquo;Ardpatrick&rdquo;, &ldquo;Darragh&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kilfinnane&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kilflynn&rdquo; and &ldquo;Particles&rdquo;.&mdash;George E. Russell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned to the Minister on the Second Stage of this Bill, the purpose of the change in the constituency proposed by the Bill is to transfer five electoral areas from the constituency of East Limerick to West Limerick. As the constituency stands at present, there are four Deputies elected for East Limerick on an average by 20,819 electors.  In West Limerick, as it stands at present, it takes 18,202 electors to elect each of the three Deputies.  With the Taoiseach's sentiments for my guidance, I again submit that a minor <Col N="1111" /> alteration of this nature is quite unnecessary and that the Minister would do well to leave matters as they are.</P>
    <P>The constituency of East Limerick, which I represent, is roughly three-fifths an urban constituency and two-fifths a rural constituency.  I submit that there is no question of having a surplus population.  It takes only just over 20,000 electors to elect each T.D. That figure is very substantially less than the average number of electors required to elect a T.D. in any purely urban constituency such as Dublin or Cork.  The average in West Limerick at 18,202 is substantially higher than a number of the constituencies which it is not proposed to alter and is now substantially higher than Wexford which has retained its five seats with an average of 17,452 electors.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go down through the whole list of the constituencies. Offhand, I shall just mention the following which have fewer than an average of 18,000 electors which have not been touched: North Donegal, South and North Galway, North Kerry, South Kerry, North Mayo&mdash;approximately the same as West Limerick but it has not been touched&mdash;Monaghan, which cannot be touched&mdash;it is a three-seat constituency&mdash;Sligo-Leitrim, North and South Tipperary.  The Deputies are elected by little over 18,000 or the present average number of electors for each T.D. in West Limerick.</P>
    <P>There is another point also.  When the old constituency of Limerick was divided in 1947, it was decided to give three seats to West Limerick and four seats to East Limerick.  The people in the electoral divisions which it is now proposed to transfer, having voted in East Limerick for the past 12 years, are represented by members for that constituency.  For a number of years that portion of East Limerick, which is now scheduled for transfer, was represented by Deputy Tadhg Crowley who lived very close to that area.  If the five electoral divisions are transferred, it will mean that you will have an isolated leg of the constituency there which cannot be again represented by a Deputy elected from its own area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Furthermore, its nearest neighbours in West Limerick will be situated anything from 40 to 60 miles away. Deputy Collins in Abbeyfeale on the Kerry border is very far away from that area and so are Deputies Jones and Ó Briain.  The natural course of the roads is from the city of Limerick to these areas.  The natural fall of the population for marketing or shopping or to see their Deputies is towards the east and the city of Limerick.  I suggest that, having regard to these considerations and the overall sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach when speaking on the Bill, the Minister might leave matters as they are.</P>
    <P>I am not personally affected to any substantial extent by this because, so far as I am aware, the votes in that area, where the population is 2,500, representing some 1,500 electors, go generally to all the Parties that contest East Limerick.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in the spirit of the Bill generally, to leave things as they are.  It would be unjust to these people to transfer them into a new constituency without any valid reason on the basis of population.  It is a fair request and I hope the Minister will accept it in the spirit in which it is made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If anyone would be affected, it is I.  If anyone has a &ldquo;crib&rdquo; or complaint, it is I.  Naturally, having headed the poll on each occasion in East Limerick, it is not very pleasant to see 2,500 votes being taken from one's constituency.  Nevertheless, I welcome the change.  I think it is a good thing.  It is a good thing from the administrative point of view. There is a peculiar anomaly to which Deputy Russell did not advert.  These areas are in the Kilmallock rural district for county election purposes and Kilmallock is in West Limerick. So, up to now, there was the peculiar position that the East Limerick T.D., if he were a member of the county council, was acting, for local authority purposes, for people who were outside his area for Dáil election purposes.  For this small area, this Bill is righting the position.  If anyone is affected, it will be the Fianna Fáil Party because the <Col N="1113" /> Kilfinnane-Ardpatrick area is a nationalist stronghold and has been down through the years.</P>
      <P>I must also correct the statement of Deputy Russell&mdash;I wish he would get his facts correct when speaking in this House&mdash;on the subject of the distances Deputies are from this small area. Deputy Ó Briain, for instance, lives within 15 miles of the area and, certainly, it would be far more convenient for the 2,500 persons concerned, if they wish to see their T.D., to meet Deputy Ó Briain, who passes through the area every week-end or Deputy Collins who is usually there once a month, than to have to travel 40 or 50 miles into the city of Limerick.</P>
      <P>On the whole, the move by the Minister is to be welcomed and gives these people an opportunity of discussing matters of local and national importance with the same people as represent them in the county council and in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like disagreeing with a fellow-Deputy from my constituency but Deputy O'Malley's argument about the electoral areas is nonsensical.  The boundary between East and West Limerick cuts across two electoral areas.  Deputy O'Malley was careful enough not to refer to one of them, that is, the Bruff electoral area, which is far closer to Limerick and is cut off in East Limerick and is part of West Limerick.  As a matter of fact, on that point, the boundary of West Limerick and the boundary of the city of Limerick are coincidental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other electoral division, Kilmallock, even taking in what the Minister is taking in now, the five electoral divisions, there is still the big proportion of the electoral area of Kilmallock in East Limerick. The only difference is that, due to these changes, the people in that area who will remain in East Limerick will be even more inaccessible and more cut off than previously.  I have a map here which very closely illustrates the position.  This is the boundary between East and West Limerick.  This is the Dáil division down here.  This is the area concerned here.  It is now <Col N="1114" /> proposed to bring the boundary over around here, thereby drawing something like a small miniature of Italy sticking into the Mediterranean, with a long arm sticking out.  I suggest it is making an incongruous mess of the two constituencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of voting there, I am not conversant with an organisation that rises to the heights suggested but what Deputy O'Malley has stated in the House now and what he stated outside the Dáil are not compatible. I find it very difficult to understand the change in his figures in his submissions in this debate.  However, I am not so much concerned about who got the votes or who did not.  If you cut out these five electoral divisions, you will create down there a limb in which there will be people who will be largely on their own and will not have an opportunity in future of electing a T.D.  Up to now, the people living in the electoral divisions to be transferred were, I am quite certain, represented adequately by, amongst others, Deputy O'Malley himself. The number involved is so small &mdash;not 2,500 votes, but 2,500 people, representing about 1,500 voters, of whom about 1,250 would normally vote&mdash;and the change is so incompatible with the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach and, indeed, by the Minister himself, that my view is that it might be very well left alone, not in the interests of the Deputies but in the interests of the people living there who have voted in East Limerick for the past 12 years and are, apparently, quite satisfied with things as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Russell's suggestions in regard to this amendment, let me right away say that again, as in the other arguments we have had in the House with regard to what should have been done and what should not have been done, it is quite easy to draw a parallel that would seem to indicate that since we left certain constituencies alone, there was a better case why this one should be left alone.  The fact of the matter really is that in our consideration of this constituency and its present boundary and the average figures in each of the two constituencies of East <Col N="1115" /> and West Limerick and looking at the regulations which, broadly, had to govern all our actions in regard to this matter, we felt that it was practicable to make this change and to make the figures as between the two constituencies more nearly uniform.  In the absence of any suggestion as to how better they might be made more uniform than in the existing constituencies, this proposal is now before the House.  It is on that basis I am asking that the House should add in the areas as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not follow the same policy in regard to other constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We regarded it as practicable to make the changes bringing about near uniformity between these two constituencies, and the regulations direct us to do that, where possible.  Whereas in other cases we did not think it was practicable, we did think so in this case. Since comparisons with other counties have been made, I must point out that the Donegal constituencies were not changed at all in 1947.  On the other hand, there was a change in the constituency boundaries in Limerick at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Deputy correctly, he made the point: why should this change be made in Limerick, whereas it has not been made in other counties, where, from the point of view of population figures and ratios, it should have been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister took me up incorrectly.  I did not approach it from that point of view. I approached it from the point of view that the average number of electors who elect each T.D., at about 18,200, is quite larger in that constituency than in some of the other constituencies the Minister mentioned.  I did not suggest that he should change the other constituencies.  My point was: leave West and East Limerick as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's argument still goes in the same direction. If the figures and the ratio in West Limerick are greater than those in some other constituencies that have been left untouched, that strengthens the Deputy's case for asking why West Limerick was left untouched?  In reply to that, I must refer again to the fact that it was practicable to make changes in this constituency, whereas I hold it was not practicable in the other constituencies the Deputy mentioned. It was against that background we made the changes.  We felt they were practicable and that we were governed by the regulations which said that, where practicable, the figures should be as nearly uniform as possible. We have brought them nearer to each other as a result of this change.  I feel the change will not make either of the two constituencies unduly awkward for either Deputies or constituents. It is on those grounds we are putting the proposals to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of practicability, the Minister is in a position to say that something is practicable and that something else is not. I am not in a position to controvert him.  The Minister can say that it is not practicable to touch 38 of the 39 or 40 constituencies but it is practicable to touch yours and the one next door.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  If he had time, I should like the Minister to demonstrate to me that it is not practicable in other constituencies to make alterations which apparently are practicable in this constituency and to create what must be one of the most incongruous constituencies in the State.  If the Minister says that, I cannot contradict him.</P>

      <P>To try to resolve the slight difference between Deputy Russell's views and my own in regard to what is practicable and what is <Col N="1117" /> not, let me put it another way.  Let us take Dublin city and county and let us take my own constituency, which I know intimately.  Changes were practicable in and around the Dublin city boundaries, the metropolitan area, the county, Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  Not only were changes practicable, but they made for greater convenience.  Surely there can be no comparison between that situation and trying to bring in 3,000 or 4,000 population from East Donegal to West Donegal?  They are completely different in lay-out.  That is an illustration of extremes in regard to what is and what is not practicable in dealing with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify one point?  I gathered from the Second Reading speeches of the Taoiseach and the Minister that Donegal was pivotal.  In fact, it was only when that principle was found to apply to the position in Donegal that the same considerations were made applicable to some of the other western counties. Donegal apparently turned upon the difficulty caused by a big range of mountains.  Could the Minister tell me now where does that range of mountains run?  Is it east-west or north-south?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the way in which the mountains run, as practically <Col N="1119" /> every Deputy here knows, they are fairly widespread.  Deputy McGilligan can take it that they run mainly from east to west.  The constituencies are known as East Donegal and West Donegal, and it might seem from that that the line runs in a direction which makes that division feasible. I do not think that Deputy O'Donnell, or any other Deputy for that matter, will contradict me when I say that, if you draw a line across and say that line divides north and south, the mountain range is running mainly east to west.</P>

      <P>We could get to the stage, talking about mountain passes, in which we might create the impression that, outside Donegal, motor cars normally take to the bocage and drive across fields, rivers and valleys. The normal habit for any person perambulating this country is to adhere to the metalled road.  Whether it is flanked, right or left, by hills or plains does not make very much difference to the travelling Deputy.  But I admit that in Donegal, serving the people there, <Col N="1121" /> was a very much more picturesque experience than it is in the flatter parts of the country.  I would not wish Deputies, strangers or, indeed, tourists, to imagine that getting around Donegal is a virtual impossibility, or that it appertains in any way to Arabia Deserta, or anything like that.  There are ample roads, very picturesque, and anyone who wants to travel in Donegal will find every facility for travelling anywhere he wants to go.  I think undue emphasis has, perhaps, been laid upon this Sputnik-like range of mountains which seems to swing in its orbit north to south and east to west.  A picturesque county Donegal certainly is. A county with admirable roads I know it to be; a county I was happy to represent, not east or west or north or south but in all four points of its expansive compass.</P>

I admire his wit as a cross-examiner in the profession to which he belongs, but, after repetition here, it becomes somewhat boring listening to this playing back of a broken record.  Where does the mountain range lie?  Is it a moving range?  As I said at the outset, there are a number of ranges strung across that part of the county.  I hold there is a main mountain range running east to west.  Deputy O'Donnell says it runs north to south.  On further consideration, I agree that he is, in fact, right.  I am also right.  There are two mountain ranges, one running east to west and one running north to south.  They do not move.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Desmond is aware that Donegal has this <Col N="1122" /> peculiarity; the east and west of it are divided by a range of mountains with only four passes by which people can travel from one to the other.</P>
    <P>Replying to the Second Reading on 29th October, at column 508, the Minister complicated matters still further by stating:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £140,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Aviation and Meteorological Services including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The House is, I think, now fully acquainted with the circumstances leading to the establishment of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. and the general nature and object of its activities.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Bill, which was passed by the House on 5th November, 1959, is to provide the company with share capital of £1½ million for the construction of factory premises. Money for its own administration expenses and for training and other grants to industrial projects at the Airport is to be given by way of non-repayable grants-in-aid voted annually within an aggregate amount of £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with grant-in-aid funds, the original intention was that an <Col N="1125" /> amount of £50,000 would be made available each year.  Experience of the activities of the company before the passing of the Bill, showed that such a fixed arrangement would be unsuitable as the need for grant money in any year would depend on the success attending the efforts to secure the establishment of industries at the Airport. Section 8 of the Bill, therefore, now provides for an overall limit of £500,000 on the amount of grant money and within that limit authority for funds will be requested from the Oireachtas each year as shown to be required by the company.</P>
    <P>The company has already received the full grant-in-aid of £50,000 provided in the original Estimate and the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to provide the company with an additional sum of £140,000 to meet further unexpected commitments. These commitments relate to four projects which are in an advanced stage of negotiation and which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say &ldquo;of negotiation&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;in an advanced stage of negotiation and which the company hope to bring to completion within the current financial year.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions that the Shannon Airport Development Company is unnecessary on the grounds that the promotion of industries at the Airport could be carried out equally satisfactorily by the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal and that there is, in fact, no need for the Shannon company.</P>
      <P>There might be some grounds for these fears if the functions of the Shannon company were solely to promote industries at the Airport.  It will be recalled, however, that the original Shannon Development Authority was set up expressly for the purposes of:&mdash; (i) encouraging transit traffic to use the Airport; (ii) developing tourist attractions at and in the vicinity of the Airport; and (iii) promoting freight traffic at the Airport, including, if necessary, the provision of handling services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became clear at an early stage that the development of freight traffic <Col N="1126" /> would play an important part in maintaining activity at the Airport and that the promotion of industries at the Airport would be necessary to develop the freight traffic.  The Authority, which was subsequently constituted as a limited company to give it status as a legal entity for carrying on business, has, therefore, a diversity of functions apart from industrial promotion, and it would be quite impracticable to try to have these functions exercised through the Industrial Development Authority and/or An Foras Tionscal; in fact it would be impossible without legislation to amend the terms of reference of those bodies.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that there is no overlapping of functions implied in the establishment of the Shannon company.  Furthermore, in the processing of proposals for industries at the Airport, the services of the Industrial Development Authority are utilised in precisely the same way as for any industrial proposal for another part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get an explanation from the Minister. He requires an extra £140,000.  I gather from what he has said that there are a variety of interests which this development company will cater for, not merely industries themselves but industries the negotiations for which are at an advanced stage.  At this point, could we at least have precise information, first of all, as to what industries have already started at Shannon and what employment is being given there or in the neighbouring area?</P>
      <P>Could the Minister say with regard to the others which are in an advanced stage of negotiation and which he hopes to have developed before the end of this financial year, what is the employment in the first year, or in later years, that is forecast for them?  Could he tell me if he can divide this £140,000 which is now requested in addition as between aid for industrial development and aid for the other matters which the development company is to take on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can deal with the points raised by Deputy McGilligan, but, for his information, the information he requires as to the precise activities being undertaken by <Col N="1127" /> the Shannon Airport Development Company Ltd. at the present time was given on the introductory stage of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Bill, 1959, as reported in volume 177, No. 1.  Details are given of the four projects under construction for which negotiations have been completed.  The present employment content and the envisaged employment content are also given.</P>
      <P>There are some matters to which I want to refer with regard to the Shannon Airport Development Company. So far as I can see, one is either entirely for this proposition of the Shannon Airport Development Company or against it.  One cannot be lukewarm with regard to that matter. Whether we like it or not, Shannon Airport happens to be fighting for its existence and for its future.  There is no point in going into the reasons for that.  We know that with the coming of the jet age, certain changes are taking place, and if we were to ignore the trends of modern aviation and their effect on this country, we would, in my humble opinion, be committing a very grievous sin against our industrial workers and, in particular, against the 2,000 people employed in Shannon Airport at the present time.  There will be a certain amount of over-flying by jet aircraft.  Were we, therefore, to indulge in what one might describe as industrial presumption, namely, a foolish expectation of industrial salvation without taking the proper means to attain it?  Whether or not the Minister will appreciate that point, I cannot say.</P>
      <P>We were left with that position facing us.  The Government, in a very realistic manner indeed, shortly after coming back to office, provided over £1,000,000 for the jet runway which, under the contract, is to be finished next August.  In reply to a Question by me yesterday, the Minister indicated that with favourable weather, and so on, it may be finished in time.</P>

    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Russell and several speakers, notably in newspaper articles and in letters to the papers, tried to suggest that the same facilities obtainable at Shannon Airport <Col N="1128" /> should be given to industrialists in the Limerick and Ennis areas.  I do not think either of these Deputies wishes to see Shannon Airport close down, with regard, at least, to the industrial zone, but if legislation were ever enacted in this House to give the same facilities to these areas, I am afraid it would be the end of Shannon from the industrial zone point of view.</P>
    <P>There is nobody who would prefer to see industries in Limerick city more than I but I am being realistic.  If the same facilities were given to Limerick city or to Ennis as are available at Shannon and if the industrialist setting up his factory said: &ldquo;All right; I will set up my factory in Limerick or in Ennis and fly my products by air freight out of Shannon Airport&rdquo;, what is the answer?  In my opinion, it is a question of the cost of freight. You will have double freight charges. At present, the factories at Shannon just load on the finished product and fly it anywhere in the world where there is a market.  That is a convincing argument.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another criticism by Deputy Russell in relation to the building of the factories.  He cited a case where Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority gave a loan and a grant to a project and the building was left on their hands.  In Shannon, so far, they have leased all the buildings.  If it did happen that a company went out of business at Shannon, they would not own the factory.  Their lease would end under the terms of their agreement with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  The building would revert to the company if the people using it ceased the business. I think that is good policy also.</P>
    <P>I want to correct a statement which appeared in one of yesterday's newspapers that a Japanese company with Irish principals and substantial Irish capital propose setting up a factory in Shannon.  A speech was made by a responsible member of, I think, the Waterford Chamber of Commerce, or some such body.  He suggested that, if a curb were not put on the activities of Shannon Airport, cheap raw materials or semi-processed articles would come into the free airport and <Col N="1129" /> the result would be to drive a number of Irish business firms off the map. That is not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    <P>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited&mdash;it is a pity the title is not shorter&mdash;is not empowered to sell anything on the Irish domestic market.  Everything in that industrial zone is for export.  The primary object is to encourage air freight.  Industrialists in this country, small business people as well as large business people, need not have the slightest fear that at any time they will be in competition with the manufacturers in Shannon.  Everything in Shannon Airport will be for the purpose of encouraging air freight business.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well-advised to give the question of freight subsidy every consideration.  We know that, in certain respects and in certain cases, air freight is not as economically attractive as transport by ship.  There are commodities in which it is competitive. It has the advantage for agricultural produce of getting it to the Continent of Europe quickly but I think there is a case for a subsidy.  I do not want the Minister to answer me today because it is very involved. However, in my opinion, there would be a very strong case for a certain subsidy with regard to freight.  Concessions are given to airline companies with regard to fuel, and so on.  I have in mind a grant or a subsidy (1) to attract industrialists to export by air and (2) to make it competitive with shipping at the present time.</P>
    <P>A certain aspect of the mentality of the Irish is that we seem to think everyone in the world is watching us and knows everything that is happening in Ireland and at Shannon.  If you pick up 999 industrial or travel magazines out of 1,000 in America you will not see any mention of Ireland.  If one of these factories cost £500,000, this company would be well-advised to devote that capital, or an equivalent amount, towards advertising the facilities available.  The Minister may say that this matter has been publicised throughout the world through chambers of commerce.  We know these individuals. They throw magazines in a <Col N="1130" /> reading room.  You go in there out of the cold, or if you have nothing better to do.  The ordinary go-ahead young businessman quite possibly never comes across these journals.  Are they advertising in the right journals?  Is there any indication that their advertising campaign will be stepped up?</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, everything going well, in the next six years there should be an extra 3,500 persons employed at Shannon.  If 3,000 to 3,500 extra people are employed there, this Company will be one of the biggest semi-State undertakings we have, perhaps, after C.I.E. and it should receive every encouragement and co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stressed the desirability of attracting business to Shannon and work hand in hand with Bord Fáilte.  We must get away from an insular attitude in this regard.  Take the difficulty in relation to hotel accommodation in Ireland.  Hotels are about to be erected in Limerick, sites are being purchased in Cork and there are options on sites in Dublin.  However, that is all in the future but the Minister will have to be convinced that the modern deal in relation to American tourists is the package deal.</P>
    <P>The very high percentage of the travel from America to Europe last year was of the type that your hotel accommodation and the countries to be visited were picked out.  I see no reason why this Company, possibly together with Bord Fáilte, could not ensure that we had the hotel accommodation in Ireland, that we owned a hotel in Spain, that we owned a hotel in the South of France and possibly in Italy or Germany.  I do not think that is so fantastic.  The first few jets will be delivered to Aer Linte next year. It is essential that we have means of conveying travellers wherever they want to go and that we should have the means of accommodating them. However, I do stress that the whole future of the tourist traffic from America, particularly to Europe in the foreseeable future, will involve the package deal and I trust that consideration will be given to the bottleneck which exists as regards the lack of hotel accommodation.  Perhaps I am getting away from the question before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> This Company set up in Shannon is composed of a body of young men and some old men; it is well worthy of the support of all sections of the community. I know some of them personally and I know that, night and day, they will have the hope and the object of securing the continuation of the prosperity which Shannon enjoys now.  They are alive to the grave position with which we shall be confronted in the jet age but with the encouragement they have received from the Government in the past couple of years I have no doubt they will be successful in their endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wants to see Shannon Airport closed nor do I believe that Shannon Airport is in immediate danger of being closed or that it will ever be closed.  It is far too important to the vital communications of Europe and America and of world transport as a whole for any such contingency to arise.  I am personally fully in favour of anything that will assist in maintaining Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The Minister made quite a comprehensive statement again today but he really reiterated what he said on the Second Reading of this Bill, that to keep Shannon Airport alive we need a special development company, that we need this company for the purpose of seeing that the freight traffic of Shannon Airport is maintained, that we need it for the purpose of tourism and to ensure that industries will be developed in and around Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could disagree with that. However, as I stated on the Second Reading, I consider that all the facilities are already available in the State for this purpose.  We have Bord Fáilte Éireann whose function it is to develop tourist traffic.  There is always the danger in State or quasi-State bodies of overlapping and duplication of their functions.  Although I am not very much in favour of State bodies I freely admit a body like Bord Fáilte Éireann is necessary and desirable. But if they are already doing a job, why do they want the Shannon <Col N="1132" /> Airport Development Company to assist them in doing it?  Deputy O'Malley said you could open 999 journals in America without seeing any reference to Ireland.  I cannot challenge that statement because I have never been in America but, if that is the case, it simply means that Bord Fáilte are not doing their job. If we have this development company manned by people who have no real experience in tourist work, the only result will be overlapping and duplication of functions.</P>
    <P>With regard to air transport, of course it is necessary to develop freightage from Shannon Airport but is it seriously suggested that by setting up this company and having a new board, you will develop industries at Shannon Airport that cannot be developed with the facilities that already exist?  Is it necessary to develop those industries at the airport itself to ensure that the goods will be carried by air to America?  Surely air transport deals with materials that are not very heavy, the lighter type of processed or manufactured material, and it is nonsense to suggest that if those industries were established in Ennis, Limerick or anywhere else, it would involve tremendous extra expense to transport them to Shannon Airport in order to fly them to America, or that it would make any difference one way or the other to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting up of industries, have we not all the facilities necessary for starting industries?  I understood the Minister to say he would want amending legislation in relation to Foras Tionscal to set up an industry at Shannon Airport.  If that is so there is a justificable argument in favour of this new company but the Minister just mentioned it <i>en passant.</i> He did not go into details on the question of why it was not possible to have this amending legislation.  Even if amending legislation were necessary, if you regard it from the economic point of view, is it not much more economical to introduce simple amending legislation to an existing Bill than to introduce a new Bill?  I would be the last to wish any harm to Shannon Airport.  I am sure the Minister is <Col N="1133" /> genuine in his belief that this Bill is necessary, but I think it is surplus legislation and that Shannon Airport will survive quite well with the existing State facilities without any further legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in connection with the Bill, I have already disposed of the arguments which are being put forward that it is unnecessary to form the Shannon Airport Development Company.  I should like to repeat, however, that the object of the company is to make Shannon as well known all over the world as a centre for tourism, as a place where duty-free goods can be bought, as a centre for fishing and as a point from which to start on a journey to see our scenery, as, for example, Florence is.  It has a specialised job of making Americans think of Shannon as a vital centre in connection with their transatlantic journey and inducing them to drop down at Shannon and not to overfly it.  That we regard as a special publicity job.</P>
      <P>So far as Bord Fáilte is concerned, it is my intention to secure such a measure of co-ordination between An Bord Fáilte, the Shannon Airport Development Company, C.I.E. and Aer Lingus that there will be absolutely no overlapping whatever and no waste of time or effort through agencies competing with each other and doing the same job.  If, for example, it is possible to arrange the type of package tour recommended by Deputy O'Malley, and with which I agree entirely, then the packaged tours should be known to all those agencies and be devised in such a way that no one is selling competing package tours.  For that purpose, a committee is being formed so as to ensure that there will be no overlapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Esmonde will take my word for that.  I am absolutely insisting that it would be fantastic to have An Bord Fáilte representatives arriving in New York and arranging for publicity in one form or another, whether on television or by personal contact, or by calling on counter clerks, and the week after to have the Shannon Airport Development Company arrive with a similar team to do <Col N="1134" /> exactly the same job.  There must be real and true co-ordination and we hope to effect that.</P>
    <P>The work, therefore, of the Shannon Airport Development Company will comprise, first of all, its own specific job of dealing with the area around Shannon, with the duty-free shop and with the facilities in the area.  Secondly, it will deal with the whole question, in co-ordination with the other agencies, of bringing package tours to Ireland.  At the same time, the Shannon Airport Development Company will have the special function, in which it will be exclusively engaged, of making the kind of personal contact suggested by Deputy O'Malley with prospective industrialists.  Deputy O'Malley can be assured that the executive and directors of the Shannon company are fully aware of the limited value of advertisements in trade magazines.  To get industries to Shannon, there has to be continuous personal contact, either in the form of exhibitions in a particular city or town where the industries are already operating and can be demonstrated in films, or through personal contact with high executives.  That is already being done and an expansion of that activity is contemplated.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked for some particulars of the industries in operation at Shannon at present.  At the moment, there is one industry which does not depend on the Estimate with which we are dealing.  It is dealing with the production of chinchilla furs for onward sale.  There is a second industry which is making coin-operated amusement games and vending machines.  Those two industries together employ 30 people.</P>

      <P>Coin-operated amusement games and vending machines. Those two companies employ 30 people at present and one of them does not require any grant under the terms of this Estimate.  The second will require a grant.  In addition, there are industries in course of erection. <Col N="1135" /> There is a factory being erected which will manufacture pianos and piano actions.  It will employ 50 to 60 people to begin with and build up to 200 later.  There is the firm of W.R. Pink, Ltd., which is not yet in production; the factory is in course of preparation as in the case of the previous firm.  It will manufacture machines for marking textile fabrics.</P>

Yet another firm is to manufacture transistor radios and electronic equipment.  It will employ 30 to 40 people, in the first instance.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The suggestion has been made that we should subsidise air freights.  I do not think that is practicable under present circumstances and I understand that it would be contrary to the rules of the International Air Transport Association.  I should say that air freight under certain circumstances is regarded as being absolutely economic and that is one of the advantages of Shannon Airport as a place for developing industries.  If the aeroplane can call at the door of the factory and if there is no extra charge for bringing the goods to the aeroplane, and they can be placed on board by a fork lift truck, and if they are packed the way they can be packed for air transport and are delivered in an area where they can be called for by a lorry, they can frequently make the venture generally remunerative to the company.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the advantages of the Shannon area is, quite apart from the tax incentives which are offered and the grants for industry, that firms will tend to take an interest in Shannon Airport because of the air freight factor.  How far that would develop is impossible to say, but having met some of the executives of these industries when I was on a visit there, I can say that they do value it. Deputies will be intrigued to know that articles such as pianos can be satisfactorily exported by air, and that, apart from the other obvious advantages of the Shannon Airport area, the company intending to manufacture these pianos is satisfied that the kind of crating that will be used will be an actual economy to them.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the points.  As I said, this is a very important venture.  I am told by the executives of the Airport Company that they have every reason to believe that quite a large number of people will be employed there in the course of the next two or three years, and there are a number of other projects which have not reached what could be described as the final negotiation stage, all of which indicates what I hope will be continuing prosperity for Shannon Airport.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Committee on Finance. - Control of Imports" RHead="(Quota No. 50) Order, 1959: Motion of Approval">
    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Control of Imports (Quota No. 50) Order, 1959: Motion of Approval.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 50) (Superphosphates) Order, 1959.</P>
      <P>Quota Order, No. 50, is the Order which restricts the importation of superphosphates.  The Order applies both to single superphosphate and to triple superphosphate.  Licences are granted freely for the importation of triple superphosphate.  My intention is that this arrangement should continue until such time as the home fertiliser industry is in a position to meet the demand for triple superphosphate.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that, in October, 1956, the Government announced that they had decided to arrange for the supply of superphosphate to Irish farmers at world prices, while ensuring that the entire output of the Irish fertiliser industry would be taken up. The implementation of this decision involved the suspension of the 20% Customs duty on superphosphate and the payment of a subsidy to home manufacturers, representing the difference between their economic price and the price of imported superphosphate. In addition, it became necessary to pay a freight subsidy to the Irish manufacturers in order to equate the cost of Irish superphosphate with the cost of imported superphosphate delivered to any part of the country.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, in the 1958/59 fertiliser season, a further subsidy of £4 per ton on both imported and home single superphosphate, as announced in the Government's &ldquo;Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo;, became operative. The object of this further subsidy was to achieve a rapid expansion in the use of phosphates on grasslands which is one of the main objectives of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the subsidy scheme, <Col N="1138" /> a substantial increase in home production of superphosphate is developing. Plans for increased production, not only by existing manufacturers but also by new entrants to the industry made it clear to the Government that home production will soon be sufficient to meet the entire home demand for superphosphate, due allowance being made for the increased user of superphosphate by Irish farmers as a result of the subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government also had regard to the threat of dumping in this country of low-priced Continental superphosphates. In these circumstances, while not interfering with the subsidy, which enables the farmers to obtain their supplies at world prices, reduced by the £4 per ton subsidy the Government consider it essential to control the imports of superphosphates in the interests of the Irish superphosphate industry and the Order now before the House for confirmation was made by them.  Under the Order, arrangements will be made to allow for imports of superphosphate to balance any short-fall which may arise until the plans of home manufacturers for increased production of superphosphate come to fruition.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have read the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Order and they will have seen that under Section 4, subsection 2, of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, it is provided that any Quota Order made under the Act shall be operative from the date of its making for a period of 6 months.  It must also be confirmed and approved by each House of the Oireachtas, by Resolution, within that period of six months.  The Order concerned was made by the Government on the 28th July, 1959, and must accordingly be approved by the 28th January, 1960.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Order follows a decision taken by the last Government in 1956, under which it was decided that supplies of superphosphate would be made available to Irish farmers at world prices, it being understood that they should be in the same position vis-a-vis supplies of superphosphate as farmers elsewhere.  I should like to <Col N="1139" /> know from the Minister what quantities are now being provided by home suppliers, and when home production will be sufficient to meet the increased demand?  I should also like him to say the amount of the subsidy which is being paid to the home producers, and also the total of the freight subsidy. I should also like him to say if, in addition to that, there is available the £4 per ton which it was decided would be granted under the decision of the Government last year.</P>
      <P>We are anxious that no restrictions of any kind should be placed in the way of farmers getting superphosphate at equivalent world prices.  At the same time, any encouragement necessary to give increased production, or any facilities necessary to stimulate increased production from home sources, would be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Cosgrave has already pointed out, that there is certain information required.  It is perfectly clear to us that, in the world in which we live, it is economic suicide for this country to tax, or restrict, the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  We are facing a period of very great difficulty on which I do not think it expedient for any of us in this House unduly to dwell, but anyone who looks at the trade returns, with the prospect of a trade deficit of £80,000,000 at the end of this year, and a probable deficit of £20,000,000 in our balance of payments, must view with consternation any possibility of burdens being placed on our agricultural production, which would render it any more difficult than it already is for us to batter our way into world markets, at a price level which would leave our farmers any margin of profit.  It is an alarming and distressing fact that we have got to realise that our agricultural exports in the last two years have been melting away.  We are now exporting neither butter nor bacon, and we are almost driven back to the point that we have nothing to export in that field outside cattle and carcase meat.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that there are about four different Departments dealing with different types of drainage and that there is very often overlapping between these Departments so that one Department does not know what another Department is doing although they are working on the same scheme?

      <P>Drainage is done by the Forestry Department in conjunction with afforestation work; it is done by the Land Commission in conjunction with farm division and other activities which are its responsibility and it would be impracticable to require that <Col N="1142" /> all these types of drainage done in relation to specific activities in different Departments should be undertaken by another Department.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why the case of William Doyle, Knockorolla, Gorey, which was investigated by the Inspector of Agents in April, 1959, in respect of disability benefit was further investigated in June, 1959; if such frequent special investigation by the Inspector of Agents is a usual procedure; and if he will state the cost of each such inspection to the State.</P>

      <P>The case of the insured person referred to in the question was investigated in April, 1959, as a result of information received that he had sought employment at the Avoca Mines and was not unfit for work.  The Inspector making the enquiries was satisfied that no benefit had been wrongfully claimed by the insured person.  An investigation made on the 28th July, 1959, was as a result of further information received that he was working.  The second investigation established that he had been employed on 17th June, 1959, and had in fact been paid a fee of £1 by the Deputy who is responsible for the question.  In consequence an overpayment of disability benefit amounting to 10/2d. was recovered from benefit subsequently due.</P>
      <P>Enquiries are made by an Inspector of Agents when there is a reason to believe that a claimant for disability benefit is working.  Such enquiries are combined by the Inspectors with their normal work of inspecting local Agencies and it is not possible to state the cost of each particular investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On present indications, the deficit in visible trade for the year 1959 is likely to be some £20 million more than for the year 1958.  The greater part of the increase is attributable to exceptional factors such as higher imports of cereals due to last year's bad harvest, and reduced exports of store cattle due to the prolonged drought in Britain. A further part appears to be due to increased capital formation.  So far as increased consumer spending may be involved the situation is being carefully watched.</P>
      <P>Invisible transactions in 1959 cannot yet be fully assessed but I am confident that increased income under this heading will help substantially to offset the trade deficit and thus relieve the balance of payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 21 to 24 together.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a misapprehension as to the legal position in regard to the matter to which these questions refer.</P>
      <P>The relevant Act, the Documents and Pictures (Regulations of Export) Act, 1945, provides that the Minister shall, on application, grant a licence for the export of an article to which the Act applies, and reserves to the Minister the right only to facilities for making photographic copies of an article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of having a valuation made of an article in respect of which a licence is requested does not arise under the Act, nor is there any enabling authority under the Act to prevent the export of such an article once facilities <Col N="1155" /> for photographing it have, if requested, been granted.  It is, having regard to the purpose of the Act, the practice to confine requests for photographing to articles which are of national, historical, genealogical or literary interest.</P>
    <P>An export licence was issued in December, 1956, in respect of paintings which from their description would appear to be what are now known as the Guardí paintings.  This licence was issued to an art dealer.  Normal practice and procedure preclude me from giving the name of the dealer concerned.</P>
    <P>I am aware of no factor in connection with the application for the export licence in question which would call for a public inquiry or the appointment of a Select Committee of the Dáil and Seanad to inquire into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if the licence was given by his Department to the same person as purchased the paintings at Bantry House?  Is it the same person?  Can the Minister give the House that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not come within the legal position.  The legal position as laid out here gives us a right to inspect and photograph, but not to make available to any other section of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that before a licence was given to export such valuable paintings an opportunity should have been given to the National Gallery, that they should have been told: &ldquo;We have an application for a licence for the export of these very valuable paintings.  Are you interested in the purchase of the paintings?&rdquo;, to ascertain whether they were or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister this supplementary question: If there is an obligation under the statute to make a full and frank disclosure to the Minister of the nature of the pictures which it is proposed to export under licence, will the Minister cause inquiry to be made as to whether such a full and frank disclosure was made to him or to his predecessor, so that in considering the issue of a licence, they might be fully informed of the nature of the proposed export?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This question seems to have boomeranged.  Further arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that on 9th May, 1956, I put down a Question in this House to the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy, asking him how a national treasure known as the Monsell Shrine was exported and he told <Col N="1157" /> me it was exported illegally; that it was offered to the National Museum; that he knew it was exported illegally but he did not intend to take any action against the people who exported it.  Is the Minister aware of all this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether at the time the licence was granted for the export of these pictures, it was known that they were by a Venetian painter, Guardí, or whether that fact was discovered after the pictures had been restored elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>From the description given of the pictures in the application, the painter's name was not known at the time.  It was put as a period painting but I could not say what knowledge any particular person had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister: do the provisions of the statute not require that in seeking a licence a full and frank disclosure should be made to the Minister in the application and if the applicant for the licence did in fact know or believe that these were Guardí paintings, was there not a statutory duty upon him to inform the Minister of that fact in making the application for the licence so that the Minister might act on his application in the full knowledge of the facts?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to inform the House that an Agreement has been concluded between the Commissioners of Public Works and the Trustees of the National Gallery of London in regard to the Lane pictures.  In entering into this Agreement the Commissioners have acted as agents for the Government, and the Government will, of course, take whatever steps may be necessary to secure that the Agreement will be carried out on this side.</P>
      <P>A copy of the Agreement is being placed in the Library.  It provides that the 39 Lane pictures will be divided into two groups, which will be lent, in turn, for public exhibition in Dublin for successive periods of five years, over a total period of 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government welcome these arrangements and consider that for the duration of the Agreement they offer a solution of a question which has been the subject of controversy for a long time.  They will not themselves during <Col N="1162" /> the currency of the Agreement initiate, or give support to, any proposal for an alternative arrangement concerning the Lane pictures.</P>
    <P>We trust that the conclusion of this Agreement will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should not let this occasion pass without paying tribute to those whose untiring efforts have helped so greatly to secure the completion of the arrangements that have now been made.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it gives me special pleasure to express the Government's sincere appreciation of the active interest displayed by Deputy John A. Costello in this matter, both during his periods of office as Taoiseach and while in opposition.  As Taoiseach, he availed himself of every opportunity to renew, in a vigorous manner, the representations of previous Governments for the return of the pictures to Ireland.  In opposition, his advice and co-operation have been generously given and have been of inestimable value in the course of the discussions that led to the present Agreement.</P>
    <P>To Professor Thomas Bodkin, the nation owes a debt of gratitude for a lifetime's service for the return of the Lane pictures.  In more recent years, Professor Bodkin has had the co-operation of Lord Pakenham and Lord Moyne, both of whom have been unsparing of time and effort and have given assistance of the utmost value.</P>
    <P>It is right that I should recall also the assistance given, over the years, by many other friends in Britain who have shown a constant anxiety to promote a friendly and equitable settlement of this question.  We are sincerely grateful to them all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great privilege and pleasure to me to join with the Taoiseach in his expression of gratification at the conclusion of an Agreement which will to a considerable extent secure that the wishes of the late Sir Hugh Lane in reference to the group of pictures which he intended to donate to Dublin will be carried into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement offers an honourable compromise in a prolonged and difficult controversy.  We have not secured our <Col N="1163" /> full demands, which could not have been met without the enactment of a statute of the Parliament of Great Britain.  In the absence of such an enactment it is, I think, proper that we should express our appreciation of the manner in which our claims have been met by the Trustees of the National Gallery.  They are confined in their powers by their statutory duties as Trustees and I think it can be said that within the limits of their authority they have gone to the fullest possible extent in making this Agreement.</P>
    <P>Those who have been engaged in this long campaign have been sustained and heartened in their endeavours by the encouragement and help of many people of goodwill in Great Britain, and particularly by the knowledge that in the course of the years there has grown up in Great Britain amongst fair-minded people a public opinion favourable to the return of the Lane pictures to Dublin, founded on the conviction of the justice of our case. To them we should offer our gratitude. They created an atmosphere which enabled the present Agreement to be arrived at.</P>
    <P>While many in Ireland, North and South, and in Great Britain helped our Governments, success has really been achieved by the persistent and tenacious efforts of a few individuals. I join with the Taoiseach in expressing our gratitude for the co-operation of Lord Pakenham and Lord Moyne.  I am grateful to him for his generous expressions in reference to myself. Such little work as I have over the years been enabled to do has been entirely inspired and directed by the unflagging energy and unfaltering hope of the person, above all others, to whom the present successful Agreement is to be attributed&mdash;Doctor Thomas Bodkin.  In his famous codicil, Sir Hugh Lane said: &ldquo;I would like my friend Thomas Bodkin to be asked to help.&rdquo;  Doctor Bodkin felt that it was his mission to see that what he was convinced were Sir Hugh Lane's real wishes were carried into practical effect.  For 44 years, he has borne practically the entire of the <Col N="1164" /> burden.  His books on Hugh Lane, his multitude of letters and articles in a variety of newspapers and periodicals, his lectures, broadcasts, and the seizing of every television opportunity to keep alive our claims have contributed more than anything else to maintaining our case and bringing a great measure of success to our cause.</P>
    <P>I join with the Taoiseach in commending this Agreement for its endorsement by the Dáil and the people. The Irish people should guard these treasures as their own.  Generations to come will derive that cultural and spiritual advantage from the study of the beauty of the pictures which Sir Hugh Lane had intended to bequeath to the people of Dublin as an inestimable gift.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join briefly in recording the satisfaction of this Party that this Agreement has been arrived at with the British Government and to say that I think the whole nation will rejoice that what in the circumstances is a relatively satisfactory Agreement has been arrived at. It does not of course satisfy our full demand that the pictures morally belong to the Irish nation, but, having regard to the many difficulties which confronted the negotiators, I think we can all feel gratified that such a substantial measure of agreement has been achieved.  With the Taoiseach and Deputy Costello, I want to join in paying tribute to Lord Pakenham and Lord Moyne for the magnificent services they have rendered.  I think, however, that no one will deny to Professor Bodkin a due measure of credit for his dauntless struggle over a long period of years to have these pictures returned to the home for which Sir Hugh Lane intended them.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Costello that many high-minded people in Great Britain, not of Irish nationality, have helped in the effort to have these pictures returned to Ireland, being convinced, as they were, of the outstanding merits of the Irish claim.  To them, the Irish nation can now return its sincere thanks.  I am sure the nation will honour to the full the Agreement into which the Government has entered on the people's behalf.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 50) (Superphosphates) Order, 1959.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period in office of the previous Government, it was our objective to secure for the farmers their raw materials at the lowest possible price at which they could be procured.  At the same time, we recognised that there was in existence here a fertiliser industry which could, with advantage, be expanded, albeit that it is an industry the raw materials of which must be imported, as to 80 per cent. from abroad.  The superphospate industry is founded on the import of phosphate rock, mainly from the North African shore.  For the purpose of securing that the farmers of this country would have their raw materials at the lowest possible price, while at the same time, securing that the existing industry, and any development of it, would be protected from adverse consequences, we undertook to see that the domestic industry would be assisted by the Exchequer to meet any competition it was called upon to meet from superphosphate imported from any source.  The net result of that was that the domestic industry collected £200,000 per annum in subsidy to assist it to meet competition from superphosphate from abroad.  That resulted in the farmers getting not only the domestic superphosphate at £200,000 less than they would have had to pay for it, without the arrangement we made, but it also enabled them to buy foreign superphosphate at the lowest possible price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government&mdash;I think wisely&mdash;have superimposed upon that a general subsidy of £4 per ton wheresoever it may come from for the benefit of the farmers, but, so surely as we establish a system whereunder the open competition that has operated to keep down the price of superphosphate over the past three or four years is suspended, the greater part of that subsidy will go into the industrialist's <Col N="1166" /> pocket and not into the pockets of the farmers for whom it was intended.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that this is not an issue between town and country.  This is an issue of survival for all of us.  There is no living creature here, whether he lives in city, town or rural Ireland, whose livelihood and standard of living does not ultimately depend on our success in exploiting the resources of the land.  To exploit these resources effectively, we must use superphosphate of lime.  If we fail to use it in sufficient quantity, the net result of such failure will be a diminution in the national income.  If the price of superphosphate is suffered to rise, it will result inevitably in a reduced user of it and a reduced output from the land.</P>
    <P>There is one national statistic that is susceptible of accurate check, that is, the volume and the value of our agricultural exports.  I admit that there are statistics for national output, gross national product and net national product.  I confess that after 20 years of careful study, I am wholly unable to make head or tail of them.  They seem susceptible to such wide variations and unascertainable elements that they mean nothing to me.  But there is one statistic which is inescapable because it is measured physically at the point of export and the point of import.  That is the volume and the value of our exports.</P>
    <P>In the 10 years between 1947 and 1957, we doubled the volume and we trebled the value of the exports of this country.  If we had not done that, where would we stand today? Those exports consist, as to nearly 80 per cent., of agricultural produce, and the bulk of them is livestock and livestock products, fed on grass.  Remember, they must be fed on grass, because that is the only feeding stuff which can be made available to farmers at a price which will leave them any margin of profit at all on which to survive.  If they are forced over to feeding concentrates, the outlets we have for agricultural exports are not such as to leave our farmers a marginal profit over the feeding of concentrates.  You may take <Col N="1167" /> it, therefore, that an essential raw material of the bulk of our agricultural exports is an increasing quantity of superior quality grass, either growing on the land or in the form of silage or hay.  There is the foundation of the dairy industry.  There is the foundation of the livestock industry.  There is the foundation of the sheep industry, and the wool industry.  All these exports go together to build up the livelihood of everyone in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to warn this House against acceptance of the principle that the raw materials of that fundamental industry should be taxed or restricted in any way.  The Minister makes protestations &mdash;in which, I have no doubt, he believes&mdash;that these quotas can be administered without increasing the cost of our fundamental raw material. I speak with long experience, not only in my capacity as a Minister for Agriculture but also as a merchant handling these materials and selling them to farmers; there is nothing of which I am more convinced than that, if we remove the element of competition in the manufacture and distribution of superphosphate of lime, the price will rise to the farmer so certainly as to morrow's sun will rise upon the new day.  There is no device the Minister can operate to prevent it.  That danger is doubled and trebled under a system by which the Government are providing a subsidy of £4 per ton, for this reason that by and large, single super is selling today in rural Ireland at about £9 a ton, and that is after you have taken the subsidy off.  The current world price at which super would be available to this country would be something in the nature of £12 15/- or £13, but the Government subsidy makes it possible to sell it at £9 per ton.  Next year or the year after&mdash;I should say next year&mdash;trade concessions should make it possible for the fertiliser industry to bring down the price by about 10/- per ton.</P>
    <P>As certainly as we are in this House, if there is no competition to force them to do it, human beings, being what they are, will come to the conclusion that by bringing it down by 2/6 or by <Col N="1168" /> 5/-, they are not doing so badly, and the farmers who are buying at present at £9 per ton, when they know the world price is £13 per ton, will lose the real advantage they should enjoy of a further reduction of 10/- and, in the last stage, we shall find ourselves pouring this subsidy, not through the farmers' hands on to the land, but through the distributors' hands into the manufacturers' hands.</P>
    <P>There is no contest between providing superphosphate to the farmers at the lowest world price available, and preserving our domestic industry in full production.  The only contest is where is the wherewithal to achieve that purpose to come from?  Is it to come out of the exiguous profits of the farmers of the land, or is to come from the Exchequer and be measured by this Parliament, and be known by this Parliament?  I say that to take it from the exiguous profits of the small farmer in a way no one can measure &mdash;because if it is extracted from the price nobody will ever know quite what the volume of the levy is&mdash; means you are putting a burden on that section of the community least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>There are thousands and thousands of small farmers throughout the country for whom a sufficiency of super, at a price they can afford to pay, means the difference between something approaching destitution and a very modest degree of comfort.  If the price of this commodity is suffered to rise to a level at which they cannot afford to use it, bearing in mind the price they will get for their end product, it will reduce the standard of living of everyone who needs it.  Not only will they suffer, but we shall all suffer, because the trade deficit which this year is £80 million&mdash;£80 million sterling is the probable deficit on this year's trading&mdash;will rise in proportion as our agricultural exports fall.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to pause and consider with a trade deficit of £80 million this year, what would that deficit be if we had not doubled the volume, and trebled the value, of our exports between 1947 and 1957?  It would be at a level which would involve an early economic collapse of this community. <Col N="1169" /> I am imploring the House to face the facts.  We have an opportunity and a duty to expand exports so that we may maintain the economic viability of our society, and we can do that.  If we fail, it will be through our own folly.  We have 12 million acres of arable land: we have a splendid population who are eager, willing, and well able to exploit it to the best advantage.  We have the greatest market for agricultural produce outside our door in which to dispose of the output of our land, if we have the intelligence to effect satisfactory trade agreements with 50 million people who are, at present, the greatest food importers in the whole world, and we are the only country in the world within 30 miles of them.  We have free access to that market and every variety of livestock that can be reared on grass, and there is no other country in the world which will be permitted to send livestock on those terms.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is getting away from the Order which deals with the marketing of superphosphates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not, but I wish to conform strictly to your suggestion. Superphosphate is livestock.  Superphosphate is the blood and bones and flesh of livestock.  Withdraw superphosphate and we shall see in this country what we saw in 1947&mdash;the livestock dying of starvation on the grasslands of Ireland, as they ate the grass, because there was no superphosphate in the grass.  We discovered then for the first time, in our midst, a cattle condition unknown possibly except in the veldt of South Africa&mdash;aphosphorosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is difficult for the House to see, as it appears to me, the intimate contact between superphosphate and the standard of living of a labouring man in Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick, but to me the chain is unbroken and as clear as crystal, because in superphosphate, I see the very essence and substance of the livestock industry, and in the livestock industry, I see the means of getting foreign exchange with which to purchase the raw materials to employ men in their own country.  I realise <Col N="1170" /> that the bulk of our income from abroad is the fruit and produce of the prudent user of the land of Ireland which cannot be undertaken without an abundant supply of these materials, our present user of which should be quadrupled and doubled again.  We can never do that if we do not make superphosphate available to our farmers at the lowest price possible. This is a clear departure from that principle and we propose to divide against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Dillon, I am afraid I misunderstood the purport of his remarks because I was going to say I agreed with what he had to say about the necessity for applying fertilisers to our lands and to enable farmers to purchase fertilisers at the cheapest possible rates.</P>
      <P>I said at the outset that this Order was a consequence of the fertiliser subsidy introduced by the leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Agriculture.  As he was aware at the time, not only was the undertaking given that our farmers would procure fertilisers and superphosphates at world prices, but that the Irish manufacturers of superphosphate would be protected against unfair competition from abroad, or from ordinary competition from abroad, by the payment of these subsidies and concomitant with that decision was the suspension of the 20 per cent. duty on imported superphosphate.  The object of that was obvious&mdash;to ensure that an element of competition would be maintained. In furtherance of that decision, the Government, following the announcement in the White Paper, introduced an extra subsidy of £4 a ton.  These two decisions taken together naturally not only induced greater production by existing manufacturers of superphosphate but the possibility of greater production by new entrants into this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net result is that, apart altogether from the increased user of superphosphate that the farmers are undertaking and I hope will continue to undertake, there will be an increased volume of production from our own factories. There is, too, as Deputy Dillon <Col N="1171" /> knows better than I do, a great interest in our uses of fertiliser in general by Continental interests even to the extent of dumping or selling at dumped prices their produce in this country.  This was taking place to a certain extent and, as a result of all these factors&mdash;the increased user followed by the subsidy; the increased production induced by the subsidy and the desire of foreign producers to maintain their hold on this market even to the extent of dumping&mdash;in the interests of home producers and without prejudice in any way to the utilisation of superphosphate and the making of it available at world prices by Irish farmers, the Quota Order was made last July.</P>
    <P>The Quota Order provides for the importation of superphosphate, again at world prices, to the extent that home manufacture will fall short of the demand. Even if home manufacture does not fall short of the demand but meets it in full we still have the means of ascertaining world prices and that will be the measure of the subsidy <i>vis-á-vis</i> the cost of home production.  That yardstick will always be available to us irrespective of whether we produce as much as or even more than the home market can absorb.</P>
    <P>I think the opposition to approval of this Order is ill-advised having regard to the undertakings given that Irish farmers will continue and have continued, notwithstanding the making of this Order to receive superphosphate at world prices, less the further £4 per ton subsidy.  The suggestion Deputy Dillon makes is that that subsidy will ultimately find itself going not, as he says himself, through the farmers' hands on to the land and so increasing their own production but into the pockets of the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied there is available to my Department the means of very close scrutiny of the costs of production by Irish manufacturers and there will always be available to us the information as to world prices.  Therefore, under these circumstances, I cannot see the subsidy now being made available abused.  I am not making this as a plea to the main Opposition Party to, perhaps, change their attitude <Col N="1172" /> but it must be remembered that our fertiliser industry provides direct employment for no fewer than 1,500 people.  The prospect, having regard to and as a result of all the arrangements now being made, is that with the sub-sidisation of superphosphate this employment content will increase considerably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon rightly commented that phosphate rock is the main raw material of superphosphate, whether single or triple.  There is also another necessary raw material, sulphuric acid produced from sulphur or pyrites. In this country, we are in a position to produce big quantities of pyrites.  The prospect is very much there that we can utilise a further raw material from our lands for the production of this&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You can make it out of raw materials available at Avoca, if you can get the boys to use it but it has not been possible up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now&mdash;but we can always try to induce people to use it perhaps by advising better methods of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect is very much there that we can use our own pyrites.  I do not want to delay any further on that.  I would say that the opposition to this is ill-advised.  The fears expressed by Deputy Dillon are hardly likely, in fact they are almost certainly not likely, to materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me a few questions which I should like to answer.  He asked if I could give him the amount of the subsidy paid in the years since the subsidy system was introduced and if I could break down the ordinary subsidy and the transport subsidy.  Unfortunately, I cannot do that but I can give him the full figures. In 1956-57, £105,000 was paid.  In 1957-58, £140,000 was paid.  In 1958-59, £260,000 was paid.  That represented, roughly, what the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, an average of £200,000 a year.  In fact, his figure was slightly above average. Added to that is the £4 a ton subsidy <Col N="1173" /> under the economic programme.  That amounted, in the first year, namely, 1958-59, to £1,500,000.  If you add the £260,000 paid under the prior subsidy scheme to that £1,500,000 you will get a total of £1,760,000 paid by way of subsidy on phosphatic fertilisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the £1,500,000 not the money provided and not the actual money spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The money provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it was all spent.  In further answer to Deputy Cosgrave, over the same period, home production in 1956-57 amounted to 152,000 tons; in 1958-59, 200,000 tons, representing an increase of 48,000 tons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that employment in this industry has expanded to 1,500 persons without any Quota and with the tariff removed?  Why does the Minister think the Control Order is necessary to maintain expansion in the light of past experience that in fact we expanded employment in this industry to 1,500 persons without tariff or quota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reason is this.  If I may go back to the mainspring of this whole exercise&mdash;the making available at world prices of superphosphate to Irish farmers&mdash;<Col N="1174" /> world prices envisage prices arrived at as a result of efficient methods of production and fair competition.  The necessity for the Quota Order was that unfair competition in regard to the sale of superphosphates to this country was not only envisaged but was being experienced.  That was the reason for the Quota Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that the Irish farmer must pay more for his superphosphate than he would have to pay if the Quota Order did not operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in replying originally it was in order to defeat the plans for increased production of superphosphate in this country that the dumping action was being taken from other countries.  The possibility was that once the projected increase in production here was killed import prices would revert to what they had been before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know that our fertiliser manufacturers have to be constantly on the alert against the possibility of substantial dumping of fertiliser from Holland, where there is a very substantial surplus and where fertiliser is produced under cheaper conditions than here? If that dumping from Holland takes place sufficient to kill the Irish industry, it is the Dutch who will fix the price of fertiliser in future.  We must remember that we can have our fertiliser from Holland and have no fertiliser industry.  If we want a fertiliser industry with Irishmen working in it, we must protect the home manufacture and there is no alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has said that fertiliser can be manufactured much more cheaply in Holland than here.  That is admitted, and we <Col N="1175" /> are quite prepared to continue our subsidisation scheme having regard to these prices but as soon as they cease to be fair prices and come around to being dumped prices, then we have to take action other than simply providing a subsidy.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday, I asked the Minister for Health whether, in accordance with the public undertakings he had given, he had yet had discussions with representatives of the Irish Medical Association.  In the course of his reply, the Minister referred to a letter of his of 13th March of this year in which he had expressed his willingness to meet the Irish Medical Association, provided they removed what he termed a ban on certain hospital appointments.  The Minister went on to say that, on 23rd May last, the Association, far from withdrawing this ban, published a notice seeking to extend the ban to other medical posts.  The Minister said that on 13th June the Medical Association issued a statement disclaiming the existence of any ban and said that shortly afterwards he was invited by the Irish Medical Association to be their guest at their annual dinner in Killarney and that on this occasion he again expressed his readiness to meet the Association, provided this ban was removed.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that subsequently he had further evidence of a continuance of what he termed a ban and accordingly the conditions were not such as to permit him meeting a deputation from the Irish Medical Association.  It transpired, in reply to supplementary questions directed to the Minister, that what he described as a ban was a notice published in the newspapers advising doctors who intended to apply for certain posts to discuss the matter with the Irish Medical Association.  The Minister has called that a ban and since the Minister is in charge of his own terminology, the absurd position now appears to be that the Minister for Health in Ireland is not prepared to discuss with the representatives of a great profession matters which should be matters of common concern in relation to health.  I assert that that situation is intolerable and that whether the Minister wishes it or not, it will have to be changed and changed forthwith.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is possible to have a continuance of any cold warfare between the Minister for Health and the Irish Medical Association.  If that is to continue, then the only result will be a stultifying of efforts which were being made to improve the standard of health services.  The Irish Medical Association is a lawful association; a coming together of members of a common profession in accordance with their rights under our Constitution.  I would remind the Minister that under our Constitution the right to co-operate lawfully is preserved and guaranteed.  The Irish Medical Association are such a body and as such a body, are entitled to advise their members on terms and conditions applicable to different medical posts.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the Minister would deny them that right.  I doubt if any person interested in democratic principles would deny them that right.  I doubt if any member of this House, which is a House freely elected to preserve the rights of the people, would deny any lawful association the right to look after the interests of their members. I suggest to the Minister that he should recognise that this lawful association is exercising a constitutional right which it has and that he, and only he, can cut the Gordian knot which he himself has created.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that at the moment&mdash;I do not intend to make a bad situation any worse&mdash;in the operation of the country's health services there are grave problems to be faced.  I shall only instance the fact that in our local authority hospitals there are at present first-rate men, carefully appointed through the Appointments Commission machinery, to carry out various operations and do the surgical work required.  These men are expected to be 24 hours on duty; under the conditions now obtaining they are expected to be available to give of their best to help the patients every hour of every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of my own knowledge&mdash;not from the I.M.A.&mdash;that some of these highly-trained, highly-qualified county <Col N="1179" /> surgeons are on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  They have no assistance and cannot get it.  It is impossible at present to provide any relief for them. That is one of the problems that urgently requires discussions between the Minister and the I.M.A.  There are other problems of which the Minister is aware and which I do not intend to detail, problems affecting other medical practitioners whose services are necessary for the proper functioning of the health services here and these things urgently require the Minister's attention.  I suggest that in the interests of the country itself he should forget his own dignity in this matter and realise that someone has to take the first step.</P>
    <P>I feel this is a situation which the Minister seems to have permitted to arise.  Certainly, when the Minister resumed his present office, conditions as between his Department and the I.M.A. were not as they are now. While all the problems had not been overcome and all the difficulties had not been cleared, at least there was a feeling that those difficulties might gradually be surmounted.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that in 1956 when it was possible by agreement to ensure that the health services would operate under the Health Act, not merely on paper but in fact, that should have been the beginning of a new era so far as the Minister's Department and the Association outside were concerned.  I regret very much that we are now faced with a situation in which the Minister is isolating himself in the Custom House, issuing bulletins and statements wrapped around with his own dignity, and he is not prepared to discuss matters of public importance with representatives of the medical profession. Such a situation is likely to lead to anything by frustration and lowering of health standards.</P>
    <P>I am raising this, not as a spokesman of anyone except those who elected me.  I raise it as a person concerned to improve the standards of health services and I have no other reason.  I have had no discussions whatever with the I.M.A. or anybody <Col N="1180" /> concerned with them and I have no way of raising it other than this and I do so with the plea that the Minister would be&mdash;as I am sure he is&mdash; big enough to realise that this situation if not attended to and relieved now will only lead to much trouble and great harm in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think nothing is further from the facts than the impression that Deputy O'Higgins has given us.  His speech has been just a rehash of what he said on the last two occasions when this matter was discussed.  I should like to point out that we had all this out before the Summer recess and the Minister at that time pointed out that, even if he wished to meet the I.M.A., the law as framed at present would not permit him to discuss certain matters with them.  If they have complaints, as evidently they have, on certain matters governing the conditions of appointment and salary in regard to specific posts, it is mandatory on them to meet first the County Managers' Association. On the 12th June, 1958, they met the County Managers' Association and the agreement then made was that the meeting would be adjourned, that they would report back with certain recommendations, and that each manager would go to his respective council and put his proposals before them.  The only function of the Minister was to sanction those increases or turn them down.  Therefore, in regard to these functions, this is not a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think the Minister overstepped the mark in that he certainly displayed great latitude and tolerance. We should go back to the matter mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins, the I.M.A. function in Killarney on the 1st July last.  &ldquo;The man who came to dinner&rdquo; was the Minister for Health; he travelled to Killarney to the I.M.A. annual dinner.  Surely the House will agree that a Minister so fully occupied in a Department such as that of Health and Social welfare displayed feelings of co-operation by travelling to Killarney? Surely he displayed an anxiety that relations between his Department and the I.M.A. should be more harmonious? Evidently, as he said at the <Col N="1181" /> time in his speech in Killarney as reported in the Press, he was most anxious to come to an understanding with them.  I shall quote from his speech at the I.M.A. dinner:</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his agreement to meet a deputation from the I.M.A. on the following terms:</P>
    <P>Speaking as the guest of honour of the Irish Medical Association at their annual dinner in Killarney, the Minister indicated his readiness to participate in a discussion far removed from trivial.  Afterwards, we saw a letter in the public Press signed by one Dr. Noel Reilly, medical secretary to the Irish Medical Association, which was a copy of an open letter sent to the Taoiseach saying they were compelled to write to him, due to the failure of the Minister to meet them on certain matters.  It was not bad enough to insult the deputy Prime Minister of this country.  It was not bad enough to insult the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, but nowadays if one writes to the Taoiseach, on the same day as you drop the letter into the post, you write a letter to the three daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>If that is not lack of courtesy by these gentlemen, I do not know what is.  It would certainly arouse bitterness on my part, but, notwithstanding that, the most disquieting part was the spate of abuse of the Minister by the Irish Medical Medical Association.  Despite that, the Minister publicly announced his intention to meet them but their reaction could be summed up by Jeremiah: &ldquo;The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.&rdquo;  That is about the height of it.</P>
    <P>The time has come when I would ask the Minister to set up a judicial inquiry.  Before the summer recess, he might well have been driven to do so. Deputy T.F. O'Higgins thinks there is nothing to do but ring up the secretary of the I.M.A., that he will attend, and then all will be well.  He says that someone must take the first step.  Did the Minister not take the first step at the dinner in Killarney?</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins also says that the word &ldquo;ban&rdquo; is a piece of <Col N="1182" /> imagination in the Minister's mind, yet the Association themselves agreed at one time to suspend their disapproval of certain key positions.  Was that a ban or not?  Deputy O'Higgins also suggests that the Association notice in the public press, asking members not to accept certain posts without prior consultation, was purely for the purpose of discussing these posts with the Irish Medical Association.  The I.M.A. themselves expressed their disapproval of these posts and, therefore, they were going to inform the individuals who would approach them of their disapproval.</P>
    <P>Back on 2nd June last, Deputy O'Higgins to show his inconsistency, when Surgeon Hurley was removed from his post in Mallow said: &ldquo;I do not wish to express any view on the inquiry which the Minister has conducted because I do not know the facts.&rdquo;  Yet, for the past 10 minutes, not knowing the facts, he went into detailed discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear.  Is the Deputy replying for the Minister?  I understood this was a half-hour debate.</P>

      <P>It is a half-hour debate and only ten minutes are left.  I was about to remind Deputy O'Malley of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just concluding. I was reminding Deputy O'Higgins of his inconsistency when this matter was previously introduced.  I would ask the Minister to set up a judicial inquiry.  This body known as the Irish Medical Association does not, in fact, represent the vast majority of its members and does not carry out their wishes.  Its letters in the public Press and general conduct are not in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the members of that Association.  The great body of doctors throughout the country are respected and highly honoured members of the community, and I know several country members of the Irish Medical Association who are appalled by the conduct of this small clique. They are a small politically-biassed clique and they have selected the Minister for Health as their target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> In conclusion, I think the best summary of their action was given in a leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i>, a paper I do not always agree with, when it said of the boycott: &ldquo;It will deserve and receive just as much sympathy as complacency and arrogance usually command.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins in his opening remarks said that the I.M.A. has the constitutional right to advise its members on the terms and conditions of appointments. I am not denying the right of any body to advise its members as to their conduct but there rests upon the Minister, the person who occupies the position of a Minister responsible for any Department, the responsibility to ensure that the position which he holds on behalf of the people, and which has also its constitutional rights and its duties, is fully maintained.  I have the right and also the responsibility to see that no organisation in this country will succeed in its endeavour to prevent the proper functioning of any Act of the Oireachtas.  I am convinced, by my knowledge of what has happened in this regard since the middle of 1958, that the purpose of certain members of the I.M.A. is to bring the administration of the Health Acts into disrepute with the general public and to prevent them from functioning properly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to public undertakings which I have given.  I am prepared to stand over them.  They were not unconditional undertakings. There was a condition attached to my offer to receive a deputation from the I.M.A. and it was that the ban which they had imposed, the proscription which they had imposed upon applications for certain posts, should be withdrawn, because that ban was imposed without due reason, without any justification and without prior notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has also suggested that it is merely a question of nomenclature, so far as I am concerned.  He has referred to the act of the I.M.A. as &ldquo;what I have termed a ban.&rdquo;  The designation of the action which the I.M.A. has taken did not, of course, <Col N="1184" /> originate with me.  I have here the official report of the proceedings of the Central Council of the Association held on 23rd April, 1959, and published in the June issue of the Journal of the Association.  It refers to &ldquo;the proscribed posts&rdquo; and to &ldquo;proscription of posts.&rdquo;  The official report of the proceedings of the annual general meeting on 30th June, reported and quoted in the August issue of the Journal, referred to a resolution from a branch as follows: &ldquo;This branch is of opinion the time is opportune for revising the Association's policy concerning (a) the ban on medical appointments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So there is a ban.  I have further evidence here, but I do not wish to utilise the time left to me to go into it, showing that, in fact, there was and is a ban.  I informed the Association that so long as that ban was persisted in, I would not meet them. They published a letter disclaiming that there was any ban.  Acting on that, I indicated that, since there was no ban, I was prepared to meet them but evidence came to me later, and continues to come, to indicate quite clearly that there was a ban and that it remains.</P>
    <P>I went down to the function to which Deputy O'Malley has just referred; but I went down there under conditions and as a result of assurances which I had received from prominent members of the Association.  Here it is necessary for me to read an extract from a letter which I wrote to one of these gentlemen, one of the gentlemen who was responsible for the insulting reference to myself which was published recently.</P>
    <P>Let me say this.  I am not dealing with this as a personal matter.  I am dealing with this issue as a Minister of State charged to protect the prerogatives of a Minister on behalf of the public.  Here is what I did write to one of the gentlemen who has had the audacity to refer in the newspapers to my attendance at this dinner.  One thing I have learned as a result is to beware of dining officially with doctors in future.  I said this:</P>
    <P>Dear So-and-So: Further to our conversation at the Reception in honour of the President on Thursday <Col N="1185" /> night last regarding my acceptance of the invitation of the Irish Medical Association to their Annual Dinner at Killarney on the night of Wednesday next, 1st proximo...</P>
    <P>my letter was dated the 26th June&mdash;</P>
    <P>However, as I was unable to attend the similar function last year, but mainly as an earnest of my desire for good relations between the profession and the Department of Health in the interests of the general good, I would like very much to attend this year.</P>
    <P>The position, however, is not without difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Association has assured me and the general public that there is no ban or boycott on medical posts in local authority hospitals.  On the basis of that declaration and accepting it as unequivocally and definitively expressing the considered view of the Irish Medical Association, I agreed to meet a deputation from the Association in an effort to arrive at a solution of certain matters at issue between us.  Recent events at Mallow, however, seem to belie the statement that there is no boycott. An effort is being made to clear up the situation there and if a satisfactory settlement can be arrived at in the next day or two, I shall ask the Taoiseach to make arrangements for my absence and will have pleasure in accepting the invitation to the dinner.</P>
    <P>A day or two before I was due to depart for this function, the issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association appeared and in that issue, instead of the usual editorial, they had cribbed an editorial which had appeared, I think, a fortnight before in one of the provincial newspapers and published it as their own editorial.  I immediately indicated that in those circumstances I was proposing not to attend the dinner of the Irish Medical Association.  I received certain reassurances, however, and in consequence I wrote again to my correspondent and said:</P>
    <P>Thanks for your note and for the assurances which it gives.  I confess that, were it not for these and those which the Association's President Elect, Dr. Dolan, also gave me on <Col N="1186" /> Saturday evening, I should have been slow to make the long journey to Killarney and back this week in view of the Editorial in the July issue of your Journal.</P>
    <P>I was the more annoyed by the ill-timed reprint of <i>The Nationalist</i> editorial in the Journal, as in the spirit of my letter of the 15th June to the I.M.A.  I had with some restraint refrained from replying to it. However, Mr. Murray has told me of the discussion which he had with Dr. Reilly and your good self, from which I gather that, being gravel'd for lack of matter, the Editor of the Journal had to find something to fill the page.  Accordingly, as I am a good-natured man, I am looking forward to being with you and your colleagues on Wednesday.  My wife is coming also&mdash;she feels that her presence will safeguard me from the lancets and scalpels of the brotherhood.</P>
    <P>Those are the conditions upon which I went to this dinner at Killarney.  Notwithstanding the letter to which Deputy O'Malley has referred, I am still prepared to meet the members of the Irish Medical Association, but only because I put the public interest above my own private and personal position.  Indeed, if that letter had referred to me in my ordinary capacity as a private citizen in this State, I should refuse ever again to speak to any person responsible for it.  In spite of all this, I am still prepared to meet a deputation from the Irish Medical Association, provided that they honour their word, that they make good their disclaimers and withdraw the ban upon these posts.</P>
