      <P>It is very simple.  This amendment was accepted by the Seanad because certain doubts were raised with regard to the rights of the Librarian and Assistant Librarian to continuity of employment.  They, as the House is aware, are officers at the moment but will cease to be officers when the new Bill comes in.  The Seanad were afraid that Section 10 did not exactly cover them and to remove any doubt this has been put in.</P>

      <P>It is desirable it should be passed quickly.  The effect of the motion passed yesterday is to bring the new tax regulations into operation on the 1st January.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The right of the Minister for Transport and Power under the existing Act is to adjust the authorised weight of vehicles in case <Col N="795" /> of hardship and it would require the exercise of a personal decision on each licence.  In view of the change that is being made in relation to the method of assessing the weight of a lorry for tax purposes, it is necessary to have an omnibus adjustment of lorry weights for the purpose of avoiding the situation under which licensed hauliers might be acting illegally.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening statement on this Bill I confined myself to giving a very general summary of the provisions of the Bill which I mentioned was of a detailed nature.  I then said that the discussions on the merits or demerits of particular proposals contained in the Bill would have to await the Committee Stage.  I mentioned that the primary matters which the Government had in mind were: (1) the abolition of <i>bona fide</i> hours; (2) the necessity for uniformity in opening hours in all parts of the country; (3) the adjustment of the opening hours on week days to meet the reasonable needs of the public, and (4) the question of general Sunday opening in place of the <i>bona fide</i> hours and the hours of opening granted under the area exemption orders.</P>
      <P>There seems to be general acceptance in the House that the <i>bona fide</i> trade should be abolished.  With the exception of one or two Deputies I did not hear one voice raised in favour of its retention.  On the question of uniformity of hours, I pointed out in my opening statement that the Government regarded it as essential that the hours during which a licensed premises could remain open for the sale of drink should be the same for all parts of the country whether in the cities, towns, holiday resorts or rural areas.  I pointed out that if we were to have a differential in the hours of trading as between cities and rural areas it would result in a re-creation of the old situation of people travelling to get a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, despite all I said along those lines, the opening speaker for Fine Gael, Deputy Cosgrave, made a plea for later hours in rural areas than for county boroughs and for special <Col N="797" /> provisions for later opening in tourist resorts.  It is plain that Deputy Cosgrave is endeavouring to preserve the <i>bona fide</i> trade in substance while not actually saying so, in so many words.  However, he was repudiated almost immediately by Deputy Blowick who said that he was glad that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic was being done away with, by Deputy Giles who said he would be glad to see it &ldquo;wiped out&rdquo; and later, again, by Deputy Lindsay, who condemned it whole heartedly.</P>
    <P>I would have expected that Deputy Dillon, as Leader of the Opposition, would say what he felt on each one of the four primary principles of the Bill but he did not give us any enlightenment. He did say that the Fine Gael Party must vote against the Bill in its present form because they feel that its proposals in respect of the opening hours are not appropriate.  The Deputy did not say in what respect they were not appropriate.  It makes me begin to think that this is the old Fine Gael tactic of being all things to all men or, as they say in the country, running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.  Deputy Cosgrave seems to be in favour of measures to keep the <i>bona fide</i> traffic alive while Deputy Lindsay condemns it unreservedly. Deputy Giles says he is satisfied that the Minister has made a good effort to improve matters while Deputy Ryan explains that Fine Gael will be voting against the Bill on the Second Stage because they believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Ryan is in any doubt he should consult Deputy Belton who is a member of the licensed trade and who said in Column 128:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Publicans and their assistants are servants of the public.  They are in the catering trade and must work and carry on their employment when the rest of the people have their leisure or are on holidays.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Also, at Column 123, he asked for opening hours on Sundays from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  On the other hand Deputy T. Lynch suggests that in no circumstances <Col N="798" /> should there be opening after 7 p.m.  What I want to know is where do they stand in regard to this Bill at all?  Have they made up their minds as to whether the week-day hours and the Sunday hours should spread over this or that period?  I shall not go into the merits or demerits of those matters until the Committee Stage but I want to say now that the Government accept the Commission's majority report that the present closing hours on week-days in the county boroughs are too early and that they are satisfied that the hours proposed in the Bill are reasonable.  The Government are satisfied that there must be no differential between the closing hours inside and outside the county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies to the Sunday hours.  Whatever is decided must be the same for all parts of the country.  There can be no question of a differential in the hours between certain areas which would simply result in a re-creation of the <i>bona fide</i> trade in another way.  While I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of particular proposals at this stage or why the Bill is silent on some matters which on superficial examination may appear to require amendment of the law, I feel that I must correct some misconceptions which some Deputies appear to have so as to save trouble later on.</P>
    <P>The absence from the Bill of any special provision for the benefit of six-day licensees has come in for a great deal of criticism.  One might be justified in thinking from what some Deputies have said that it is a simple matter to provide here that all six-day licences should become seven-day licences overnight and that nobody would be the sufferer.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, the matter has been considered by two licensing commissions, one in 1925 and the other in 1957, and neither commission could see their way to support the case made for the six-day licensee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but will the Deputy tell me how it affects the six-day licensees?  Will the Deputy tell me in what respect this will worsen the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The seven-day licensee at least had the right to cater for the <i>bona fide</i> trade and under area exemption orders.  The six-day licensee had not that right unless he did so illegally.  It may be that they were doing so illegally, and that is the only way I can see in which they can be affected by this Bill.  If they were to act legally, then their premises should have been closed during the Sunday <i>bona fide</i> hours while the seven-day licensees were open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The seven-day licensees were open only for persons who were travelling and who could call in to the seven-day premises on their journey.  But it was perfectly clear that no resident of the locality could have recourse to the local seven-day licensed house.  The Minister has now proposed to have Sunday opening, with the result that the seven-day man is open for two periods on Sunday legally and there is a padlock on the door of the six-day man, which will operate ultimately to close him down altogether.</P>

      <P>Granted what the Deputy says is correct, but we have had Deputy after Deputy telling us that the <i>bona fide</i> trade was in full operation for all who wanted a drink. The people from this town went to that town and got as much drink as they liked as <i>bona fide</i> travellers, and passed the people from the other town on their way to get as much as they required.</P>

      <P>I have to depend completely on information I am given.  Most of that information I have received in the House and from my own Party, who discussed this Bill at length.  I presume all these matters were examined by the two commissions and they came to the conclusion that six-day licensees should not, by a stroke of the pen, be turned into seven-day licensees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But does the Minister not appreciate that the two earlier commissions were dealing with an entirely different state of affairs because they recommended there should be no Sunday opening?  It is only in the light of the Minister's decision to have Sunday opening that this proposal to permit the seven-day man to open freely for local trade will operate to destroy the six-day man. So long as there was not Sunday opening, this dilemma did not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to continue, perhaps we may get somewhere.  The 1957 Commission specifically referred, at paragraph 40, page 19, of their report, to their decision not to make representations on behalf of the six-day licensees. There was a unanimous decision of the 21 members of the Commission on that question.  Deputy Blowick has purported to give the circumstances under which six-day licences were granted.  He says, at Volume 178, column 88, of the Dáil Debates:</P>
      <P>This idea of the six-day licence has come down to us from the old days when the landlord or some agent of his had charge of these premises.  If he did not like the colour of your eyes he gave you a six-day licence; if he took a greater dislike to you he did not give you a licence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know where Deputy Blowick got his information?  His <Col N="801" /> explanation is something of a surprise to me.  I suggest that the six-day licence did not originate in that way at all.  There was a time when the only licences which existed here were seven-day licences.  That was changed in 1872.  In 1878 a law was brought in to close public houses outside the county boroughs on Sundays, because of the development of drink throughout the country and a great number of people then opted to apply for six-day licences.  That is how six-day licences originated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are that, by the Licensing Act of 1872, on the occasion of an application for a new licence, or the transfer or renewal of a licence, for consumption on the premises, the applicant could ask the Court to insert a Sunday-closing condition in the licence, whereupon the licence holder would become entitled to a remission of one-seventh of his ordinary excise duty.  The Sunday closing condition could be inserted only at the instance of the applicant himself and thenceforward the licence could only be renewed as a 6-day licence.  The object of the provision seems to have been to induce licensees, of whom there were a great deal too many, to give up trading on Sundays.  At the time there was general opening on Sundays from 2 to 9 p.m. in towns with a population exceeding 5,000 and from 2 to 7 p.m. elsewhere and there was no restriction on sales to <i>bona fide</i> travellers.</P>
      <P>Six years later the Sunday Closing Act of 1878 forbade the general opening of licensed premises outside the four county boroughs and that restriction has remained up to the present, sales being limited to <i>bona fide</i> travellers and, since 1927, to persons entitled to be served on special occasions by virtue of area exemption orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before 1872, there was no such thing <Col N="802" /> as a 6-day licence.  After 1878, there was no such thing as general opening outside the four county boroughs and, in consequence, a great number of applicants for new licences or for the renewal of existing licences asked the courts to insert a Sunday-closing condition in their licences in order to be entitled to get a remission of the one-seventh of the excise duty for which the 1872 Act provided.</P>
    <P>I feel that the 6-day licensees have no right to conversion.  A great number of these premises have been bought or sold or changed hands as 6-day premises during the past 87 years. They have enjoyed remission of one-seventh excise duty because of closing on Sundays while their competitors, the 7-day licensees, have carried on Sunday trading under provisions relating to <i>bona fide</i> trading and area exemption orders, paying the full excise duty.</P>
    <P>There are so many unwanted publichouses that quite a number have been voluntarily closing their doors and going out of business.  In 1925, there were 10,981 full publicans' licences; now there are 9,880, that is, 1,000 less of which 299 were abolished on compensation. There were 1,624 six-day licences; now there are 1,187, over 400 less.  There were 477 six-day early-closing licences; now there are 255, over 200 less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a great many less after this legislation passes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there would still be adequate facilities for the general public if 3,000 or 4,000 publichouses doing a mixed business were to stop selling drink.  A large number of them would be willing to sell their licences, no doubt, if they were made a reasonable offer.  That was proved some 30 years ago when 299 publicans surrendered their licences on being paid compensation. For every licence that was surrendered there were 10 on offer.  I want to impress upon Deputies that, for every licence that was surrendered, there were 10 on offer.  Some of the prices paid were well below £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what to do about <Col N="803" /> the 6-day licences has been the subject of a great deal of consideration by the Government.  It seems to us, as it seemed to the two licensing commissions, to be eminently reasonable that if these traders want a share in the pool, a share to which they have no right in equity, they must be asked to contribute something and what they are asked to do by way of contribution is to extinguish 7-day licences, of which there are thousands too many in the country.  I have heard no attempt to refute this argument in principle. What I have heard is a suggestion that the existing provision is insufficient in that the cost of a 7-day licence in certain parts of the country is very high.</P>
    <P>I must say that, up to now, I have taken the view that the area within which the seven-day licence may be extinguished, an area which can extend over several counties, was sufficiently large to give any six-day licensee who cared to avail himself of the provisions an opportunity of getting a licence at a moderate cost. Deputy Seán Flanagan, however, has mentioned actual purchase prices in recent times in County Mayo and has drawn attention to the fact that the choice there is limited by the fact that Mayo is a seaboard county and the are comprising a district court district and its adjoining district is not as large as it would be in the Midlands. In one or two other counties, also, it is possible that there might be difficulty in acquiring a seven-day licence within the prescribed area except at a price which licensees generally could not afford.  As the Taoiseach has told the House, the Government are prepared to look into this matter again to see what might be done to ease the situation. At the moment, we have in mind to widen the area within which a seven-day licence might be purchased so as to include any part of the State and, moreover, we hope to simplify and to cheapen the procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton asked if there was a mistake in the drafting of Section 5, which makes no reference to midnight as the limit for drinks with meals. There is no mistake.  Section 4 of the <Col N="804" /> Bill prohibits the sale of drink before 10.30 a.m. or after 11.30 p.m. on any week-day in the months of June to September and 11 p.m. in the rest of the year.  Section 5 provides exemption for hotels and restaurants serving drinks with meals after 11.30, or 11 p.m., as the case may be, on any weekday and the clue to the mystery which seems to have baffled Deputy Belton is that each day, naturally, ends at midnight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett and Deputy McGilligan asked about the meaning of &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo;.  All I can say in that respect is that the law as it stands in relation to the serving of drink in hotels or restaurants in county boroughs during the closing hour of 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. has always been there.  I do not think it could be defined: it is a question of fact which the court would have to decide on if there were a prosecution.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement I mentioned that the provisions of Section 19 of the Bill were of some significance. I pointed out that there were a great number of premises up and down the country which had been licensed at the time of the passing of the 1902 Act, the licences of which have not been resumed, presumably because the premises were doing very little business.  I stated that under existing law the licences for these premises could be re-created at any time.  Deputy McGilligan queried that.  He said, at column 408, Volume 178 No. 3 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I had always thought that the law was that if there was a licence dormant, which did not trade during 12 months, that licence was lost.  It is true, it could be revived on an application to the court but the courts were very slow to grant such applications.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries in the meantime and I have been informed that Deputy McGilligan is not correct; that in actual fact the courts readily grant such applications.  An inquiry in this regard in 1957 revealed that some 160 applications had been granted in the previous eight years. <Col N="805" /> That is the suggestion that I have been making to all those people who came to me and pleaded their case in respect of being changed from a six-day to a seven-day licence.  I am perfectly satisfied that if these people exert themselves and go out of their way to seek one of the redundant licences, or even one of the lapsed licences that can be revived, they will succeed.</P>
    <P>Section 19 now provides that after an interim period of two years after the passing of the Act any premises, the licence of which had lapsed for five years, cannot get a new licence on the grounds that it was licensed in 1902.  The interim period of two years is provided in order to avoid doing an injustice to people who for one reason or another allowed their licence to lapse temporarily.</P>
    <P>Some criticism was made of Section 30 of the Bill which proposes to withdraw the application of the Weights and Measures Acts from beer bottles.</P>

      <P>May I say right away that I see no force whatever in the case made by this Association?  At one and the same time they admit that no change is being made in the law which requires beer bottles to be one of three standard sizes but they assert that, because of the absence of an official stamp, manufacturers of beer bottles will not be in a position to refuse to supply smaller bottles.

How can the question of scrapping existing stocks of bottles arise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The law will provide that you must not sell stout in quantities other than one-third of a pint, a half-pint or a pint but it does not say that if you strike out the existing provisions there are not to be bottles of that size.  There are already bottles in circulation which are called 17's and 18's, that is, 17 or 18 of them to a gallon.  None but the most practised eye can tell the difference between them.  They look almost exactly the same as the half-pint bottle. Unless they are stamped they are not half-pint bottles.  I can show the Minister the three bottles but I am precluded by the Rules of Order from showing them in the House.  No one but an expert could visually detect the difference between them.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Association admit that there is no similar control of milk bottles.  That is a fact.  They argue that as milk is cheaper, the incentive to fraud is not so great.  Since publicans do not manufacture their own bottles and since it is not, I assume, suggested that the Irish Glass Bottle Company will enter into a conspiracy with individual publicans to manufacture bottles of a size which cannot legally be used, I do not see where the temptation to fraud can arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have the suggestion that that is so examined. Besides, I am saying here that the Association should not have confined their comparison merely to milk bottles.  There is no control either upon soft drink bottles, which the members of this Association use.  Is it suggested that dishonest publicans have taken advantage of this situation to use special bottles to defraud the public?  Soft drinks, like milk, are generally cheaper than stout, but the difference is not all that much, especially at public house prices for soft drinks which, as is well known, are well above the average.  Deputies may ask if the comparison with soft drink bottles is valid, why were the Weights and Measures Acts applied to beer bottles in the first place? <Col N="808" /> The answer to that is that the application of the Weights and Measures Acts was not intended when the Order standardising the size of the bottles was made in 1925.  It had been thought by all concerned, including the Department of Justice, that the Order would simply mean that the trade would have to give up using or planning to use bottles with capacities of one-fourteenth, onefifteenth, or one-eighteenth of a gallon, and that if they did not do so they would be prosecuted for a breach of the Order.</P>
      <P>In fact, however, the AttorneyGeneral advised that, as a matter of law, the effect of the Order was more far-reaching and that, by specifying that a bottle used for the sale of stout would have to be of a particular capacity, the Order made each individual bottle a measure for the purpose of the Weights and Measures Acts and that the elaborate provisions of those Acts relating to the stamping of measures and their verification by Inspectors of Weights and Measures applied to those bottles.  While an opportunity presented itself a few years later&mdash;when the Weights and Measures Act of 1928 was being enacted&mdash;to change the law, it appears it was decided not to do so at the time since the manufacture of bottles was then a very new industry here and the requirements as to stamping and verification were of assistance to it <i>vis-ávis</i> foreign competitors, since arrangements could be and were made by the Irish firm for the stamping of these bottles to be carried out in the process of manufacture.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the present Bill provided an opportunity to consider the matter afresh in the light of conditions obtaining to-day.  The Irish Glass Bottle Company is now well established and there is no longer any justification for a procedure which costs several thousand pounds each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It costs threepence a gross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a procedure which is not and never was necessary as a safeguard against the marketing <Col N="809" /> of bottles of sizes such as one-eighteenth of a gallon, which is what the 1925 Order was aimed at right from the start.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt that the Wholesale Bottlers are willing, as they say, to continue to defray the cost of stamping.  I find that quite irrelevant. Controls are sometimes comfortable things and enable people to avoid responsibility.  Ultimately it is the community who will have to pay and whether they pay as taxpayers or as consumers does not alter the fact that the system is wasteful and unproductive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Commission's recommendation for the repeal of a provision in the Coroners Act of 1846 which obliges publicans to allow the remains of a deceased person to be deposited in their premises, at the direction of the Coroner, for the purposes of an inquest.  If the law in this respect were to be changed it would be by way of amendment of the Coroners' law&mdash;not the licensing law.  As it is, the preparation of a Bill amending and consolidating the Coroners' code of law is well under way in my Department and Deputy Cosgrave will have his opportunity of raising this matter when that Bill comes before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick raised the question of the methods of assessment of excise duty on licensed premises.  That is a matter for a Finance Act with which the Minister for Finance would be concerned.  It is not proper to a licensing Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier on, I was surprised to hear Deputy Dillon saying that the Fine Gael Party would vote against the Second Reading.  It seemed to me, listening to several speakers from his side of the House, that they were in agreement that the law should be changed and that they differed only from the Government on points of detail.  The two Deputies nominated by Fine Gael as their Party representatives on the 1957 licensing Commission were at one with their fellow members that the law should not be left as it is.  They signed their names to the Report recommending changes in the law relating to the hours of opening <Col N="810" /> on Sundays and week-days, on St. Patrick's Day and in relation to the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade, and so on.  For the several reasons I have mentioned, I fail to see why the Party should oppose the Second Reading which is concerned with the principles involved and not with matters of detail.</P>
    <P>When a Minister sits in and listens to a discussion on a Bill of this character which is of a very controversial nature, naturally some impressions are made on his mind.  Three impressions were made on my mind in the course of the discussion: (1) the brevity of the speeches; (2) the apparent failure of Deputies to consult or to have recourse to the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill or to the report of the Commission and (3) surprise at the attitude of the Opposition Party to the Second Reading of the Bill.  I have to presume that they are not against the principles of the Bill.  The Bill emanated from a Commission on which they were represented.  I, naturally, would presume that if they thought it was desirable to have a commission of enquiry should deal with the matter. I notice that the terms of reference were as follows: &ldquo;To enquire into the operation of the laws relating to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor and to make recommendations.&rdquo; That is what the Commission did.  They spent a year in their investigations. They interviewed very large numbers of witnesses from all walks of life, and, having done so, they made their recommendations. Their recommendations were not accepted in full by the Government but those of them that were accepted by the Government are, apparently, being disputed by the Opposition.  It is for that reason that I am rather surprised at the attitude which the Opposition is taking in respect of the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>To go back to the impressions which were made on my mind, the first was the brevity of the speeches. I was happy to find that Deputies could say what they had to say in the brief time which they allowed <Col N="811" /> themselves.  I worked out the average to be something round about 18 to 20 minutes&mdash;and that, in spite of the fact that three or four Deputies spoke for much longer periods.  One spoke for over an hour and, not to take from the Deputy in question, he did not add a single thing of value to the debate which had not already been stated.  I must compliment Deputies generally on the manner in which they dealt with the Bill.  I think they were fair and reasonable and that they showed a good conception of what was contained in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>The second impression was the failure of Deputies to consult the explanatory memorandum.  In that respect I must confess my disappointment, because, to a very large extent I was responsible for the issue of that memorandum in the form in which it appeared.  I insisted that my officers &mdash;to whom I personally pay tribute here publicly&mdash;should get out an explanatory memorandum that would be relieved completely of all the legal jargon that goes with Bills and explanatory memoranda of this character and that it would be couched in language that would be understood by the man in the street.  The impression that it was not consulted, or that Deputies did not have regard to it, was created by the fact that Deputies asked questions in the course of the debate, the answers to which were to be found in the explanatory memorandum.  That makes me feel that if they had taken the interest they should have taken in it, it would have been unnecessary to have asked those questions.  It is for that reason that I strongly recommend to Deputies of all Parties a study of the explanatory memorandum between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Last evening, for instance, Deputy Norton, in the course of a speech which I could approve of, by reason of its terms, made a strong plea for some change in the proposed Sunday hours of opening.  He made that plea mainly on behalf of family life.  If Deputy Norton had consulted the <Col N="812" /> explanatory memorandum, he would have found that hours which he was saying were detrimental to family life were actually operating both inside and outside the county boroughs at the moment.  At the present time, the hours of opening on Sundays in the four county boroughs are: Cork, Limerick and Waterford 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock and in Dublin 1.30 to 3 o'clock and from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock. Outside the county boroughs there is trading under the <i>bona fide</i> provisions and the area exemption orders.  There is no question about it that these hours which are at present operating in rural areas are greater if anything than the hours which will operate under the new Bill.  I do not see how family life will be worsened in any respect under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also asked from whom had the demand come for this Bill.  That can best be answered by referring back to 1956 when a demand appears to have come from this House for an examination of the licensing laws because of the fact that they were not apparently acceptable to the drinking public.  The drinking public have no organisation at their disposal to make their case for extra hours so that the only case that could be made is the case that the law was not being obeyed and that drinking was going on illegally long after the permitted hours.  If that is so, and if it is clear that drinking was continuing long after hours both in the cities and the rural areas and that public opinion was not behind enforcement that denotes that there was a demand for increased facilities because the present hours were not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>When the Commission made their recommendations I am quite certain they had in mind that by doing away with <i>bona fide</i> trading, and by making some extension of the hours, plus a rigorous enforcement of the law we would reach a stage where the actual drinking time would be considerably lessened.  I am happy that there were numerous demands from all sides of the House, including a demand from the Leader of the Opposition, for a rigorous enforcement of the licensing law.  I want to state that when this <Col N="813" /> Bill does, in fact, become law it is the intention of the Government, so far as they can, to see that the law will be rigorously enforced and that every possible step which can be taken to ensure that enforcement will be taken.</P>
    <P>All I would ask is that the House will be behind the Government in taking these steps.  If the position were reversed I should be glad to see any Government making an effort to enforce the law, and I should be glad to be a member of any Party which would support that enforcement of the <Col N="814" /> law.  I believe when this Bill is passed that whatever hours are eventually in the Bill&mdash;I am not suggesting that the hours contained in the Bill are the hours which will eventually become part of the law&mdash;are the hours which will have to be enforced and I think, with the aid of all Deputies, they can be successfully enforced.  If so, the nation will be in a much better state than it would be if the law were disobeyed as it has been for some little time past.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to vest in the Minister for Industry and Commerce all property in petroleum existing in its natural condition in strata, to make further and better provision for the working and development of such petroleum, to amend the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and to provide for certain other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the Minister's speech on the Second Reading, it is proposed, when this measure is enacted, to enter into an agreement with an American company known as Ambassador Oil.  Could he say what is the proposed capital of the new company and also what expenditure it is anticipated will be incurred by the Company in exploratory work over, say, the next two or three years?  Could he also give the House any indication of the area or areas in the country where it is proposed to explore with a view to ascertaining whether oil deposits exist or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps when the Minister is dealing with that he could also furnish us with some information on a matter into which he said he proposed to look when we were on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I would put my inquiry in this form: is there any provision in this Money Resolution to finance some kind of guarantee fund to provide against the contingency of somebody entering on a <Col N="817" /> landowner's land under the Minister's warrant and doing depredation there in the course of seeking for oil, then leaving the person's land and announcing that he has no resources wherewith to pay him such compensation as an arbitrator might award?  As the Minister knows, under the amending legislation at present in operation, there does not appear to be any provision of that kind and I think the Minister said he would consider the question of establishing some kind of guarantee fund to which the ordinary citizen could have recourse if the exploring company found itself unable to meet an arbitrator's award for damage done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, the proposed capital has not yet been settled but it is anticipated that there will be largely loan capital in the capital formation of the company.  As far as the amount to be expended by the company is concerned, that is set out in the agreement. The Deputy will remember that there are four separate periods in respect of which the company will enter into an obligation to explore and expend certain moneys and on failure to expend which they will forfeit a certain amount of these moneys to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In respect of the first three years of the first five-year period; for example, they will be obliged to spend at least $300,000 on exploration and to drill at least one well to a depth of 5,000 feet.  If they fail to meet these terms of their obligation they will be obliged to forfeit to the Minister the unexpended portion of the sum of $300,000; similarly with other periods of five years, having regard to the cumulative expenditure, in so far as they fail in any period to expend the moneys they undertook to expend, they will have to forfeit the unexpended portion of them to the Minister. I do not think it necessary to give the details of the expenditure over each five year period at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the point made by Deputy Dillon, I did in fact have regard to the suggestion he made and have put it in the form of an amendment.  However, <Col N="818" /> the amendment which I framed is not as he has put it forward to-day. He suggested on the last occasion that some examination of the <i>bona fides</i> of the financial background of the company to whom rights would be given might be undertaken and I have ensured in the amendment I shall propose later on that the Minister must be satisfied as to the financial background of the company undertaking exploration before any necessary licences or permits are given.  I have not put it in the form suggested, that is, to set up a contingency fund but I am sure, having come to the amendment, the Deputy will agree I have met his case reasonably well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot expand on the definition of &ldquo;petroleum well&rdquo;.  Everybody knows what petroleum is and everyone knows what a well is.

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It does raise a point.  I presume that exploration may be by boring down for oil or an open cast.  When dealing with <Col N="820" /> a problem as intricate as this, in which we enter on people's land for the purpose of boring for oil, it seems to me that some definition of the words &ldquo;petroleum well&rdquo; should be made quite definitely to this House.  I see the Minister's difficulty.  He is no more a technical expert than I am.  I notice that the words &ldquo;petroleum well&rdquo; appear very frequently throughout the Bill and if the Minister wishes to seek advice on the definition we can clarify the matter later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard of wells that spread oil over the whole countryside and I have heard of some others that required a great deal of activity to get anything out of them.  Does &ldquo;petroleum well&rdquo; mean a bore, a bore to a certain depth or a bore through which oil is coming?  There are bores put down which give nothing but gas which is now very valuable although at one time it was regarded as useless.  I take it that a well that gave nothing but gas would not be regarded as a petroleum well. In the old days a gas well was let go to waste but now the gas is piped for miles all over the countryside.  Is that a petroleum well?</P>

      <P>It does seem to me that this matter is particularly germane to the whole Bill. If you are introducing a Bill here giving people a licence to prospect for petroleum, obviously there will be a well but the matter should be put so that it can be fully understood and we should have a clear definition of what a petroleum well is.  I appreciate that the Minister has said he will inquire into the matter before the Report Stage but I was wondering if he could obtain a clear definition as soon as possible as there will obviously be a great deal of discussion on this Bill.  There are many amendments and the discussion will go on for some time.  Some expert in the Department must have some knowledge of what a petroleum well is. I suggest that it is necessary and usual that these matters should be clearly defined as this is the most important part of the whole Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Esmonde seems to suggest is that we should have this definition before we proceed further.  I should like to say that after the Second Reading in the House, the Bill was gone through practically with a fine comb, not only by the officers of the Department but also by the representatives of Ambassador Oil.  Almost every word and comma was examined and it did not seem to strike anybody that a definition of the words &ldquo;petroleum well&rdquo; was necessary but now that the matter <Col N="822" /> has been raised I shall inquire whether a legal definition is necessary.  In the meantime, I do not think that should hinder our discussion on the main points on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  a right to do any of the following things&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to construct, operate and maintain roads and railways for the purpose of ingress and egress to or from any land specified in a petroleum lease,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  to build, maintain and operate on any such land such roads and railways as may be needed for the purpose of carrying <Col N="823" /> on the exploration, prospecting, working, drilling and development of petroleum under such land, and for the purpose of access to any petroleum well, and the conveyance of petroleum from any petroleum well,</P>
    <P>(iii)  for all or any of the purposes aforesaid to use and occupy land and to exercise any rights in or over land or water;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises on the section which defines ancillary rights as they affect or extend the scope of the rights referred to in section 3, paragraph (c) of the Bill.  These rights relate to the construction and operation of roads and railways for the transportation of petroleum and to the occupation of land and the exercise of rights over it.  Ambassador Irish Oil, Limited, have represented that the ancillary rights under the Minerals Development Act, 1940 are inadequate, particularly in regard to the construction and operation of roads and railways, and they indicated that wider powers would be necessary for this development should any petrol deposits be found.</P>

      <P>I stated on the Second Reading that about 50 per cent of the mineral rights in the State were vested in private ownership and the balance in the Minister.  Petroleum will be included in the rights vested in the Minister.  Therefore, &ldquo;State petroleum&rdquo; is petroleum already vested in the Minister or in other State agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises a very serious issue.  Take a small farmer who owns 30 acres of land.  Do we purport, by an Act of this Dáil, to proclaim suddenly that if there is petroleum under his land, we now expropriate it?  I do not think we have any power to do so.  I suggest that this Oireachtas has no power under the Constitution to expropriate any man's property.  The question then arises: are minerals or oil underlying my land my property or not?  I do not think we have any power by Statute of this Parliament simply to say: &ldquo;They are not your property; they belong to the State.&rdquo;  Surely this will create big difficulties for the Minister if a section of that kind purports to expropriate minerals rights vested in individuals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was in fact raised outside the House within the Department and I took the advice of the Government's law adviser.  The advice was that the section was not unconstitutional.  I need hardly remind the Deputy that there are adequate provisions for compensation in respect of oil found on a person's land.  It is obvious, too, that unless some exploration of this kind is permitted, even if a person has minerals or oil under his land, the possibility of his ever benefiting from them are extremely remote&mdash; in fact, absolutely remote.  Therefore, unless some provision is made whereby the Minister can entrust these rights, either to an agency he will operate through himself or through some other organisation with which he will enter into a contract to explore and exploit the possibility of petroleum, it is reasonably certain nobody will ever benefit.  I believe this is the only way it can be done.  I am informed this provision is not unconstitutional as a result of a point taken by myself with the law adviser to the Government.  As I say, there are very full and adequate provisions for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says is true&mdash;that nobody but a company with very considerable resources could exploit oil should it exist&mdash;but there may be a danger of a precedent of this sort.  As I understand the effects <Col N="826" /> of Sections 4 and 5, they are, in respect of Section 4, that all State petroleum whether it is under the control of other Ministers or not, now vests in the Minister. In addition, the Minister, by virtue of Section 5 takes to himself, and as a result of it for the future, all petroleum whether it is State petroleum or not.  Does that mean that merely by this provision the Minister acquires these rights without payment of any compensation?  Is the second paragraph of Section 5 adequate to cover compensation to the person on whose land petroleum is found?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to look at the background here.  This is an effort to induce a company which has financial and technical resources to explore for oil in this country.  Nobody knows if, in fact, there is any oil here.  Those with technical qualifications express considerable doubt as to there being oil here at all.  We are endeavouring to establish whether that point of view is right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that, in the course of prospecting or exploring, the Oil Company discovers oil in different places throughout the country.  If we are to get these oil deposits exploited to the full, in the national interest, it is desirable that the State should have the petroleum rights.  Having the petroleum rights means that if these rights are used, if in fact, the land is entered upon, the owner of the land can get compensation under Part VI. If the State does not take over the petroleum rights and if the State does not facilitate access to the petroleum deposits, there will be no development of any petroleum resources that we may have.  It would be of no value to the nation if some small farmer were to say: &ldquo;I have oil underneath my land and have such affection for the oil that I shall not allow anybody to go near it.&rdquo;  If we know that there is oil on certain land, the sensible thing to do is to exploit it commercially in the national interest and to say to the man on whose land the oil is and who cannot exploit it: &ldquo;We shall pay you compensation, to be determined in a fair way.&rdquo;  Any oil that we may have cannot be exploited unless power is taken to get access to the petroleum <Col N="827" /> underneath the ground, on the understanding that compensation is paid to the man who is fortunate enough to have got the land on that particular spot from the Land Commission or otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton's argument is fallacious to this extent, that if there is petroleum under any area of land it is capable of being exploited, not merely under one particular 100 or 200 acres, but anywhere within a very wide circumference, which may give a choice of 20, 30, 40 or 50 farmers.  It is not a question of being tied to one place, as might be the case, for example, in copper mining, where the vein would run through. The oil would be below the ground and it would be a question of tapping the reservoir.</P>
      <P>It is not merely that point that I want to raise with the Minister.  I want to raise another point on the same question.  A great deal of the land here was sold under the earlier Land Acts prior to 1909, as the Minister is personally, apart from being officially, aware, with the mineral and sporting rights reserved to the owner prior to the sale of the land under the Land Acts.  Those mineral rights were never used over the years.  Candidly, I have never considered the point in connection with mineral rights but it has been considered by others in connection with sporting rights and the view now held is that, since the passing of the Statutes of Limitation Act, 1957, which came into operation on 1st January, 1959, if sporting rights reserved in that way have not been utilised for a period of 12 years, they are now statute barred.  Prior to then, it was believed that they were not affected by the Statutes of Limitation and were not statute barred.  Now, the situation is that it is believed that they are.  If they are, then it would appear likely that the mineral rights would be similarly statute barred.  It is of great importance, therefore, that that aspect should be considered so that we would know in whom the mineral rights were now vested in any cases which have been bought through the Acts prior to 1909.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> Under the 1923 Land Act the mineral rights were always acquired by the Land Commission and reserved to the Land Commission when the lands were being vested in the tenants.  Speaking from recollection, I do not think the Statutes of Limitation Act, 1957, applied to State bodies such as the Land Commission and, therefore, it is not a problem in relation to the 1923 Act cases.  If, however, the position is as I have indicated&mdash;though I have not been advised formally by any counsel in connection with sporting rights, I have received what the Minister knows well to be a travelling opinion, that the effect of the 1957 Act has meant that sporting rights, reserved and not used for 12 years, become automatically barred in those circumstances&mdash;would it not be so for mineral rights excepted from the sale?</P>
    <P>If it is so, it means that it is not the estate of the former owner who sold under the Land Acts but the actual farmer who is now entitled to the mineral rights and I should like the Minister to tell us, first, whether he has had that aspect considered up to this and, if so, what was the view expressed and, if he has not had it considered up to now, whether he would get it considered between now and Report Stage so as to be in a position to advise us on the Report Stage, because it seems to me quite fundamental to the consideration of this Bill in relation to the whole field of land that was bought through the 1903 and the 1909 Land Acts and, perhaps, the earlier ones, not the later ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in reply to Deputy Cosgrave, this provision is not absolutely without precedent, as he seems to have suggested.  Under the 1940 Mineral Development Act, there is provision whereby the Minister may, by order, acquire mineral rights and, in fact, the Avoca workings are being done pursuant to an order made under the 1940 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Sweetman, the point he mentions has not, in fact, been adverted to in my Department but I think it illustrates the desirability of Section 5, in vesting in the Minister <Col N="829" /> the property in all petroleum within the State.</P>
    <P>Whether the 1957 Statutes of Limitation Act applies to mineral rights, as the Deputy seems to suggest, as well as sporting rights, is something that can be examined in relation to the payment of compensation by the Mining Board and, as the Deputy is aware, under the Bill, the Mining Board has the power to refer to the High Court any case by way of case stated, to solve a legal problem that may occur in the examination of the compensation aspects of the acquisition of land.  Similarly, any claimant to compensation has also a right to require the Mining Board so to refer the case to the High Court and, in the event of the Mining Board refusing, that person has the right to go in any case to the High Court to require the Mining Board to do so.  Therefore, the point the Deputy is making is one that can be taken care of adequately under the later compensation provisions in the Bill, including the rights of anybody to go to the High Court by way of case stated or to cause the Board itself to go there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While that may be so in relation to the title to compensation, it is right that the House should know from whom the rights are being acquired because the House might easily want to put in additional provisions for the tenant farmer, if the rights were still vested in the landlord. I would ask the Minister to have the matter clarified before the next Stage so far as his advisers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I could do, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Norton over-simplifies this matter.  There are two considerations in relation to the provisions of Section 5.  One is the fact that we have a written Constitution and that, if we purport to enact legislation which conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution, the only result is that we involve everybody in a very undesirable tangle and it is necessary when dealing with property rights to keep our eye pretty closely on the terms of the Constitution <Col N="830" /> so as to avoid the possibility of the whole Statute being found to be unconstitutional and ineffective. There is a detailed aspect to this to which I think Deputy Sweetman referred incidentally.  If you open a copper mine you open it on a certain coast.  You may follow the line of the minerals but must get permission to enter the next man's property in order to follow the line of minerals.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the compensation rights are to take the form of royalties paid on oil brought to the surface.  Let us suppose that Deputy Norton has a farm adjoining my farm and that the oil under both farms vests in the Minister.  The Minister elects to bore on my farm.  Deputy Norton comes along the following morning and says: &ldquo;Now, come along and bore on my farm.&rdquo;  The oil is lying under Deputy Dillon's and Deputy Norton's land.  If one bores on Deputy Dillon's land and not on Deputy Norton's land the oil will come up on Deputy Dillon's land. He will get these royalties.  In fact, Deputy Norton sucks the oil from under my land.</P>
      <P>In the Texas oil fields and the great oil fields of the Southern States of America derricks have gone up like forests in close proximity one to the other very frequently for the reason that nobody was going to allow somebody else to drain all the oil away from the field into one particular bore hole.  It may be that technical and economic reasons make it preferable that there should be only one hole and that there should be only one pool &mdash;I sympathise with Deputy Norton's scepticism about these pools of oil upon which we are speculating&mdash;and that it might be more economic to have one derrick tapping one particular pool of oil.  If the section operated all the royalties would go to one man and his neighbour would get nothing although his neighbour knew that but for the operation of Section 5 he could have got Standard Oil and bored away on his own land.  If there are two rival companies, each tapping the same pool of oil, each of the two proprietors will get his fair share of compensation provided under Section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> If we look at the matter without careful reflection we could create a situation in which Deputy Norton's land could be left dry while Deputy Dillon's land is made to gush oil.  In those circumstances, Deputy Norton may find that he has a right to go to the Supreme Court and say that his property rights are violated by the provisions of Section 5.  If Deputy Sweetman's contention is correct&mdash;and I have no doubt it is&mdash;and the mineral rights are vested in Deputy Norton who has purchased his land under a Land Act, I think the tenant farmer, whom I describe as Deputy Norton in this case, may have a very good case to go to the Supreme Court and say it is unconstitutional because it operates to deprive him not only of the physical oil which it conveys to the Minister but deprive him of his right to compensation because the Minister will not permit him to bore on his holding and bring the oil to the surface which is the only means by which compensation becomes payable to him.</P>
    <P>It is better that these things should be mentioned at this stage.  If there is a flaw in the plan envisaged in the Bill it can be corrected.  If there is nothing in it, it can be examined and disposed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputy Dillon has just raised is taken care of in Section 30.  When oil is found, operations are started at what is described as the well-head.  The best information available shows that the oil will come from beneath the surface within a radius of a quarter of a mile of that well-head and persons owning land within that area will be compensated in accordance with the defined formula.  I think the experience excludes the possibility of anybody who owns land outside the circumference of that field having any possible rights in the oil that will be brought to the surface.  It is mentioned in the Bill that there will be compensation available to everybody who owns land within that circle.  That, perhaps, may be another way to reply to the point raised by Deputy Sweetman, that there might be a huge area and very many landowners within an area in which oil <Col N="832" /> is being drilled for.  That is not the case.  According to technical experience, that possibility is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said, is that not the very point which Deputy Dillon is making?  The Minister refers us to another section in relation to this. Deputy Dillon's case was that you might be taking oil out of one person's land and actually going into another person's land.  By restricting the area to a quarter of a mile, you are creating that difficulty.  You might be producing oil at the well-head and bringing out oil but just beyond the quarter of a mile you might be taking the oil from the land of somebody else.  They will get no compensation for that at all.</P>
      <P>While speaking on this section, I want to ask the Minister a question. I will make it as simple as I can because this is a very complicated matter as far as I can see.  If a person has a freehold farm, surely he is entitled to proportionate compensation? If a person is a tenant farmer and is paying an annuity and oil is discovered on his farm, any rights which he might have if he were the complete owner of that land would not go to him.  If he is an annuitant those rights will go to the Land Commission. In other words, he will get no benefit whatever as a result of oil being found on his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point mentioned by the Deputy in relation to the quarter of a mile, the possibility is extremely remote.  The Deputy suggested that a wider area might be taken into account but if you did that, one could not say where one should stop.  Therefore everybody who owns land perhaps within a 50mile radius might be entitled to claim compensation.  Those who know their job say that you exclude all owners of land outside this circle&mdash;half a mile in diameter or a quarter of a mile in radius.  That is the only information we have on the subject.  I think it is advice we might reasonably accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the tenant who is subject to payment of land annuities is concerned, <Col N="833" /> if oil is found on his land he has the right to compensation, subject to repayment of annuities to the Land Commission.  If he owns the land and owns the mineral rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;and owns the mineral rights&rdquo;.  Under a 1923 Act case, he cannot and therefore he gets nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, if I exclude the opinion the speaker has expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1923 Act case cannot be affected by the type of case I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1923 Act case, he does not in any event own the mineral rights.  Therefore, he has no property in them.  If he does own the mineral rights, and if he is still subject to the payment of land annuities, he is entitled to compensation in respect of the oil found on his land subject only to repayment of the annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not possible for the Minister to embody in the Bill that if the annuitant so wishes, if oil is discovered on his property, which would make it valuable, it would be possible for him to redeem the annuity?  If he does, the State will surely recoup him what he is entitled to get.  Under this Section, the Minister is adequately safeguarded. I suggest the Minister should consider something on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If he already has the mineral rights and redeems the annuity then he has full right to compensation under the Act for any petroleum found on his land.  The redemption of the annuity alone does not give him mineral rights over his property if they are vested in the Land Commission.  He cannot acquire a right he never had in any case by redeeming the annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A slightly wider point arises on this.  Exploration and searching for petroleum, if there is petroleum here, cannot and will not be <Col N="834" /> carried on, no matter what legal agreements there may be between the Minister and any company, without reasonable goodwill on the part of the people over whose land that exploration will be carried out.  I agree that in the national interest the people of the country as a whole will endeavour to give that co-operation.  However, I think that co-operation would far more readily be forthcoming if the position were that the person who owned the land was not entirely expropriated from any benefit that might arise in the majority of cases.  The 1923 Land Act cases all will mean that any person who has bought under the 1923 Land Act will not get a penny piece for all the petroleum that is found in his land.  He will get compensation, I gather, for disturbance and damage but the compensation under the terms of this Bill appears to be very different indeed from the terms visualised elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister, in drafting this Bill, had no Irish experience on which to go.  I should like to know what mineral exploitation legislation of other countries he considered before determining on the basis here.  We have no experience in relation to this type of exploration.  I wonder, for example, if the Minister looked into what is universally accepted amongst oil men to be the most modern code of oil legislation, the British Columbia code in Canada?  Did the Minister and his advisers consider that code which is universally, amongst oil men, considered to be the most modern code?  There are a great many things in that code of which no cognisance is taken in this Bill.  Some of them I hope the Minister will deal with by regulation. I do not think regulation is the right way of dealing with them.  I had hoped to have an opportunity of raising this matter in a more general way on the Second Stage but unfortunately I had influenza at the time.</P>
      <P>The modern code in other countries, dealing with petroleum exploration, winning and searching for it, is quite different.  There is a statutory objection, for example, in British Columbia to carrying out this work within 250 feet of anybody's house.  There is a statutory prohibition on carrying it out within 250 feet of a main road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> There is nothing in this Bill to prevent an oil company from coming in and sitting in my back garden and, if they wish, digging it all up, when they could quite easily do it on the other side of the wall.</P>
    <P>I accept the quarter mile radius which the Minister mentions.  I am sure his technical information is adequate on it.  However, it means that you can take it within that radius and get what is required without trampling on other people's rights.  People do not mind putting up with inconvenience, with damage even, if, at the end of the story, if anything is found, they will get something out of it.  But all the 1923 Act cases, and perhaps some of the other earlier Land Act cases, will get nothing out of it.  That seems to be much too arbitrary a way of dealing with the problem.  Quite apart from being too arbitrary a way of dealing with the problem, it seems it is not a way that is likely to get the co-operation, help and assistance without which these teams cannot possibly satisfactorily work in relation to their searching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may enter into an undertaking with any person to grant to him an exploration licence or a petroleum prospecting licence or both those licences.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to empower the Minister to enter into undertakings to grant exploration or <Col N="838" /> prospecting licences in relation to petroleum.  These powers will be useful because our experience has been that groups which negotiate for facilities for the exploration of petroleum are anxious to secure undertakings from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he will grant them the necessary licences on the fulfilment of whatever conditions are prescribed. This is an amendment which was inserted mainly at the request of the Ambassador Oil Company, and to require the Minister to give undertakings, but it does not, in my opinion, carry the effectiveness of the Bill much further.  On the other hand, it does not do it any harm either.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall not grant a petroleum prospecting licence in respect of petroleum under any land unless, at least fourteen days before doing so, he has&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I suggest that 14 days is rather a limited period and that a reasonable extension would be a month, or 30 days.  Further, the section says:</P>
      <P>(a) published, in one or more newspapers circulating in the locality, notice of his intention to do so, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> (b) deposited in the office of the Geological Survey, Dublin and in one or more places in the locality, a map showing the boundaries of such land.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister clarify in paragraph (b), subsection (2) the phrase &ldquo;in one or more places in the locality a map showing the boundaries of such land&rdquo;?  Does &ldquo;one or more&rdquo; mean the local post office and the Garda barracks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The local places envisaged are, in fact, the Garda barracks and the post office.  The publication in the newspaper is to overcome the practical difficulty that would arise in the event of a large tract of land being specified as an area in which a prospecting licence could be granted. Under the 1940 Act, the Minister was required to serve notice on each land owner by registered post.  In that Act, it was envisaged that only relatively small areas would be considered for the granting of prospecting licences. Under the Bill, the area would be much wider and would involve very many land holders.  The issue of licences must not damage any land holder and, in any case, the intention is to make him aware that such prospecting is about to be carried out in his area.  I think the provisions of the section are adequate to put the land owner on notice as to what he might expect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A point arises on this section which might be considered more conveniently here than anywhere <Col N="841" /> else.  The operation, as I understand it, of the Minister's scheme is that, first of all, if an exploration licence proves worthwhile, one goes to the prospecting stage, and then if that proves worthwhile, one goes to the mining stage.  This section deals with the middle stage, the prospecting stage, and it must be considered against the background of the agreement made by the Minister with the Ambassador Oil Company.</P>
      <P>Again, the tenor of this section, and the tenor of the agreement with Ambassador Oil, is entirely contrary to the established provisions in other countries.  As I understand, from the Minister's explanatory memorandum, Ambassador Oil have been given exploration rights over the whole country.  I am not quarrelling with that at all, but as I understand the agreement further, Ambassador Oil have equally been given the right, if they so desire, to take out prospecting licences over the whole country.</P>
      <P>The actual phraseology is that the company will be entitled to prospecting licences and mining leases in any area over which they have exploration rights.  If that phrase in the memorandum means what is says, the position is that not merely exploration rights but all prospecting rights, and ultimately all mining leases for petroleum in the country, have already been committed to one company.  That is what the Minister's memorandum sets out.  Perhaps that is not so.  If it is not so, I need not develop the point further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries there has been quite a different scheme.  These may be exploration rights, these may be prospecting rights, but in relation to the actual mining at a later stage, it is dealt with on a grid system.  The particular country is divided into specified areas and a company cannot take a whole area because by so doing it, and not the Government concerned, has the right of deciding what petrol will be extracted and what petrol will be left there.  The amount of petrol, for example, that was mined in Eakring in England was a very considerable <Col N="842" /> addition to their wartime supplies but it is common knowledge that it was so mined that the reservoir of the well was very much over worked.  It was over worked, naturally enough, because of the emergency of the war conditions.</P>
    <P>In other countries it is the Government who have the right to determine what exact working there is going to be.  Under statute in other countries it is the Government who have the right to determine whether it is desirable in the national interest to extract as much as possible from a petroleum reservoir or whether it is better to build it up for an emergency period.  In this case there is no such provision in the legislation proposed here.</P>
    <P>Apparently we are relying entirely on such provisions as there may be in the lease.  That is not a satisfactory arrangement; it is particularly not satisfactory in view of the fact there is no provision, no possibility whatever, of having any exploitation on the grid system that is, for example, operating in British Columbia.  The whole purpose of the grid system is to ensure that there will be that competition.  The person who finds the oil will get the cream; the person who finds the oil will reap the benefit.  By adopting a system of dividing the country into a series of areas, squared, or whatever you like to call them, it will ensure that while the person who has done the donkey work will get the cream of the benefit, he will be kept up to his job.</P>
    <P>The blanket system which the Minister has adopted does not do that at all and it is not satisfactory.  It is not satisfactory that the rights in relation to this should be defined solely by reference to the lease. As far as I can see, there is nothing whatever in this legislation to provide that the Government, as a Government, would have the right to determine how the most vital raw material there could be would be utilised if, in fact, it is to be found in Ireland.  I do not think it right that that matter should be left purely to a covenant in the lease.  As I say, in other countries the provisions in that regard are incorporated in the legislation itself.  The fire provisions are incorporated in the <Col N="843" /> legislation itself; the prohibition against doing damage to buildings, roads, etc., is incorporated in the legislation itself.  The Minister should tell us why he adopted a different line from that adopted by other countries who have infinitely more experience than we in relation to this matter.  In case the Minister has not seen these I shall send them across to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised by the Deputy referred to the fact that Ambassador Oil have rights over the whole country.  I might say, as the Deputy knows, the territory is being scaled down according as each five year period terminates.  It is reduced to 75 per cent. after the first five years, then to 50 per cent. after the next five years, and then to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But I think I am right in saying that it is all in blocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say exactly how the reduction process will take place.  As far as the suggestion that any company under this Bill might be empowered to exploit oil to the detriment of the country is concerned, it certainly would not be in the interests of the country.  I suggest that Section 49, as amended by the new section, adequately takes care of that possibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to make regulations to provide for, amongst many other matters, in subparagraph (IV), the conservation of petroleum and then, in subsection 2, subparagraph (a) it states: &ldquo;If it appears to the Minister that a petroleum operation is being conducted in such a manner (whether by act or omission) to cause loss, contamination, deterioration or misuse of petroleum products or other minerals which would not normally occur if the operation were conducted in accordance with good oilfield practice then he may serve, by registered post...&rdquo; etc.  That at least reserves the right to the Minister to ensure that proper oilfield practice is being maintained in the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made myself clear to the Minister.  I am not <Col N="844" /> referring to a case in which proper oilfield practice is not being carried out.  Even with proper oilfield practice there is a higher principle involved. We are not likely to have oil here to the extent, say, of Texas.  We are far more likely to have a small amount of oil like that which was found in the Eakring oilfield.  I am not making any suggestions that the Minister should have made any choice other than that of Ambassador Oil.  They are an excellent little company.  They are not one of the giants but they are a good concern.  I am assuming they are going to work in relation to proper oilfield practice but there is a higher principle involved.  That is whether it is better in the national interest having a supply of the size comparable to the Eakring field in England, that it should be taken out in years, one, two or three, or whether, knowing that it is there, it should be kept as a reservoir to cover a national emergency.  Eakring, as I say, was pumped out and it is only just beginning to recover now after seepage.</P>
      <P>It was pumped out during the war to meet a national emergency.  What the Minister is taking power to do is to ensure that proper oil field practice is carried out.  That is not a matter of oil field practice.  It is a matter of national policy which a Government and only a Government should decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I get a little <Col N="845" /> clarification on this section.  The procedure is that the only interested party, the Ambassador Oil Company, will apply for an exploration licence for the entire State, which they can be granted according to the terms of the agreement with the Ambassador Oil Company.  They must then take out prospecting licences.  Am I correct in saying that nobody else can take out a prospecting licence except the Ambassador Oil Company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they take out these prospecting licences piecemeal over various areas in the State or do they take out one prospecting licence for the whole State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The exploration licence initially is in respect of the whole State.  Prospecting licences, as the section indicates, will be in respect of an area to be selected by them and that area will have to be sufficiently indicated to the people who may have rights such as ownership of land, etc. by way of notice in the public Press and by way of map deposited in the locality.  Therefore that envisages immediately that the exploration licence will be in respect of a known area within the State, but it does not give them prospecting licences over the whole State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would follow logically from the work done under the exploration licence.  As regards the point made by Deputy Sweetman, under the terms of the agreement with the Ambassador Oil Company, I think I am correct in saying, they agree to surrender after every period of five years 25 per cent. of the area of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they must surrender 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is also correct to say that a very substantial part of the State will, in any event, not be oil bearing, so that that condition in the oil agreement is really not of very much value.  In other words, they could surrender back part of the State in which they knew there was no possibility <Col N="846" /> of getting oil, still keep the agreement in force and tie up the part where the oil was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. Known techniques today would establish after the initial period which 25 per cent. of the State they are prepared to relinquish.  It may be, however, that techniques of mining will develop as the years go on, that somebody else might come along and by reason of these techniques undertake exploration and perhaps establish where oil would be in the portion of the land of the State that has been abandoned for the purpose of oil drilling by the Ambassador people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert but I do know it can be established that there are certain types of country where there is no oil and where it is quite impossible to find oil.  Under the terms of this agreement, they could release back to the State the 25 per cent. in the area in which they knew there was no oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the prospecting licence is granted for a period specified on its face and during that period it is valid and binding between the parties.  If that is so, the Minister and the licensee might come across difficulties they did not foresee by virtue of the fact that subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>Every petroleum prospecting licence shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as the Minister thinks fit and specifies therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, therefore, the conditions specified in the prospecting licence would be valid during the entire period in which the prospecting licence was in operation and there might arise a situation, say, half way through the period specified in the prospecting licence, in which both the Minister and the licensee might like to introduce new terms into the licence.  Unfortunately the Minister and the licensee would not be in the position of two parties binding <Col N="847" /> themselves by mutual agreement and they may not be able to change the conditions specified in the licence.  The Minister might find it wise to put in some kind of saver in that section to allow the Minister and the licensee at some stage to change the conditions in the licence if the need arose.</P>

      <P>Deputy Russell has followed up the point I made and it is quite clear that if the Minister's interpretation is correct in regard to the relinquishment of the 25 per cent under the lease, the provision is utterly worthless because if oil is to be found here we have a fair idea of the areas in which it will be found but in relation to certain areas where there is no prospect whatever of oil being found, they can throw these back at the Minister. That is why, particularly to meet a case like that, in British Columbia and in other places the grid system has been adopted.  If the Minister will look at the copy of the Petroleum and Natural Gases Act of British Columbia, which I have sent across to him, he will find that in Section 49 of that Act there is specific provision that a permitee&mdash;which is the same as what we call a licensee&mdash;may not get <Col N="848" /> more than five grids in one area so that as he gives up 25 per cent, if that is to be the basis of the lease, it does not shut out any other possibilities. That is specifically provided for in their legislation.  I do not purport to be an expert on their legislation as I only read their Act but that is the system on which it is done.</P>
      <P>The whole area is divided up.  There is a group and out of that group, which may consist of about 30 grid areas, a licensee may take only five.  He explores over a wide area and, as his reward, he takes the best areas but he is bound to take them in such a way that he cannot blanket out everybody else and so the oil resources will be developed.  It is a pity that the Minister did not adopt that procedure here.  The Minister may reasonably ask me why did I not put down amendments to that effect but this is not the type of Bill that could be amended in the ordinary course.  It would mean an entirely new Bill and I am not in a position to follow that line.  No member of an Opposition would be in a position to do that.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Sweetman has said, the agreement came before the legislation.  It provides for the gradual reduction by 25 per cent. after five years and by 25 per cent. more after the next five years.  Paragraph 6 says that the areas surrendered and returned must be in blocks of compact shape and, to that extent, it ensures that there will not be any random surrender of land.  I should like to <Col N="849" /> suggest to Deputy Sweetman, as he has examined the position in British Columbia, that this country is a very small area by standards of oil exploration and oil mining and that it may not be practicable under the circumstances to divide the country into grids as he suggests.  I would suggest to him that the prospects of finding oil in this country may not be as bright as they were in British Columbia.  These are the two possibilities that I suggest to him&mdash;firstly, that the prospects are not very bright and secondly, that our national territory is a very small area by the standards of oil exploration and mining.</P>

Do we not mean mineral deposits rather than petroleum?  You must do some damage to the petroleum to get it out, as I understand the method of mining, but of course I am not an expert.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is intended to mean but I want to be clear that it legally means that.  In relation to the surface of land, should there not be something to provide that the person prospecting would not do his work in a way that would be unnecessarily annoying to the owner of the land?  The question of damage is not of very great consequence because <Col N="851" /> obviously the licensee will be responsible for paying for the damage.  Under a prospecting licence, the licensee pays. Therefore, he will select the place where there is the least damage.  But if the prospecting work can be done at place A quite satisfactorily and the lessee insists on doing it at place B, surely there should be some provision which would override that?</P>
      <P>I am not thinking in terms of damage so much as loss of amenity. Is it clear, for example, that there would be any compensation for loss of amenity?  Does the Minister know how one prospects for petroleum? Is it not necessary to drill into the ground? In my opinion, the noise of a drill just outside the kitchen door can be pretty unpleasant for the woman of the house.  The man may be out but it would be pretty unpleasant for her. That is a loss of amenity.  There does not seem to be compensation in this section for that type of loss of amenity, annoyance or whatever you like to call it.  I think there should be some means of paying such compensation.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever had the misfortune, as I had, to live adjacent to where a well was being bored by one of these drilling machines.  It went on for some days and, although I was a considerable distance away from it and was not, therefore, as badly affected as others, it was a most maddening performance. Some of those near it became ill and were almost driven off their heads.  As far as I can see, there is nothing here to provide any form of compensation for that loss of amenity, annoyance or nuisance, if you like to use the word in the technical and legal sense.  If there were such provision, clearly the people causing the annoyance would clamp down on it as much as they could; but without such provision there is nothing to make them do so.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> (a)  by the exercise by the licensee under a petroleum prospecting licence of his rights under the licence, or</P>

    <P>the licensee or the Minister (as the case may be) shall be liable to pay compensation for such damage, and the provisions of Chapter VII of this Part shall apply in respect of such compensation.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say whether damage to the surface of the land is intended to include, for example, damage to timber on the land or damage to a building caused by subsidence as a result of drilling under the land?  Would these items be covered in a compensation claim?  If not, the term &ldquo;damage to the surface of land' is hardly wide enough.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 might be discussed together.  Amendment No. 17 is consequential on Amendment No. 16.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>Before Section 20 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In this section &lsquo;licence&rsquo; means a licence being&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an exploration licence,</P>
      <P>(b) a petroleum prospecting licence, or,</P>
      <P>(c) a reserved area licence.</P>
      <P>(2) The licensee under a licence may, with the consent of the Minister, transfer the licence to another person.</P>
      <P>(3) Where the licensee under a licence, being an individual, dies, the following provisions shall nothwithstanding anything contained in section 7 of this Act, have effect&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the rights conferred by the licence may be exercised until the happening of whichever of the <Col N="858" /> following events first happens, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the grant of probate of the will or letters of administration of the personal estate of the licensee,</P>
    <P>(ii) the expiration of the licence,</P>
    <P>(iii) the expiration of six months from the death of the licensee.</P>
    <P>(b) if the personal representative of the licensee applies to the Minister, not later than twelve months from the death of the licensee for leave to transfer the licence and the licence is then in force&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the Minister may grant or refuse the application,</P>
    <P>(ii) if the Minister refuses the application, the licence shall on such refusal terminate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Power is being taken under the terms of this amendment to provide for the transfer from one person to another of a licence for the exploration of petroleum deposits.  This amendment is in harmony with the amendment authorising the transfer of petroleum leases.  The amendment provides also for the continuance of licences granted to an individual, notwithstanding the death of the individual.  There are instances in which petroleum exploration and development operations are carried out by private individuals rather than by companies and this applies to a number of groups in the United States of America.  Licences granted to a company would continue in force indefinitely, subject to their terms, but, in the case of individuals, the licences would terminate on death, unless provision was made for their continuance.  The effect of the amendment will be that, on the death of the holder of the licence, the personal representative will be empowered to operate under it for a maximum period of six months.  Within a period of 12 months from the death of the holder, the personal representative may apply to the Minister for leave to transfer the licence and the Minister <Col N="859" /> may grant or refuse the application, as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 is to delete the words &ldquo;death or,&rdquo; the purpose being that it is desirable to provide that exploration, prospecting, and other licences granted to an individual shall not terminate on his death but shall pass to his personal representative.  In some instances, the interests which are concerned with oil companies are not bodies corporate but are individuals, as I have already explained in connection with amendment No. 16, and the purpose is that the licence shall not terminate on the death of an individual where the licence holder is, in fact, an individual.</P>

If he is to administer the estate, strictly speaking, his duty is to sell whatever the assets are and to distribute the proceeds of the assets amongst those entitled to distributive shares?

      <P>That is all very well from the point of view of the administrator but what is the position of the Minister when he finds that there are 17 joint tenants?  This amendment has been put up by the oil company for their own purpose.  It has now established a new line of devolution which I imagine can create great difficulty for the Minister, unless the Minister says that one of the powers he has under his power of consent is to say to the administrator of an estate: &ldquo;I do not consent to your transferring this lease to 17 people.&rdquo;  What is the position then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Bill as it stands says that the Minister shall give notice of one month when he proposes to acquire any land by acquisition order.  In the event of there being a dwelling-house on the land, he shall give notice of three months.  I want to put this to the Minister.  Normally speaking, a crop is sown in the Spring and harvested some six months afterwards.  If a farmer is put in the position where he will be suddenly given a month's notice that his lands are to be entered on with all the facilities that these licensees will enjoy, he will lose the value of the <Col N="864" /> crop.  His whole standard and method of living will be seriously disturbed.  I do not think one month is reasonable notice.  It is quite obvious that if a crop is sown in Spring, be it wheat, barley or whatever else, and if these facilities exist for a company to go in and explore the land, the farmer will be at the loss of the crop and the whole husbandry of the State will be upset.</P>
      <P>I think a reasonable time would be six months.  If the Minister does not like to accept &ldquo;he shall give six months' notice,&rdquo; perhaps he might consider &ldquo;he may give six months' notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment 20 deals with the case where there is a residence on the land.  I believe we are dealing with American firms and they are mostly hustlers.  They believe in getting things done and to give such a firm a right to enter on anybody's land and demolish holdings, if necessary, within three months does not seem to me to be reasonable.  I consider that anybody who has to move and set up another home, if he can acquire one, in that limited period would need more notice.  The 12-month period I am looking for applies not only to land-owners but to property-owners because there is no knowing where oil may be found.  Oil may be discovered in a street; it may be necessary to start exploring and it could mean that all the people in the whole street would get three months' notice to clear out of their homes.  I think it is only reasonable that the Minister should consider these amendments: in the first case, to extend the date from one month; and in the second case, where there is a residence, possibly in a built-up area, to extend the notice to twelve months.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Minister does not wish to bind himself entirely to these dates.  If he does not, I would ask him to substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and accept the periods in my amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that in fact there are ample provisions for compensation in connection with the occupation of a <Col N="865" /> house or ownership of land on which crops are growing.  Therefore, the period of notice would not seem to matter much in the long run.  Also, when you take into account that even if notice has expired, some considerable time may reasonably be expected to elapse before the actual acquisition occurs, the periods of notice provided are reasonably adequate, but, since the Deputy has raised it, I might go a little way towards him if he will come back a little distance towards me.  In respect of the one month's notice in regard to land on which there is not a house, I would be prepared to suggest two months and, perhaps, in the case of land on which there is a house to extend the period of three months' notice to four months.</P>
      <P>I think that would be reasonable when one takes into account the compensation provisions that exist and when in practice, the length of time needed for the actual acquisition to take place will give ample breathing space to every landowner to acquire housing accommodation and also to permit his crops to come to fruition or, if not, he will get adequate compensation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister deal with Deputy Esmonde's amendment on ancillary rights?  I cannot see why less time is provided for ancillary rights than for acquisition, having regard to the fact that one of the ancillary rights is the right to demolish buildings.  Surely, if a right of that sort is being acquired which is going to involve possible demolition of a habitable house on the land, it is only reasonable that at least the same notice as is required in respect of a dwelling-house should be required for the acquisition of an ancillary right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

Extending the period from one month to two months is an improvement but I do not think that would be sufficient to save a crop.  I would ask the Minister if he will go to three months in the one case and six months in the other.  Then, I think everybody would be satisfied.</P>

I am advised that practice would show the periods the Deputy suggests for notice periods would be rather too long.  Again, I would remind him that once the notice period has been expended, there will be quite a substantial period before actual acquisition will take place in the normal way. Therefore, I suggest to him that the extent I have gone to meet him ought to be sufficient, by the substitution of two months where &ldquo;one month&rdquo; appears, and four months where &ldquo;three months&rdquo; appears.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not quite see the point.  It is not just a question of going in on a farm and sinking a well in one small place. If you are going to enter on land to prospect for oil&mdash;I know nothing about it&mdash;I assume that for that purpose heavy equipment will have to be taken on to the land, and there will be considerable disruption.  It is not just a question of going into one corner of a field and sinking a shaft.  The entire crop will be destroyed.  Everybody has to make alternative arrangements and four months does not seem to me to be a reasonable time to allow a family to remove all their equipment and find alternative accommodation.  Having said that, I am very grateful to the Minister for meeting me in some small respect.</P>

      <P>I am a bad bargainer. If I had stood out on the section as it stands, the Deputy would be more pleased when I ultimately met him.  I probably made my offer too soon, but I should like to remind him that the occasions when a house will be pulled down will be very rare. The situation will probably never arise, and probably the ancillary rights required may be in respect of only a small strip of land, over which a railway track will be required to run, and probably some little corner of land when ingress and egress might be affected.  In general, I do not expect that bulldozers will be running riot through a person's land.</P>

      <P>Before Section 25 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In this section &lsquo;State land&rsquo; has the same meaning as in the State Property Act, 1954 (No. 25 of 1954).</P>
      <P>(2) Whenever the Minister is of opinion that it is necessary, for the efficient or convenient exploitation of petroleum to which a petroleum lease applies, that the lessee should be granted the right to use any State land, the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may grant to the lessee a permit (in this Act referred to as a working facilities (State land) permit), to use such land.</P>
      <P>(3) Whenever the Minister is of opinion that it is necessary, for the efficient or convenient exploitation of petroleum to which a petroleum lease applies, that the lessee should be granted any ancillary right in relation to State land, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, grant to the lessee a permit (in this Act also referred to as a working facilities (State land) permit) to exercise that ancillary right.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to empower the Minister to grant the right <Col N="870" /> to use State land and ancillary rights in relation to State land, to any person who may need them for the proper exploitation of petroleum deposits. Sections 21 and 24 of the Bill which deal with the use of land, state that ancillary rights may be granted only in respect of land, and facility rights secured, by means of Ancillary Rights Acquisition Orders.

It could happen, however, that in investigating the claim by landowner <Col N="873" /> Lynch, it would be necessary for them to go on to the land of landowner Sweetman, who knows nothing about the application before the Board; in those circumstances, there should be provision that the Board must give due and adequate notice to the owner of such land, if he is not a party to the actual proceedings.

    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, the Minister can determine the compensation payable in respect of petroleum, provided that there is only one claim.  As an alternative, he can refer the claim to the Mining Board.  On further consideration, it is felt that the Minister should, in practice, refer all applications for compensation to the Mining <Col N="876" /> Board, irrespective of whether there is only one claim, or more than one claim for compensation.  In effect, it is entrusting to the Mining Board rather than the Minister the investigation of claims for compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the Minister's attention to what appears to be an anomalous provision in the section to which this amendment applies?  It provides that where petroleum&mdash;and that includes by definition in the definition section, gas and all other things appertaining to petroleum&mdash;</P>
      <P>is for the first time brought to the surface at a petroleum well and used or sold by the lessee...</P>
      <P>Does that mean that a lessee can come on my property, bore a hole, discover gas and simply say that it is not worth his while to pipe it, and let it blow away.  It is to be remembered that in the early stages of oil exploration, millions and millions of cubic feet of gas were allowed to blow away, as if it were of no importance.  It is only in relatively recent times that people have proceeded to control and pipe it.  I can well imagine a situation arising in which a company who are primarily concerned in oil would discover supplies of gas in a remote area, say, in the west of Ireland, and say to themselves: &ldquo;The only centre in which we could reasonably anticipate this gas being profitably consumed would be a centre like Dublin, and the piping of this from here to Dublin is not worth while and we shall not do anything with it.&rdquo;  In those circumstances, has the lessor no remedy at all?  Has the Minister no power to require them to control the gas, if he thinks it is proper that that should be done?</P>

      <P>The Minister knows we have no desire to set traps.  I simply direct his attention to this and I do not ask him to answer me now.  There is a definition which reads:</P>
      <P>...that a petroleum operation is being conducted in such a manner (whether by act or omission) as to cause loss, contamination, deterioration or misuse of petroleum products or other minerals which would not normally occur if the operation were conducted in accordance with good oilfield practice...</P>
      <P>I do not believe that definition is precise enough to give the Minister the power he believes he has.  It could be shown to the Minister that in many oilfields in the world at the present time in parts of Persia and in certain of the more remote places where the facilities for the ready transport of gas as distinct from oil do not exist, it is considered to be a sound oilfield operation to allow the gas to be dissipated or to set fire to it.</P>
      <P>I am not setting up to be a petroleum expert.  I am merely directing the attention of the Minister to something I apprehend may be true.  I cannot conceive of any deposit, either of gas or oil, occurring in this country which from a national point of view could not with advantage be turned to use, but an oil company, claiming to have this section interpreted in the context of world practice of oilfields, could make a very strong case that the Minister had no right to require them to control gas and use it if they could demonstrate to him that they were not going to make an adequate profit on the capital invested in the operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>Before Section 36, but in Chapter VI of Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the adjudication by the Board of claims for compensation referred to the Board under section 34 of this Act, the following persons, and no others shall be entitled to appear, be heard and adduce evidence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister,</P>
      <P>(b)  every claimant.</P>
      <P>In the Bill as it originally stood, there was no provision as to the persons who would be entitled to appear and be heard before the Mining Board in respect of claims for compensation for petroleum and this amendment makes the provision which is necessary in this regard, that is, that only the Minister and the claimant or claimants will be entitled to appear. The claimants will, of course, be permitted to be represented by solicitor or solicitor and counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not expressed in the Bill, and the Minister's amendment would appear to cut out the possibility of a claimant being represented by a legal adviser.  The explanatory memorandum says the claimants and their legal advisers may appear before the Board but the Bill then proceeds expressly to cut out legal advice by introducing the phrase &ldquo;and no others.&rdquo;  If the Minister does intend&mdash; and I am prepared to accept his assurance&mdash;that people may attend with their legal advisers, he should put it in the Bill.  As it stands at the moment, the Bill is open to the interpretation that legal advisers may not attend because the Bill says the people <Col N="879" /> who may attend are: &ldquo;the following persons, and no others: (a) the Minister, (b) every claimant.&rdquo;  That puts the claimant in the position that if he appears before the Board and wants to bring a solicitor or barrister with him, he may be told: &ldquo;You are the claimant and you and no other may appear before this Board.&rdquo;  I deprecate the introduction of that phrase.</P>
      <P>I likewise deprecate the absence of the words &ldquo;legal adviser&rdquo;.  There should be some indication to the Board or the High Court, if the High Court were asked to state a case, that it was the intention of the Legislature &mdash;apart from what the Minister may say here&mdash;and the Legislature expressed its intention to enable claimants to be represented by legal advisers.  I ask the Minister to accept some such amendment both in respect of his own amendment and the amendment in the names of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and myself to Section 41. I think there could be no objection whatsoever to such an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy Barrett, namely, that if the phrase &ldquo;and no others&rdquo; were not included in the Minister's amendment before us now and again in Section 41, it could be assumed, and reasonably assumed, that a person was entitled to be represented by his agent whether he be solicitor or counsel, whoever is there to speak for him.  It does seem to me that even though there may be a precedent for this phrase, its use specifically precludes anyone except the persons listed in the Bill from appearing or being heard.  I think the matter can be dealt with either on the lines suggested by Deputy Barrett or else by a slight amendment to the Minister's amendment so as to make it read that the following persons and no others shall be entitled to appear, <Col N="880" /> be represented, heard and adduce evidence; so that the question of representation would be introduced instead of appearance.  Appearance in the legal sense connotes appearance through a representative but in the Bill as it stands it does not.</P>
      <P>If the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; were used it would be broad enough to include a person's legal adviser.  As Deputy Barrett has pointed out, in the White Paper issued with the Bill the reference to Section 41 seems to me, while I am not questioning the good faith of the Minister and his advisers, to state that there is something in Section 41 which is not in it.  The White Paper sets out the claimant person and his legal advisers.  That phrase &ldquo;and his legal advisers&rdquo; does not appear in the Section.  The fact that it appears in the White Paper shows a discrepancy which the Minister should cover.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the contention in the White Paper.  If the Minister's contention is correct that legal advisers are permitted to attend, I cannot see why anyone else cannot walk in on another person's behalf.  I do not think that is what the Minister intends.  There has been a suggestion made behind me here that a local Deputy can appear for a claimant before the Board.  From a reading of Section 41 and of the amendment, it would appear that anyone could attend on behalf of a claimant and I do not think that is what is in the Minister's mind.  The secretary of a body such as a Landowners' Convention could appear. What the Minister wants to ensure is that if I am looking for compensation <Col N="881" /> somebody else, who has nothing to do with my case, cannot come in and clutter it up with the irrelevancies.  It is quite easy to simplify the two things in a few words.  It is only a matter of drafting and both circumstances could be dealt with by a short sub-section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can there be any objection to adding three or four more words to this Bill?  Some of the amendments have been very verbose and certainly there has been no shortage of words on the part of the Department or the Drafting Office. When you talk about the Minister being entitled to appear, you mean the Minister's legal advisers and when you talk about the claimant being entitled to appear you should mean the claimant's legal advisers.  If a claimant who has no experience of these matters is compelled to go in on his own and if it could be held that he is not entitled to be legally represented, I do not quite like the kind of deal that such a person might get.  I suggest that we should clarify this matter and make it quite clear that a claimant can be represented and send his legal representatives.</P>

It may be that the inclusion of the extra few words in these two sections might require substantial amendment to the 1940 Act but I shall look into it between now and the Report Stage, and I think I shall be <Col N="882" /> able to meet the requirements of Deputies.</P>

      <P>The section describes the type of person entitled to be present.  Under paragraph (c), it allows to be present any person claiming to have an estate or interest in the land, mineral deposits or water supplies in respect of which compensation is claimed.  Does that mean a person must establish he has a personal interest in the mineral deposits, the water supplies or the land?  Would it be possible, for example, for a county manager to turn up and say that if this affects the water supply in a particular town, he should be entitled to come along?  Would the local county councillor, for example, be entitled to go along and see in what way the potential amenities of his area were being affected by this section?  In other words, must a person establish a personal interest in these matters such as mineral deposits, water supplies and the land, in order to be present; or is it sufficient to entitle him to be admitted if he has a special interest in these aspects of the matters referred to?</P>

      <P>May I put another case to the Minister, which, I think, may have been overlooked?  The Minister is, perhaps, familiar with the fact that when open-cast mining was proceeded with in England, the Coal Board proceeded to open-cast mine under the <Col N="885" /> drawing room window of Wentworth Boathouse which gave rise to considerable difficulty.  The proprietor of that ancient residence was entited to make representations, but what fills me with anxiety is that Deputy Davern, having built himself a nice villa on the outskirts of Cashel, will find when the building is finished and his french window is open to the autumn and spring breezes, that somebody has erected a steel derrick right in front of him.  As I read this, Deputy Davern has no right at all to appeal and say: &ldquo;It is true they have not interfered with the structure of my house, but they have made it quite unlivable and I am entitled to compensation.&rdquo;  I cannot find in any part of these definitions that a person whose minimum amenities are destroyed by the exploitation of oil deposits in the immediate vicinity of his buildings has a right to have his case heard.  Provision ought to be made for that in the light of the common experience, both in the oil fields of America and open-cast mining in Great Britain where certain individuals in fact have had their property very seriously depreciated by the unnecessary operation of works ancillary to the exploitation of steel and coal in the immediate vicinity of their houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, a married woman was refused payment of the higher rate of disability benefit as the deciding officer, who determined her claim, decided that she was not living apart from her husband.  On appeal, this decision was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>

I do not propose to change that policy because I believe it is an essential and vital one.  No number of red herrings will induce me to alter that course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not one red herring which the Minister is overlooking? Under the original scheme, the Minister required the canneries to tender to him and the Minister accepted the highest tender from one of the 17 canneries.  Under the scheme to which Deputy Wycherley is referring the farmers are required to tender to the canneries and the canneries are not operating the same competitive system that the Minister required them to operate when he was receiving tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there are many things in the world not perfect.  This scheme was introduced with a view to achieving certain objectives.  If it has weaknesses then they can be dealt with if it is possible.  What I am contending is that the scheme did not get a chance inasmuch as prior to its coming into operation I think some 12,000 cows were offered in a very short period of time, valued and purchased by the Department.  That had the effect of creating for the factories with whom we had a contract a certain amount of glut and the free competition provided for in the scheme to which I have referred did not in the early stages get a fair chance.  That is an entirely different matter from the proposition made to me by the Deputy who asked the question whether I am prepared to extend to 52 licensed meat firms, in addition to the 17 canners, the right to purchase cow reactors even though these places are not equipped, as we hold it is essential they should be, to deal with such animals properly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all over now. We purchased 10,000 cows under the new scheme and the glut to which I referred has disappeared because time has brought about that result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Every scheme introduced is entitled to a fair chance.  My contention is that it has not got that fair chance.  My attitude on this and on other matters is that if weaknesses are thrown up, as a result of the operation of a scheme under reasonable conditions, then surely it can be reconsidered and if the weak link can be eliminated there will be no hesitancy on my part to do so.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the matter to which he refers is one which I have under constant consideration.  If, like my predecessors, I have been unsuccessful in doing all that might be regarded as desirable, it is due to financial factors which, as the Deputy will appreciate, are not altogether within my control. I can promise, however, that the matter is one which I shall continue to keep in mind in the hope that circumstances will permit of an improvement. While it is true that there is no gratuity payable, the position in this regard has been improved since November 1957 by the granting of 91 days' pre-discharge leave with full pay and allowances to a soldier with 21 years' service instead of the 21 days previously granted, a concession which should prove of assistance to the soldier in making arrangements to return to civilian life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note the sympathetic ring in the Minister's <Col N="899" /> answer.  I hope it will not be long before he will effect the reform he has in mind.  The highest rate of pension which, say, a battalion sergeant-major &mdash;the highest non-commissioned rank in the Army&mdash;can receive after 31 years' service is £3 10s. a week if he is married and approximately £30 less per annum if he is not married.  He receives no gratuity on retirement. These rates for non-commissioned officers compare very unfavourably even with the rates paid to Army officers on retirement.  When an Army officer retires he receives a pension and a gratuity which the non-commissioned officer does not get.  Would the Minister give some further consideration to this matter in the hope that he will do something to improve the conditions of a section of the Army which in fact must really be its backbone?</P>

      <P>The total productive areas acquired by my Department for forestry purposes in County Kildare in those years were as follows: 1955-56, 96 acres; 1956-57, 215 acres; 1957-58, 537 acres; 1958-59, 431 acres and 1959-60 (todate), 93 acres.</P>
      <P>The average price per productive acre paid for this land, exclusive of timber and buildings, was as follows: 1955-56 £4.7; 1956-57, £8.1; 1957-58, £7.7; 1958-59, £5.9 and 1959-60 (todate), £3.4.</P>
      <P>As regards minimum and maximum prices, I must inform the Deputy that every block of land offered for forestry purposes is valued acre by acre and the price to be offered for the land is determined by reference to a scale of values ranging from £1 to £10 an acre.  The valuations placed on the lands acquired in County Kildare in the years in question ranged over the entire scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 43.  I think it is a hardship that the Land Commission are entitled to sequester the whole of the compensation money given if the amount of compensation did not exceed the redemption price of the annuity and the arrears.  I think the Minister himself will remember that prior to the passage of the Land Act of 1949, or that period, when the Land Commission were purchasing land under the old code, we had a number of cases in which, when the purchase price was fixed for land resumed by the Land Commission, it transpired that when the outstanding annuity had been redeemed, and the arrears of annuity redeemed, out of the purchase price, the owner was sometimes given a £5 note and put out on the road.  I think <Col N="912" /> it was with the general consent of this House that we substituted market value for the old code and that evil has now very largely disappeared.</P>
      <P>Here I apprehend that the Land Commission have approached the Department of Industry and Commerce and said: &ldquo;We want our customary protection in this petroleum and other minerals development legislation,&rdquo; and they have sought the insertion of Section 43.  What I apprehend is that we shall come smack up again against the situation in which some individual will find himself, or herself, effectively displaced from his or her holding&mdash;perhaps a small holding&mdash;and when compensation has been assessed, the Land Commission will step in and virtually scoop the pool.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is what this House wants.  I think we want to ensure that if a land holder has to be displaced from his home, he will be left in the position that he can get another holding to go to.  It would be wholly wrong if the impact of this Bill on one individual should be that owing to the accumulation of arrears, or the redemption value of his annuity, he would be put out on the road without another holding to go to.  I do not attribute any dark or sinister motives to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or to the Land Commission. I imagine that this is a kind of formal section they are always looking for.</P>
      <P>I apprehend that it may have, in certain cases, unreasonably severe results and I should be glad if the Minister would look at the question to ensure that the Land Commission would be required, if they wished to exercise their powers under this section, to provide the person against whom they wish to invoke these powers with an alternative farm, or something of that kind.  Some precaution should be taken to ensure that this subsection will not operate to take a man's holding from him and leave him with virtually nothing except a receipt from the Land Commission for annuities and arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case made by the Deputy in regard to the resumption of land is not quite parallel.  It is not envisaged that the person's entire land will be affected by <Col N="913" /> the necessity for an award of compensation. Take, for instance, the case of petrol.  If he is obliged to pay the arrears and to redeem State annuities, the compensation will be only in respect of a small part of his holding. He will have the right to continue on in occupation and he might even be a freer man in so far as the annuity will be redeemed.  It was a point that occurred to me when I was considering the Bill before Committee.  Having inquired, I was told that it was ordinary practice in such cases and that there was a similar provision in the 1940 Act.  However, I shall look into it further.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I shall have to take into account not only the Department of Lands but also the Department of Finance in this connection.  I shall have something to say about it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This is not inconsistent with ordinary practice.  Apart altogether from cases where the State is involved, as the Deputy is aware, there is a mode of legal procedure called garnishee.  If John O'Brien is indebted to John Murphy to the extent of £500 and if John Murphy, having <Col N="914" /> taken the necessary proceedings against John O'Brien for the £500 fails to get it, and if subsequently, and within a certain period, John O'Brien comes into £450 by way of damages in an accident, John Murphy can by way of garnishee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no reference to it.  This section only applies where compensation is payable by the Minister.  As the Minister is part of the institution of the State, and as the person to whom compensation is payable is indebted to the State, he is therefore, in a sense, indebted to the Minister.  I think it is not indefensible that the Minister should be empowered to require that person to pay his indebtedness to the State, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, out of the compensation the Minister for Industry and Commerce is paying to that individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I am not unreasonable in suggesting to the Minister that if the compensation has been determined by an arbitrator, the onus is clearly on the Minister to pay to the person entitled that compensation, but the determination of whether a debt is due and owing by that person to a Minister of State appears, by this section, to be at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would have no objection if the section said that where the Minister held a judgment for an amount against an individual, he could proceed to collect it from the proceeds of compensation which he is responsible for paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem from this section, if the Minister believed, or if any of his colleagues believed that the grantee of compensation, was in debt to any one of them, the Minister could withhold the money and pay it over to any of his colleagues, or the Revenue Commissioners, on foot of an alleged <Col N="915" /> debt and pass over to the grantee of compensation the obligation of trying to recover that money by civil process from the Government.  That seems rather hard to me.  Having got his award before an arbitration board, it seems hard to tell him that he can sue the Government, when he knows perfectly well that if he does, the Government will carry it to the Supreme Court because the Government will not admit their claim is unfair.  They will be trying, not that individual's specific claim against them, but some elaborate matter of principle on which they propose to act for all future time.  Therefore, they go to the highest court in the land in order to establish a principle on which they wish to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know of any other Bill in which this section is put down so nakedly?  I know there has been a practice that where you owe the State anything, the long arm of the State's law stretches out and you discover that instead of getting something the Minister for Defence owes you, a fair slice of it is being paid to the Revenue Commissioners in satisfaction of income tax.  That has been the practice, but I thought a lot of people were so ashamed of it because of its Shylock characteristics that nobody would be brazen enough to set it down in a Bill.  I must say it is the first time I have seen it in a Bill, although it may have escaped my notice in other Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>See what is possible under it.  You may find a man who is living a peaceful life down in some place in Cork, Tipperary or Kildare, and then the Ambassador Oil Company come along and move in and by the time they finish with his land a fair portion of it is unusable.  Some of his timber is destroyed; his outoffices are undermined; and generally <Col N="916" /> the whole place is a bit of a shambles as compared with its former condition.</P>
      <P>Then he negotiates with the Minister or perhaps the Minister may find it unnecessary to negotiate and he says compensation is payable to the man. This compensation is not a gift or a donation, in which case you might say: &ldquo;Instead of giving you this gift, we shall make you an honest man and shall pay some money that you owe.&rdquo;  But this is a case where a person has suffered some hardship.  He may succeed in persuading the Minister to give him some compensation and the Minister may say: &ldquo;I am prepared to give compensation but, really, you owe some other State Department money&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&ldquo;and we shall pay to the Revenue Commissioners the compensation otherwise payable to you for whatever hardship you suffered.&rdquo;  As a result of all this, the man is left in the position that he has damaged land and no compensation, but the Minister has enabled him, perhaps, to face with greater courage the next Revenue Commissioner he sees.  It is a rather melancholy form of compensation.</P>
      <P>I think this measure could operate pretty brutally.  I can understand the Minister making a deal with a man and saying: &ldquo;Look; you owe so much money and this is an opportunity of paying it off&rdquo;, but to put it down in a measure so that it is always before the Minister and so that his vigilant officials will always be sure to say to him: &ldquo;You are bound to have regard to section so-and-so because you have a responsibility there, is wrong.  I think this could operate very harshly.</P>
      <P>Under this section, the Minister could pay all the compensation in respect of a debt which the claimant of compensation disputes.  It does not mean that the State has to get a Court award against the man in order to make the deduction: all they have to do is make up their minds that he owes the money and, if he is disputing it, it does not matter.  They assume the liability which they think is there to be there in fact and they use the compensation money to discharge it.  I think this could be very unfair when you have a powerful State dealing with a weak man.</P>

That is by way of case <Col N="919" /> stated.

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>Before Section 49, in Chapter IX of Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) (a)  Regulations may provide for all or any of the following matters&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the siting and spacing of petroleum wells,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(ii)  the reduction of fire hazards at petroleum wells,</P>
      <P>(iii)  restrictions on the production of petroleum from boreholes commenced or completed nearer the boundaries of land to the petroleum under which a petroleum lease applies than the distance specified in the regulations,</P>
      <P>(iv)  the conservation of petroleum,</P>
      <P>(v)  restrictions on the disposal of water and waste products,</P>
      <P>(vi)  the blocking of abandoned boreholes,</P>
      <P>(vii)  the measurement of petroleum.</P>
      <P>(b)  If any person (being the licensee under a licence granted under this Part or the lessee under a petroleum lease) contravenes (by act or omission) any regulation made under this sub-section, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  (a)  If it appears to the Minister that a petroleum operation is being conducted in such a manner (whether by act or omission) as to cause loss, contamination, deterioration or misuse of <Col N="924" /> petroleum products or other minerals which would not normally occur if the operation were conducted in accordance with good oilfield practice, then, he may serve by registered post on the person conducting the operation a notice requiring him to take, within a specified time, such remedial action as will prevent such loss, contamination, deterioration or misuse occurring.</P>
    <P>(b)  If it appears to the Minister that a petroleum operation is being conducted in such a manner (whether by act or omission) as to cause or to be likely to cause unnecessary damage, then, he may serve by registered post on the person conducting the operation, a notice requiring him to take, within a specified time, such remedial action as will prevent such damage occuring.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where a notice is served under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection and the person on whom the notice is served (in this paragraph referred to as the defaulter) does not comply with the notice, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the defaulter shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the Minister may (whether proceedings have or have not been taken against the defaulter under sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph) take such remedial action as was required by the notice to be taken by the defaulter, and may recover any expenses incurred by him in doing so from the defaulter as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(d)  Where the Minister is entitled under subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of this subsection to recover any expenses, a certificate sealed with the official seal of the Minister and certifying the amount thereof shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the amount of such expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> (3)  Every person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding one hundred pounds for every day on which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the same set of facts constitutes an offence under both subsection (1) and subsection (2) of this section and the offender is charged with both offences, the offender shall be liable to be punished for one of the offences only.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to consolidate Sections 49 and 56.  These two sections overlap to an extent and it could so happen that one offence would involve separate penalties under the two sections, which, of course, would be inequitable.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister relying entirely on the agreement or is any portion of this new Section 49 relied upon in order to <Col N="926" /> enforce compliance with the obligation to work the deposits found in a workmanlike way in accordance with good husbandry in oil economics?

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;subparagraph (b), he will see that the Minister may serve a notice requiring the person conducting the operation to take, within a specified time, such remedial action as will prevent damage occurring.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relying on both, but this is directed only to the non-use of oil and to the proper use of oil.  I am relying on both the agreement and the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which enables the Minister to make the regulations.  The matters for which regulations can be made are set out in subsection (1) (a).  Does this enabling power permit the Minister to make a regulation, for example, to cover uncontrolled flow?  Does it permit the Minister to make a regulation under which an order can be made to shut in a well that is not being properly used? Does it permit the Minister to make regulations to provide allowable rates of production in the national interest about which we were talking earlier on?  The seven are there that are required in relation to regulations. Is it in this connection only that the Minister is taking the power to make regulations dealing with the operation of petroleum winning?  I never can get myself used to the phrase &ldquo;petroleum <Col N="927" /> mining&rdquo;.  Candidly, it does not seem to me that &ldquo;mining&rdquo; is a suitable word in relation to a viscous fluid.  Is there adequate provision in this enabling section to ensure that the regulations can provide what is required for blowout prevention?</P>
      <P>If I am right in thinking that this is only an enabling section, it seems to me that we have not got anything like enough power there, and there should be some general power as well, subject, of course, to the proper safeguard of tabling.  What exactly is covered by (vii)&mdash;the measurement of petroleum? Is that intended to cover measurement both from the point of view of royalty and from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners?  I imagine the Revenue Commissioners will have to have some control over crude oil because, otherwise, there could be wholesale evasion of excise duty.  If there is petroleum here, the regulations that have to be made are of a far more detailed and difficult nature than are dismissed so lightly in these first seven headings.  There is not much point in our providing this statute except on the basis that, if petroleum is found, it will be workable.  If the Minister looks up other legislation, he will find that there is not sufficient here to enable petroleum to be operated properly. Perhaps he has the power elsewhere.  I should like to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to an abandoned well, I agree.  The case I am interested in is where the Minister thinks it is not working properly and the only safe thing to do is to cover it.  The well is not abandoned.  If it is abandoned, the power is there.  If it is not abandoned, it is just a wrong job and dangerous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (2), if portion of the well is conducted in such a manner as to cause loss, contamination, deterioration or misuse, then the Minister has power to serve a notice and to require within the prescribed time that steps are taken to <Col N="928" /> prevent such misuse or loss.  I am advised that clause (iv) dealing with the conservation of petroleum is sufficient to cover uncontrolled flow and the using of a limited supply in the national interest.  I do not know whether there are other points that might arise but, if there are, they can be looked into in the interval between now and the Report Stage to ensure that we have covered every possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>Before Section 49, in Chapter IX of Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a royalty rent has been fixed, by an award made under the Mines and Minerals Act, 1931 or by an agreement made under that Act, as compensation for petroleum acquired under that Act, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a royalty rent has been fixed, by an award made under the Minerals Development Act, 1940 or by an agreement made under that Act, as compensation for petroleum acquired under that Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the said royalty rent, in respect of so much if any of that petroleum as is brought to the surface at a petroleum well within the appointed area in relation to that petroleum well (as defined by subsection (1) of section 30 of this Act), shall, in lieu of being at the rate fixed by the relevant award or agreement, be at a rate which bears to the rate fixed by the relevant award or agreement the same proportion as that part of the <Col N="930" /> area to which the relevant award or agreement relates and which is inside the said appointed area bears to the said appointed area.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to cover an omission in the original Bill.  There are in existence a number of awards and agreements under the Mines and Minerals Acts of 1931 and the Minerals Development Act, 1940, which provide for the payment not only of a royalty in respect of the principal minerals involved, for example, gypsum, copper, coal, etc., but also of a further royalty covering all other minerals which may be brought to the surface.  These agreements or awards arise from the compulsory acquisition by the Minister of the mineral rights in certain localities and while the incidental royalties relating to subsidiary minerals generally were not designed to include petroleum, nevertheless petroleum must be regarded as coming within the ambit of these awards or agreements, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The terms of these awards and agreementss must be honoured and this renders it necessary to make provision in the Bill for the payment of compensation in respect of petroleum which is brought to the surface in any of the areas in respect of which awards or agreements of the kind I have referred to are in existence.</P>
    <P>The amendment achieves this object and provides that compensation shall be payable at a rate which bears to the rate fixed by the relevant award or agreement the same proportion which the portion of the area concerned which lies within the appointed area bears to the appointed area.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has delivered himself into my hands; in other words, subsection (1) of Section 50 has the effect not of taking it away from the State but of taking it away from the local authorities.  Surely the Minister is not expecting the county council in Waterford, if oil were found there, to compensate the State by way of extra royalties instead of getting the normal rights they would get.  That is what the section means.  If the fact of excluding it from valuation meant excluding it from something that was collected from the State, then I could see the Minister's point of view, because he would say we are getting it the other way.  But it is not the State that is getting the knock; it is the local authority.  It is not reasonable to expect the Minister to be generous in his behalf at the expense of a local authority.  I am not sure whether this is a good principle in sub-section (1) for the development of initiative, but if it is a good principle, it should not be applied only in the case of the rich oil company and rejected in the case of the small man engaged in the cutting of turf on his bog.  The Minister must remember, and many Deputies will remember, the enormous number of revaluations there were when turf was cut during the emergency.  This provision is to say that is not to be done in respect of an oil well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is the provision in relation to what I might call hard minerals.  I do not know what the <Col N="932" /> word for minerals other than oil is, but what is done in relation to Avoca?  Does Avoca not have to pay rates?  I think they do.  I am quite sure Silvermines had to pay rates or were assessable to rates.  Why, of all cases, should the exception be made in respect of the rich petrol company if any exception is to be made?  If any hole is to be punched in the Valuation Office procedure, this is the worst possible case in which it can be done.</P>

      <P>After 20 years I shall not be very interested in what the rates are in county Kildare.  The Minister made the case that the reason they were being relieved from the <Col N="933" /> liability to pay rates was that they were paying such generous royalties to him.  That is a good reason all right for relieving Ambassador of the payment, but now I am asking the Minister to do the rest of the job, to give back to the county council out of these very generous royalties, the amount he is taking from the county council in the section.  He is getting, he says himself, generous royalties.  If that is so, if the reason he has put this section in is that he wants to get generous royalties, is it not right to compensate the county council out of these royalties?</P>

It is not unreasonable that having regard to these expenses, the Minister should be relieved of the obligation of paying to the county council rates for 20 years.

As it stands persons are obliged to notify the Minister of their intention to sink shafts or boreholes regardless of whether they are for the purpose of searching for petroleum or developing a known petroleum deposit. There is no practical object in requiring persons to notify the Minister about the drilling of boreholes which are of exploratory significance only and this obligation is now being removed.

      <P>&ldquo;Sell&rdquo;&mdash; that visualises an out and out sale, as apart from leasing.  Does that mean that by this section we are giving the Minister power to sell whatever petroleum there is under the national territory for one lump sum?  Surely that is not intended.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In this, the obvious inference is that he would be entitled to sell unworked minerals.  The intention is that the powers given here would apply only to limited areas and I cannot envisage a situation arising, even though, strictly speaking, it could, that the Minister would sell the entire deposits of a certain mineral, although unworked, in the State.  That is true. I am informed that it is on the advice of our own draftsman that this was put in in case the occasion arose at any time that the Minister might require to sell some mineral, not necessarily petroleum.  As I said originally, this Part of the Act deals with amendments to the 1940 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the Minister will understand that there is a <Col N="946" /> great deal of difference between selling worked minerals and selling unworked minerals.  This section as phrased at present empowers the selling of unworked minerals and I do not think that is a power which should be taken. I can understand, as I said, that this was put in on the advice of the draftsman because, if it were not put in, there would not be any power. Equally, I know it is the common practice of all Departments to tell their draftsmen to put in everything they can possibly think of.  This is a power that should not be put in and I think, on reflection, the Minister will agree that the whole tenor of our mineral legislation is that in relation to unworked minerals they are to be dealt with by leasing and a royalty coming out of the leasing.</P>
      <P>Between this and the next stage, I shall have a look at some of the speeches the Minister made when I was sitting over there, when he was attacking Deputy Norton and myself on the basis that we had sold the minerals.  In fact, we had not; we had leased them.  Then the attack was that it was altogether improper to sell them, although we had not sold them, but now the Minister is here putting in an express proviso deliberately to sell.  I do not think that is wise; I think it is quite the reverse, and I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this section between now and Report Stage.</P>

I do not know whether it was Mianraí Teoranta that sold the deposits or if the Department or the Government or the State had any interest in these deposits.

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>Before section 71 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section &ldquo;State land&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the State Property Act, 1954 (No. 25 of 1954).</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister is of opinion that it is necessary, for the efficient or convenient exploitation of minerals to which a State mining lease applies, that the lessee should be granted the right to use any State land, the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may grant to the lessee a permit (in this Act referred to as a mining facilities (State land) permit) to use such land.</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister is of opinion that it is necessary, for the efficient or convenient working of minerals to which a State mining lease applies, that the lessee should be granted any ancillary right in relation to State land, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, grant to the lessee a permit (in this Act also referred to as a mining facilities (State land) permit) to exercise that ancillary right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> (4)  Every mining facilities (State land) permit shall be granted on such terms and conditions as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may determine.</P>
    <P>(5)  A person to whom a mining facilities (State land) permit is granted shall as consideration therefor pay to the Minister such sum as the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may determine.</P>
    <P>It has been found that the Minerals Development Act, 1940, is defective in as much as the existing powers to grant facilities in respect of land and ancillary rights to persons who require those facilities to develop mineral deposits are not capable of being exercised in respect of State lands.  This is due to a technical defect in the wording of Section 19 of the Act of 1940.  The defect is remedied by this amendment which provides that the Minister may by permit grant a right to use any State land or ancillary rights in relation to State lands to persons who require these facilities for the efficient exploitation of minerals. If that amendment is accepted there is a consequential amendment, amendment No. 40, to which we referred a few minutes ago.  I do not think there is any question of difficulty in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It is going back to the original.  It is legislation by reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only note I have here does not refer to whether a person may lay it underneath a person's house.  I am told that in an extreme case where the laying of a pipe would <Col N="952" /> be necessary under a building full compensation would require to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not even thinking about compensation.  I was assuming that.  If it is absolutely necessary to lay a pipe line through a particular place, the pipe line has got to be laid but I do not want to see a situation in which the person laying the line is arbitrarily entitled and the only person entitled to decide where it is going to be laid.  If the owner of the property and the layer of the line cannot agree, is there any provision for anybody to arbitrate between them as to whether it must go north or south?</P>

      <P>Section 42, sub-section (1) of the original Act provides that any person, having an interest in the land and where he requires such land for supporting a building already erected or about to be erected, can apply to the Minister for an Order restraining any person proposing to lay a line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>Before Section 76 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 73 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the deletion in subsection (1) of &lsquo;and the Board may in any case disallow the costs of counsel&rsquo;,</P>
      <P>(b)  by the substitution for subsection (2) of the following new subsection&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  The Board may, with the consent of the parties concerned, fix the amount of costs ordered to be paid or, in default of such consent, may refer the <Col N="953" /> costs to a Taxing-Master for taxation.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>That is to empower the Board to refer to a Taxing Master.  That obligation is in the 1940 Act as well as in the new Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;(2A) Every person who keeps in pursuance of subsection (2) of this section a journal of a shaft or borehole shall, if so requested by the Minister, furnish to him a copy of the journal and a site map, which site map shall be returned by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 75 of the 1940 Act provides that the Minister must be given notice of the sinking of shafts and boreholes and that the person sinking shafts and/or boreholes <Col N="954" /> must keep a journal.  The purpose of amendment No. 45 is to make it obligatory on the person who keeps the journal to furnish a copy of the journal to the Minister.  It imposes a greater obligation.</P>
