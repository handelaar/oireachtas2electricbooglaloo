    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is prepared to make known the report made by an inspector of factories following a complaint of dangerous ship's gear on the M.V. <i>Soemba</i> in Cork on 29th August, 1958: and if he will give an assurance that in future cases the opinion of the inspector on the condition of ships' discharging gear will, if requested, be communicated to the workers or their representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of a report made to me by an Inspector of Factories under the Factories Act, 1955, would be in breach of the confidential nature of such reports and contrary to long-established practice in the matter.  I would be unable, therefore, to disclose the contents of the report referred to in the Question, or of any similar report which may be made to me in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that in the case referred to in this question there were clear indications that the ship's discharging gear was in a highly unsatisfactory and dangerous condition, that the dockers concerned, through their responsible trade union, sought for some kind of certificate as to the condition of the gear and that because this adjudications was not forthcoming a withdrawal of labour occurred?  Does the Minister feel it desirable that the regulations should be such that when dockers reasonably question the conditions of the gear, stoppage of work may occur in the further?  Does the Minister not think it reasonable and fair that some provision should be made in a matter such as this, in which these people are vitally concerned, whereby they would have some machinery through which they could get an immediate adjudication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what happened. I understand the trade union concerned immediately contracted the factories inspector.  He immediately went to the site and inspected the gear. <Col N="1254" /> The gear was not in fact subsequently used in the discharge of the ship.  It seems to me there is some misunderstanding about the function of factories inspectors.  Their duty is to warn people operating apparatus, gear or machinery they think is unsafe that they are liable to penalty on continuing to do so.  In this case, once the warning was given by the inspector, no attempt to use the defective equipment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be under a misapprehension.  Is he not aware that the trade union sought that advice from the inspector and he refused to disclose whether or not the gear was in a dangerous condition? Surely it was not to be expected that the dockers concerned were to risk their lives while the inspector fiddled around about sending a report to the Minister?  Incidentally, no definite reply was received by the union from the date of the occurrence in August until the 31st February this year.  A stoppage of work occurred and I am simply asking the Minister does he think it desirable that these stoppages should occur because of what appears to be a flaw in the operating machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the factories inspector had notified the owners of the ship that the gear was defective&mdash;as he did in this case&mdash;they should have stopped work until they had made alternative arrangements for discharging. The purpose of the inspector is to ascertain the facts.  If he is of opinion that defective gear is being used, he can warn the owner of the legal penalties to which he leaves himself liable by continuing to use it.  That is the limit of his functions.  The actual determination of the legal penalty is, of course, a matter for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is some force in the point made by Deputy Casey?  The dockers were asked to unload a vessel which had defective gear and it was so certified by the factories inspector.  However, they did not know he had so certified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1255" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Casey stated the complaint was made in August and no decision was conveyed to the union until February of the following year. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect that dockers, whose lives are in danger if defective gear is used, should have some information conveyed to them that the gear was in fact defective and dangerous in use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not the circumstances in the case.  In this case a wire rope, to which was attached a bucket, broke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The bucket fell into the hold where the workers were working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the inspector was there within half an hour and when he had inspected the gear and the alternative equipment it was proposed to use, he conveyed his opinions to the owners as to their quality.  The owners immediately acted on his opinion and made alternative arrangements for loading the ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point. The owners insisted even at that stage that the remaining part of the gear was not dangerous and that the dockers should proceed with the unloading of the ship with the alternative gear.  The trade unions were unable to have any authoritative statement from anybody as to whether this ship's gear was dangerous or not. Naturally, they were not going to risk the lives of workers and they withdrew their labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the inspector fulfilled this functions.  He went to the owners of the ship and expressed the opinion that the alternative gear they proposed to use was equally defective and that, if they used it, they would leave themselves liable to Court proceedings.  They did not, therefore, proceed to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not conveyed to the dockers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the factory inspector is entitled to go and tell the owners to put their house in order but he is not entitled to warm <Col N="1256" /> the men that they are endangering their lives if this defective gear is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 98 of the Health Act, 1947, as amended by Section 41 of the Health Act, 1953, provides that not less than half of the persons who are appointed to be members of the National Health Council shall be appointed by the Minister on nominations of bodies which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of the medical and ancillary professions and of persons concerned with the management of voluntary hospitals.  The Irish Medical Association has in the past been accepted for the purpose of this provision as a body representative of the medical profession and for some years past three nominees of the Association have been appointed to the Council.</P>

Are we likely to get an early settlement of this matter by a boycott on the one hand and a lock-out on the other?

As a matter of fact members of the Labour Party have been pressing me in relation to the Mallow incident to announce a decision which, after very deep consideration, I have announced and which I intend to stand over.  I am not responsible for the fact that the I.M.A. have taken the action which they have embarked upon&mdash;what Deputy Norton calls a strike&mdash;without giving any notices, nor for the fact that, in the middle of negotiations with the representatives of the local authorities who employ county physicians, county surgeons and all the other members of the medical and surgical staff of local authorities, they have taken what Deputy Norton describes as strike action&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have had no notice at all of the objections which have been taken in relation to any medical or surgical appointment under the local authorities by a local authority.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In May, 1957, the Irish Medical Association requested a discussion with officers of my Department concerning a review of the terms of service of County Surgeons and the alleged worsening of the conditions of service of these officers following the implementation of the Institutional and Specialist Services sections of the Health Act, 1953.  The Association requested that representatives of the County Managers be invited to the proposed discussion.</P>
      <P>In reply, the Association were informed that I was of opinion that it would be more appropriate that the matter should be discussed in the first instance between the Association and the City and County Managers' Association.</P>
      <P>After further correspondence, the Association informed me on the 31st July, 1957 that they were requesting the City and County Managers' Association to receive representatives of the County Surgeons' Group to discuss the conditions of service of these officers.</P>
      <P>My reason for suggesting that the matter should be discussed with the Managers is that County Surgeons are officers of health authorities and under Section 6 (1) of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, any proposal for an increase in remuneration must emanate from the Manager, who must obtain the consent, be resolution, of the members of the local authority before he can submit it to the Minister.  My statutory function is to approve or refuse to approve, as the case may be, any such proposal submitted to me by the Manager with the prior approval of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the meeting between the County Surgeons' Group <Col N="1261" /> of the Irish Medical Association and the Managers took place on the 12th June, 1958 and that, after an amicable discussion, the meeting was adjourned to enable the Country Surgeons' Group to prepare a statement setting out their claim and giving factual figures.  I am also informed that no such memorandum has yet been received by the Managers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Is it a fact that, even if the Minister were sympathetic to granting increased remuneration to the county surgeons and other officers of local health authorities, he is debarred from doing so until the appropriate local authority first passes the increase?  Did I hear the Minister correctly?  Is it not a fact that the local authority must first deal with the application for an increase in remuneration passed on to them by the manager and then, if they accept the manager's recommendation to grant an increase in remuneration, it comes before the council and, if they pass it, it then has to go to the Minister and the Minister's sole function is to accept that or reject it?  Is that the position?</P>

      <P>The manager shall not submit any proposal to fix an increased or reduced rate of remuneration applicable to any class, description or grade of office or employment for the sanction of such Minister as may be empowered to sanction the proposal save with the consent by resolution of the local authority.</P>

      <P>A pupil is not eligible for enrolment in a class in a secondary school for the purpose of his recognition as a pupil in respect of whom capitation and other grants may be paid to the Manager of the school unless he is sufficiently advanced in knowledge and intelligence to enable him to follow, with reasonable success, a course of secondary education.  In order to test their eligibility for such recognition the manager is required to hold an entrance examination of all new pupils on or <Col N="1265" /> before the 15th October each year. Pupils who have passed certain specified examinations may be exempted from the entrance examination, if the manager so desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the words used by the Deputy, &ldquo;less brilliant&rdquo;, hardly apply to the case.  The examination is of the primary leaving standard, which is sixth standard, and I do not think it requires great brilliance, at any rate, to pass it.  The intention is to ensure that secondary education will avail the young person receiving it.  If he is not able to pass an examination of the standard required, I think he is better advised to seek education in another form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what other form?  There are certain children who may be of less than average intelligence but who could absorb secondary education if regard was had to considerations other than this test.  In view of that, would the Minister not to prepared to instruct the people who carry out these examinations to include reports of the pupil's progress over the primary school years, in other words, not to base it entirely on this test but to take into consideration the pupil's record over the years that he spent in the primary school? Am I correct in assuming that, if a pupil does not pass this one test, he is immediately shot down and refused? Is that the position at the moment?</P>

      <P>I do not believe the circumstances under which these tests are carried out are as stringent as the Deputy suggests.  I am sure ample allowance is made in respect of any young person who has had a reasonably good primary school course, in order to permit him to do a secondary school course.  I do not think there is any great stringency.</P>

It will be possible, I am sure, to make some estimate of the progress of business in the Seanad and to give the Opposition some indication of what is likely to happen in that regard.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1958.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, empowers the Government to limit by order the importation of sugar under licence.  Each such order operates for one year only so that each year at this time, for the past 23 years, a motion in these terms has been submitted to and approved by the Dáil.  This is the annual motion designed to keep arrangements for the importation of sugar the same as they have been hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that since the <Col N="1268" /> matter was before the Dáil last year this country has become a party to the International Sugar Agreement.  It did so in October of last year.  The principal objects of that agreement are to maintain stable conditions in the world sugar market.  The first International sugar Agreement was negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations in 1953.  It was decided at that time not to adhere to it and that decision was reaffirmed in 1956 when an International Conference to consider amendments to the original agreement was held.</P>
    <P>A new agreement has now been framed which does not differ in any substantial degree from the old agreement and we have decided to adhere to it because we found that last year our non-membership of the agreement was reacting unfavourably on our recently developed export trade in sugar.  Indeed, towards the end of last year because of our non-participation in the agreement that trade was brought to a standstill.</P>
    <P>The agreement requires countries adhering to it to buy sugar in certain circumstances only from those countries which have signed the agreement. In the circumstances now prevailing it seems to be in our interest to be members and, indeed, the circumstances which led to a decision otherwise in 1953 and in 1956 have also changed in so far as all the important sugar-producing countries, including Brazil and Peru, are now within the agreement.</P>

      <P>But we import sugar too.  We imported sugar last year.  I asked the Minister a question last year about this and he practically denied that we were importing sugar from Iron Curtain countries.  Evidently the Minister had not read a reply from the Taoiseach, in the form of a tabular statement; in which it was stated we had imported over 879,000 cwt. of sugar from Eastern Germany and Poland.  I saw the sacks that came off the boats and I was told by people who are familiar with the language that the sacks were Russian in origin.  If we join this Organisation and if we have to purchase sugar abroad, we should purchase it from countries outside the Iron Curtain.  If we are not able to purchase it from them, then we should not purchased it from the countries. behind the Iron Curtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the importation of sugar provided our own people are first allowed to grow all the best they can here.  It is not right that our own people should be prevented growing beet here when, at the same time, we import sugar from elsewhere.  I object to any Minister or Government giving permission for the importation of sugar and, at the same time, refusing our own people the right to grow all the raw material needed either for our own domestic requirements or for our export trade. If the Minister is asked for a licence to import sugar he should make that licence contingent upon certain conditions. He should tell the applicant: &ldquo;Give me a certificate first that you are taking all the raw material that can be produced here and, when you produce that certificate, I will give you a licence to import any sugar you may require.  But, until you produce that certificate, I will not give you a licence to import as much as one ton of sugar.&rdquo;  If the Minister does not do that, he will be failing in his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He may contend that in order to provide for exports we must have cheap sugar.  I do not regard that as an adequate excuse.  Even if it is a little more costly, in the opinion of the Government, to produce sugar off our own soil, it must be remembered that it is a bit more costly to produce <Col N="1270" /> wheat off our own soil.  It must be remembered, too, that it is a bit more costly to manufacture machinery in our own factories as against imported machinery.  If imported machinery carries a tariff, I do not see why imported sugar should not carry a tariff also.  I do not see why we should import sugar in order to have cheaper sugar for exports of chocolate crumb and so forth.  Surely, it should be possible for the Government to meet the situation by means of subsidy. After all, the beet industry provides more employment than any other crop grown.  It is giving employment to people who badly need employment. The Minister will be failing in his duty if he does not insist on the type of certificate I have suggested from the Irish Sugar Company that they are prepared to take all the beet grown before he issues a licence for the important of sugar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what percentage of the home market was supplied by the Irish Sugar Company in the last year for which figures are available; secondly, what quantity of refined and underfined sugar was imported last year and could he say also whether, for the purpose of the export, trade, we are using the Irish produced sugar, or the imported unrefined or the imported processed sugar, in the confectionery articles which are being exported from this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy T. Lynch's point I think, if he studies the trade statistics, he will find that the bulk of the raw sugar imported here normally comes from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and countries in that part of the world but, in any event, that matter does not arise here.  What we gain by this agreement, is the right to export sugar to countries which are parties to the agreement, in the circumstances where these countries would have to confine themselves to countries that where adhering to the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crotty raised the point that he dealt with during the debate on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Apparently he was not <Col N="1271" /> here when I was replying to the debate and did not bother to read the Official Report since.  The position is that the Sugar Company is taking all the sugar beet they can handle and, for the first time, they are getting all they can handle.  There is no sense in the Sugar Company taking beet from farmers when there is no sugar in the beet. From the 1st October to the end of December, or the beginning of January at the latest, is the season when sugar is in the beet, and that represents the limit of their capacity to buy sugar beet from the farmers.</P>
    <P>They import raw sugar in the offseason and, by importing that raw sugar, not merely do they made it possible to supply all the requirements of sugar, both for home consumption and the export trade, but they are giving employment to workers in the factories during a period when they would otherwise be laid off.  Certainly I see no objection to that, and it would be no benefit to the farmers to disemploy these workers and stop that method of operating because it would not enable the Sugar Company to handle any more beet during the season of the beet harvest.</P>
    <P>The extent to which it would be possible for the Sugar Company to supply sugar to manufacturers of sugar products for export, at prices which would enable them to compete in export markets, is also a very relevant consideration.  The Sugar Company is, of course, producing from the home beet harvest alone enough sugar to supply our home sugar requirements.  The imports of raw sugar for refining here represent the quantity of sugar which is used here in manufacturing processes over and above our own needs of sugar products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  As the Deputy will understand, there are certain situations which exist and <Col N="1272" /> which require that the sugar should be of Irish origin to secure certain preferential rights in some markets and, naturally, only Irish sugar can be used for that purpose.  There must be a certificate accompanying the consignment of goods stating the origin of the sugar.  This price arrangement which enables the company to say to a manufacturer &ldquo;You can get your sugar for the export trade at the same prices as if you were free to import it from any part of the world&rdquo; is conditional on their present method of operation continuing and while, no doubt, prices of sugar in world markets fluctuate from time to time and it is not always correct to say that raw sugar can be purchased abroad and refined here giving sugar at a price lower than the sugar produced from Irish grown beet.  That happens to be the situation now and, of course, this agreement I refer to only comes into operation and these restrictions on the right to export apply only when sugar is below 4 cents per lb.</P>

      <P>What is true at the <Col N="1273" /> present time is that the factories are producing all our home requirements of sugar.  They are doing that from native beet alone.  The quantity they are getting out of the native beet harvest is meeting our home requirements for the first time.  They could handle more native beet if they could organise earlier deliveries, but Deputies must understand they must have a quantity of beet in stock before they can start the continuous process of extracting sugar.  Normally they cannot do that before the 15th or the 20th of October, but if they could get a stockpile ready to start operations on the 1st October they could take more beet from growers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote that the Minister for Lands moved last night in regard to forestry is, in my opinion, one of the most important to come before the House in the course of each year.  Naturally enough, forestry is not of as much interest to city Deputies as it is to rural Deputies but I believe that city people are much larger consumers of timber, good, and wood products than rural people and I think they might ask themselves, when they do make a purchase of timber, where it comes from and is it home produced or is it foreign? If the answer is that it is foreign they must then ask themselves &ldquo;Why have we not all our own supplies&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>During the course of the last ten or eleven years this Vote has grown to many times its original size.  I think I would be correct in saying that this year the Vote brings our total expenditure on forestry up to at least, approximately, £18,000,000.  Only £4 million was spent on forestry before 1948.  That is a sign of progress in this Department and both the Minister and the officials have a good deal on which to congratulate themselves.  It was a huge job to expand the programme from 4,000 acres to 25,000 acres which is the target for the season beginning in October next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to discuss forestry and the reaching of the proposed target of having a million acres of forestry on the land of this country where there has been little or no forestry we have to take into account the user of the land.  We have about 17 million acres of land all told.  Of that roughly 11½ or 12 million acres are arable land and 5 to 5½ million acres are waste land. There are about 3 or 3 ½ million acres of rough land which can be brought into full production.  Side by side with that there is a marginal or semiarable <Col N="1275" /> area the productivity of which could be increased by drainage and by means of the rehabilitation scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, when dealing with forestry, must confine himself to the poor portion of our lands.  That is the case in every country.  If we take the target of a million acres, whether it takes 50 years, 30 years or 20 years to achieve it, it is a step in the right direction.  I notice that in 1957, last year, and again this year the Minister has been very keen on economy.  He is very keen that the grumblers of the future will not be able to say, when these forests come to maturity, that the money would have been better spent if it had been invested at 3, 4 or 5 per cent. interest.  I want to warn the Minister against letting that idea encroach too far on his mind.</P>
    <P>Unlike other countries we are starting completely from the beginning in this country.  We have no tradition of forestry nor have we any experience except that gained since 1908, when Charles Stewart Parnell gave his own home to the nation for the growing of forests.  The only knowledge we have is the knowledge we have gained by trial and error.  With the exception of this country and England, that is not the case anywhere else.  The problem of other countries such as France, Italy and Germany is to utilise the existing natural forests that have been there for thousands of years.  We are in a completely different category.  We are the only country that has to establish forests right from the very start.  In those circumstances I often think of the good job that has been done by our forestry people and the very small percentage of failures that they have had.  We have no one to turn to for experience and our forestry officials have to realise that they have got to learn the hard way, by trial and error.  Their errors have been very small over the years.</P>
    <P>I want to run through various aspects of the Minister's brief and I want to point out that he has omitted what are, to my mind, two very important points.  He has ommitted to mention the total number of men at present employed and the plantable reserve.  I wonder would the Minister <Col N="1276" /> have these two figures at hand because they are fairly important?</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that receipts from timber thinnings had fallen £5,400 below the estimate.  Why did they fall?  Even if they had remained at the same figure as for the previous year I would still want to know why.  I should also like to know what amount of thinnings it is expected the new Scariff chipboard factory will take.  I should like to know too what sales in thinnings are taking place at home and if they are as much as was expected.  I am keen on these questions because we are spending a very large amount of money on the planting of trees.  These will be coming up to first and second thinning and then to maturity, and I would like to know what the produce of our forests will be.  There is no use planting trees if we do not know what we are to get for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Electricity Supply Board and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been taking some poles from the Forestry Department.  Again I would like to know how much they have taken and how they compare in finish and quality with the foreign poles they have been used to getting.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also if any progress has been made towards establishing a research section in the Department and what progress has been made towards finding the annual increment of growth in the existing forests, and towards the elimination of disease and pests in forests.  I am interested in these questions because a research department would be able to give us a fair idea of mineral deficiencies or other physical obstacles that might retard growth.  It had been intended to establish such a research station at Shelton Abbey.</P>
    <P>Last year I expected to see a report on small pulp mills from the D.P.A. This is an important matter and I think the Minister should now take the first step towards the establishing of our own pulp mill.  I am not running down the private industries but I want to warn the Minister that, human nature being what it is and the forests being State-owned, it is quite natural that the danger may <Col N="1277" /> arise that the private pulp mill owners will create a situation in the years to come when they will try to get the produce of our forests at their own price.  There would be only one way to meet such a situation.  That would be by having our own pulp mill.  That is a danger that has to be guarded against.  It is a very real danger. I would be very sorry to think, after the tremendous effort made for the last ten years to establish forestry, that the day would come when, through lack of foresight now, the produce of these forests would become merely food for a racket in this country.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in deducing that the plantable reserve is in the region of 56,000 acres?  Naturally the Minister is very conservative in this regard.  I do not want to lull him into a sense of false security by telling him he need not be alarmed at that figure.  I know he would like to see a figure of 80,000 acres.  So would I.  It would make for much better working.  Before the seeds are put into the new nursery beds in the Spring, it would be very nice to know exactly to the lb., the weight of seed and how many transplants were necessary for a three year planting programme.  Do not forget the big forestry drive is only nine or ten years old.</P>
    <P>The Minister's record over the past few years has been very creditable, but I think the time has come when he will have to increase the ceiling price for land.  A good many offers of land failed because the people selling felt they were not getting a fair price for it, rough mountain land as it was.  I agree with them.  I encourage as many people as possible to sell their land but, once they feel they are not getting a fair price, I cannot press the matter any further.  The present limit is about £12 for the best forestry land.  It is not sufficient.  In some cases £2 or £1 per acre has been offered.  That might be all right in cases of a vast expanse of poor quality land, but it would be the worst of bad management if the plantable reserve, because of the low ceiling price, was not kept up to maximum.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech the <Col N="1278" /> Minister dwelt on the danger of the plantable reserve not being sufficient. He said that the Department should be in a position to plan work programmes for individual forests in such a way as to provide a steady flow of work in the years ahead.  He added: &ldquo;We are now forced to arrange unduly large planting programmes at newly established forests in Western countries.&rdquo;  Along the western seaboard from Kerry to Donegal lies the largest pool of land for forestry. Almost all the available forest land in Wicklow has been bought up and planted and the same is true in many other countries.  The Minister will have to turn to the West.  During my term of office I deliberately encouraged a high percentage of planting each year in the West, and the figure crept up from 13 per cent. or 14 per cent. to 42 per cent. in 1957.  The Minister did not give us the actual percentage this year and I should like to have it.</P>
    <P>Not alone is the greatest area of forest land available in the western counties but it is there also that emigration and flight from the land are at its greatest, because of the poor quality of the land.  It is only through the operations of the forestry division that emigration can be stemmed and a certain population stabilised on the land.  The Minister himself said that Bord na Móna and forestry are the only two sources of permanent employment available in the rural areas at present.  Arterial drainage and other works are too spasmodic and would have no lasting effect.  That is true.  The Minister should concentrate on the West.  He cannot get much land in Meath, Kildare or the midland counties because the quality is very good.</P>

      <P>That is where the Minister will get the greatest portion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see the Minister is seeking increased staff for the acquisition section.  Up to a few years ago, with only three or four engaged in the work, that section was almost a joke. Even 20 men could not acquire 25,000 <Col N="1279" /> or 30,000 acres nowadays.  Most of the larger blocks of land have been bought up.  The Minister told us that last year 28,000 acres were acquired in 339 cases.  Each case entails a good deal of inspectors' time assessing the forestry value and the price of the land, and, of course, there is the usual wrangling over price which might drag out for months.  Even when all that is agreed there is further delay on the question of title.</P>
    <P>That brings me to ask the Minister what has been done towards utilising the provisions of the 1956 Act.  I did my best at all time to find and easy, honest and equitable way of taking over commonages.  It is no use saying that commonages are difficult.  Most of the forestry land in the western counties, after long years of usage by the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission, is now turned over to commonages with many tenants enjoying rights on a mountain. I should like to know if the provisions of the 1956 Act are working.  I have an interest in it.  By the time the change of Government took place it was not possible to have all the regulations made.  If there is any way, I can assist the Minister or if the Act needs amendment in any way, I should be only too glad to help the Minister if I can.  I suppose no commonages have been taken over under that Act?</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone over to large nurseries.  At first glance that appears to be more economical than a large number of small nurseries scattered all over the country.  But the small nurseries gave very useful employment in areas where no other employment, such as that from the county council, Bord na Móna or arterial drainage, was available.  I think the cost of transporting the transplants from the large nurseries to the various forests will eat up any little economy made.  I should like the Minister to go over that again with a magnifying glass because the curtailment of employment has been a pretty hard blow in certain areas.  I could name two or three with which I am familiar.</P>
    <P>The Minister was a little bit sketchy in what he told us about seeds.  How <Col N="1280" /> much home produced seed is used? What are the chances that some of the stands of timber planted 25 or 30 years ago will provide some, if not all, of the necessary seeds?  What is being done to establish seed orchards among some of the forests of the best trees we have at present?</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Minister has done what I tried to do but did not quite succeed in doing in regard to the question of providing a proper staff for road construction in forests.  That is something that was badly needed. I did not think it fair to ask foresters or forestry inspectors to engage in that work.  It is a special work completely outside their ambit but I must say that, even so, they earned my admiration for the excellent roads they made without any training at the job and without experience with the Board of Works or with county councils.</P>
    <P>One thing that struck me in connection with the few forests I was through in the last six or eight months concerns the making of roads.  Sometimes a road is made into a small nucleus plantation which will perhaps grow to 2,000 or 3,000 acres.  In the construction of such roads at present, is the expansion of these nuclei into large forests envisaged for the future? It would be a pity if money were wasted in the supposition that the forests would not grow or expand.  I think they will grow and that the roads should be made with that in mind.</P>
    <P>Reverting to thinnings&mdash;what percentage of those are sold standing? The desire was to sell all of them standing if possible.  How far has that policy succeeded?  What percentage of, say, this years, last year's and the thinnings of the year before, were sold standing and what percentage had to be extracted by the Department themselves?</P>
    <P>What new machinery does the Minister intend purchasing?  Under Subhead C.2 (6) he asks for £76,000 for the purchase and hire of machinery. I am not being critical, but that is a pretty large sum and I am simply asking what it is intended to buy and what is the particular work it will be required to do?  Is it just to renew ploughs to continue the mounting and <Col N="1281" /> drainage which was started in 1950 or 1951?  If so, I would ask the Minister to go ahead.  Hand-work is good in the sense that it has a certain labour content but while our young men are as hardy and as vigorous as ever I do not think it would be fair to ask them to engage in some of the work machinery can do nowadays.  If the Minister wants to do something with large tracts of land hitherto regarded as unplantable it can only be done by using machinery.  Wonderful work has been done in many areas by using machinery.  One particular forest so developed in my own county has been a great surprise to me where, even on the poorest land, the trees are already eight or nine feet high.  That shows that we have a favourable climate for forestry here.  Even on land that has been considered unplantable I believe plantations will, in time, be successful.</P>
    <P>Turning to the reserve of plantable land, I think there is nothing for the Minister to be gloomy about even if he has only 28,000 acres of which probably 25,000 or possibly 26,000 will prove to be plantable.  He should continue the pressure on acquisition and he should not shed any tears because we have not a three years' supply of plantable land on hands at present.  It is one of the growing pains which forestry has to suffer.  I admire, and I have every sympathy with the Minister in his drive to secure a reserve of 75,000 or 80,000 acres which would be necessary for the proper running of forestry schemes, but so far the programme has not suffered very much because this figure has not been reached.  The worst result is probably the slight extra cost involved because the men in charge of the nurseries do not know exactly what species of seeds to sow.  If we want to run our forestry programme properly we should have three years' supply of land in hand.</P>
    <P>I think it is very creditable that we have approximately 270,000 acres now planted.  Up to 1948, when the first inter-Party Government took office, I think the total area planted was only about 103,000 or 109,000 acres.  I am relying on memory and open to correction on that.  When <Col N="1282" /> 25,000 is added to this year's figure we shall not be so far from the 300,000.</P>
    <P>It is comforting and pleasant to know that most of the forests are doing well.  The Minister described some land as experimental; about 3 per cent. of the total is experimental.  I believe that as time goes on most of what has been described as unplantable up to now will be found plantable.  Comparisons with Scotland or Northern England are not completely true because our climate is much more favourable for timber or indeed any crop than the Scottish climate and what Scottish, English or Welsh forestry experts might consider as unplantable may, in fact, prove plantable. Such land may not give first-class, commercial timber in the long run but it will certainly give pulp wood which will more than pay for itself.</P>
    <P>I want to impress two things on the Minister.  The first is that he has the means in his hands to do something that no other Minister can do, check unemployment and check the flight from the land.  The second thing is to tell him that the flight from the land is greatest where the land is poorest and it is on the poorest land he will be falling back to secure the plantable reserve.  It was my view, and I have not changed it, that the best place to find that land is in the Western counties along the Western seaboard.  Some forestry officials will throw up their hands in horror at the idea of planting trees within range of salt water, but how is it that private plantations and shelter belts have proved so successful within a few hundred yards of the sea during the past 20 or 25 years?  Such a plantation may be seen around the parish priest's house in Achill where one would imagine the gales and storms would tear out the trees. Instead, the plantation is thriving wonderfully.</P>
    <P>Without casting any reflection on some of the forestry experts we had 20 or 25 years ago, some gentlemen proclaimed loudly and boldly, and got a large following on the subject, that the land west of the Shannon was not fit to grow timber.  I am glad that bogey has been exploded.  It is about time.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see the Minister <Col N="1283" /> in County Mayo and to welcome him when he took over the huge area of Tourmakeady.  Any time he comes on an errand of that kind he will receive a very warm welcome.  Employment is urgently needed in that county and forestry is the only hope I see.  I admit that the preparation of land, fencing and planting has not a high employment potential but, if we do not plant the trees now, it will never be done. If, 25 to 40 years ago, somebody had planted the 250,000 acres that we have planted, we would be very proud of it and would nurse the forests and try to get the most out of them.  Let us do for future generations what the generations that are dead and gone did not do for us.</P>
    <P>The Minister is engaged in the best work that is being done by any Minister of the Government.  I want him to pursue it.  He is not making any mistakes.  For some reasons, the number of men employed has dropped slightly. The selling of thinnings standing instead of getting forestry workers to cut them and extract them does not account for the drop.  I do not think the preparation of the soil by machinery accounts for it.  I would be very sorry to see the employment potential of the Forestry Division going down.  In the years to come it will expand but I should like the Minister, when he is replying to the debate, to give some explanation of the drop in the number of men employed.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is happening about research.  I gave the Minister some idea of the lines on which I would go.  Research is a very important part of the work.  It is in the same category as the soil tests undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for farmers.  A research section, even if it were to do only very elementary work, is absolutely necessary and would pay for itself.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister the best success in achieving this year the 25,000 acre target which was set by the first Inter-Party Government in 1949.  It was the intention and part of that programme that when the target of 25,000 acres would be achieved in 1960 there <Col N="1284" /> would be re-examination and re-assessment of the whole problem.  I would suggest that in the coming year the Minister should examine the whole problem.  If he comes in here and gives good reason for increasing the programme to 40,000 acres we will help him out.  If he gives good, sound reason why the programme should be cut down to 22,000 acres, we will hear him.  I am not one of those who will say that 25,000 acres a year is just the right planting programme for the Government, that if they plant an acre more they are doing wrong or if they plant an acre less they are doing wrong.  I will not take that stand.  We set the target at 25,000 acres as being a convenient figure to achieve the total of 1,000,000 acres of forestry, about 1/17th of the total area of the country. I would like the Minister to look into that question during the coming year. He would be wise to do it.  Personally, I think the Minister will find that there is no great need to expand beyond the 25,000 acres at present.  If we take Roy Cameron's report, about 7,000 acres a year would meet our own needs according to present timber consumption. Neither extreme is right.  The Minister will find on examination that something in between is the proper thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there has been an undoubted improvement in recent years in the rate of planting in the forestry programme, I want to emphasise that there is no room whatever for complacency on the part of this House or the country.  In order to get the problem of afforestation in proper perspective we should realise and appreciate that of the 117 nations that are listed in the United Nations Agricultural Organisation, Ireland is at the very bottom of the list as far as forestry acreage is concerned, that there are 116 countries ahead of us. That should give us an idea of where we stand as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there is one per cent of the country under forest whereas it is recognised by the authorities that at least 18 per cent of the land should be under timber.  We have a long way to go yet before we reach the 18 per cent. I want to assure this Minister that he <Col N="1285" /> will need very good reasons before he comes back to this House with any programme that would suggest a reduction in the rate of afforestation that is in operation at the moment.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Blowick that at the earliest opportunity the Minister should re-assess the problem, now that we have reached the target of 25,000 acres laid down a few years ago, with a view to increasing the rate of planting. Every authority that has studied the problem in Ireland has agreed that the soil and climate of Ireland are unmatched for the purposes of afforestation. Yet, over the years, especially since we have had native Government, there was criminal neglect of afforestation on the part of all Governments until 1948.  I hold no brief for what has happened from 1948 on but, at least, there was a decided improvement because there was an enlightened approach to afforestation.  One of the factors that brought about that improvement was that public opinion was roused and the public were enlightened as to the importance of embarking on a scheme of afforestation.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the situation we find to-day lies on the shoulders of all Governments since 1922.  Deputy Blowick said that this programme should have been embarked upon 30 to 40 years ago.  Had that been done, the hillsides and poor areas of the country would be clothed to-day in timber that would provide major ancillary industries and give first-class employment to the thousands that emigrate to-day.  That would have been the position to-day if the programme now in operation had been embarked upon as an urgent measure 30 to 40 years ago.  I suppose there is no good talking about that at this stage but it does emphasise the fact that we cannot allow any more years to slip by before starting a dynamic programme.</P>
    <P>It is the business of the Government alone to formulate an active forestry policy and to take steps to carry it out. It is the business of the Government to set up the necessary machine, through the Forestry Division, to acquire the land for the programme. It is the business of the Government, <Col N="1286" /> when the programme is under way, to set up the major ancillary industries based on afforestation.  Let me emphasise that that is the approach of all democratic governments to the question of afforestation.  In all democratic countries the afforestation programme is planned and formulated by the Government and responsibility for the schemes lies on the Government and not on private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is utterly false in principle and in economy to put the private planting of trees on an equal basis with State planting.  I think the Minister is alert to the advantages of afforestation and I should hate to see him diverting his energies and the skill and knowledge of his officials into the private enterprise channel in order to facilitate individuals in the richer counties at the expense of the community as a whole and, more particularly, at the expense of the undeveloped areas.  For the past 18 months the emphasis, in relation to private planting has been on counties such as Carlow and Kilkenny.  With all due respect, the Government must not have given really serious consideration to the way in which afforestation reacts on the unemployment problem. If they had, the Minister would not be permitted to concentrate on counties like Carlow.  I do not want Deputies who represent Carlow to think I have any objection to Carlow getting its fair share.  It is, however, tragic to find the services of experts and officials being diverted from the major schemes which should be put into operation.</P>
    <P>More than anything else&mdash;this cannot be repeated too often&mdash;afforestation offers a solution to emigration from and unemployment in the rural areas.  Today, whole families are packing up and leaving, especially from the poorer areas.  The Minister should, wherever he can embark on a large-scale forestry programme in the poorer areas, make haste to implement that programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the necessity for setting up State-owned pulp mills.  Here, again, we have an insight into the working of the Minister's mind on this question as to whether the State or private enterprise <Col N="1287" /> will be the channel used to develop certain industries here.  Giving priority to private pulp mills is a question the Minister will have to tackle.  Deputy Blowick advanced sound reasons today and I am glad he has taken the line he did.  It is very encouraging to find Deputy Blowick at this stage anxious that the State should ensure that there would be no rings or cartels and no holding-up of forestry products to ransom by organised private pulp mills.  All the difficulties visualised by Deputy Blowick can be solved by the Minister following along the line of State planting right through to the establishment of State pulp mills and ancillary factories to deal with the by-products of afforestation.</P>
    <P>We have a first-class example of a State-owned body working very successfully along the lines I suggest, namely, the Sugar Company.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in that type of economy.  There is nothing criminal in the State doing these things.  The rights of the individual under these State companies are protected just as well as they are protected under private enterprise.  Indeed, if anything, the advantage is in one direction because we know that private enterprise very often has inherent in it the philosophy of &ldquo;Dog eat dog&rdquo; and the weaker go to the wall.  But if the State gives a helping hand the protection is there for the weaker and there is no opportunity for the exploitation.  It is the duty of the State to ensure that there is no hold-up in our major afforestation programme and in the establishment of ancillary industries because of lack of initiative on the part of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>A first-class forestry programme ensures a number of things.  It ensures continuous, secure employment in areas in which it is most needed.  It ensures the production of future wealth.  It saves the country from the balance of payments point of view because Irish products are equal in quality to the best imported.  There is no reason why there should be any slowing-down or any hold-up.  Every effort should be made to expand.  The benefits will be immediate.  It is <Col N="1288" /> estimated by experts that 80 per cent. of the capital outlay on forestry goes in wages.  Very often the greatest percentage of outlay goes on machinery and overheads.  In forestry, however, the biggest proportion goes on wages. Thereby security is ensured to the worker and his family.</P>
    <P>At the moment large sums are being spent every year on employment and emergency schemes.  We have relief schemes in Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Clare.  The manner in which that money is expended is to my way of thinking quite extraordinary.  If there are 12 unemployed in a certain townland, that townland qualifies for a minor relief scheme.  Irrespective of whether or not the project is desirable, the money will be spent in that townland in order to give employment to the people concerned. In the next townland a very essential work may be required but, because there are only three unemployed, that scheme must wait.  That type of wasteful expenditure should be cut out.  All that money could be utilised on forestry instead.</P>
    <P>There is nothing so soul destroying as temporary employment.  Nothing makes men so sour and disillusioned. But if men are given continuous employment on forestry schemes a good return will ensue morally as well as physically.  Added to that, we will be producing wealth for the future. Every Party here will support the Minister if he takes the bit between his teeth and insists on doubling the annual planting rate as quickly as possible.  He will receive no opposition. He will be helped by all.  It is very seldom the Minister will get any praise from me under any circumstances but if he does as I suggest now I will go out of my way to back him. Whether or not he will be suspicious of that, I do not know, but I shall certainly support him.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the industries which will arise as the result of forestry promotion will be based on products of the land and there will be no need for tariff walls to protect them. There will be no need for quotas to be established to prevent the importation of competitive goods, so that the more <Col N="1289" /> one thinks over this question of afforestation and its results, the more attractive it becomes.  It is far more attractive than the type of assembly industry we have in this country to-day, the assembly of cars and things like that, costing fortunes to the taxpayer and with very limited benefit to the community except for the employment given.  There would be better results if half that money were spent on afforestation instead of on sheltered, hush-hush, fostered, assembly industries.</P>

      <P>It is disgraceful that this question of afforestation was neglected over the last 20 or 30 years, while preference was given to the type of industry I have mentioned.  It can be said here that if we planted 25,000 acres per annum, in time we would probably be producing more timber and timber by-products than we could utilise here.  That is nonsense.  The demand can be increased here and anyway, if we reached that stage, there is always the possibility of the export market.  It is much better to be worried about selling native products abroad, even though at times we may suffer, than to be in the position we are in, worrying about the loss of population which can never be replaced if that loss becomes any greater.  On balance, it is better to try to conserve our population rather than have speculation and worry in the minds of economists as to how we will dispose of forestry products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to refer to the numbers employed in afforestation. Undoubtedly, as I said, there has been an improvement in the rate of planting, but I want an explanation from the Minister with regard to the reduction in the number of men employed.  The statistics show that generally there has been a drop in the number of people employed.  Two years ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he had a plan ready to provide 100,000 new jobs if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  The public believed that statement made by a responsible ex-Minister. He was not talking on the basis that he did not know the facts. <Col N="1290" /> He deliberately produced that plan when he was out of office, ably abetted by the Minister for Lands, who is always ready to concoct a scheme like that in order to regain office.</P>

      <P>I must say, Sir, that as a prophet and seer you are slightly out.  If you will allow me to continue I shall show it is relevant. As far as I am concerned these 100,000 new jobs included jobs in afforestation, and the Minister for Lands has to take responsibility for that portion of the plan which never matured.  I want to know why, instead of an increase in the number of men employed in afforestation, there has been a reduction?  I do not deny for a moment that there was an expansion in the planting rate but that is not sufficient.  As well as that we must increase the number of people employed. This is not purely a matter of squeezing more work out of less men. That is not what we should aim at. We do not want any Russian technique of that sort in afforestation, and I do not think the Minister himself has any leaning towards the system in operation behind the Iron Curtain.  I am sure other Deputies in the House will deal with him more forcibly than I on the dangers of adopting that system.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, is the Deputy suggesting that I am adopting Communist methods of employment in afforestation, or is this just another bit of abuse of the type we have come to expect from him?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government must give an answer to the people on their promise that, if returned to power, they would provide so many new jobs.  The Minister has a responsibility to play his part in providing a percentage of these new jobs. What percentage has he provided? Has he increased the number of men employed in afforestation or has he reduced the number?  Deputy Blowick is of the belief that there is a reduction. The statistics definitely show that there has been a reduction and I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to explain what the actual position is in that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion let me, like Deputy Blowick, promise that if the Minister comes into this House at any time with a measure to expand and embark upon an increased rate of planting in afforestation, he will get all the assistance I can give him.  He certainly will not meet with obstruction in this House, or outside it and, if <Col N="1292" /> he is afraid that this thing is being treated on a purely political basis, he can be assured that I gave him full credit for being the first Fianna Fáil Minister I can remember who has seriously interested himself in the question of afforestation.  I do not agree with him on one or two of the aspects on which he has laid emphasis in his plans but I shall give him the credit that of all the Fianna Fáil Ministers who have had responsibility for afforestation, he is the best.  He need not have any qualms that he will meet with criticism from me and people like me in this House or outside it, if he makes greater haste to get an increased rate of planting and provide more work of a reasonably permanent nature, especially in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very heartening to hear the tribute paid by Deputy McQuillan to the Minister when he said he was one of the best Ministers we have had.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan.  He has shown, since he became Minister for Lands and Fisheries, that he has put real drive into the fishery section of his Department. I do not want to go into that now but he has made a real effort to provide some of the jobs which Deputy McQuillan criticised him for not providing.</P>
      <P>I have read the Minister's report on afforestation and while I agree that it is progressive in many ways I have to say that in some respects there is something lacking.  The intake of land is not as great as it should be.  I should like to remind the Minister that in rural Ireland afforestation is the only means of combating the unemployment problem.  I should like to remind him that, due to the trend of affairs over the last five or six years, the employment that can be given by local authorities to rural workers is very limited.  That is due to the fact that a policy was initiated and implemented whereby the machine displaced the man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole economy of road making in the country now depends to a great extent on the machine.  That may be, as I said last night, laudable from the point of view of economy but we have always to watch out that we do not <Col N="1293" /> allow the hard core of economics to destroy the social side.  That side has been irreparably damaged in rural Ireland. In reading the Minister's report I notice that a certain amount of money has been ear-marked for machinery. We do not want to go back to the old county council days when the working man sat on a bag of hay on the roadside breaking stones with a stonehammer.  Thank God, we have moved on from that and that was a move that all of us were pleased to witness.</P>
    <P>While it is necessary in a well-organised afforestation scheme to have a certain amount of machinery to get into the subsoil, as mentioned by the Minister, I would say that the less machinery we use in our afforestation schemes the better it will be for the social order of things in this country. If we have any sincerity left in us all our efforts should be bent towards the solving of our great employment problem. In the last two years or 12 months there has been a general feeling that the era of progress is about to present itself.  We are trying to build up and establish a good sound agricultural policy, as was advocated by Arthur Griffith, and, side by side with that, we are trying to build up the industrial arm.</P>
    <P>We know that the problem of unemployment is our most important social problem.  While there may be a certain amount of capital made available for the industrial drive we, who represent rural constituencies, can be fully satisfied that we have to look in some other direction for alternative schemes of employment.  I say, coming as I do from an area where we have acres upon acres of land suitable for afforestation purposes, that afforestatiou is the only sound rural industry that we can establish.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that the officials of his Department are not playing their part as they should play it.  I received a letter from his Department this morning telling me the price they were prepared to pay for 600 acres of land.  I would like to get some of these forestry officials down into that part of the country and have them tell me then that that land is only worth £3 an acre.  I know that land <Col N="1294" /> well and in the worst of times it was worth £10 to £12 an acre for grazing purposes.  It is rough grazing land.  The Minister's Department now informs me that it is only suitable for the growing of inferior timber.  I cannot understand that.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on forestry, but I know a tree and I know that it takes good land to grow a tree.  Poplar can be grown anywhere.  If £15 to £20 an acre is being given for the planting of poplar I would say that this land can grow a better tree than poplar.  That is the economic side of the matter, but I am deeply interested in the social side.  There is a big incidence of unemployment in that part of the country.  These people are living far off the main roads and they are a deeprooted people.  I feel that if we could have that 600 acres in the heart of that mountainous area acquired for afforestation purposes we would have a number of families in continuous employment and these families would be much happier than if they were working in an industrial plant.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister and his officials that I find fault with the decisions given in regard to the value of the land.  I leave it to the common-sense of the Deputies.  Would a man with 600 acres of good, sound, rough grazing land be tempted to part with that land for £3 an acre?  Are we serious in our efforts to promote forestry and to reach a target of 25,000 acres per year?  We shall not do that unless we treat people fairly and give them a decent price.  I do not want a situation in which we will have to acquire land compulsorily.  The land is there in abundance if the right approach is made to owners.</P>
    <P>I want to state with all emphasis I can command that we shall not be able to tackle the great problem of unemployment unless we go ahead with forestry everywhere.  We must make an all-out effort if we are to achieve the target of 25,000 acres.  At the start of the Second World War we had no difficulty whatever in marshalling together all the best elements in the nation to achieve the target ahead.  We built up a force here <Col N="1295" /> that was a credit to any small European country.  Deputy McQuillan could castigate the Tánaiste for failing in his promise of 100,000 jobs, although I do not think he failed entirely.  But if he could make an all-out afforestation drive in every part of rural Ireland, in a few years' time we would have broken the back of the unemployment there.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy McQuillan, who is not over-generous in his tributes, particularly to anybody on this side of the House, pay tribute to the Minister.  The Minister is a young, energetic man.  He has handled fisheries and the Land Commission very well, but he must be tree-minded to make a job of forestry.  As a representative of rural Ireland, I would ask the Minister to have his Department reconsider the method by which they purchase land at such niggardly prices as I have mentioned here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Introducing his Estimate last evening, the Minister gave us a very commendable review of the activities of the Department of Forestry.  We are all very pleased to hear from him that at last the target of 25,000 acres has been decided on for planting in this year.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department on their continuance of the drive initiated here some years ago to have an annual target of 25,000 acres.  It is quite clear that the Department of Forestry will grow very much in importance in the years immediately ahead.  As a matter of fact, it bids fair to outrival completely the activities of the other section of the Department, the Department of Lands. This is natural because of the fact that afforestation provides one of the few rural possibilities of development in this country.  We would all like to see it expand and grow, particularly at a time when rural employment is difficult to procure.  In the years immediately ahead there will be a tapering off in the employment on the rural electrification scheme, and it is some consolation to have a development such as this to fall back on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that having reached the target of 25,000 acres the Minister and <Col N="1296" /> his Department will not relay their efforts.  I see no reason why that acreage should not be increased from year to year.  The Minister has expressed concern about the acquisition of sufficient land ahead of development. I cannot understand why in this country with its vast areas of barren land, with so much hill, glen and bogland, we could not get at least 30,000 to 40,000 acres a year for many years to come.  We are not sufficiently tree-conscious, as the last speaker said, to realise what potentialities there are in forestry development.  There are the ancillary industries that go with it&mdash; the Minister mentioned his interest in the development of nurseries&mdash;and all these activities are bound to increase employment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing so pleasing to the eye in a rural scene as the young forest growing and developing.  There is nothing that will so readily transform the whole countryside from the point of view of scenery, beauty and natural amenity as forestry development.  A part from that, there are the commercial possibilities.  I would ask the Minister, if possible when replying, to give us an idea of the cost of the importation of timber into this country in the last twelve months.  These facts should be associated with the Forestry Vote so that we shall be in a better position to assess the whole value of the forestry industry here.  We know it is not in his Department but I am sure he will be willing to provide this information if possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that in 15 years or so it is envisaged that the revenue from forestry might equate the expenditure on forestry.  If that is a possibility, that fact should be emphasised as a means of inspiring hope and faith in forestry development.  We should all like to see that realised in this country.  It is well that the rural organisations, particularly Macra na Feirme, should be encouraged to take an interest in forestry.  They are likely to see and enjoy the fruition of the efforts now being undertaken in forestry development.</P>
    <P>Private planting is a very wise activity of the Department.  I do not agree at all with Deputy McQuillan that private planting will interfere with the <Col N="1297" /> State forestry schemes.  Private planting will take very little of the officials' time.  The onus is on the owner of the land to provide the labour and the capital.  All that is required for payment of the grant is that the place is suitable and the acreage accurate. That does not interfere at all with the State enterprise envisaged.  Land owners should be encouraged to provide shelter belts, particularly in exposed places.  Suitable trees should be made available at very competitive prices&mdash;I believe they are in most cases&mdash;and we should encourage every effort of that kind.</P>
    <P>The incentive bonus scheme has come in for a certain amount of criticism here, and particularly the fact that employment has decreased over the past 12 months.  I expect that was a natural eventuality.  New techniques, greater skill and experience have been applied to forestry over the years. These have helped towards greater expansion and it is quite possible this is one of the reasons for employment in forestry development.  At the same time there is something ingenious about the scheme for incentive bonuses and if it works out successfully&mdash;I do not believe in slave-driving at all&mdash;it may be undertaken by other Departments and even by private firms.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the planting of ploughed land.  That has some obvious advantages; it checks the growth of weeds and scrub in the early years of development of the young trees.  That is important.  The furrows left by the plough beside rows of trees help to drain the land superficially. That is the most expeditious means of dealing with forestry in certain areas instead of having to dig drains and use machinery.</P>
    <P>I do not know what research has been carried out in regard to the application of certain minerals to the land in order to develop the growth of young trees but in some cases where farmers have applied farmyard manure in a limited way to young plants the results have been very encouraging.  It is possible that the controlled application of certain fertilisers would promote rapid growth and more resistance to disease.  I do not know if experiments <Col N="1298" /> have been made in that line but I think they are well worth while.</P>
    <P>There have been very serious forest fires in recent years and that is very regrettable.  It should now be possible for the Department to have its own watchmen, in periods of dry weather at least, so that they would be able to watch, travelling on motor cycles or on foot, the people who come out on picnics and see that they do not light fires inside the danger zone near forests.  Some arrangement of that kind should be provided to prevent these fires which cost so much money.</P>
    <P>Travelling between Kinsale and Cork recently I was edified to see what I assumed to be some trees that had been cut there in recent weeks.  I was amazed at their strength and length. I believe they were for E.S.B. purposes &mdash;they would certainly fit that classification. I did not think we could grow trees up to such a standard here.  I see no reason why we could not produce commercial timber on a scale that would be important as an economic development.  There are great possibilities for the expansion of forestry under the present Minister.  He has applied himself with vigour and zeal to his task.  I am sure he is in earnest and that he will continue his efforts so that we shall become self-sufficient in the production of raw timber for ordinary use here in future years.  We look forward to the development of forestry in rural Ireland especially because there are few other developments to which we can look forward. I think forestry offers the greatest potential, and no effort should be spared to expand it.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed concern about land acquisition.  It is my experience that rarely is the maximum price paid for land.  The Department makes a generous offer, but the price is usually cut back.  It is not generally realised that the annuity must be redeemed before the purchase price is paid and that further reduces the sum going to the owner of the land.  That sort of niggardliness in approaching a problem of this national magnitude should be avoided.  If we are generous, we shall get the land required and certainly if we get the support of rural <Col N="1299" /> organisations such as Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre there will be no shortage of plantable land for the next ten years at any rate.  Above all, let us be realistic in regard to price and pay a price commensurate with value and with prices offered in various other areas. The price might be fixed in relation to the standard of fertility, but I think that would not be fair in all cases because lands that are not fertile for some reason may grow good forests on development.  We cannot afford to be niggardly about the price we offer for land for forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate the Minister on the drive he is putting into forestry.  I am however disappointed in some respects, perhaps through no fault of the Minister.  In my area we have a vast amount of land suitable for forestry but at present the people who are giving land to the Department are the big farmers with large tracts.  We have, however, a vast amount of land held by small farmers who cannot afford to offer it for forestry, even though it is fit for nothing else, because they use it for small rough grazing.  It has been brought to my notice&mdash;and I have referred the matter to the Minister on a few occasions&mdash;that where we have this type of farmer anxious to give over all, or portion, of his holding to the Forestry Department, if he could get any sort of promise from the Minister that he would get an exchange holding when land was being divided near by, he would be prepared to give up the land suitable for forestry.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister should consider carefully the question of an exchange of holdings.  I know that one matter comes under the Land Commission and the other is the concern of the Forestry Department but both are under the one Minister.  A smallholder cannot afford to give up 20 or 30 acres of rough grazing and so make his holding completely uneconomic unless he gets a promise that an exchange holding will be forthcoming at some future time.  If that were done, much more land would be offered to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> In regard to the bonus scheme, so far as we in North Tipperary are concerned, in the Roscrea area and possibly in Silvermines area also where trade unions have made representations to the Minister, the workers have been paid this bonus.  In a number of rural areas, where there are no trade union organisations to represent the workers, a big number of forestry workers have been paid no bonus whatever.  Prior to the introduction of the bonus scheme the workers were entitled to the same rate of pay as county council workers but, when the bonus scheme was brought in, the county council rate of pay went overboard and we were told by the Minister and his Department that all workers would be paid on the bonus scale.  That is almost twelve months ago but we have workers in various parts of North Tipperary who are still being paid a low rate of wages and no bonus scheme has been applied in their case.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the increasing cost of living, a loss of £12 or £14 a year is a big consideration to a worker.  I would appeal to the Minister to operate the bonus scheme for all workers or, if he is not prepared to do that, to pay them at the county council rate.  It is not fair that men should be kept waiting ten or twelve months for a scheme.  There is no indication that the scheme will be introduced as far as North Tipperary is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division are not getting the amount of land they require for the simple reason that the price offered is far too low.  In some cases it is £3 or £4 an acre.  In rare cases the price was brought up to £7 an acre.  If the Minister keeps the price down to that ridiculously low level, nobody will offer land except somebody who can afford to do without it. I am very interested in afforestation. The Minister should increase substantially the price offered for land for forestry purposes and he will find overnight that a vast amount of land will be forthcoming, possibly more than he can plant.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I understand that some time ago the Minister was expecting heavy machinery which would be used in forests, where suitable. <Col N="1301" /> I would appeal to the Minister to go slow in introducing heavy machinery for this work.  Afforestation was introduced in order to build up Irish industry.  I believe it will have that effect in the not too distant future. It was introduced for another purpose also, to absorb the unemployed in suitable work.  The more machinery the Minister brings in, especially of a heavy type, the more workers will be disemployed.  The result will be that what we gain on one hand will be lost on the other.  Any group of honest, decent workers can do more satisfactory work than can be done by heavy machines.  I suppose the Minister has in mind that there is a certain type of land where the use of machinery would be absolutely essential but I would appeal to the Minister to use discretion in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very interested in fisheries and is doing a very good job. Fisheries have an important bearing on the tourist industry.  The Minister has the means in his own Department to develop a very attractive tourist proposition.  Large tracts of land are being acquired by the Forestry Division.  My suggestion to the Minister is that such land should be preserved for game, in the Department's name, for some years to come, and that the shooting rights should not be given to individuals or groups.  In that way a world of game can be built up which would be a tremendous tourist attraction. I would ask the Minister to examine that proposition very carefully.  Some lands the Minister is now acquiring were once well stocked with game and when they are planted the game will return naturally.  If these lands are preserved and, possibly, restocked, they could be of great importance from the tourist point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate objective by way of benefit deriving from money spent on afforestation must be the giving of employment in rural areas.  I am heartened by the spirited appeal by Deputy Collins of West Limerick for unified effort in this regard. Many things prevent a national drive.  In any matter where land has to be acquired, delay is the order of the <Col N="1302" /> day.  In an ordinary transaction between private individuals delay in completing a sale is notorious but when, through no fault of theirs, there is the legal delay coupled with what has come to be the delay of Civil Service routine, it is very difficult to achieve one's objective in any given time.  I think the Department can be blamed for this.  If they are not to be blamed, certainly they should be exhorted to discontinue the practice of not pursuing the offer.</P>
      <P>I know of cases where the person offering the land does nothing after the original offer from the Forestry Division except, perhaps, get in touch with his nearest T.D. to make some sort of effort.  I have one case on hands&mdash;I think I have had it since I came into the House&mdash;where the offer was made and there was a further increase and a further demand and a further small increase.  That has been going on for practically five years.  In that case, I do not think the fault is entirely the fault of the Forestry Division.  The fault lies also with the person offering the land, who does not seem to follow up an offer and make his fresh demand as quickly as he might.  The valuation of land in the initial effort by officials or somebody at their behest is also wrong.  The original offer is too small and tends to dishearten the person offering the land and to make him lose interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins stressed the value of the type of land that is offered which, to a valuer from Dublin or an official who might not be conversant with such land, may appear virtually useless. Rough commonages and rough grazing land on the mountain side or elsewhere, which appear to be useless, may be very important in the economy of certain areas, particularly the congested areas in the West, North-West and South-West.  A great deal could be achieved by altering the psychology behind the offer.  The introduction of the element of redemption of annuity into the offer at a late stage, or understood by the person making the offer at a late stage of the negotiations, has a disheartening effect.  Everybody appreciates the difference between a purchase in which one does not have <Col N="1303" /> to pay auctioneer's fees and one in which one does have to pay such fees. If a man can buy a house for £3,000 or £4,000 and not have to pay any auctioneer's fees, that is an added attraction.  In the same way land in respect of which no deduction is made, like an annuity, no matter how small it may be, is a more attractive proposition, whereas in the other case there is the psychological effect that the owner is put off, at least for a time, thereby holding up the drive.</P>
    <P>I am interested in private planting as well as State planting.  The average scheme initiated by the Department is of necessity concentrated and gives employment over a restricted area. Private planting can provide work for at least one more member of a family.</P>
    <P>Shelter belts have been mentioned by Deputy Manley.  Such belts are very important.  I would urge the value of a shelter belt between tillage land and commonage.  Such a belt would have the advantage of preventing the animals grazing on the commonage from trespassing on the tillage land.</P>
    <P>Great strides have been made in Mayo.  Full credit for the initiation of the drive there must be given to Deputy Blowick in Deputy Costello's first Administration.  In 1948 there were only 11 men employed on forestry development.  To-day&mdash;I hope my figure is accurate&mdash;there are 410 men employed all over the county. Deputy Blowick, as Minister for Lands, initiated seven forestry centres in South Mayo and six in North Mayo &mdash;it may be the other way round, but the overall figure is 13 centres.  In paying that tribute to Deputy Blowick, I am not in any way trying to belittle the efforts of the present Minister. After all, he is continuing the policy inaugurated by Deputy Blowick and he is trying to reach the target of 25,000 acres per annum.  He is working with commendable energy.  I am not concerned as to whether or not he has any responsibility for the 100,000 jobs referred to by Deputy McQuillan. We are all of us now pretty well conversant with the wide divergence there is between the promise and the performance.</P>
    <P>At a time like this it is incumbent <Col N="1304" /> on all of us to make some concrete suggestions for remedying the position in the rural areas.  The population is declining at an alarming rate.  It is only when one has personal experience of it that one grows really anxious about the situation.  I was in a Garda station yesterday arranging for a police certificate for an emigrant to America. I asked if there would be any delay and the Garda replied: &ldquo;There will be no delay.  We do a dozen of these in the day.&rdquo;  That came as a shock to me.  I knew the position was bad, but I did not think it was so bad.</P>
    <P>Rural employment must be the primary objective apart altogether from any commercial ancillary advantages to be derived from forestry in the years to come.  As Deputy Manley said, rural employment is difficult to procure.  It is equally difficult to provide particularly at this era of our progress; scientific advancement may be accountable in large measure for the greater portion of rural unemployment. At the moment in Foxford there is a great deal of anxiety because numbers of people are being laid off work.  I forget the exact number, but even one man laid off in a rural area is a serious matter, particularly if he happens to be the breadwinner of a family.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on keeping up the pressure.  I hope he will achieve the target of 25,000 acres per annum.  Not alone that, but, as Deputy Blowick urged upon him, I hope his first consideration will be directed towards re-planning in an effort to increase the target.</P>

      <P>Every £ put into afforestation is a £ well spent.  It is a £ that will save the Department of Social Welfare many pounds in the years to come.  It will also help the taxpayer.  Money put into afforestation is like money invested.  It is good economy.  The policy may be a long-term one.  Indeed, it is a policy upon which we should have embarked many years ago.  Unlike wheat, one cannot overdo the sowing of trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate should get the blessing of both sides of the House.  Our country was denuded of trees by the <Col N="1305" /> foreigner.  That denudation was aggravated because of the fuel shortage in the last war.  A big lee-way has to be made up now.  To some extent we have suffered from the mentality: &ldquo;Only God can make a tree&rdquo;.  But God helps those who help themselves and, from that point of view, we should make an all-out drive to plant our land.  Unfortunately we are not tree-minded.  We were never taught anything about forestry in school.</P>
    <P>On that point, a directive should be issued from the Minister's Department warning children not to go near forests during the summer holidays.  Many children go out from the towns for picnics and they do not appreciate the dangers.  Another group which causes a good deal of damage is the itinerants who park near forests.  The Guards should watch these people.</P>
    <P>We are approaching the target of 25,000 acres per annum.  The Minister and his officials should bend all their energies now towards going ahead as rapidly as possible.  The rabbit pest is no longer a menace.  Recently the Minister appealed in Connemara for the co-operation of public men in securing more land for afforestation purposes.  I assured him then that he will have my full co-operation.  It is not so many years ago since I put the Minister in touch with people who had land for sale.  The only reply I received was that the land was not required and would not be taken.  No excuse was given.  Possibly the Minister might note it now and give me an idea of why these lands were not accepted, and then we would be better able to know what type of land is best. I am referring to land in the Knock area; the names of the holders were Curran and Haire.  I would like to know why these lands were not accepted.  There may be good reasons but, if we are to approach people again, we would like to know what the snags are.</P>
    <P>It has been heartening to note the export of pit props from Galway during the last year or two, and from that it can be seen that our forests are playing a part in the export drive. I hope we will see much more of that. <Col N="1306" /> I am in agreement with other Deputies when they say that afforestation will help to curb emigration.  I think the Minister should intensify his efforts in the area I represent where we suffer sorely from emigration.  He will get land there much more cheaply than in the midlands.  Thousands of acres are lying waste; he has seen them himself. If planted these lands would add beauty to the countryside which would mean much from the tourist as well as the economic point of view.</P>
    <P>I note that the grant to private persons and public bodies has been doubled.  I congratulate the Minister on that because I believe that private enterprise should play a part in afforestation and it is time people got every encouragement to plant.  It is a step in the right direction and I hope the Minister will go still further. Young farmers' clubs could play a bigger part in the afforestation drive but, unfortunately, many young farmers are more concerned with crops that yield a harvest in one year.  Unless we can make them tree-minded, as is done in the schools, we shall not succeed.  Like Deputy Blowick, I believe that the western counties should be planted to the full.  I think the Minister is in favour of that, and I hope we will be able to welcome him again, as we did quite recently, when starting a great effort in that respect in Connemara.  He will get my co-operation, just as he has secured it every time he asked in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have been so congratulatory that I almost feel I should examine my conscience.  I thank them for their kind and helpful remarks and I can assure them that all the constructive criticism they have made will be carefully examined. First of all, I want to deal with the question of employment because I think we should make quite certain that the House and the country understand the position.  It is an absolute fact that in the next two or three years it will be difficult to compare the number of people employed from one year to another because of the practice that has grown since before the present Government came into <Col N="1307" /> office&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;of selling standing timber, and it does really make a considerable difference to the figures of men employed each year.</P>
      <P>It is impossible for us to tell very accurately the number of people employed each year by contractors in felling timber, and the indirect employment afforded by lorry men and so forth.  The nearest figures that I have are that the rise in indirect employment in 1957/58 was about 300, and the rise in indirect employment in 1958/59 was a further 200, making 500 in all, and that there was a reduction in direct employment in those two years of 340. Therefore, there was a small net increase in direct and indirect employment.</P>
      <P>I should also make it clear that last year the appalling weather reduced what should have been an increased labour force on road construction.  I am hoping that this year Providence will bring us good weather, not only for forestry road works but for agricultural production, and that we shall be able to employ more people in wiping out arrears in the road programme and preparing roads for our new forests.</P>
      <P>I must also make it clear that there is a new factor entering into the situation which only much greater acquisition in the eastern part of the country, on the better lands, will prevent from operating&mdash;the cost of the employment factor in planting ploughed land which has got to be ploughed by machine because there is no other way of ploughing it.  The employment factor in planting ploughed land may be as much as 50 per cent. less than in preparing the land, the better class of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the proportion of land planted in western counties has risen steadily and in the last planting year was some 48 per cent. of total plantings as compared with 34 per cent. in a previous period.  In one sense concentration is very valuable for the counties which most need employment but in increasing employment rates, we have to bear in mind the fact that in regard to the higher proportion western areas&mdash;or should I say mostly of newly-planted lands each year in <Col N="1308" /> in the west&mdash;where ploughing was a factor, the employment content must necessarily diminish, not because we wish to save labour but because we have to use machinery in order to plough heavy soil.</P>
    <P>When we consider that trend, and also the very bad weather of last year it will be seen that there has been a small increase in total employment.  At the moment, there are between 150 and 200 more people in employment than at the same time last year, in spite of all those difficulties.  Of course, the general growth of forestry operations should overcome reductions in employment consequent upon the type of planting and consequent upon the other factors I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the incentive bonus scheme has not led to disemployment.  Last year, in its incipient stages, only ten per cent. of the work was handled under the scheme and the scheme could have had no effect on the employment level. This year about 45 per cent. to 50 per cent. of the work is being handled under the scheme and, as I have already indicated, employment is running higher than last year and should average some 200 more than last year.</P>
    <P>One Deputy gave a sort of philosophical discourse on the comparison between what he called social employment and economic employment, which is of interest and has some bearing on forestry employment, but I should make it clear that it is human to provide incentive bonuses.  It is not being done only for cold-blooded economic reasons.  If a man is paid more he will spend more and, if he spends more, he will employ more workers to provide him with industrial goods and services. The additional number of workers who provide him with industrial goods and services will themselves employ other workers and so, the payment of more wages for more work, in an expanding economy, inevitably results in the employment of more people.  That is the manner in which more people have been employed in Great Britain, the United States and other countries.  If more work is done for a given expenditure by the State as a result of <Col N="1309" /> State taxation the State can either invest money in further schemes for giving employment or they can tax the public to a lesser extent.  I am glad to say that no one is in a position to contradict me on that matter because economists agree on that proposition.</P>
    <P>This then is a human proposition. More employment is given as production grows and more families are happy.  No one would think of introducing an incentive bonus scheme solely for the purpose of giving a certain body of men higher wages. Such a scheme should have the additional effect of bringing happiness to more families.  That should at all times be stressed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that we should be careful about purchasing too many machines.  The high quality of the Irish worker enables us to use men in circumstances in which, in other countries, machines would be better.  There are many jobs in ground preparation where machinery is absolutely essential.  Unless we purchase these large machines we will not be able to give my employment in many areas.  Deputies who see the heavy ploughing that is to be done, the piercing of the peat and the breaking of the heavy pan sub-soil by the gigantic machinery used by the Department, will realise that no possible from of annual labour would replace the work of those machines. Machinery is essential in these soils and in itself provides further employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick ask me to give the figure for the plantable reserve. At the moment it is about 55,000 acres.  This year, the Minister for Finance has provided the sum necessary to plant 25,000 acres.  If I could see any sign of a growth in the plantable reserves sufficient to enable us to plant even 1,000 acres more, I should be delighted, but there can be no consideration by the Government of the general proposal for the increase in the present programme without significant offers of land coming in.</P>
    <P>We are looking for as much land as we can get to provide more uniform employment.  I hope that all Deputies understand the necessity for having <Col N="1310" /> reserves of land not only for efficiency's sake but for human reasons.  If there is sufficient land available for any given employment area, we now have well-established work values and we know the exact cost of carrying out any afforestation scheme in any area, so that it is possible to plan the preparation, fencing, planting and thinning in such a way as to employ permanently a group of men, provided always that some of them may not want permanent employment due to their personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>Not everybody knows that the big problem of rural employment has always been the very large numbers of men who are temporarily employed. One of the reasons for our high emigration rate has been the large number of men who will no longer stand and tolerate a system of working for a season and then live on the dole for the remainder of the year when they can get more highly paid and continous employment either in Great Britain or in Dublin.  We want to establish a system in the Department of Forestry where we will have groups of men interested in their work, interested in the big incentive bonus, interested in the future of forestry and skilled in their work.  We have been able to secure that in some areas where there is a high plantable reserve but there are many areas where there is need for more land and I hope that Deputies will do everything they can to encourage people to offer more land.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly understandable for owners of greatly eroded land where the sheep grazing value has diminished almost to vanishing point to be reluctant to sell those lands.  They may have had the use of that land for numbers of years and, even if they did not own it, their parents and grand-parents may have used it.  For these reasons they may not wish to part with it but the permanent employment which would be given by large blocs of afforestation on those lands to the children of those owners should induce them to part with those lands which have become so severely eroded by the grazing, under uncontrolled conditions, of already poor land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also asked for the <Col N="1311" /> figures of acquisitions in the congested counties in the West.  I have already mentioned the fact that 40 per cent. of the land planted last year was planted in the West.  The figures of acquisitions are: 1955/56&mdash;8,239 acres; 1956/57&mdash;8,086 acres; 1957/58&mdash;8,241 acres; 1958/59&mdash;11,450 acres.  On 31st March, 1959 in the western areas there were in course of purchase 313 cases with a total area of 24,000 acres.  The number of offers of land in the West is improving all the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also mentioned the question of pulp mills.  I want to assure him that this matter is under very active consideration.  I should like to give the House a very brief account of a report made following a survey carried out by a firm with a very high international reputation as consultants.  The survey was initiated by a number of countries including Ireland.  The consultant visited each country separately and submitted his report separately to each country.  The report was limited in his terms of reference to the smaller type of pulp mills and excluded wallboard and chip-board. He recommended the construction of paper-making mills.</P>
    <P>The consultant's recommendations were based on very exhaustive costings data, both in relation to capital courses and production courses, and they show very clearly the relationship which could be established through the various pulping methods envisaged between the price of timber and raw materials and remuneration of capital, on the one hand, and the price of pulp, on the other.  Those recommendations can be summed up by saying that in the consultant's opinion this country should be able to engage in the production of paper pulp in the way he envisaged providing the plants were of suitable capacity and that the present relationship of pulping prices and production costings on heads other than labour, power, fuel, chemicals and so forth. remained reasonably constant.</P>
    <P>The report in that sense is quite encouraging and it is being examined by the various firms engaged at present in the production of pulp or <Col N="1312" /> who are major users of pulp.  The report indicates the economic feasibility of pulping plants of various kinds and should give us great assistance with the research we should have to undertake in planning regionally the kind of industries we need to absorb timber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government naturally is always prepared to engage in State production, when the alternative is no production or anything undesirable from the national standpoint.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me how many poles were sold to the E.S.B. and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The sales of the E.S.B. were 3,500 and to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, 8,800, making a total of 12,300.  Sales should be larger this year.  The E.S.B. report showed that our timber is comparing favourably in quality with the imported.</P>
      <P>The proportion of thinnings sold standing is now between five-eighths and three-quarters of the total thinnings and is likely to rise in the future. The reduction in the income from thinnings was referred to by Deputy Blowick.  If he reads the Estimate script, he will find it is due to a market situation, which is expected to be of a temporary character, in which Russian exports of timber forced down the Scandinavian prices which, in turn, forced down Irish prices.  It is something we cannot foretell in advance.</P>
      <P>In regard to the decision to promote larger nurseries, this is not due mainly to purely economic reasons but in order to ensure that we have high quality plants.  The whole management of the nursery is far superior if it is relatively large and everything can be done on a fairly big scale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the price of land, as far as I can ascertain reasonable prices are offered.  The number of offers that are turned down because of a difference over price I do not think are sufficiently significant to suggest that is a matter of grievous concern.  We try to offer the market value for the land and I think the Department are aware of any changes that have taken place in land values. As I have said, if I received data showing there had been a very large number of offers turned down on the grounds of price, naturally I would be worried.  Of course, sometimes we get offers turned down by people who thought they would get an obviously excessive price, but in regard to marginal differences I do not think at the moment we get many offers turned down.  In connection with this acquisition drive we are undertaking, it has been pointed out to the acquisition officers that they must be sure to offer what they regard as a reasonable price per acre for the land they inspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are planting a good deal of experimental type land.  We have been planting at the very edge of the sea in Glenamoy, where there is a certain amount of salt water exposure, and we have planted along the coast in certain areas where we thought the conditions were possible.  I think our experimental work is as advanced on peat as such work anywhere in the world.  I do not think anyone can say we are showing an over-conservative attitude.  The visit I paid to Scotland, along with officers of my Department, was followed by a visit by the British Forestry Commission here.  For a total of twelve days I saw nothing but peat plantations and heard nothing but discussions on peat plantations.  This was a tremendously valuable experience, enabling me to gauge the very great importance of peat in future planting, to hear literally 12 of the greatest experts in the world on peat planting discuss among themselves all the problems and difficulties&mdash;the <Col N="1314" /> eternal problem of what is now considered to be really experimental land and what is considered to be land which we are hopeful will produce good results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also asked about home seed collection.  In 1957-58 the total amount of seed sown was 11,500 lbs. of which 1,500 lbs. were home collected.  Home collection is extending very slowly and we are comparing the qualities of pinus contorta stands both here and in Great Britain with the British Forestry Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I wish to assure Deputies that the assessment work is continuing.  We have completed the assessment of State plantation of ten years or over to the amount of 70,000 acres, and a total of 12,000 acres is being examined.  This work commenced in April, 1958, and will be completed as soon as possible.  We are also doing as much research as we can manage, with what must be, under present circumstances, a fairly limited staff, both in regard to the comparative effects of planting different species on different sites with different spacing. We are also doing manurial trials by applications of different types of manures for varying returns.</P>

      <P>I have no information on that point.  Deputy Tierney was anxious about the application of the incentive bonus scheme to a particular area in Tipperary, the Newport-Silvermines-Templederry area.  I should say that these forest areas are in a different administrative district to the area where the bonus scheme was initiated&mdash;also a part of the Deputy's constituency&mdash;and these areas are listed for application of the scheme within three to six months' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Lindsay, all the offers we make for forestry land are on a nett price basis.  That is to say, they <Col N="1315" /> are exclusive of the redemption value of the annuity.  Deputy Lindsay also referred to employment in the Foxford forest, which was reduced a couple of years ago when thinnings arrears were cleared up.  I am sorry to say acquisition is very slow in the area and I hope it will be speeded up so that we can continue planting in that area.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered most of the questions put to me by Deputies and any other constructive criticism will be examined.  I should like to thank Deputies once again for their congratulations. I should also say a work of tribute to the officers of the Department who show the most tremendous zeal and whose method of operation is completely different from what is supposed to be the traditional habit of the civil servant.  Like men in a great timber corporation they eliminate red tape to the very maximum degree and have shown an extraordinary capacity in working with the industrial consultant in carrying out one of the largest schemes of conversion to incentive bonus that this country has ever seen in its history or is ever likely to see in the future.</P>

    <P>Bhí an cúnamh teicniúil seo do na Tionscail Tuaithe san áireamh i gComhaontú Idirnáisiúnta a rinneadh ar an 14ú de Mheitheamh, 1957, idir Rialtas na hÉireann agus Rialtas Stát Aontaithe Mheiriceá a bhain leis an airgead a bhí i gCuntas Speisialta Contrapháirteach an Deontais Mheiriceánaigh alos Cúnaimh Theicniúil d'úsáid agus chífear go bhfuil soláthar faoi Fho-mhírcheann R.6 den Vóta seo chun an méid a caithfear faoi Fho-mhírcheann <Col N="1318" /> P d'aisghnóthú ón gCuntas Speisialta sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Tionscail Torthaí Mara déantar soláthar faoi Fhó-Mhírcheann E chun feamainn agus carraigín a cheannach don ghnólacht Arramara Teoranta.  Suas go dtí an bhliain seo ba ghnáth soláthar a dhéanamh chun na habhair seo a cheannach, a láimhseáil agus a sheacadadh ag monarchain an ghnólachta ach tabharfar faoi deara nach bhfuil aon tsoláthar á dhéanamh feasta do na chostaisí láimhseála agus do na chostaisí seachadaidh toisc go mbeidh a gcuid socruithe féin á ndéanamh ag an ngnólacht ina leith sin amach anseo.  Ní miste dhom a rá go bhfuil cúrsaí an tionscail ar fad faoi aithbhreithniú agam le tamall anuas agus go gceapaim gur maith an rud é go bhfuil an gnólacht ag tabhairt faoina gcuid socruithe féin ann, agus tá súil agam go leanfar den iarracht sin go dtí go mbeidh an obair ar fad á reachtáil acu, idir ceannach is eile.</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh de chúrsaí láimhseála agus seachadaidh, tá laghdú le feiscint sa mhéad atá á thaispeáint i leith Feamoinn agus an Carraigín a cheannach.  Ní hionann sin is a rá, ámh, go bhfuil aon laghdú ag teacht ar an tionscal, ach go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh i mbliana chun an meastachán a dhéanamh níos cruinne ná mar a bhí le roinnt bhlian anuas. Le fírinne tá glaoch níos fearr anois ar na Slata Mara ná mar a bhí riamh agus dá mhéad díobh a bailítear isea is fear é.  Tá ardaithe ar an bpraghas dóibh agus bheadh áthas orm dá mbeadh a dhá oiread nó a thrí oiread díobh ar fáil.  Ag an am céanna ní haon chabhair dúinn níos mó airgid a sholáthar ná a ceaptar a bheas ag teastáil agus is é sin an fáth go bhfuil laghdú déanta mar atá mínithe agam.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann F, déantar soláthar le haghaidh deontas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht). Tháinig méadú sa bhliain airgeadais 1958/59 ar an obair a rinneadh faoi na hAchtanna.  Críochnaíodh ós cionn dhá chéad dteach nua, feabhsaíodh beagnach trí chéad eile, cuireadh saoráidí sláintíochta ar fáil i gcéad teach agus cuireadh leathnúcháin speisialta le ocht gcinn déag de thithe. Tháinig méadú, dá réir sin, ar an <Col N="1319" /> gcaiteachas faoi na hAchtanna&mdash;ó £70,000 go £78,000 tuairim.  Meastar go dtiocfaidh méadú eile fós ar an obair sa bhliain airgeadais seo agus gur gá £90,000 a sholáthar chuige arís i mbliana.  Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, tá Bille nua tithe ar siúl againn faoi láthair agus measaim, mar sin, nach gá tuilleadh a rá faoi chúrsaí tithíochta sa ráiteas seo.</P>
    <P>Fé mar is eol don Dáil, is faoi Fho-mhírcheann G a cuirtear airgead ar fáil chun Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin na Roinne a chur i gcrích.  Tá na húdaráis áitiúla agus muintir na Gaeltachta ag dul i dtaithí na Scéimeanna go maith agus tá an t-éileamh orthu ag dul i méid dá réir.  Ag an am céanna, ní féidir i gcónaí dul ar aghaidh chomh tapaidh agus ba mhaith linn leis an obair ar chuid de na scéimeanna.  Sa bhliain airgeadais seo caite, mar shompla, níor éirigh linn an t-airgead go léir a chaitheamh a bhí curtha i leataoibh againn le haghaidh Scéim Leathnuithe na dTithe Gloine agus na Scéimeanna Uisce-Sholáthair.  Mar gheall air sin, fágadh tuairim £30,000 gan caitheamh as an £125,000 a cuireadh ar fáil le haghaidh na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin.  Ach, cé nár caitheadh an t-airgead sa bhliain seo caite, tá na scéimeanna sin ag dul ar aghaidh agus meastar go mbeidh méadú mór ar an gcaiteachas ina leith sa bhliain airgeadais reatha.  Dá chomhartha sin, táimid tar éis an soláthar le haghaidh na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin d'ardú ó £125,000 anuraidh go dtí £170,000 i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh a fhios ag an Dáil cad tá ar siúl againn leis na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin agus, dá réir sin, déanfaidh mé trácht beag ar gach ceann ar leith díobh.  Seacht gcinn acu atá ann, mar leanas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Scéim na mBóthar: Tugadh dhá chineál deontais amach anuraidh faoin scéim seo, deontas 100 fán gcéad den chostas do na Comhairlí Contae i leith bóithre contae agus deontas 100 fán gcéad den chostas, a cuireadh ar fáil trí Oifig na Scéimeanna Fostaíochta Speisialta, do bhóithre áise, is é sin, do na bóithre nach bhfuil freagracht reachtúil ar na húdaráis áitiúla ná ar <Col N="1320" /> éinne eile ina leith.  De dhroim na taithí a fuarthas ar riaradh na ndeontaisí sin le cúpla bliain anuas táthar ar an tuairim anois gur mó an gá atá le cabhair airgid ón Roinn i gcás na mbóthar áise ná i gcás na mbóthar contae.  Tá gléas ann cheana féin, is é sin an Ród-Chiste, chun airgead a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na mbóthar contae agus is féidir an t-airgead sin a sholáthar le dea-thoil na gComhairlí Contae lena mbaineann an scéal. Taobh amuigh d'Oifig na Scéimeanna Fostaíochta Speisialta a chaitheann suimeanna éigin airgid ar choinníollacha áirithe i ndáil le hoibreacha bóthair, ní raibh gléas ar bith ann go dtí seo chun airgead a chur ar fáil do na bóithre áise.  Ar an ábhar sin agus ó tharla gur léir don Roinn anois go bhfuil an-éileamh ar chabhair i leith na mbóthar áise, tá socair furmhór Chise na mBothar sa bhFo-mhírcheann seo a chaitheamh, faid a bheas gá leis sin, ar na bóithre áise.</P>
    <P>2.  Scéimeanna Uisce-Sholáthair: Tá dhá chineál deontais á dtabhairt ag an Roinn do na húdaráis áitiúla i leith scéimeanna uisce-sholáthair&mdash; deontas 50 fán gcéad&mdash;60 fán gcéad i gcás caidéal agus mionscéimeanna píopaithe agus cumhachta, agus deontas 25 fán gcéad i gcás scéimeanna réigiúnacha.  Tá réamhobair fhairsing a ghabhas le scéimeanna den tsórt sin, agus sin é an fáth nach raibh mórán á íoc ina leith ag an Roinn i dtosach báire.  Le bliain anuas, ámh, táthar tar éis cuid mhaith scéimeanna a thosnú agus is cosúil, anois, go mbeidh méadú mór ar an gcaiteachas faoi na scéimeanna seo, go háirithe na scéimeanna réigiúnacha, sa bhliain airgeadais reatha.  Tríd is tríd mar sin táthar sásta leis an scéim deontaisí seo sa mhéid go bhfuil ag éirí leis cuspóir na Roinne a bhaint amach agus go bhfuil borradh ag teacht faoi chúrsaí uisce-sholáthair sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil scéimeanna á gcur i gcrích cheana féin gur chosúil nach dtosnófaí go ceann i bhfad orthu mura mbeadh gur cuireadh deontas ar fáil dóibh ón Roinn.</P>
    <P>3.  Mion-Oibreacha Mara: Scéim trína gcuirtear ar chumas na Roinne deontaisí 100 fán gcéad den chostas a <Col N="1321" /> chur ar fáil i leith muir-oibreacha áirithe sa Ghaeltacht ar choinníoll go mbeidh na húdaráis áitiúla iomchuí sásta cothabháil na n-oibreacha sin a ghlacadh mar chúram orthu féin tar éis a ndéanta.  Fágtar faoi Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, de ghnáth, tograí den tsórt sin a chur i gcrích, agus sa bhliain seo caite d'éirigh leo oibreacha áirithe a chur i gcrích ar chostas os cionn £3,000.  Tá clár oibre i bhfad níos leithne leagtha amach don bhlian seo agus má éiríonn le hOifig na nOibreacha Poiblí an clár sin a chomhlíonadh meastar go mbeidh caiteachas £14,000 ann ar oibreacha éagsúla.</P>
    <P>4.  Scéim Saoráidí Ilghnéitheacha: Tá scéim ag an Roinn trína dtugtar deontaisí suas go dtí 80 fán gcéad den chostas measta i ndáil le saoráidí éagsúla, cuir i gcás pinniúirí liathróid láimhe, faichí imeartha, linnte snámha, etc.  Tá roinnt éigin deontaisí ceadaithe cheana féin faoin scéim agus tá eadarbheartaíocht ar siúl ag an Roinn le Coistí Áitiúla i dtaobh timpeall dosaen cás den tsórt sin i láthair na huaire.  Is ábhar iontais é, ámh, a laghad tairbhe is a baineadh as na deontaisí seo ó tugadh isteach iad.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na scéimeanna trialacha maoth-thorthaí ar cuireadh tús leo i gContae Chiarraighe anuraidh, is féidir a rá go bhfuil forás ag teach fúthu do réir a chéile.  Tá scéimeanna beaga den tsórt chéanna bunaithe anois i gContae Choraighe agus i gContae Phortláirge le comh-oibriú na gCoistí Talmhaíochta ansin.</P>
    <P>5.  Scéim na Muc: Bhíothas sásta go maith leis an gcuma inar éirigh leis an Scéim seo anuraidh.  Tugadh 159 cránacha ar fad amach faoin scéim anuraidh agus tá socair timpeall 50 cráin eile a thabhairt amach i mbliana.</P>
    <P>6.  Scéim na dTrátaí: Tá socrú déanta chun go gcuirfear airgead ar fáil as fo-mhírcheann G i mbliana d'fhonn Scéim na dTrátaí a leathnú sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá tosnaithe cheana féin ar ghléasanna téimh a chur isteach i naoi gcinn déag de na tithe gloine i gConamara.  Tá gach ullmhúchán déanta freisin chun go bhféadfar timpeall fiche teach nua faoi theas a thógáil i gceantar Chonamara agus <Col N="1322" /> b'fhéidir 20 teach eile faoi theas a chur ar fáil i gceantar Thuar Mhic Éadaigh i gContae Mhuigheo.  Táthar ag súil leis go bhféadfar an obair sin uile a chur i gcrích in am do shéasúr na bliana 1960/61.</P>
    <P>7.  An Scéim chun Cabhrú le Meánscolaíocht sa Ghaeltacht: Tá ag éirí go maith leis an scéim seo.  I rith na bliana seo caite ceadaíodh deontais i dtrí cásanna.  I gcás amháin tá an obair ar fad críochnaithe agus tá an mheánscoil ag obair faoi lán-tseol cheana féin.  Tá an dá chás eile ag dul ar aghaidh go sásúil.  Diúltaíodh aon iarratas amháin i rith na bliana agus tá dhá iarratas eile faoi bhreithniú go fóill ag an Roinn.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann H den Mheastachán, tá míle punt á sholáthar arís i mbliana chun deontais bheaga a thabhairt le haghaidh imeachtaí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha sa Ghaeltacht. I rith na bliana seo caite do híocadh roinnt deontaisí i leith Féilí Drámaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus ina theannta san tugadh cúnamh airgid chun taifeadáin reatha agus óirnéisí ceoil a chur ar fáil do Choistí Áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht ar mhaithe le cúrsaí ceoil agus cúrsaí caidrimh.</P>
    <P>Déantar soláthar faoi Fho-Mhírcheann L le haghaidh an Deontais £5 a tugtar, faoi scéim a bunaíodh i 1934, do thuismitheoirí nó caomhnóirí, sa Ghaeltacht nó sa Bhreac-Ghaeltacht, i leith páistí scoile leo idir 6&mdash;16 bliana d'aois arb í an Ghaeilge teanga a dteaghlaigh agus a labhrann í go líofa nádúrtha.  Scéim an-tábhachtach í seo arb é a cuspóir an Ghaeilge a chothú agus a choinneáil mar theanga teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  Gheibheann tuairim 4,600 teaghlach deontas faoin scéim i leith tuairim 10,000 páiste ar fad.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-mhírcheann N den Mheastachán (Taispeántais Drámaíochta Gaeilge), tá méadú ó £2,000 go dtí £2,500 déanta i mbliana sa tsoláthar don Deontas a íoctar le Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe chun feabhsuithe áirithe atá ar intinn ag na Stiúrthóirí a chur i gcrích.  Ina theannta sin, tá £700 á sholáthar chun deontaisí a chur ar fáil do na Chumainn bheaga drámaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Íocfar na deontaisí tar éis moladh a fháil ó Choiste Comhairlitheach <Col N="1323" /> i ngach ceann de na ceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-mhírcheann O den Mheastachán tugtar cúnamh airgid do choistí áitiúla, faoi scéim a bunaíodh i 1936, chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Sa bhliain 1958 bhí méadú mór ar líon na bpáistí a bhí páirteach sa scéim i gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe sin agus tá súil agam go mbeidh méadú níos mó fós ann i mbliana.  Tá coinníollacha na scéime athraithe anois chun go mbeidh ar chumas daltaí sna Meán-scoileanna páirt a ghlacadh ann agus chuige sin tá an uasteorainn aoise ardaithe go 17 bliana.  Tá méadu cuí déanta san Mheastachán ó £1,600 anuraidh go £3,750 i mbliana agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh an oiread daltaí agus is féidir tairbhe as an scéim.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Scéim na mBád Iascaigh, faoi mar a chuireas in iúl don Dáil anuraidh tá cúig báid mhóra, ar chostas tuairim £12,000 an ceann, curtha ar fáil cheana féin agus tá ceithre báid bheaga, ar chostas tuairim £800 an ceann, tugtha amach le déanaí. Beidh tuilleadh de na báid bheaga seo á n-eisiúint i rith na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Níl ach cúpla bliain caite ó cuireadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ar bun agus tuigeann an Dáil go maith an méid oibre atá le déanamh chun cuspóirí na Roinne a bhaint amach.  Ní bheidh éinne ag súil go bhféadfaí é go léir a dhéanamh in éineacht.  I ndiaidh a chéile a tógtar na caisleáin, agus tá dóchas agam go n-éireoidh leis an Roinn do réir a chéile saol agus cor maireachtála mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú agus a chur chun cinn.  Is maith liom é bheith le rá agam go bhfuil comhoibriú agus comhairle le fáil go fial ó údaráis agus comhaltaí agus daoine a bhfuil spéis acu sa Ghaeltacht.  Bíonn lucht gearáin ann freisin ar ndóigh ach ní hiontas go mbeadh mí-fhoighid ar dhaoine faoin slí ina bhfuil cúrsaí saoil sa Ghaeltacht agus faoin staid ina bhfuil an teanga féin i ndiaidh na mblianta d'obair na hathbheochana.  Tá an Roinn ag iarraidh leas na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn le chéile agus déanaimíd iarracht, i <Col N="1324" /> scéimeanna uile na Roinne, tús a thabhairt do na ceantracha Fíor-Ghaeltachta agus do na daoine a labhrann an Ghaeilge de ghnáth agus a choinníonn beo bríomhar í ina dtithe muintire féin.  Is deimhin liom go n-aontóidh an Dáil liom go bhfuil an ceart againn sa méid sin.</P>

      <P>Is ait agus is íontach nach bhfuil tada le rá ag aon duine den Fhreasúra ar an Meastachán&mdash;nach bhfuil moladh nó locht le fáil uathu ar an ráiteas a thug an tAire uaidh.  Dá bhfaigheadh siad locht air le go bhfeabhasófaí é, níor bhfhéidir a rá ansin go rabhadar ag déanamh neamhshuime den Ghaeltacht. Ní bhainim-se meabhar ar bith as a dtost ach gur beag í a spéis i nGaeilge nó sa nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Is ar mhaithe leis an teanga atá an Roinn seo ann agus na habhair chaiteachais atá luaite ag an Aire.  Tá maitheas dá dhéanamh dá mbarr; ach is fánach a bheith ag súil go sabhálfar an teanga mar bheo-theanga gan í a scaipeadh ar fud na tíre.  Is ionann sabháil na Gaeilge agus a h-aithbheochaint go coitian.  Ba sórt críochdheighilt eile é da mbeadh cuid den tír taobh le teanga amháin agus teanga eile ag an gcuid eile den phobal&mdash; muintir na Gaeltachta, gan buachtáil Béarla acu, agus lucht an Bhéarla agus gan acu ach beagán eolais ar an teanga, agus a mhalairt de scéal sa chuid eile den tír.  I gcás mar sin tuigeann gach duine a bhfuil intleacht dá laghad aige go bhfuil géar-ghá le scaipeadh na teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin is ionann sábháil na Gaeltachta, sábháil na Gaeilge agus scaipeadh na Gaeilge.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir an teanga a shábháil mura bhfuil fonn láidir ar mhuintir na tíre an teanga a thabhairt ar ais arís mar bhun-teanga na tíre.  Is duine den tuairim sin mise a chreideas gur féidir <Col N="1325" /> an dá theanga a bheith go maith ag muintir na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Tá sé cruthaithe cheana ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil siad indon máistireacht an Bhéarla a bhaint amach freisin.  Ba mhaith liomsa a thuigsint go ndéanfaidh an chuid eile den tír an rud chéana a dhéanamh i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Mar sin is soléir dom gur obair sár-mhaith atá faoi lámha ag na Gaeilgeoirí anseo i mBaile Atha Cliath agus caithfidh mé Baile Cliath a mholadh freisin as ucht a bhful déanta ag lucht na teangan chun fáilte agus cúram a thabhairt do na daoine a thagann don chathair seo ón nGaeltacht.  Cuidíonn siad leo agus taispeánann siad dóibh go bhfuil meas acu ortha.  Láimh leis sin déanann siad tréan-iarracht an teanga a mhúineadh agus a scaipeadh i measc a gclainne féin.</P>
    <P>Tá freisin anseo i mBaile Atha Cliath gluaiseacht mór i dtaobh scríobh na Gaeilge agus is iontach go bhfuil dhá pháipear in Gaeilge le fáil ann, cheann amháin acu gach uile mí agus an ceann eile gach uile sheachtain.</P>
    <P>Tá sárobair á dhéanamh ag Club na Leabhar agus ina dtaobh sin freisin tá fhios againn nach bhfuil aon tagairt déanta dó faoin Meastachán seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Gearóid Mac Pharthaláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ach tá dlúth-bhaint idir an obair atá déanta ag an Aire agus an cuspóir atá taobhthiar den obair sin, eadhon, scaipeadh na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.</P>
      <P>Is cuma cad a deireann lucht cáinte agus na daoine a bhíos ag fáil locht toisc natch bhfuil na Gaeltachta níos fairsinge.  Deireann daoine eile go bhfuil siad ag cumhaingiú ach tá na Gaeltachta láidir de bharr a bhfuil déanta ag an Aire dóibh.  I dtaobh na Gaeltachta a bhfuil sár-eolas agam féin uirthi is é mo thuairim go bhfuil teorainn na Gaeltachta sin sna háiteacha a raibh siad dhá scór bliain ó shoin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fhios agam go bhfuil eolas níos fearr ar an mBéarla ins na Gaeltachta ná mar a bhí an t-am sin ach má tá, sin í polasaí díreach an Rialtais agus <Col N="1326" /> na Roinne Oideachais agus cuidíonn sé sin le muintir na Gaeltachta féin. Tá an Béarla acu comh mhaith leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní mar sin a bhí an scéal i gcónaí Roimhe sin, san tsean-am níor múineadh Gaeilge sna scolanna agus ba bheag an chuid Béarla a múineadh iontu freisin.  Ó thosaigh muid ar Rialtas na tíre tá eolas ag gach duine óg ar an dá theanga, Béarla is Gaeilge a scríobh agus a lán rudaí nach raibh ann fadó.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim gur cheart an Ghaeilge a spreagadh ar fud na tíre agus i nDáil Éireann freisin.  Is féidir le gnáth-mhuintir na hÉireann cuidiú leis seo.</P>
    <P>Ar an gcaoi sin, chomh maith is atá na scéimeanna atá luaite ag an Aire &mdash;agus tásiad le moladh&mdash;ní eireoidh linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil dá mbarr sin amháin ach tá na scéimeanna sin ag tabhairt compóird agus árdú caighdeáin maireachtála do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus fiú dá bharr sin féin tá an obair atá ar siúl ag an Aire le moladh.  Tá muintir na Gaeltachta buíoch de as a n-ucht agus cé go gcloisinn sé&mdash;agus tá fhios agam go gcluineann sé go minic&mdash;lyucht cáinte ag caitheadh anuas air féin agus ar an Roinn, tógfaidh sé uaimse go bhfuil formhór mhuintir na Gaeltachta buíoch de as ucht a bhfuil sé ag iarraidh a dhéanamh ar a son.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá cuidiú leis an óráid atá déanta ag an Aire.  Tá cuid mhaith luaite aige féin.  Tuigim-se b'fhéidir níos fearr ná an chuid is mó de na Comhaltaí chomh maith is atá sé ag leagadh anuas ó ceapadh mar Aire na Gaeltachta é.  Mar dúirt mé nuair thosaigh mé, tá an-díombáidh orm tar éis bheith ag éisteacht leis an gcaint ón taobh eile den Tigh.  Murach é, tá seans, b'fhéidir, nach bhfanfainn féin ar mo dhá chois chomh fada is d'fhan mé.</P>

      <P>This is really an insult to the people of the Gaeltacht. It is a piece of deliberate humbug, trying to convince the people of the Gaeltacht that something has been done, whereas absolutely nothing is being done.  I make a suggestion to the Minister. I do not know whether it will have any effect or not.  Would it not be much better to abolish his Department altogether and give the money provided for it to the Minister for Lands to give permanent employment in forestry and other works, instead of this humbug?</P>

Fianna Fáil talk from one year to the other about preserving the languyage, about what great people the people of the Gaeltacht are, and all the rest.  The Minister has relegated them by this document to the category of outcasts who are not worthy of anything. <Col N="1328" /> I would make one suggestion to the Minister: He ought to resign decently if his Government will not give him more money to do something for the Gaeltacht besides this.  He should, for once in his life, act the gentleman and resign.</P>

      <P>Is aisteach an óráid atá an Teachta Ó Bláthmhaic tar éis a dhéanamh mar tuigeann sé go rí-mhaith go bhfuil a lán déanta ag Rialtas Fianna Fáil le blianta anuas ar son na Gaeltachta agus muintir na Gaeltachta agus nach bhfuil anseo ach gné amháin den obair a rinneadh agus den obair atá ar siúl ag an Rialtas ar son na háite sin.</P>
      <P>Níl an Roinn seo curtha ar bun ach le cúpla blian anuas agus is inmholta an iarracht atá á dhéanamh.  Mar dúirt an tAire, bíonn daoine ann a deir nach bhfuil go leor á dhéanamh. Is fíor é sin.  Tá na daoine sin ann. Is ait an óráid a chualamar annseo anocht ó iar-Aire den Fhreasabhra, a bhí ar na binsí seo agus a chuidigh leis an Roinn a chur ar bun.  'Sé an Fhreasabhra a thug isteach an Bille a chuir an Roinn seo ar bun agus bhí an Teachta Ó Bláthmhaic ina Bhall den Rialtas sin mar Aire.  Chuir sé os cóir na Dála anocht an cheist gur cheart an Roinn seo do chur ar ceal&mdash; cad na thaobh, níor dhúirt sé.  B'fhéidir gur dhúirt sé sin nuair bhí ó shoin i bhfeidhm.  Níl fhios agam.</P>
      <P>Sílim féin go bhfuil dhá chuspóir ag an Roinn nó go mba cheart go mbeadh dhá chuspóir aici, is é sin, cabhrú leis an teanga a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht agus cabhrú leis na daoine ansin slí mhaireachtála fháil. Tá an dá chuspóir sin fite fuaite le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taobh amuigh de Roinn na Gaeltachta féin, tá sé d'oibliogáid ar an Rialtas cabhrú le daoine atá i na gcónaí i gceanntracha bochta mar atá sa Ghealtacht.  Dá mba é an Béarla a bhí ar siúl mar theanga nádúrdha na ndaione, bhéadh sé d'oibliogáid ar an Rialtas carbhrú leo.  Tarlaíonn sé gurab í an Ghaeltacht tobair fíoruisce na Gaeilge agus, dá bharr sin, tá sé mar oibliogáid níos mó ar an Rialtas agus, go speisialta ar Roinn na Gaeltachta, <Col N="1329" /> an dá chuspóir a luaigh mé a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann a deir go bhfuil limistéir na Gaeltachta ag dul i laghad, go bhfuil úsáid na teangan sa Ghaeltacht ag fáil bháis.  Ní chreidim é sin ar chor ar bith.  Chomh fada agus a thuigim, i nGealtacht Thírchonaill, tá leathnú ag teacht ar an uimhir a bhfuil an Ghaeilge go h-an-mhaith acu.</P>
    <P>Tá sé fíor go bhfuil níos mó daoine sa Ghaeltacht inniu atá ábalta Gaeilge agus Béarla a labhairt chomh maith le chéile ná bhí blianta ó shoin.</P>
    <P>Sílim nach bhfuil aon ní mí-cheart é bheith mar sin.  Taobh amuigh de dhream an-bheag sa tír seo ar fad, aontaíonn gach aon duine gurb é an aidhm atá againn an Ghaeilge a chur dá labhairt chomh maith le Béarla sa dóigh go mbeidh an tír dá-theangach.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir linn ár siúl a roinnt agus a rá gcaithfimíd an tír a dhéanamh Gaelach agus gan ach teanga amháin agus sin an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl ach fíor-bheagán ar an intinn sin anois.  Táimid go léir aontaithe gur ceart an dá theanga a reachtáil taobh le taobh agus gurb é an té is fearr nó an té gur féidir leis Gaeilge mhaith a labhairt agus Béarla maith freisin.  Tá curtha ar ár súile dúinn ag an Aire go bhfuil seacht nó ocht de ghnéithe éagsúla cabhrach tugtha don Ghaeltacht le dhá bhliain anuas. Luaigh sé seacht gcinn de rudaí atá usáideach agus a bhfuil buntáiste le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta astu. Sílim fhéin gur gá cabhair a thabhairt d'fheabhsú tithe cónaithe sa Ghaeltacht, d'fheabhsú na mbóithre ansin, gur rudaí an-mhaithe iad.</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh de sin tá deontaisí dá dtabhairt chun obair a dhéanamh i Ranna eile den Stát agus is mór an trua nár luaigh an tAire na rudaí sin chun a thaiseáint do dhaoine mar an Teachta Ó Bláthmhaic nach éseo an t-aon rud amáin atá ar siúl.  Creidim go mbíonn comhrá agus cainteanna idir an Aire agus Airí eile.  Cuir i gcás tá sé intuigthe go mbeadh comhoibriú idir Aire na Gaeltachta agus an Aire Tailte, an tAire atá i bhfeighil cur chun chinn iascaireachta agus foraoiseachta sa Ghaeltacht.  Le bliain anuas taobh amuigh den chaiteachas atá luaite <Col N="1330" /> anseo, caitheach mórán ar fhorbairt na hiascaireachta agus caitheadh suim níos mó i mbliana ná riamh ar fhoraoiseacht; agus den mhéid sin chuaigh cuid mhaith go dtí ceantracha na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Mar an gcéanna leis an Roinn Tionscail agus Tráchtála, ba cheart go mbeadh, agus tá mé ag súil go raibh cainteanna ag an Aire agus comhoibirú ag an Aire leis an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála.  Tá Bille os comhair an Tí fé láthair, an Bille Min-fhéir, rud a cuireadh ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bhí muintir Fianna Fáil ina Rialtas ó 1951 go 1953 nó 1954, ach rud a chur an Rialtas idir-Pháirteach ar ceal. Ní hé an t-aon rud amháin gur cuireadar ar ceal é sa Ghaeltacht ach chuireadar rudaí ar ceal sa chuid eile den tír chomh maith.</P>

Sílim féin gur cabhair maith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta an deontas a thabharfar do na &ldquo;chalets&rdquo; ansin ach tá mé féin den bharúil gur ceart leathnú ar an scéim sin sa dóigh go mbeidh daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht i ndon tithe a thógáil in san Ghaeltacht.  Má chuirtear teach ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht beidh an teach annsin agus is dóigh go mbeidh an t-airgead le tógáil an tí sa Ghaeltacht freisin.  Má théann an plean annsin, má tá glacadh leis ansin agus má théann an teaghlach ar saoire, caithfidh siad airgead feasta ansin.  Má chuireann siad an teach ar cíos nuair a bheas a gclann féin críochnaithe leis, pé duine a thagann sa teach annsin caithfidh siad airgead chomh maith.

    <P>Fé láthair tá Gaeltarra Éireann, ina Bhórd neamhspleách don Rialtas.  Bhí gearán agam le daoine ar an slí a cuireadh éadach bréidín ar fáil ar fud na tíre ar luach timpeall 5/6d. agus 6/- an tslat.  Sin ceann de na céad rudaí a rinne an Bórd nua.  Rinne siad sin ag am go raibh caochló beag tagartha ar déantúis an bhréidín.  Rinne siad sin ag am go raibh gach aon <Col N="1331" /> duine a bhí in san tionscal sin á fháil deacair an bréidín a dhíol taobh amuigh den tír.  B'éigin dóibh é a dhíol ar luach saor go leor ar fud na tíre seo.  Ach ansin tháining an Bórd agus pé éadach ar bith a bhí ar na seilpeanna le blianta anuas, &ldquo;flagáil&rdquo; siad é ar fuid na tíre go léir, sa treo go ndearna siad an scéal i bhfad níos measa.  Níl fhios agam gur ceart go ndéanfaidh aon Roinn Stáit rud mar sin.  Bhí orthu an t-éadach a dhíol uair éigin ach do bhféidir leo fanúint go dtí go mbeadh an díolíocht ar luachanna ísle thart.  Sílim go bhfuil rud eile ansin freisin.  Sílim go mbeadh ar Bhord na Gaeltachta an t-airgead d'aisioc leis an Aire Airgeadais.  Má leanann siad ag déanamh rudaí cosúil le díol an bhréidín mar a rinne siad agus má dhéanann siad an rud céanna onsna tionscail eile atá acu ní bheidh ag a gcumas an t-airgead a ba chóir doibh a aisíoc, a aisíoc leis an Aire.</P>
    <P>Níl aon chúis éadóchais ann i dtaobh dul siar nó dul ar gcúl labhairt na Gaeilge.  Is maith a chloisint fiú amháin i mBaile Átha Cliath&mdash;an Gaeilge á labhairt sna stráideanna, ins na busanna, agus mar sin.  Do bhí an Ghaeltacht dílis don Gaeilge. Do thug muinntir na Gaeltachta caoi do dhaoine an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim leis na blianta anuas agus go háirithe do tugadh caoi do oidi scoile dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun an teanga líofa d'fáil ann.  Inniu, tá gach duine sa tír fé, abair, tríocha bliain d'aois, indon an Ghaeilge a thuigsint agus tá an chuid is mó acu indon í a scriobh agus a léamh.  Sílim féin nach bhfuil aon chontúirt ann go bhfaigh an teanga bás.</P>
    <P>Fé láthair, ar fud na tíre, tá gá ann le spiorad chun daoine do mhuscailt chun an teanga do labhairt i bhfad nios mó.  Tá roinnt daoine ann agus tá eagla orthu an Ghaeilge do labhairt toisc go gceapann siad nach bhfuil sí go maith acu.  Nuair a cloistear iad a caint is léir go bhfuil togha na Gaeilge acu agus nach bhfuil de dhith orthu ach taithí.  Do bhí cruinniú de Theachtaí le déanaí agus do chuadar tríd an obair ar fad trí Ghaeilge.  Is mór an trua nach labhrann nios mó Teachtaí trí Ghaeilge anseo.  Tá a bheag nó mhór de Ghaeilge ag <Col N="1332" /> an gcuid is mo de na Teachtaí anseo agus, biodh sé beag nó mór, ba chór doibh í a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud is mó atá de dhíth orainn anois ná sampla.  Is gá sampla do na Teachtai, do na Stáitseirbhisigh agus do na daoine a mhúnlaíonn &ldquo;popular opinion.&rdquo;  Is mór an chabhair é sampla chun an Ghaeilge do chur ar aghaidh.  Ní cóir go ndéanfaí buntáiste politicíuil as an nGaeilge.  Sílim nach ndéantar é sin ag gach aon dream.  Tá an Rialtas ar an dtaobh seo agus gach dream ar an dtaobh eile den Tigh ar aon aigne faoi cheist na Gaeilge.  Biodh is go bhfuil an scéal mar sin, pé rud a thárlaíonn ar na Meastacháin eile nó pé rud a tharlaíonn ar pé Bille a beadh ós comhair an Tí, ní ceart go dtarlódh sé go mbeadh sé ar aon dream amháin anseo an Gaeilge a labhairt ar an Meastachán seo.  Fiú amháin an méid beag daoine atá sa ngaleri fé láthair, deárfaidh siad go bhfuil sampla an-olc á thabhairt as ucht an líon beag Teachtaí atá anseo fé láthair agus, fosta, gur deallrach go raibh an oiread sin beagáin spéis ag na Teachtaí sna Pairtithe eile sa Meastachán seo ná labhródh siad in nGaeilge.</P>

It is a waste of good officers in the Department.  I shall pay them that tribute. These men were specially selected for that Department but there is no imangination at the head.  I suggest the Minister should hand over the whole Department to Gael-Linn. They have imagination and approach to things.  They have done things that our Department had no idea of doing.</P>

      <P>I maintain their activities have not stopped one emigrant and that that is why this Department was set up, to deal with areas that are being bled white by emigration.  They want imagination.  They want a better policy than one of merely growing a few onions in Aran, and so on.  As <Col N="1333" /> I am on the question of Aran I would like the Department to safeguard a little industry there.  The Aran crios and the Aran sweater are now being made in the backrooms of this city. They are being cashed in on by the smart boys of this town and I hope the Department will do something to stop that.</P>
      <P>On the question of the grant in respect of school children in the Gaeltacht, it is a very mean thing for some of these officers to go around and give the impression they are tourists.  They walk into a house and if the people in the house think they are tourists, naturally they will address them in the language the tourists know, the English language.  The report then goes back that Irish is not the spoken language of that home and these people are deprived of what they are entitled to.  If you want to save the Irish language you must save the Irish speakers from emigrating.</P>

      <P>Táim cinnte go mbreathnóaidh an tAire agus an Roinn isteach i gcúpla poinnte atá agam le cur féna mbráid.  Tá go léor daoine i mo cheantar go mbíonn an íocaíocht dheire den deontas tithe ag dul dóibh agus cuirtear cigire thart chun an scéal a scrúdú.  Ní féidir le aon cigire amháin gach cás a scrúdú i nDún na nGall, Muigheo, Gaillimh agus an Clár.  Dá bhrí sin tá daoine ag fanacht leis an deontas le trí mhí anuas agus níl sé acu fós.  Ba cheart cigire sa bhreis a chur ar fáil ionus gur féidir le cigire amháin taisteal a dhéanamh i nDún na nGall agus i Muigheo agus an cigire eile sa nGaillimh agus sa Chlár.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá gearán eile ann i dtaobh na <Col N="1334" /> dtithe nua atá ann.  Tháinig an cigire amach le sé mhí anuas agus d'iarr ar na daoine a bhí ag cur suas na dtithe úlaireachta do shaghas áirithe adhmaid in ionad na sean chinn do chur isteach.  Ní dóigh liom gur cheart cur isteach ar na daoine mar sin, mar níl aon locht ar na úrlaireacha a bhí ann cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Deir cuid de na Teachtaí go bhfuil an teanga ag dul i laige sa Ghaeltacht. Ní aontaím leis sin.  Tá labhairt na teanga ag dul i bfeabhas agus, le cúnamh Dé, tiocfaidh feabhas níos fearr air do réir a chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile agam i dtaobh deontas na bpáistí scoile.  Cuir i gcás go bfágann fear óg an tír seo chun dul go hAlbain nó go Sasana.  B'fhéidir go bpósann sé cailín taobh amuigh den Gaeltacht.  Tagann sé abhaile agus socraíonn sé síos sa Ghaeltacht. B'fhéidir go mbeidh clann aca agus nuair a bhíonn siad ag dul ar scoil agus nuair a thagann siad go dtí am an deontais, ocht bliana d'aois, tagann an cigire thart agus deireann sé nach í an Ghaeilge teanga an tí.  Ní hé sin locht na mná mar nach raibh an teanga aici ó dhúchais.  Ba cheart don Aire bhreathnú isteach sa scéal seo ionus go mbronnfar an deontas ar dhaoine mar seo chomh fada agus atá an teanga foghluimthe aca.  Ma tá an teanga ar fheabhas aca is ceart an deontas a thabhairt.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately my speaking knowledge of Irish is not sufficiently good to enable me to address the House in the native language.  As a Deputy coming from a constituency part of which is in the Gaeltacht, I am pleased with the progress made in the Department of the Gaeltacht in the past year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, in the Gaeltacht I represent it should have been possible to introduce further activities during the year under review. However, every beginning is weak and one finds some evidence of progress <Col N="1335" /> no matter how small, and we have to be grateful for it.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the Minister took over the Department of the Gaeltacht, he announced the introduction of regional water schemes for the Gaeltacht under a special grant.  I am glad to say that quite a number of acute problems were taken care of in the North Kerry Gaeltacht under those schemes.  The local authority had this proposal on their books for many years but due to a shortage of local finance were unable to undertake the necessary work.  During the past 12 months the Kerry County Council, with the aid of grants from the Minister's Department, have provided for and almost completed 15 or 16 rural water supply schemes.  The schemes, as I have said already, are in many instances complete and are in service.  I am very happy to be able to tell the Minister this evening that the local people who have so far benefited from those schemes are entirely grateful to his Department for the initiative and assistance which they have given in this matter.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I am glad to be able to record that the tourist potential of the particular districts so serviced has increased considerably due to the fact that the householders in these particular villages and areas are in a position to tell the visitors who are anxious to come to the Gaeltacht that they have running water in their homesteads. That development in itself over a period of 12 months completely justifice the establishment of a separate department for the Gaeltacht.  All we have to do is to compare the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the Gaeltacht in other parts of County Kerry in the matter of these amenities to which I have referred and we find a vast difference between the respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to suggest at this stage that the schemes which have been provided over the past 12 months have covered the entire requirements of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in North Kerry. Indeed, very far from it.  I rather feel that the Minister might now push the local authority a little bit in this matter.  Evidently, the schemes which <Col N="1336" /> have been executed came about as a result of a list of proposals which the local authority passed some years ago and had on their books as I have already said.  For some reason which I find it very hard to explain the local authority has not proceeded to envestigate the requirements of other villages and districts in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in question.  I do not know whether it is possible or not or whether the Minister has power to do it but I would suggest that he might at least indicate to the local authority that they should prepare a further list of proposals and send it forward for approval here.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, to be expected that the villages and districts which have not been supplied have become a bit impatient.  They are inclined to feel at times that the grants which had been in operation through the Minister's Department may not continue and that they might find themselves eventually without the amenities which have been provided for their neighbours.</P>
    <P>The Minister also introduced in Kerry&mdash;I am glad he referred to it in his report&mdash;the experimental scheme in connection with soft fruits.  I can say that so far as the Department is concerned they got complete co-operation on the introduction of this scheme from the local County Committee of Agriculture.  That particular body readily made available the services of a horticultural instructor to organise the soft fruit scheme for North Kerry Gaeltacht.  This man is a very young man and very energetic and a man who had a very strong interest in pushing the scheme all over the Gaeltacht.  He did not, however, influence a sufficiently large number of people to embark upon this scheme.  I do not know why the local people should be so conservative in this matter.  A very liberal grant and technical assistance were available for the implementation of the scheme.  As far as I can understand, a market was available for the many fruits that might successfully be grown in the district.  In fact, I think that the price which could reasonably be expected for such goods was also reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister could add <Col N="1337" /> some weight to the scheme in question if it was possible for him to provide the local area directly with the services of a horticultural instructor who could work entirely through the Department.  I want at the same time to reiterate what I have said about the work carried out by the local instructor. I do not want it to be in the least inferred that I am trying in any way to reflect on this man.  He is doing very good work.  Other responsibilities are pushed on to him and it is possible that he may not be able to give sufficient time to pushing the soft fruit scheme in the Kerry Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Minister that the people of the area are somewhat disappointed that, so far, the Department has not introduced the tomato-house scheme to the Kerry Gaeltacht. From the Minister's report and from other sources which come to our knowledge from time to time we know that in the Connemara Gaeltacht that scheme is being carried on in a rather extensive way.  So far as I can understand, it has not been introduced in the Gaeltacht south of the Shannon. In the matter of growing tomatoes I think it would be possible to get a more satisfactory response than there is in the case of soft fruit.  I understand that the people in the Gaeltacht feel that the growing of tomatoes in that particular area seems to be more suitable to the type of soil available than the growing of soft fruits.  Apart from that, now that the Minister's Department is very well organised and running smoothly and efficiently, the Minister could be expected to introduce this scheme to the Kerry Gaeltacht.  I appeal to him to try to do so at the earliest possible moment. I think I am correct in saying that the local co-operation which will be forthcoming for such a scheme will be quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred this evening in his report, when introducing the Estimate, to the Scéim na Muc.  I can tell the Minister also that the applicants who succeeded in being allocated sows under that scheme are quite satisfied that it is a useful and remunerative source of revenue to supplement the other sources that these <Col N="1338" /> small holders had to eke out a living. I think, however, that the scheme, as it stands at the moment, is a bit conservative. As far as I know, it provides only for the allocation of sows to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and does not enable an applicant in the Breac-Ghaeltacht to obtain the necessary facilities in this connection.  If that is so, I would suggest to the Minister that he might widen the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a big potential in this line of activity.  It is a type of work that seems to appeal to rural farmers and particularly to smallholders because they find it a very valuable source of income, as I have said already, to supplement their general means of livelihood.  It is money very well spent. In addition to that, it provides the successful applicants with work to produce the crops, the cereals and all the rest necessary to feed the sows which they get under the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Minister's report to special miscellaneous amenities which are provided under the Vote for the Department.  They are schemes whereby grants may be provided for handball alleys, playing pitches and swimming pools.  In the matter of playing pitches the Minister is rendering a very signal service to the Gaeltacht if he can assist, without too much formality, in bringing to fruition any proposals which may come to him for providing them.  The deficiencies in amenities in every Gaeltacht can be pin-pointed.  One is swimming pools and the other is playing pitches for various kinds of games, particularly for children.  I am glad that the Minister has taken the provision of swimming pools into the scope of the scheme because in the Kerry Gaeltacht there is a complete absence of any facilities for swimming.  The western seaboard is rather dangerous, particularly for people who are not accomplished swimmers.  For them bathing is especially dangerous and generally is not undertaken at all. Swimming pools that could be constructed at very moderate cost would provide a much-needed amenity, and would also increase tourist income in such an area.</P>
    <P>The general scope of activities in the Munster Gaeltacht is something <Col N="1339" /> that I think could be extended considerably. We always felt, prior to the setting up of Roinn na Gaeltachta, that its predecessor, the Gaeltacht Services, seemed completely to forget that there was any Gaeltacht south of the Shannon.  That statement might appear to be a little exaggerated, but the powers who have been charged with the responsibility of administering schemes in the Gaeltacht must admit that there were no small industries set up in the Kerry Gaeltacht under the auspices of the Gaeltacht Services, or even by Roinn na Gaeltachta since its establishment.  The small industries I refer to are toy making, weaving and sea-weed industries, industries such as those that have been developed in Mayo and the Donegal Gaeltachts.  I understand some of them have actually been developed by outside bodies such as Gael Linn who have gone into this line of business.</P>
    <P>There is a complete absence of that type of home industry, if I may call it so, in our Gaeltacht, and we hope that the Minister will set about doing something in that connection during the coming year.  We have the necessary personnel to operate any local schemes of that kind.  I want to tell the Minister, though I am sure he knows it from his travels through our area, that we have one local industry that could be termed an industry.  It is a knitwear industry near Dingle which is operated by a religious community. It provides good employment for a limited number of girls who are working in it under the management of the Sisters.  Beyond that we have not one single other industry in the Kerry Gaeltacht, and I think we are entitled to our due proportion of whatever industries might be established under the auspices of Gaeltarra Éireann, or directly under the Departments.</P>
    <P>There are various types of industries that I think would present themselves for consideration by whatever Department will eventually undertake that work.  As far as I can see in connection with the expenditure of money under certain headings, according to the Minister's statement, during the past twelve months there was a carry-over in a number of cases, and there was <Col N="1340" /> a carry-over under this heading also. Like all other Gaeltachta there is considerable emigration from the Kerry Gaeltacht and, if any industries of the type I have suggested were established there, they would help to stem the tide of emigration and would give some optimistic prospect to the people who were born in that area, a prospect that would enable them to settle down permanently there and retain their native tongue, which we all so dearly love.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to accept that the Munster Gaeltacht is not suitable for industries and, for that reason, I would like to know if the Minister has any explanation to give as to why industries of the type I suggest have not been initiated there in the past.  At the same time I sincerely hope that the Minister, when concluding, will find it possible to give me some assurance that this very important matter will be examined.  The people of the Kerry Gaeltacht are anxiously awaiting some proposals from the Department or Gaeltarra Eireann, as the case may be, in connection with the matters I have now raised, and I sincerely hope it will be possible for some progress to be reported on this particular matter during the coming twelve months.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon. We will say no more than this.  I shall not quote because we are speaking on a different Estimate.  However, one would imagine that for the first time in the past 29 years we are now about to salvage the Gaeltacht from the position into which it has fallen.  The Parliamentary Secretary had charge of this Department for a good while.  Fianna Fáil have had charge of it since 1932 with the exception of a few years when we had Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Mulcahy endeavouring to do some of the things that we thought were necessary to bring it out of the mire into which it had fallen but, when here we find a Minister introducing an Estimate telling us today that after all those years of Fianna Fáil Government there is so much to be done for the Gaeltacht that one could not expect very much in a year or so, we can only wonder.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moloney is a gentleman for whom I have nothing but respect.  I know the constituency he represents.  I see the Ballyferriter Gaeltacht dwindling away as I see the Donegal Gaeltacht that Deputy Breslin and I represent dwindling away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also see my friend, the Deputy from Galway here, and I see his Gaeltacht dwindling away, day after day, but I am very glad to see he has signified to me, not by word of mouth but by a shaking of the hand, that his is a prosperous Gaeltacht.  I sincerely hope it will be put on record that we have the Deputy from the Connemara Gaeltacht telling us things were never more prosperous there than they are today.  Am I right in interpreting that?  I notice he does not give me that assent he gave me a few moments ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the unfortunate privilege the other morning of seeing five busloads of migrants leaving the Rosses&mdash;the Rosses and Gweedore region&mdash;the largest Gaeltacht in this country.  We see them slip out day by day after approximately twenty years of Fianna Fáil, twenty years of endeavouring to push Irish down the throats of the Irish people, instead of encouraging <Col N="1343" /> those Irish speakers in the Irish Gaeltacht areas to remain in the country.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is amusing to me to hear Ministers get up in this House&mdash; I am not referring to the present Government alone; I am referring to the Government of which I had the honour of being a member&mdash;saying we are progressing, that the Irish language is going on fine.  Yet when I find young Ministers in the present Government, Ministers who were taught through the medium of Irish in National Schools and Secondary Schools, and it is as much as they could do through that language as to pass the usual salutary blessing of &ldquo;Dia dhuit,&rdquo; I must ask is the Irish language progressing?</P>
    <P>A serious attempt was made to set up industries in the Gaeltacht.  I do not wish to comment very much on that at this stage.  Possibly later on I may but, if one considers that exodus out of our Irish speaking districts, one realises the futility of the efforts made by Fianna Fáil down through the years.  I thought that at one stage they were doing something good by transplanting Irish families from the Galway Gaeltacht, the Kerry Gaeltacht, and the Donegal Gaeltacht into Meath, and I thought we were getting enthusiasts down in those localities to remain with those people, to encourage and foster the speaking of the Irish language.  However, some prominent officials of Fianna Fáil who were teachers in those localities saw the futility of the efforts made and now we find them principal teachers, not in the Gaeltachta of Donegal, Galway, Mayo or Gibbstown, but somewhere in the neighbourhood of the City of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but through the medium of the Minister for the Gaeltacht we dispense a certain amount of moneys through the deóntas to the children who speak Irish in various localities.  Gibbstown was one of the places into which we poured a lot of money in those days, and I am referring to Gibbstown, that locality where we thought we would foster a second Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect, all I can say is that there is such a thing as passing the buck, and when you find a decent family who are Irish speakers and cannot get the £5 deóntas to which they are entitled from the Department of Education, ultimately they are referred to the Department of the Gaeltacht, and they in turn pass the buck on.  That is what has left the Gaeltacht as it is today.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer and that is what the Minister has done through the Gaeltacht Housing Inspectors.  Their duty is to go around, first of all, and find out if Irish is the spoken language of the applicant for a reconstruction grant or a building grant.  Deputy Geoghegan from Galway is fortunate. From Donegal we sent down an Inspector for whom we had nothing but the greatest respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While he was with us he understood the family life of every household in the parish, town-land or locality.  I am not going to pass any unfavourable comments on his successor.  It would be very unfair but I do say that his successor <Col N="1345" /> came to us at a very wrong time.  I am certain he is a very excellent official. I do not want to pass any comments on that, but he came to us a very short time before the Donegal County Council decided to suspend the County Council supplementary grants.  When he went to visit applicants, possibly on account of lack of knowledge of the northern dialect and his lack of knowledge of family life in Donegal, he did a thing which I can never understand.  He postponed his decisions on their applications for a period of six months.  He said &ldquo;I will come back at the end of six months and see if your Irish has improved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No Deputy, barnacled old warriors like you and me, will learn Irish in six months.  I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary is not here to know that I do not mean that in any personal way. We have either got Irish where Irish is spoken in our households, but we do not pick it up in six months.  He postponed his decisions on these cases for six months. I do not mind that so much, but what has happened is that they have now lost their supplementary grants because the Donegal County Council closed down on them on 31st March and supplementary grants are no longer available.  That is a serious matter for these unfortunate people living in the Gaeltacht.  That minor official was merely covering his Minister by back-pedalling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My interpretation of the Act is this, that Irish must be the spoken language of the family.  Irish will not become the spoken language of the household in six months.  If it did, we would all be doing very well and we would have an Irish-speaking State in a very short time.  I complain to the Minister that, through some of his officials&mdash;I know he takes the responsibility for it and I do not want to blame them personally for it&mdash;they have done more damage to unfortunate applicants for Gaeltacht housing grants in Donegal than one could imagine.  When an applicant is refused the Gaeltacht housing grant, he may then apply for a Local Government grant, but unfortunately at that stage the Donegal County Council&mdash;and I am speaking for the greatest Gaeltacht in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The position is that we represent&mdash;in case someone disputes <Col N="1347" /> it&mdash;one of the largest Gaeltachta. We find this poor unfortunate applicant who applies for a Gaeltacht housing grant having to go back and apply for a local government grant but owing to the lateness of his application, being excluded from the supplementary housing grant.  Everyone knows that the £300, or whatever the maximum grant is, is supplemented by an equal amount from the local authority and it makes a very serious and large contribution towards the building of the house.  When they lose that local authority supplementary housing grant, it is very serious for them and I do not know any way whatever at the moment of assisting them.  I would like the Minister to look into it now and request the local authorities to review these cases.  I do not think it would be fair for me, because I have great respect for the Civil Service, to say they are inefficient, or that this occurred through the inefficiency of a civil servant, but it occurred through the inexperience, if I may use that expression, of a civil servant, a new official, turning them down.  Those particular cases should be reviewed and I would like to see them reviewed. They are on record and he knows them.</P>
      <P>There is only one other complaint I have to make against the Minister on his Estimate.  The Minister is a gentleman we like very much, but unfortunately we do not see him often enough in Donegal.  I do not know whether it is that he fights shy of our dialect or that he does not like our county.  We would like to see him more often.  I can assure him that when he does come there will be no person who will give him a more hearty welcome than myself.</P>

There is no one we would like more to see coming and inquiring about the people in the Gaeltacht, coming around and meeting them and asking them what might be done.  The módh-díreach is the best method in this country, be it for teaching Irish <Col N="1348" /> or for inquiring into the requirements of the Gaeltacht.  I understand the Minister recently visited one of the most northerly outposts in our county, namely, Tory Island.  There are equally important Gaeltachts in our area, possibly not from the political point of view but from the Irish-speaking point of view.  We would welcome the Minister in Rannafast or even in Gweedore, Gortahork or any of those other places.  It is only by coming up there and short-circuiting the usual Civil Service methods that he will find out what our needs are.</P>
      <P>If I might say so, he might consult both Gael Linn and Comhaltas Uladh, who are doing so much for the spoken Irish language.  I do not mean to say anything against the present Minister in that respect.  I am referring to his predecessors and the predecessors of his Ministry.  Those two bodies are doing much more work for the spoken language than all the moneys voted by this House since 1922.  In 1927, I think a Commission was set up to inquire into the Gaeltacht.  We had then a very large Gaeltacht.  It is dwindling fast.  It could be saved.  We can only rock the cradle of the Irish language in one place, we can rock it in the Gaeltacht and the sooner the Minister and his officials and this House realise that that is the place it can be rocked, the better.  If we do not, we will have Irish as we know it as well known in Ireland as Latin is today.  That is not what we want.  We want Irish the spoken language.  We do not want it the written or the reading language of our unfortunates who have to leave the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, may I tell the House a very interesting story.  I know a family where the head of the family was a school teacher in the heart of the Cloughaneely Gaeltacht.  In his household nothing has been spoken to his children but Irish.  They have been taught through the medium of Irish. Unfortunately, three of them are compelled now to emigrate.  One of them is in employment in London and the other is in Birmingham.  I asked this gentleman quite recently whether they wrote often and he said they did, that they wrote every week.  I was very glad to hear that.  I said: &ldquo;Have they ever <Col N="1349" /> spoken a word of English in your household?&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Do they write to you in Irish?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;No, they write in English all the time.&rdquo;  Does that not give us food for thought?  Does that not suggest that our method of trying to revive the Irish language is completely wrong?</P>

      <P>I quite agree and certainly would not dispute what you say in that regard.  There is one primary consideration, and let us not allow technicalities or trivialities to enter into it.  The Minister is concerned with the revival of the spoken language, and, if we say something here in discussing that particular matter and if we encroach on some other Department, then I know that the House will forgive us in our desire to revive that ancient, traditional language of our own.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I notice that my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, can say that he loves the language and that he can speak the language, and other Deputies speak of &ldquo;the language that we all love&rdquo;&mdash;but just like himself they do not speak the language.  If they loved it as much as they protest they do, they would be speaking it.</P>
      <P>That is what I think is the matter. Deputy O'Donnell kept using the phrase &ldquo;the unfortunate people living in the Gaeltacht.&rdquo; After looking through the Minister's statement I think it is the people living outside the Gaeltacht who are the unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>There is the copy of the Minister's speech in English.  I daresay I could make a fair crack at picking up this Irish copy and reading it.  Maybe a lot of people would think I have good Irish and know it fluently. We are voting £291,700 for salaries and expenses in connection with Roinn na <Col N="1350" /> Gaeltachta, including housing grants and sundry grants-in-aid.  In order to preserve the Gaeltacht areas, we are subsidising industries there.  We are to give swimming pools, playing fields&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They usually get them in the long run.  We are to give them sows, water supply schemes, tomato houses, schemes to assist secondary education in Gaeltacht areas, and so on.  I notice also that any speaker who mentioned Gaeltacht areas spoke about the Kerry, Galway and Donegal Gaeltachts and Gaeltachts everywhere else but nobody mentioned the Gaeltachts in my constituency. I think that that has got itself down even into the Department of the Gaeltacht because at all times, whether it was the giving out of boats or the giving out of grants, we were forgotten.</P>

      <P>When I first came into this House I kept shouting that 80 boats were given out and that we got one boat, the <i>Ardmore.</i>  I think we should frame her.  This has been going on for a good length of time.</P>
      <P>I want to put this question to the Minister.  Is any Gaeltacht area expanding&mdash;the area itself or the population of Irish-speaking people?  I heard Deputy Lindsay say last week, on the subject of chalets for Gaeltacht areas, that Achill was a Gaeltacht areas.  I understand that in 1925, 85 to 90 per cent. of the people of Achill were Irish speakers but that today they are practically wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask ourselves if, by providing these moneys, giving these grants and doing all these things for the people in the Gaeltacht, we are helping to keep the Gaeltacht going.  It looks as if everybody in the Gaeltacht should be supplicants to the Dáil or to a Department or to its inspectors to give handouts to them.  They are just told: &ldquo;If you speak Irish you qualify for all these things but if you do not speak it you will not qualify.  If we consider that you are not speaking it <Col N="1351" /> we will go away and will come back in six or 12 months' time.&rdquo;  They do not say it but the inference is that they will go away in order to give the person a chance of studying the language. As Deputy O'Donnell said, either they have the language or they have not.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves if the Irish people as a whole or even the people in the Gaeltacht want to preserve the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A Gaeltacht area is an area in which the Irish language is spoken.  If the people there speak the language they qualify for a cut out of this £291,700.  By providing this money and these handouts, are we helping the language?  Do the people want us to help the language?  Do the people care?  If the people cared for and loved the language, they would not need anything like that.</P>
      <P>A great deal of these areas which we call Gaeltacht areas now were isolated up to about 25 or 30 years ago.  They were more isolated than any other areas in the country.  Since then transport has improved.  It is easier to get jobs in England.  A lot of young people there who grew up speaking Irish and who would have remained there speaking Irish saw that those who migrated from the Gaeltacht obtained a higher standard of living.  They saw that the people who remained in the Gaeltacht had to live at a much lower standard of living than those who left it.  That is one of the Minister's difficulties. I cannot see that the provision of these moneys, sows, greenhouses, and so on, will keep the people in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year, I intend to ask the Minister a Parliamentary Question as <Col N="1352" /> to how much money was spent on the Gaeltacht area of Ring in my constituency. I shall ask how much the people there got by way of grants for reconstruction or for boats or for anything else mentioned in the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>With regard to boats, the Dáil was informed last year that five large boats costing approximately £12,000 each were provided and that recently four smaller boats costing approximately £800 each had been given out and that further issues of the smaller boats will be made this year.  Did any of these boats come to the constituency of Waterford?</P>

      <P>I had something to say about the <i>Ardmore.</i>  I made representations to Deputy Dillon.  The <i>Ardmore</i> was going somewhere else. This is a matter of record.  Two men were sent from Helvic to Galway and succeeded in convincing the Department that they would be able to navigate such a boat.  The <i>Ardmore</i> was sent to Helvic.  That was before this year or last year.  The <i>Ardmore</i> is a museum piece down there because she is the only one they ever saw.  Are we likely to get any more of these boats? I knew about that one and had something to do with it.  I do not say I got the boat but only I kept protesting here the boat would not have gone and I think the Minister's predecessors and his officers in the Department will bear me out in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If some of the £291,700 which is provided for all these plans were diverted into the funds of Gael Linn and other such organisations, they would do more to make Irish a living language.  It is not right either for my colleagues or for people on the other side to be talking about the people of the Gaeltacht as if they were poor unfortunate applicants and supplicants for these handouts.  The people outside the Gaeltacht, who speak the language of the foreigner, as it is called, who earn the £1 of the foreigner <Col N="1353" /> have to carry on to the best of their ability rearing their children without any of the help or handouts that are given to the people who are lucky enough to be born in areas where the Irish language is spoken.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Donnell had a complaint about some official of my Department who he suggests, through inexperience or for some other reason, was too particular with the applicants in the area with which he is familiar. The gravamen of his complaint was that this inspector postponed his decision in some cases because he was not satisfied with the knowledge of Irish possessed by the applicant concerned. I am advised that this very same practice has been the rule, not alone in this Department but in the section covering the Gaeltacht areas that went before it, since 1934, that this practice has always been there and, indeed, from my own experience I can say I have seen files since I came into Roinn na Gaeltachta from which it appears that this practice is followed in every Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I feel that the inspectors concerned would be most anxious to give the grants forthwith if they were satisfied that the applicant was entitled to get the grants.  Indeed, the inspector who refuses an applicant because of his knowledge of Irish and puts him back six months to see if he will improve his knowledge is putting much more trouble on himself from his own personal point of view.  I cannot understand the suggestion made by Deputy O'Donnell that this was some innovation that was introduced by me.  In fact, it would appear that this has been the practice since 1934 and the practice that has been enforced both by this Department and that section of the Department of Lands which dealt with the Gaeltacht before Roinn na Gaeltachta was established.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to say that the <Col N="1355" /> House in general&mdash;and the last Deputy who spoke&mdash;would not be satisfied to vote money for the people in the Gaeltacht unless for the particular purpose of preserving the Gaeltacht as a living Gaeltacht.  There would be no point at all if the Department were to dish out grants indiscriminately within Limistéirí na Gaeltachta to people who not alone did not have the language but were not sufficiently interested in it although their neighbours use Irish as their everyday speech.  There is largely no justification for giving special treatment to the Gaeltacht unless it is carefully provided that the officials of the Department will only give these benefits to people who are prepared to speak the language and promote the language in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I cannot visualise any quicker way of destroying the Fíor-Ghaeltacht that are left than to give the benefit of these schemes to people who are not sufficiently interested in the language and in speaking it to qualify for them.</P>
    <P>As far as the housing grants are concerned, I assume that in the Gaeltacht areas they qualify for supplementary grants under the different county councils. I regret to hear from Deputy O'Donnell that Donegal county council evidently have decided to discontinue these supplementary grants.  At all events, the people who may have been recently concerned will be entitled to get the benefit of the much-increased grants under the new housing proposals which have just passed through this House and the provisions of that Act go back to the time when the new Local Government Housing Act was passed.  If Donegal county council have decided in their wisdom or otherwise to cut out supplementary grants that is, of course, a matter entirely for themselves.  I assume their decision will affect not alone people in the Donegal Gaeltacht but the people as a whole in that county.</P>
    <P>With regard to the administration of Scéim na gCúig bPúnt, it would appear that Deputy O'Donnell is also dissatisfied with the way in which it is administered and, I assume, with the cases that have been turned down by the Department on the grounds that Irish <Col N="1356" /> was not the spoken language of the home.  That is the law as it stands and until Dáil Éireann decides in its wisdom or otherwise to change that law that is the way Scéim na gCúig bPúnt must be administered.</P>
    <P>Again, I am satisfied from my experience of the scheme that it was made clear to the parents of a household that unless the children have that líofacht and unless Irish was the language in the home they would not qualify for Scéim na gCúig bPúnt.  I think that this scheme more than any other scheme, possibly, has, as far as the language is concerned, succeeded in keeping the language alive in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and kept it the spoken language in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, the examination of the children is conducted by the inspectors under the Department of Education, but I have heard the allegation made by the Deputy voiced before.  In some cases reputable people alleged to me that this was the reason why children did not appear to be as competent as they were, that in fact it was due to shyness with the inspector.  But in the few cases that came before me&mdash;I am speaking from memory; I think there were only four or five of them in the whole country&mdash;I permitted separate examinations to be carried out by different inspectors.  I asked that that should be done.  I discovered that, with one sole exception, the different inspectors came to the same conclusion.  The children concerned did not have the same líofacht that would qualify them for Scéim na gCúig bPúnt.  Considering that there is a very considerable number of children involved&mdash;I think something about 10,000 in the whole country&mdash;I think that due to the very few complaints that come before me in regard to allegations of this kind there is not very much to it.  I think that in general this scheme is working very well.  It is only in a very odd case that <Col N="1357" /> parents claim for one reason or another that they were wrongfully refused the grant.  In every such case, since I came into Roinn na Gaeltachta, where there is such a complaint I have made myself personally satisfied about it.</P>

      <P>I do not know how far the Deputy's county council has availed of the other schemes.  As I have already pointed out, my Department have to depend on the county councils as far as either small water schemes or regional schemes are concerned.  I have pointed out to the House the new road schemes that were made available under my Department to deal with accommodation roads and, in so far as the Office of Public Works is able to carry out these jobs for us, good progress is being made with them in the various areas.  With all schemes of that kind we have to operate through the Office of Public Works of the county council or, in the case of other schemes that have been introduced, through the County Committees of Agriculture.  I want to say generally, and to put it on the records of the House, that the County Committees of Agriculture have been tremendously helpful to my Department in going ahead with any schemes that we have suggested to them and that the county councils have given us very good help also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of county councils, I should like to see them making more progress, in the areas of the Gaeltacht particularly, with water and sewerage schemes that will fit in with the main provisions for tourism that we are now <Col N="1360" /> introducing for the benefit of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary for me to deal with any of the other matters that were raised.  On the suggestion of Deputy Lynch, that we should pity the people outside the Gaeltacht areas and not those inside it, I would emphasise, and not for the first time, that the Gaeltacht areas comprise the poorest and the most backward portions of the country and the people in these areas, where they have rock, bog and water, instead of the very good land that some of their more fortunate neighbours have, outside the Gaeltacht, need the special provisions that are being made for them under Roinn na Gaeltachta. They were provided for very poorly by nature there.  Some of the Gaeltacht areas comprise the greatest land slums in the country.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the Gaeltacht areas are the last parts of the country in which the Irish language survives as a living, spoken language, the everyday language of the people, it is true to say that they could not, in these days at all events, survive on the small holdings that generally are there and the poor land that generally is there unless they got special help in one form or another from the rest of the community.  I think some of the provisions that are now being made will have a very healthy effect on their economy and I am glad to say that there is at least one Gaeltacht, and a very large Gaeltacht, that is as strong as, in my view, it ever was.  From the figures I can see there is barely a difference in population of 5 per cent. between the people who are there now and the number that were there in 1911.  I refer to the Connemara Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>So, to those people who say that everybody is gone from the Gaeltacht, I want to point out one area of which that is not true.  There has been, undoubtedly, the movement of people from the Gaeltacht, just as there has been from every other part of rural Ireland but, on the face of the situation, it would appear that, due to the extraordinary poverty of the land and the extraordinary handicaps <Col N="1361" /> under which these people worked, most of them would have gone long ago.  That, I am glad to say, is not true and, certainly, as far as that Gaeltacht is concerned, it is as strong and as healthy in every way as it has been for many years.  I hope the same picture will ultimately appear in all the Gaeltacht areas that are under Limistéirí na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Gaeltarra Éireann: Motion for Select Committee (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee, consisting of eleven members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom four shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to inquire into and report back to the Dáil within three months on the management and conduct generally of the affairs of the Gaeltarra Éireann section of the Department of the Gaeltacht, with particular reference to the production and marketing of Gaeltarra Éireann goods over the past five years.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies Lindsay and O'Donnell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recollect that when Deputy Lindsay was speaking on this motion on 26th February, 1958, certain allegations were made by him&mdash;serious allegations&mdash;to which, perhaps, I had better refer.  I quote from column 771 of Volume 165 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister now to tell the House and the country whether he has any knowledge of whether in any year from 1954 to 1956, or even up to 1957, there seemed either not taken into account, or missing from the stores of Gaeltarra Éireann, thousands of yards of tweed, valued <Col N="1362" /> at anything from £10,000 to £20,000, of which the Minister has no record and cannot say where it is, how it went, who took it, or whether it was from wrong accounting, wrong auditing or a wrong assessment from the yields in wool.  It is for that kind of thing I ask the inquiry.</P>
    <P>That is, the inquiry he asked for in the motion before the House.  Further, in the same column, the Deputy went on to say:</P>
    <P>Lest it be alleged by the Minister that this motion of mine is in any way directed towards one person, I now want to tell him that I am about to give him information generally across the floor of this House that involves possibly the most consistent, most damning, and most longstanding fraud, certainly unilateral fraud, and a fraud which has been made possible through either of two things, negligence on the part of the staff of Gaeltarra Éireann, on the one hand, or conspiracy and fraud by some member or members of the staff of Gaeltarra Éireann, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The Deputy then produced two sheets of paper and went on to suggest a way whereby these &ldquo;consistent, most damning and most longstanding frauds&rdquo; were carried out:</P>
    <P>How is this done?  If anybody wants to make money quickly and if he has any knowledge of the wool trade and, with the full realisation that he has careless and willing hands to help him in Gaeltarra Éireann, one can get into it straight away.  This is how it is done.  You weigh 10,000 lb. of second-rate Irish wool and, having weighted it, you fill your consignment docket or invoice and make it out, not as second-rate Irish wool but as superwhite New Zealand greasy.  In the weight column, you do not fill in 10,000 lb. but you fill in any figure up to 15,000 lb.  The wool is transferred by someone in the public haulage companies and it reaches Gaeltarra Éireann depots either in Dublin or Donegal, where it is not checked, either carelessly or deliberately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> Of course, through no fault of the accountancy branch of Gaeltarra Éireann, the accounts branch pay on these fradulent invoices the rate obtainable for the better class wool and the higher weight.  On that alone, the Minister has a serious responsibility in respect of the criminal code in this country, but on that alone he should hold an inquiry at once and put the public mind at ease.  This is not a question of what the Minister thinks, what I think or what any Deputy thinks.  These are figures, some of which have been proved already, some of which are capable of being proved beyond any shadow of doubt.</P>
    <P>In view of these specific charges of a criminal nature&mdash;conspiracy, fraud, going on, as was alleged, over a very long period&mdash;when the Deputy finished that night I directed the officials in my Department to impound all the documents of Gaeltarra Éireann and on the 5th March, 1958, I moved in this House that further discussion would stop in this matter and that the Garda would be called in by the Minister for Justice to investigate the charges of fraud and conspiracy made by the Deputy in this motion and in the debate to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Garda came in on 1st March, 1958 to investigate these allegations and intensive inquiries were made by them over a period of nine months, covering all the purchases of wool made by Gaeltarra Éireann from Messrs.  Campbell and Walker from 1952 to 1958.  As a result of the investigations by the Garda, certain charges were brought before our courts and dealt with by the court concerned. After, I understand, a long hearing of some 15 or 20 days, after investigating the evidence in respect of these charges which were brought, informations were refused.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with that, I should deal with the first point&mdash;that is the allegation by Deputy Lindsay made on this motion that there was, I think it was, 20,000 yards of tweed missing from Gaeltarra Éireann and unaccounted <Col N="1364" /> for.  I think he referred, speaking in connection with the same matter elsewhere, to some miles of tweed being missing from Gaeltarra Éireann.  I want to inform the House that these allegations were fully investigated, not alone by the accounting officer concerned but by the Comptroller and Auditor General and that their evidence has been given before the Public Accounts Committee.  I want to put on the records of this House that the explanations given by the Accounting Officer have been fully accepted by the Comptroller and Auditor General and that this evidence has already been given to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>No doubt, in due course, when the Committee of Public Accounts produce their report, they will say what they think of this matter.  The evidence given in respect of this alleged 20,000 yards of tweed, which, incidentally, referred to an amount alleged to be missing out of the total stock of tweed going over a period of three years, was that it is accounted for by the fact that on 75 yard lengths of tweed it is a practice in the trade to allow for an extra yard and that that alone, on the figures involved, would indicate that 16,000 yards of the alleged 20,000, was accounted for.  The other amount alleged to be missing, on the figure that was given, was accounted for by patterns which had been sent out to the trade by Gaeltarra Éireann and these figures were accepted and have been accepted by the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is as far as the allegation about the missing tweed is concerned.</P>
    <P>The other allegations made by the Deputy caused a very considerable expenditure of public time and money, the time of the Garda and others in investigating the charges made here. They were charges of alleged most consistent, most damning and most long-standing fraud, certainly unilateral fraud and fraud made possible by two things, negligence and conspiracy to defraud by some members of the staff.  When the Deputy made these charges, he said or alleged that he had certain information which he would convey to the Garda.  It would <Col N="1365" /> appear, however, from subsequent events at the trial, that when he made these charges he did not have documents which he alleged he subsequently got anonymously by post and documents which it transpires now were stolen from the companies concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister making an allegation now that they were stolen by me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make my case if the Deputy will listen to it.  I want to point out to the House that when the Deputy made these statements, according to sworn evidence given to the Court and according to his own statement as I understand it, he did not have some alleged records that it transpired were stolen at some stage from the people to whom they belonged.  Not having those records to go on according to his own statement, he still thought fit to make these charges here in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most fantastic thing about this whole business is that after all the close scrutiny by the Garda over all the years, the only alleged irregularities, that they could find at all events, or that they thought should be investigated by the Court, were in the years 1955-56 when the Deputy himself and Deputy Blowick were the responsible political heads for the Department concerned.  It seems to me that I am placed here in the rather fantastic situation that public time, money and expense have been wasted in investigating the administration of this Department during the Deputy's own time and the time of his predecessor. At all events, I want to put on the records of this House, in fairness to the people concerned, considering all the general slander that has been cast within the protected walls of this House on everybody associated with Gaeltarra Éireann and on people and firms outside Gaeltarra Éireann, that the Garda did not discover any evidence whatsoever of fraud in respect of the Civil Servants who were working in Gaeltarra Éireann.  Although under a cloud ever since that time until this recent case was over, they at least have the satisfaction of knowing that, after thorough investigation, there was no <Col N="1366" /> evidence of fraud to be brought against them even in Deputy Lindsay's time, before it or since.</P>
    <P>Making allegations of this kind here is all well and good.  I wonder if the Deputy has realised the effect of what I call these outrageous charges on the business of Gaeltarra Éireann and on the firms which he pilloried here in this House.  I wonder if he realises what effect this kind of conduct in this House can have generally on people outside who are not here to answer for themselves.  Will the business community as a whole tolerate a situation in which they can be slandered and lambasted inside the privileged walls of this House, irrespective of the consequences that it is going to have on them, a situation as a result of which they may be held up to hatred, ridicule and contempt of all and sundry on the baseless allegations of the Deputy?  There evidently was no evidence to sustain the allegations.</P>
    <P>The only result of this whole business is first, a waste of a tremendous amount of public and Garda time. Secondly, a reputable firm has been slandered and put to costs which I understand are estimated to run to about £7,000 or £8,000.  Thirdly, an unfortunate man lost his life up in Donegal, leaving a widow and family. Fourthly, irreparable damage has been done to the business of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Fifthly, irreparable damage has been done to, and a cloud left over, conscientious civil servants who for many years have served under different Governments in this State.</P>
    <P>This has been the result of these allegations which as far as the alleged missing tweed is concerned, have ended in a mare's nest and, which as far as the matter before the Court is concerned, have ended in informations being refused.  This has been the result of the motion before the House tabled by Deputy Lindsay and Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, before I leave this matter as it is a question which may affect the judgement of the House as regards the whole propriety of this motion, I think I should refer to the fact that as the result of the Garda enquiries there were two people at <Col N="1367" /> least charged with alleged offences in Kilcar in Donegal.  They were defended by Deputy O'Donnell whose name is to this motion, and they were certainly interviewed, if not advised, by Deputy Lindsay according to their own sworn statement before they gave evidence in that Court, a Court resulting from the allegations of the Deputy in this House and from charges arising out of them. So evidently not alone was the Deputy prepared to raise the hare and chase it through this House, but he and his colleague were prepared to defend the hare when they got outside this House.</P>
    <P>This whole business has been fantastic and it reflects little credit on this House.  We are seriously asked now under this motion to go ahead with some kind of inquiry by a committee to be set up under the auspices of this House.  Let me emphasise that the matters that arose, or are alleged to have arisen, arose long before I became the responsible Minister for this Department, and certainly during the period when both Deputy Lindsay, as the political head, and his predecessor, Deputy Blowick, were in charge.</P>
    <P>I do not know that, in common sense, I can ask the House to waste much more time over this matter.  I think enough time has been wasted. Unfortunately, if it were only waste of time that resulted from this matter, it would not be too bad.  There have been other dire results arising out of this extraordinary motion and as a result of these unfortunate charges.  As far as setting up another committee within the terms of the motion, is concerned, I think, as I have said, enough of public time and expense has been wasted to the detriment, I say, of the movers of this motion and to the detriment of the practice of this House.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Deputy, in view of what has occurred, in view of the fact that, as a result of these baseless allegations, fully investigated by the courts of this land, fully investigated by the Garda authorities and detectives of this land, in view of the fact that informations were refused in this <Col N="1368" /> case and that the Auditor-General of this country has been satisfied that tweed was not missing from Gaeltarra Éireann, will he now withdraw this motion?</P>

      <P>The Minister has come in here to deal with my allegation about larger quantities of wool being invoiced than were in fact sent from a wool firm in this town to the Gaeltacht factory at Kilcar.  That was proved in the courts beyond the shadow of a doubt.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that in one instance where 21,000 lbs. net of wool had been invoiced to Gaeltarra Éireann in fact only 14,000 lbs. net arrived at Kilcar.  What the Minister for the Gaeltacht forgot to tell the House and the country was this in relation to these district court proceedings, that Mr. Brian Walsh, Senior Counsel, competent and whose integrity could not be questioned, opened the case to the district justice and said, in effect, when dealing with the statement of the accused wool merchant that an arrangement had been made with the management of Gaeltarra Éireann to alter weights and to alter descriptions: &ldquo;Mr. Reddington, the then Assistant Manager of Gaeltarra Éireann, will deny that there was any such arrangement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>An employee of Gaeltarra Éireann who, when questioned by the police, purported to give the police in that statement the truth of the matters which were the subject of the investigation at that time.  He made a statement to the police saying that there was no such arrangement as the changing of weights and the altering of descriptions.  Otherwise why would the Attorney General's competent representative, Mr. Walsh, have said to the District Justice in opening the case and referring to the statement of the accused that there was some arrangement: &ldquo;Mr. Reddington will say there was no such arrangement.&rdquo;?  In that court every day sat that man hearing the evidence of the various people right down along the line, some of them being treated as hospital after their evidence had varied and varied considerably from the statements they had made to the police.  He allowed a man who had given evidence before him, whose evidence was contradicted by his own employees, to take his own life at Kilcar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the meaning of the court.  He waited until it was safe to change the evidence and he went into the witness box and in direct contradiction of the statement he made to the police and in direct contradiction of the opening statement of counsel for the Attorney General, he said he had such an arrangement with the accused.  It was easy to do it then because the man responsible for the checking at Kilcar was no longer alive. <Col N="1375" /> It was easy to take advantage when somebody was dead.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,770,120 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>The net total expenditure involved in the Vote for my Department in the present financial year is £4,475,120, involving a net increase of £735,160 on the corresponding provision made in the last financial year.  The chief increases comprise £140,000 in the provision for contributions towards housing loan charges of local authorities; £400,000 in the provision for grants to private persons, etc., for the purchase, erection, reconstruction and improvement of dwelling houses; £45,000 in the contributions towards loan charges of local authorities in respect of sanitary services works and a new provision of £200,000 to supplement the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> The group of subheads which provide for the payment of housing grants and subsidies total £3.7 millions, about 80% of the whole Estimate.  These housing subheads show an increase of more than a half million pounds over 1958/59 and accordingly account for the greater part of the amount by which this year's Estimate exceeds the sum voted for Local Government last year.</P>
    <P>Almost the whole of the expenditure anticipated on the housing side is comprised in Subheads H. 1 and H. 2, which include £1.985 million for the payment of annual subsidies in respect of local authority housing and £1.7 million for the payment of private housing grants.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision to meet estimated expenditure on grants for private housing, the £400,000 increase is attributable in the main to the anticipated expansion of operations of reconstruction, repair and improvement of existing houses due to the additional benefits and facilities made available by the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958.  That Act not only increased the maximum grants available in individual cases but widened the scope of application of grants for repair or improvement of houses by easing the qualifying conditions for those grants and also made provision for the availability of loans from housing authorities to individuals reconstructing, repairing or improving houses.  The effects of the provisions of the 1958 Act have not yet been manifested in full, but the tendency is clear from the fact that operations of reconstruction, etc., of existing houses increased in the last six months of 1958/59 by more than one-third as compared with those for the preceding six months.  As there has been a decided shift in emphasis in recent years from the building of new houses to the conservation of existing houses and since there is very substantial scope for the latter type of operation, it is to be expected that applications for grants for reconstruction, etc., will show a cumulative increase for some considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of a recovery in <Col N="1380" /> the position in relation to new house building, which had shown a considerable decline, and a slight increase in operations is anticipated while the increase in the amounts of individual grants for the installation of private water and sewerage facilities made available by the 1958 Act has already led to an increase in applications for these grants.  There has been an administrative development in the administration of these grants which I should like to mention.  It will have the effect of enabling public water supplies to be used in certain circumstances for the provision of private supplies.  In the vicinity of built-up areas served by public water supplies, particularly in county health districts, a person may wish to connect his house to a public main although the main is not in close vicinity to his house.  The cost of making a connection in these cases is generally very high.  Hitherto it has not been the practice to admit such cases for a private water supply grant.  I have now had legal advice that such cases may be entertained, and I have laid down the following conditions in regard to them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The house must be more than 100 feet from the public main.</P>
    <P>2.  The local sanitary authority must certify that they do not propose to extend the public main as part of the public water supply and that they have no objection to the work.</P>
    <P>3.  The grant will be on the usual statutory terms involving a minimum contribution by the applicant and will be based on a cost to the applicant which will not include the average cost to a householder served by the public water supply of making a connection therewith.</P>
    <P>The same conditions will apply to connections to public sewers.</P>
    <P>As regards house building by local authorities, the diminishing volume of housing needs requiring to be met by them is reflected by the figures of completions for the year ended 31st March last.  1,870 dwellings were completed in that year as compared with 3,467 in the preceding year.  At the 31st March, 1959, however, work was in <Col N="1381" /> progress on 2,221 dwellings and houses in tender at the same date totalled 949. The estimates put forward by the different housing authorities suggest that a somewhat increased volume of building is expected to be undertaken in urban areas during the current year.  In county health districts works already approved in respect of the first nine months of the last financial year show an increase as compared with that period in the preceding year, while a further increase in the current year is indicated by the estimates of the local authorities.  In the county boroughs of Cork and Dublin the total value of tenders sanctioned in 1958/59 showed an increase of £145,000 over 1957/58.</P>
    <P>There was a steady fall from about the middle of 1956 to the end of 1957 in the amount of employment on local authority housing schemes, but a tendency to stabilise at a total figure of approximately 2,500 men is observable from the statistics relating to successive three-month periods since the 1st January, 1958.</P>
    <P>The general level of building costs for serviced dwellings remained reasonably stable during the year.  It was, however, necessary to withhold approval in certain instances to the proposed acceptance of tenders for schemes in which the superstructure costs were up to £300 per house in excess of costs obtaining in other areas. In all such cases I gave close personal attention to the factors involved and, where it seemed appropriate, I requested the housing authorities concerned to make a general revision of house plans with a view to more economical construction.</P>
    <P>I had similarly to withhold approval to tender prices showing an inflationary trend in the case of rural unserviced cottages.  Concerted efforts were made in such instances by officers of my Department and of the local housing authorities concerned to determine the reason for unduly high costs and to secure such economies as would enable the cottages to be built at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>While I am on this subject of economy on construction, I think it well to draw attention to the experiment <Col N="1382" /> adopted by the Cork County Council in their cottages erected at Ringaskiddy.  They are based on a new design involving the provision of a flat asphalt roof and asphalt floors and the omission of internal and external plastering.  Their dimensions are designed to suit the size of the blocks. Using these features, a number of fully serviced cottages of a standard of accommodation and amenity comparable with the traditional types have been provided at a total cost of about £950 each, representing a saving of up to £350 per house on previous costs.  I understand that a corresponding economical design has now been prepared for an unserviced rural cottage.</P>
    <P>It is as yet too early to assess the potentialities of this new design without further experience of the results of tendering by contractors for the erection of this type of dwelling in other areas.  I commend the experiment however to the consideration of other housing authorities.  My Department will be prepared to co-operate at all times with local authorities in encouraging such enterprise in the design and planning of house types which give promise of achieving economies while maintaining essential standards of construction and accommodation.</P>
    <P>The housing operations of Dublin Corporation have entered a new phase which at present is gaining in momentum. The previous stages of the programme involved the immense task of displacing thousands of families from unfit and overcrowded dwellings in the central city areas and rehousing them in new estates on the city fringes.  The building of these new estates has reached the stage at which the Corporation has been able to commence the work of redeveloping the cleared areas and to plan the redevelopment of further areas.  Redevelopment operations are slower and costlier than building on virgin sites, since the process of land and property acquisition is more difficult, site costs are higher and it is necessary to build blocks of flats to accommodate as many families as possible near places of employment, shops, churches and schools.</P>
    <P>Compulsory Purchase Orders have been made, and others are planned, in <Col N="1383" /> respect of many city sites of various sizes which will accommodate large and small schemes of flats.  Sites are available for some 5,000 dwellings and a further 4,000 sites are either in process of acquisition or are included in a programme of acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The building of approximately 500 houses is in progress, tenders have been approved for a further 250 houses and the Corporation estimate that approval to tenders for about 800 dwellings will be sought this year.  The current programme, therefore, shows an upward trend on last year.</P>
      <P>The reassessment of housing needs in the City has received close consideration.  It was intimated by the Corporation in March last that a new panel of approximately 6,000 families was being compiled following the invitation of applications for tenancies of houses and flats.  Analysis of the new list, however, showed that the maximum net need was in the region of 4,300 families, including families of two persons only.  There are about 3,000 unfit houses to be closed, demolished or cleared within the next 3 to 5 years.  The Corporation expect to displace 2,700 families from unfit dwellings this year, which figure added to the new panel brings the current housing need to approximately 7,000 families.  The elimination of all unfit dwellings would add to this total.  It is expected that at least 1,200 vacancies a year will continue to arise in Corporation dwellings representing 3% of the housing estate.  This vacancy rate is not high having regard to the size of the estate.  The regular occurrence of vacancies enables a substantial portion of needs to be met without new building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In association with the provision of new houses and the exercise of their slum-clearance powers, the Corporation are actively co-operating in the private housing sector.  They are allocating repair grants at a rate of 1,000 a year, are arranging to make advances available for repair works and also for the purchase of previously <Col N="1384" /> occupied houses, in addition to the facilities normally made available by them to persons providing new houses.</P>
    <P>The volume of housing work in progress in Cork City has increased in recent months and over the last few years as a whole it has proceeded so rapidly that careful consideration has now to be given to the rate at, or the periods in which, new schemes are to be undertaken.  An essential requirement in connection with future programmes is that they be linked with the slum clearance programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing in Limerick, a report submitted to the Corporation in April, 1957, indicated that 1,353 families were living in unfit dwellings or in overcrowded conditions. To meet the ascertained needs 295 houses have been built or are in progress while a further 122 have reached the tender or planning stage. Vacancies in the Corporation housing estate have averaged more than 100 per annum in recent years and thus make a significant contribution to the satisfaction of outstanding housing needs.</P>
    <P>Limerick was one of the places to which I referred earlier as having been confronted with the problem of tenders which were excessive by reference to the general level of approved tenders in other urban areas. As a result, the Corporation has been requested to arrange for the redesign of a current scheme on the basis of more economical plans.</P>
    <P>There was a falling off in the volume of work in progress on sanitary services schemes in 1958/59.  The cost of schemes in progress at the end of that year was £5,130,000 as compared with £6,660,000 on a corresponding date in the previous financial year.  The value of work actually executed on these schemes fell sharply from £2,100,000 in 1957/58 to £1,400,000 in 1958/59.</P>
    <P>The downward trend in expenditure seems largely due to the interruption in the planning of sanitary services works a few years ago.  I would view the decline with less concern if, as in the case of housing, it could be said that needs had generally been met or were in course of being met.  In the <Col N="1385" /> case of water supplies and sewerage schemes, however, the position is far otherwise.  Hitherto a good deal has been done to service the towns and moderately sized villages but rural areas have been largely overlooked.  I am entirely opposed to the idea, if such exists, that we can call a halt at the boundaries of built-up areas in this matter of piped water supplies.</P>
    <P>This is a service that can make a large contribution to the national welfare in the rural areas, not merely as a health measure but as a factor in raising rural living standards by reducing domestic hardship and drudgery and so helping to counter the de-population of country districts. I would appeal, therefore, to county councils who are in general within sight of completing the programmes of town and village schemes not to defer any further the planning of schemes for extending sanitary services into rural areas and not to drop or postpone schemes which are at present in course of planning.</P>
    <P>Apart from this general appeal which I make here today, I intend in the near future to circulate suggestions to county councils as to the lines which future planning should take.  I am, accordingly, confining myself at this stage to emphasising in a general way the national importance of continuity in the planning of sanitary services programmes and in their gradual extension, whether by way of regional schemes or by a variety of small works, over the whole countryside. In this connection I would recall that I mentioned in the course of my Estimate speech last year that county councils have been urged to take advantages of the rural electricity network which has been extended to the greater part of the country as a valuable source of assistance in the installation of small local water supplies.</P>
    <P>As regards works in progress, the North Dublin Main Drainage Scheme and the North Dublin Regional Waterworks Scheme are practically completed and both are in partial operation. The Whitegate Regional Water Supply is approaching completion and is already supplying water to the new <Col N="1386" /> oil refinery.  Construction on the Lough Mourne, County Donegal, regional water supply has been concluded and subject to certain tests being satisfactorily passed, should soon be in operation.  New major projects commenced during the last financial year include regional water supply schemes at Rosscarbery, Co. Cork; Gortahork, Co. Donegal; Fenit, Co. Kerry; and South Wexford.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend local authorities for their response to the circular letter issued during the year by my Department inviting them to take part in the annual clean towns competition sponsored by Bord Fáilte Éireann.  The number of entries in the competition rose from 52 in 1958 to 182 in 1959, largely, it would appear, because of the interest taken by local authorities in it.  It is clearly in the national interest that the maximum number of towns and villages should participate, and that there should be a widespread awakening of civic interest in making and keeping towns and villages cleans and attractive.</P>
    <P>I drew the attention of sanitary authorities to their extensive powers to prevent litter, abate nuisances, keep streets clean, etc.; these powers, if exercised with reasonable firmness and prudence, could be utilised to secure a welcome improvement in the cleanliness of our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The provision in Subhead J for grants to local authorities for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, is only a token provision to enable outstanding accounts arising from works in previous years to be cleared off.  In the course of the last financial year I received several requests from local authorities and public representatives that I should consider the restoration of provision for grants towards schemes under this Act.  In preparing the Estimates for the current year, therefore, I gave careful consideration to the possibility of providing grants for schemes which would give good and lasting value for the money expended.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that there was a case on sound economic grounds for drainage works on small rivers which, discharging directly into the sea, are <Col N="1387" /> not tributaries of the larger arterial river systems.  This would be a type of work intermediate between arterial drainage and the minor drainage works on streams, etc., carried out under the Land Project.  On consideration of the matter, the Government decided that the Commissioners of Public Works would be the appropriate authority to deal with such intermediate river would be the appropriate authority to drainage works.  The matter is now under consideration by the Commissioners and the Minister for Finance will in due course report to the Government on the arrangements which may be found practicable for the carrying out of such works by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Road Fund revenue from motor taxation last year was £5,557,600. This was slightly more than estimated but shows a drop on the figure for 1957/58 which, as I explained last year was exceptional.  The estimate of revenue for the current financial year is £5,550,000.  Having regard to existing commitments and the need to make provision for repayment of loans and other charges, it was necessary to maintain the grant allocations for 1959/60 at the same level as in recent years, namely £5 million.  The grants under the provision in Subhead O of my Estimate will be in addition to this.  These grants are to meet road problems created for certain local authorities by the recent closure of railway lines and in certain areas by the setting up of large-scale industrial undertakings, the public road approaches to which require major improvement.  I have dealt in detail with this matter in the recent debate on the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Bill which has passed through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The basis on which the ordinary £5 million allocation is distributed is the same as in each of the three preceding years, subject, however, to one important innovation which I introduced in the interest of greater flexibility. Some councils are approaching completion of their county road improvement programmes but have still ample scope for absorption of <Col N="1388" /> their county road improvement grants on main road improvement works. On the other hand, in counties where a lower proportion of county road mileage has been improved, there may be a case for accelerating the rate of county road improvement.  I, therefore, decided that proposals from local authorities for transfers of grants from main road improvement to county road improvement or <i>vice versa,</i> could be considered according to local circumstances.</P>
    <P>In counties where 50% or more of the county road mileage is dust free, the councils may transfer to main road improvement such portion of the county road improvement grant as they consider proper.  On the other hand in counties with less than 50% of their county road mileage dust free, consideration can be given to transfers on a graded scale from the main road improvement grant to county road improvement.  I would emphasise that the initiative in making these transfers rests with the local authorities who, as I mentioned on this Estimate last year, have my full support in examining and voicing their opinions on the roads programmes before they are submitted to my Department.  It is anticipated that the expenditure on county road improvements this year will be about 2½ times the amount spent on main road improvements.</P>
    <P>The problem of how to reduce road accidents is presenting a major challenge in all countries in our time.  Some people seem to think that the answer lies in new legislation.  While I appreciate that there should be no avoidable delay in bringing our road traffic code up to date, and that new legislation should help towards greater safety on the roads, I wish again to emphasise that the fundamental necessity is to get every road user to grasp fully how easy it is in modern traffic conditions to become involved in a tragic road accident, and therefore how important it is that every pedestrian, cyclist and driver should be ever careful not to violate the rules of road safety to the danger of themselves and others.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, very difficult to impress on the individual road user that road safety is his personal concern, and <Col N="1389" /> that no action on the part of the Government can relieve him of his personal responsibility to do his part.</P>
    <P>Certain important steps have, however, been taken in recent times to make it easier for the road user to ensure his own safety.  Road authorities have been asked to press forward with the erection of the traffic signs prescribed some time ago, and when this work has been completed we will have a modern uniform system of signposting throughout the country, which cannot fail to be of considerable help towards safer travel.</P>
    <P>Again, a booklet setting out all the rules which the road user really requires to know has been widely distributed by my Department.  I again appeal to everyone to study this booklet because if the advice contained in it was known and applied, I have no doubt whatever that very many of the tragic accidents which are now occurring would be avoided.</P>
    <P>I have recently prescribed a new system of markings to indicate pedestrian crossings.  Under this new system pedestrian crossings at which the pedestrian has precedence are indicated by flashing beacons at each end of the crossing and on the central refuge, where such is provided. &ldquo;Zebra&rdquo; stripes will also be placed on the roadway within the crossings. These beacons and stripes are so conspicuous that they cannot fail to be observed by drivers in time to enable them to respect pedestrians' rights on the crossings.  A number of these crossings are already in use in Dublin, and it is open to other local authorities to provide them where traffic conditions warrant it.</P>
    <P>County rate collection continues to be very satisfactory.  At the 31st March last 97.4 per cent. of the collectors' warrants had been accounted for.  During the last financial year the total revenue expenditure of local authorities excluding Vocational Education Committees, County Committees of Agriculture and Harbour Authorities, was approximately £52.5 million.  Revenue expenditure for the present financial year is estimated to reach about £55.1 million.  Rating <Col N="1390" /> authorities do not, of course, have to provide for the whole of this amount from their own funds.  In fact, the State will contribute more towards the cost of local services than the local authorities will themselves raise from rates.  In the current year it is estimated that the State will pay to local authorities by way of revenue grants the sum of £23.1 million.  The net amount falling on local rates will be about £21.8 million.</P>
    <P>Other sources of local revenue, such as rents of local authority houses, fees by paying patients in local authority hospitals, etc., will make up the balance.  This represents a change in the pattern of local finance from pre-war days when receipts from rates were considerably in excess of the total State grants received by local authorities.  In the year 1938/39, for instance, rate receipts were £6,271,000 while State grants amounted to only £4,697,000.  The increased State contribution towards the expenses of local authorities has meant that over the past twenty years or so local taxation has not increased at the same rate as central taxation.  Between 1938/39 and 1958/59 rate receipts have risen by 234 per cent. while Exchequer Revenue has increased during the corresponding period by 296 per cent.</P>
    <P>The estimated increased expenditure in the current year is naturally reflected in increased rates in most counties and the average county rate is 37/11½d. as compared with 36/7½d. last year.  These rate increases are unavoidable in view of the extended services now afforded by local authorities and the increased cost of existing services due to the upward trend in prices and in levels of remuneration. If the services afforded by local authorities are to be maintained at the standard demanded in this age, I am afraid that no great decrease in local authority expenditure can be expected in the years immediately ahead.  I have, however, urged economy in current expenditure wherever this was possible without impairing the efficiency of the services rendered and I intend to maintain this attitude.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure in contrast with <Col N="1391" /> revenue expenditure has shown a considerable decrease over the past few years and expenditure under this heading for the year 1958/59, at £8.7 million, was less than half what it was five years ago.  This fall has been caused mainly by the decrease in capital expenditure on housing, consequent on the completion or near completion of the post-war housing programmes of many local authorities.</P>
