    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned last night, I was dealing with an interjection by Deputy T. Lynch to the effect that we were imposing a British system on the people.  Taking it for granted that it is a British system, is that any reason why we should not adopt it, if we think fit?  I remember seeing on the front benches opposite no less than eight members of the legal profession, and, to my knowledge, I never heard any objection to the fact that we were adopting the British legal code holus-bolus in 1922.  We have amended it and added to it since then, but it is the legal code that we work on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take a simpler comparison, for our measurement system here we took for distances feet, yards and miles; for weights, we took tons, cwts. and ounces, and for liquid measure we took gallons, quarts and pints.  I never heard any objection to these systems simply because we took them over from the British.  If, for instance, we were to <Col N="1672" /> adopt the metric system, would it not be simply because we felt that it was better than the system we have at present, and not because we wished to abandon the system which we have been accustomed to and which I think is generally agreed to be the British system?  However, we do not propose to adopt the straight vote system simply because it has been used by the British, and perhaps might be regarded as the British system.  We are proposing to allow the people a chance of adopting it because we think it will be good for the country in the future.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Costello speaking on his amendment and I asked Deputy Dockrell a question when he was supporting that amendment.  I asked him what advantage had the system proposed by Deputy Costello; what difference there was between the discussion here and in the Seanad and the Opposition proposal.  I must say I found the explanation he gave me very unconvincing.  I can imagine a number of Deputies from this side of the House, and a number from the opposite side, sitting down from now until next August repeating the discussions which we have had at such great length, and at the end of that time, reporting back to the Dáil that the Deputies on this side had no report and that the Deputies on the other side had one, two or three reports.  We would have to go through the process again and hold this referendum and ask the people to support our proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton's suggestion was that we should have a general election. Why, in the name of goodness, we should have a general election I do not know, because even if we did have a general election and succeeded again in getting the confidence of the great majority of the people, we would still have to use the referendum if we were to put our will through.  I do not see any sense in either of these suggestions.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I wish to refer to the caustic comments made by Deputy Norton about Deputy Booth's statement last night.  One would think that Deputy Booth had committed a criminal offence by referring to the people of Northern Ireland, whether Unionists, or Nationalists, as Irishmen and Irishwomen. <Col N="1673" /> I regard these people as Irish, no matter what way they vote or think.  They are as much Irish as we are in the south, every one of them.  I remember reading many years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one of them ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one of them, yes.  They are as much Irish as we are.  I was just going to say that the Republican movement which, in our youth, we helped, was started in Northern Ireland, as far as I can remember, by the very people whom Deputy Norton condemned Deputy Booth for talking about last night and naming as Irishmen.  I am proud of the people of Northern Ireland notwithstanding the views they hold. They have something really good in them and I am always hoping the time will come when we shall have the benefit of the tenacity and the wisdom of these people in Northern Ireland in helping to build up a united Irish nation.</P>
      <P>I do not despair of that happening, perhaps not in my time but certainly in the foreseeable future.  I hope the day will come when nobody in this Parliament will suggest that because people in the North hold a different viewpoint from ours, they should be regarded as anything but Irishmen. They are Irishmen and Deputy Booth was quite correct when he made that statement here last night and Deputy Norton was wrong and very unwise when he condemned Deputy Booth for making that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not condemn him for making that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment before the House in the names of Deputies Costello and Mulcahy has everything to commend it.  We are not so much discussing this experiment for the first time as discussing it for the last time in the life of the average Deputy here. If P.R. goes and if the disappearance of P.R. has the effect desired by Fianna Fáil, what Fianna Fáil are pleased to describe as splinter Parties or crackpot Parties will disappear and we shall have a House in which year after year <Col N="1674" /> Fianna Fáil will have an overwhelming majority of the Deputies present.</P>
      <P>There is a very good example of that arising out of references made here yesterday, one by Deputy Major de Valera and another by Deputy Loughman who has just spoken.  Those two Deputies indicated that one of the abiding ambitions of Fianna Fáil since 1944 has been to abolish P.R.  That seems to be at variance with the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach told Deputy Dillon here on the First Stage that it was in 1948 that he got the infanticidal instinct to smother his own child, this portion of the Constitution. Anyway, Deputy Major de Valera and Deputy Loughman told us yesterday that, since 1948, Fianna Fáil were anxious to do away with P.R. and would have done so if they had the requisite majority in this House.  It is a good thing that P.R. stood between the Fianna Fáil Party and the achievement of that desire.</P>
      <P>It strikes me as being strange, and I am certain it will strike the people as being strange, that if Fianna Fáil did want to abolish P.R. since 1944, they should wait 15 years, until the year of grace 1959, to make public that ambition.  This is the time and place to comment on the doubtful political morality of obtaining from the people the requisite majority to force this matter through the House without at any time in those 15 years seeking a mandate from the people on the issue which appears to have been burning in the Fianna Fáil heart since 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that a Party like Fianna Fáil should occupy political platforms ever since 1944, right through the 1948 general election, the 1951 general election, the 1954 general election and the 1957 general election, without one being candid enough to say to the people: &ldquo;What we really want is a majority strong enough in Dáil Éireann to do away with the electoral system by which we are being elected at the moment.&rdquo;  It is all very well to say in a nice innocuous sort of way: &ldquo;This proposal is the most democratic thing in the world.  All we are doing is going to the people and asking them to endorse the view we are putting before them.&rdquo;  There is <Col N="1675" /> a more democratic way of doing that and that was open to Fianna Fáil every time they faced the electorate in a general election since 1944.  The very fact that they did not do so shows they are afraid of the views of the people on this matter and I hope and believe these fears will be confirmed.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this question which could be investigated by the committee which Deputies Costello and Mulcahy suggest should investigate it.  There is a growing and widely held belief among the people that there is room for an infusion of new blood in public affairs.  If this proposal passes through the House and if the Irish people are ill-advised enough to endorse the Fianna Fáil views on it, the country can be quite certain that there will be a strangulation of political growth and a blockage of new blood in public affairs.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste over the weekend addressed the International Junior Chambers of Commerce and there mouthed the pious hope that he would see young people taking their place in government not alone here but in other governments in the world.  I say &ldquo;mouthed&rdquo; because any Deputy who votes in favour of the abolition of P.R. is well aware that he is also voting to keep young blood out of this House. Most of the younger Deputies here have graduated the hard way.  They have stood as a second or third string within a group of candidates to the older candidates or sitting Deputies and have eventually got into this House. However, if we revert to the old system of the single seat constituency with the non-transferable vote, it is plain that we shall have the same wearying and weary old men being put up by the Parties on both sides of the House and sent back here year after year.  There will be no opportunity for any young man to introduce his personality to the electorate as the candidate for his Party&mdash;maybe only the second or third choice of his Party but nevertheless a candidate&mdash;and to stand on a platform and become intimate with his constituency. That is what the abolition of P.R. means and that is one of the <Col N="1676" /> aspects of this proposal that should be examined by the committee suggested by Deputies Costello and Mulcahy in their amendment.</P>
    <P>If we want to achieve a gradual rather than a revolutionary change in the political pattern of this country, we should maintain P.R.  The growth of the Clann na Poblachta Party in 1948 is a perfect example of that.  In 1948, obviously the Irish people were ready to supplant Fianna Fáil, and maybe Fine Gael, if Clann na Poblachta were able to deliver to them the goods the Irish people needed.  They gave Clann na Poblachta a limited vote of confidence in the 1948 election and had the Party lived up to the hopes the Irish people entertained for it, it is quite possible that by now one or other of the big Parties here would have been supplanted by Clann na Poblachta.</P>
    <P>The efficacy of P.R. was shown in the manner in which Clann na Poblachta were able to return 10 Deputies here, and the dreadful fears of the Fianna Fáil Party that splinter groups of this nature could take over permanently in this House, no matter how good or bad they were, were exploded with the disappearance from the political scene of Clann na Poblachta at a later stage.  The good common-sense of the Irish electorate sat in judgment on the Clann na Poblachta Party and banished it from this House with the aid of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>There is only one other aspect of the discussions which have gone on in this House to which I should like to refer, and that is the cold-blooded approach of the speakers on the Government benches to minority Parties&mdash;what they are glad to call splinter groups and crack-pot Parties sent here by cranky voters.  The Tánaiste suggested here that there was no reason why minority Parties should disappear, that they could come in here by joining the Fianna Fáil Party and by becoming part of the Fianna Fáil Party, that in that way minorities would get a voice in this House.  That is the most cold-blooded suggestion I have ever heard made from those benches&mdash;that all men are equal provided they speak from the Fianna Fáil benches, that all men may give their views provided <Col N="1677" /> they have been sifted first in the Party room and have received the <i>imprimatur</i> of the political boss.</P>
    <P>These are things which are anathema to the average citizen of this State, things which should be investigated by the committee suggested in this amendment.  They are things which will be investigated by the Irish people if Fianna Fáil force the Taoiseach's motion through this House and it goes to the Irish people.  It would be better that Fianna Fáil should think even at this late stage and submit to a committee of this House and of the Second Chamber the views which have been expressed both here and in the Second Chamber.  In my submission the second thoughts which Fianna Fáil would get in having those views would mean we would not have to discuss this proposal any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This controversy has been going on for a long time but, unlike most Deputies, it is new to me because I was lying on my back in a Dublin hospital during most of the discussions and all I knew was what I read in the papers.  This is a serious matter for the country and Fianna Fáil should think twice before embarking on this proposal.  What we want here is peace, quiet and respect for the dignity of man.  We have had far too much political turmoil over a long number of years.  Those of us who took part in the old struggle are not embittered of heart.  We want unity of purpose; we want every man of goodwill to come together again, forget the past and realise the aims of those who lived and died in those stirring times.  The introduction of the straight vote will bring more dissension and bring us back almost to where we left off in 1922.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach, as a figure in those stirring days, to remember what we achieved when we had unity. We achieved big things.  That was not done by splinter groups; it was done by the will of the people united under proper leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can achieve the same ideals again if the Taoiseach is big enough in his retiring years to do what the <Col N="1678" /> President has asked us to do&mdash;forget the past, come together in the present and build up for the future.  I am not in the Fine Gael Party for the purpose of opposing Fianna Fáil or of helping myself.  I am keen on political life for the good of the country.  I know that the vast majority of those in Fianna Fáil are decent, good men.  What I find wrong with them is that they are too quiet with their leaders.  They accept things silently.  They should not do that.  I would not accept things lightly from my leaders, if they were cutting across my views.  I would tell them where to get off, both in the Party room and in this House.  If we had had more of that attitude in the Fianna Fáil Party over the past 15 or 20 years, I believe we would have national unity to-day.</P>
    <P>This issue is dividing the people at a time when there is an enormous amount of work to do.  We have been a glorious failure over the past 15 or 20 years.  We have thought about everything, but we have done nothing. Emigration is still in full stream, unemployment is the highest ever, and there is not the slightest hope of removing the Border in our country because we are making no effort to do so.  Those are matters with which we should be concerned.  The people are sick and tired of this ballyhoo and of this rushing to the country for an election every two or three years.  It makes no difference whether a general election or a referendum takes place for the removal of P.R.; the people are sick and tired of it and I would tell the Taoiseach that to his face.  I know, too, that the Fianna Fáil members themselves are sick and tired of it.  These elections are expensive and trying on every Deputy; we are all sick and tired of them.  When we are elected, we expect to get a four or five year term to give us a chance of doing something for the people.</P>
    <P>The youth of Ireland require leadership. There is no use in thinking we are young fellows.  The people are sick and tired of the whole lot of us.  We have been here 40 years wrangling and fighting, and doing very little.  The youth are marking time, seeking leadership, <Col N="1679" /> and I want to see that leadership coming from this House.  The Taoiseach had the respect of everybody in this country for many years.  He had my respect and my admiration up to the time of the Treaty Debates.  I came out of prison at that time thinking that all our leaders were united and that things were looking very bright for the country but I was not in Dublin five minutes when I found a split had taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera went into great detail on this yesterday.  He wanted to show how Fianna Fáil emerged from 1922 onwards. There was no hardness of heart in any of us.  Even though I joined the National Army I had no bitterness towards the men on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall now.  Not one of them had any hardness of heart towards me.  The whole division of the country is artificial.  If the straight vote is introduced, you will have an underground movement in this country. I would almost prophesy that before eight or ten years, you will have trouble, turmoil and revolution here; and we had too much of that in the past.  If we carry on with this proposal, this House will find itself with one big Party, a very much reduced Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party almost wiped out and the Independents gone.  Will anybody tell me that the Labour Party&mdash;a progressive national Party and one that has done its duty at all times&mdash;will take that lying down; or that if you drive Sinn Féin underground, they will take it lying down? That is not the temperament of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people are a temperamental, fighting people and if they once get into a fight, it is hard to stop them. At present the country needs noble and dynamic leadership of an almost revolutionary kind; we cannot carry <Col N="1680" /> on with place hunting and the old &ldquo;scratch me&rdquo; policy.  We need more backbone in the Members of this House because we are not serving the people as we should.  The people will respond if they get half a chance.  By embarking on this move after long years of turmoil and trouble, the Taoiseach will throw the country back into the melting pot as it was in 1922.  I cannot believe that is happening.  I would like him to tell us why he is doing it.  There is no use in saying it was because two weak Governments were brought in in 1948 and 1951.  That was the people's wish and it is none of our business. They can throw the whole lot of us out if they like.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the 1948 and 1951 inter-Party Governments.  They did more in their time of office than Fianna Fáil did in their 20 years.  There was work for our people here and the nation was built up.  There was an advance in agriculture and we had the limestone scheme, the land reclamation scheme, the Local Authorities (Works) Act and other projects were implemented. We had the Trade Agreement with Britain and the position was brought about in which agriculture got a chance it never got before.  These Governments may have broken up but they were no more unstable than the Fianna Fáil Governments.  The inter-Party Governments lasted every bit as long and there is no use in the Taoiseach or anybody else making pin-prick arguments of that kind.</P>
    <P>We need something big and noble from the Taoiseach and I believe he is capable of it.  I know him because I meet him at private functions.  We always meet at the Muintir na Tíre annual congress and we have a friendly talk.  I never met a nicer man in private life but when it comes to a question of politics he is a different man altogether.  I do not think that should be the case.  He should be big enough to realise that the Irish people are dissatisfied with the present situation and they want to get down to to bedrock.  The nationally-minded people want unity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe P.R. has served the people well.  It was reasonably satisfactory in most counties.  In my own county of Meath there was one Fianna Fáil, one Labour, and one Fine Gael Deputy and we represented all the people as a united body.  We did not work in opposition to each other.  We found results were better when the three of us went to a Department on behalf of the people.  We got good results and we can do the same to-day.  If we do away with P.R., Fianna Fáil will gobble up all the seats in my county.  I would regard that as a mean and scurvy thing to do.  All sections of the people are entitled to representation in Parliament.  We should see in this House those who represent the different elements, Labour, Independents, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  All those are fully entitled to be here and if the people wish to bring in small Parties, the people's wish should be fulfilled. There is no use in thinking that all the wisdom of the country lies in the Taoiseach's brain.  I believe it is not. He can be wise in ways but the nation is wiser than any of us.</P>
      <P>If P.R. is abolished I do not feel the nation will be well served.  Under the straight vote we will get back to the old landed gentry.  We country Deputies on both sides represent the people; that is the right type of representative to have in an Irish Parliament. Under the straight vote system none of us, because we are small men financially, will be able to stand up to the stress and strain of straight voting. We have no big wads of notes.  You will find the lords and ladies coming to the fore and the ordinary people will be left out.</P>

    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to think <Col N="1682" /> twice about all this.  We need real representatives of the people and we have them today on both sides of the House.  I do not mind which side is in government provided they get in through the will of the people but I do not want to see a minority caste coming back to control this country in their own interest and in the interests of outside Powers.</P>
    <P>We see what has happened under the straight vote in Northern Ireland. It has crushed down the minority so that they have not the slightest hope of raising their heads again.  They are the most repressed people in the world outside Russia.  The Six County minority is being made become smaller because they are forced to emigrate. We are making no effort to help them down here.  Craigavon and his clique brought in the straight vote and are we now going to prove that the Northern Ireland junta did the right thing?  If so, we are impostors because we know the purpose for which that clique brought in the straight vote&mdash; to make sure the minority would never become a majority.  We are about to do the same thing.  I think this is a diabolical approach to national affairs, an approach of which we shall later be ashamed.  The Northern minority always looked to the South for a ray of hope; now they find they are being stabbed between the shoulders as straight voting is being brought in here and we shall never have any hope of the reunification of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach in the name of patriotism, in the name of the living and of those who died, to make every effort to unite this House to deal with all the problems we must face. The unification of the country should be foremost in our minds but if straight voting is introduced we are making sure we shall never have a united Ireland.  Under P.R. we were all satisfied that those representing the nation were the right type of people and I think we should be slow to change that system.  Irrespective of Italy, Germany or France, we know what the Irish people want and we know P.R. has served them well for a long time.  If the Cosgrave Government in 1924 or 1925 had brought in <Col N="1683" /> the straight vote as they could have done and had as much right to do as the present Taoiseach has, they could have ensured that Fianna Fáil would never enter this House.  Mr. Cosgrave was noble enough, however, to make every effort to bring in the revolutionary Party of Fianna Fáil and get them to conform to normal Parliamentary procedure.  He did that, and suffered a great deal over a long number of years and he was proud of having done it.  He worked with them until 1932, until they were a constitutional Party and ready to take over Government.</P>
    <P>We are all proud that they took over in a noble way.  We are also proud that when they were defeated in Parliament later on, they stepped out and the other Party who had been sitting on the Opposition benches walked across and took up the reins of Government.  That was a splendid achievement that Mr. W.T. Cosgrave brought about and he should be respected for it.  If he had wanted to keep Fianna Fáil out at the time, he could have done so but he took the big, the Irish and the noble way of approaching the matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to-day to do what Mr. W.T. Cosgrave did in his time.  I am quite sure the people are fully represented and that if minority Parties come into this House, they do so because it is the wish of the people.  It is the wish of the people to have the type of representative they have.  I have no objection to small Parties in this House uniting, if they think fit.  There is no crookedness and nothing wrong about it.  There is no use in saying that things are done behind the people's backs.  The inter-Party Government put up a programme and worked according to it.</P>
    <P>There is no use in thinking that a labour representative and a farmer representative cannot sit down side by side and work for the betterment of the country.  Is it not glorious to think that they can do so?  It is glorious that we can get those men to sit side by side and to work for increased wages, holidays for workers, and so on, and get the consent of the farmers. <Col N="1684" /> These things should count and I believe they will count in the future.</P>
    <P>In my view, the people are now well enlightened on this question.  We have no apology to make to the Government for the long debate that took place here.  It was done for the sake of the country.  I am quite satisfied that the verdict of the people will be in favour of the retention of P.R. because they are not the fools Fianna Fáil think they are.</P>
    <P>This is a golden opportunity for the Taoiseach, after a lifetime in Parliament, to do the big and the noble thing.  The recent appeal by the President to come together is a noble one.  The Taoiseach should withdraw this Bill and allow P.R. to continue as our electoral system.  It would be the right thing for him to do and he should confine himself to making efforts for the unification of everything that is good and national in this country.</P>
    <P>We want a new approach.  We are at the end of an epoch.  Politics have reached a position of stalemate and are at a low ebb.  The country and this House needs new blood, new life, new energy and new drive.  It is not getting that leadership.  This country always had good leadership when it needed it. I am satisfied we shall have it again if we give young Ireland a chance to take its place here, if we get new men into the front benches as fast and as soon as we can.  For the past 40 years, we have been looking at the same old faces on all sides of this House and the people are sick and tired of it.  They ask if these people will ever go out or die and give the young people a chance.  Even as things are, some generations have had no chance.</P>
    <P>Down the country all the boys and girls are marking time and waiting for a lead in something that is noble and good.  They do not want to join Sinn Féin if they can come into this House and work from here.  The Taoiseach has it in his power to heal the wounds of other days by forgetting much of the past, giving up the political present and thinking in terms of a noble future, a grand future, a future in which our young men and women can take their rightful place in the country and in <Col N="1685" /> this Parliament, led by the Taoiseach and the members of this House.</P>
    <P>These are the things the people are waiting for.  There is too much turmoil and trouble in Irish politics, but it is all ballyhoo because there is not the slightest bit of sincerity in it.  The promises which were made at the last election and then broken were enough to sicken the people.  &ldquo;Put us in.  Get cracking.  We will give employment to all the people.  Get your husbands to work.&rdquo;  Over the past two years, there has been a wave of unemployment and emigration that would sicken anybody and not the slightest effort has been made to stop it.</P>

      <P>Knowing myself as I was when a young fellow, and all the generation of that time, what we were like and felt like and what we would do, I am satisfied that the young generation at present are in the very same mood.  They want to be given a lead.  If we give them such a lead as will induce them to look to this House instead of elsewhere, we shall do a great deal of good for the country.  We do not want revolution and turmoil.  We want peace, concord, goodwill and a real effort to solve the three or four major problems. We shall do it under P.R. but it will not be done under the straight vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> The straight vote will throw us back into the melting pot again&mdash; exactly what we wanted to get out of. It will bring a new gentry upon this country, a new class with the money in their wallets and big organisations behind them so that they can come into this House while the simple countryman who can represent his constituents here under P.R. will be kept out.  We do not want that.  We want an assembly of the Irish people.  We have that.  All we want is a better leadership.  We want none of this tomfoolery of glowing promises and no performance.  We want work for the people.  We must try to stem emigration as quickly as possible.  We must make every effort to give hope to the Northern minority that we are working on their behalf to unite Ireland and that everything possible will be done to unite the nation.</P>
    <P>A divided Ireland has been the cause of most of our troubles.  Our economy will never really prosper while we have Partition.  The Taoiseach should concentrate on those three objectives&mdash;to stem emigration, to give employment to our people at home and to unify the country.  We shall have plenty on hands if we try to solve these problems without starting out on an errand of danger.  We do not know where we are going.  The Taoiseach brought all this about.  The Fianna Fáil Party are not united in this because 50 per cent. of them hate the day the Taoiseach mentioned it.  They do not want it.  I remember the day in the Fianna Fáil Party Room when Deputy G. Boland struck the table in front of the Taoiseach and said, in effect: &ldquo;We want none of this.  The people are sick and tired of that.  We want work, peace and plenty.&rdquo;  I was informed that there were not 12 votes out of 70 in favour of the abolition of P.R. I can prove that because I was told it by a Deputy who took part in the discussion.  The Taoiseach went on with his work and said that it must go through.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies sat there docile and silent.  If the straight vote method of election comes about, there will be very few of us on any side of the House who will come back.</P>

      <P>If I want to come back, I can come back under the straight vote or under P.R. because I am one of those who served the people all the time, irrespective of politics.  The Fianna Fáil Party are as disunited as they possibly can be. They do not want the abolition of P.R. If a minority of them were to speak up in their Party rooms and even in this House, manly and straight, the country would have a ray of hope.  Some members of that big Party over there are sitting with their heads down, being silent while others get up and make false speeches against their conscience and beliefs.  I cannot believe that Irish people are so spineless. What has become of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Is there none of them sufficiently independent to tell the Taoiseach in this House what he thinks of the introduction of the straight vote and the abolition of P.R.?  Deputies opposite know very well that the nationally-minded people will be shoved out and the lords and gentry will take their place again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a speech from Deputy Booth yesterday.  I know what that speech signified.  It signified a resurrection of the old Tory system.  He wants no one in this House except the well-learned, the cultured and those of a different outlook from ours.  That is the type of man who can get up and have the neck to insult his own back-benchers, talking about the Orange Order in the North and saying that everything was right and saying that in the North people are ground down because of their own fault.  Such rot to be expressed in this House and Deputies opposite listening to it! Deputy Booth almost brought in the Union Jack over his shoulder.  It was the first time in 40 years that I heard such an Orangeman's speech in this House and he got away with it from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I thought some of the Deputies behind him would <Col N="1688" /> have the courage to give him a crack on the back of the head and tell him to sit down but they would not do it. We had to listen to a spineless type such as was never seen or heard when there was trouble, who always made sure to be in good business and to be able to pull the coat tails of the Government.  That type can insult the Nationalists of the North and the South with his reference to Orange lodges and the Orange Order.  We want none of that.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying: abolish P.R. if you like.  You can do it if you wish, but the people will not let you or, if they do let you, you are in for a period of misery, revolution and turmoil and the country will be back to the sick and rotten days of 40 years ago.  Do what you like; do what you will; but the Irish people will not respect you for what you are doing. What the Irish people want at present is that the Government will get on with the job, get on with what they promised them: work, a stop to emigration and the unity of our country.  That can be done by united effort but Fianna Fáil are making no effort.</P>
    <P>The President has made an appeal but the Taoiseach did not listen to the appeal.  Other members of the Fianna Fáil Party did not listen to the appeal. I belong to the old-I.R.B. and the old Republican movement.  We still meet as brother Irishmen in the one hall.  We fought on both sides in the Civil War.  We are asking for unity, unity of purpose.  We are asking that the past should be forgotten and that we should build a decent present and future.  That is what we want.  It is only from those people who were together in the past that the real inspiration and initiative will come.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to forget this business about the straight vote. It is only a red herring, an effort to side-track, an effort to deceive the people and keep them bewildered.  Let us have elections when we must have them, but when the election is over, let Parliament run its full term.  I have been in the House for the past 24 years and never got a three years' run.  I fought three elections in one year. <Col N="1689" /> Simple countrymen cannot afford that. We are in the House because of our patriotism, our fighting spirit and our love of politics.  There was an election two years ago under P.R.  There will be another election and a Presidential election and, if the Taoiseach is defeated in the straight vote, I suppose there will be a general election.  The people do not want that.  They do not want the expense, the worry and the trouble of it.  They want work, peace, concord, goodwill and a unified effort by good men to make the country a place worth living in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion would not arise but for the action of the Upper Chamber in defeating the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  That poses a question which should be closely considered as to the continuance of the Seanad.  I intend to preface my remarks by reference to that question.  A good deal of discussion has taken place through the years as to whether or not we should have a second Chamber.  The Government maintain that we should because, having abolished the Seanad, they set it up again, possibly with a view to giving soft jobs to their henchmen who could not secure a seat in this House. There are others who believe that the Seanad does useful work.  The Government have seen to it that it is extremely difficult for the Seanad to defeat a measure which has been approved by this House.  Despite that position, which arises mainly from the fact that there are 11 nominees of the Taoiseach in the Seanad, the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was defeated by the Seanad.  It was defeated after close and careful consideration by people representative of every walk of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a unique situation.  During my membership of this House over the past eight years, the Seanad never defeated a measure submitted to it by this House for consideration.  In some cases, they made minor amendments. If the wish of the Seanad is being flouted openly by Fianna Fáil, on the pretence that they are entitled to do so under the Constitution, why should the country have to bear the expense of a <Col N="1690" /> second Chamber?  Is it to be clearly understood from the Taoiseach's actions on the first occasion that the Seanad defeated a measure that he has no regard for that House or its views and that the only reason he has it there is that it is helpful to providing, as I have said, nice secure posts for some of his own henchmen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim that I am entitled to make a passing reference. I have stated that this matter was examined by the Seanad, the Upper House, by people representative of all walks of life, including six representatives of the Universities.  As a result of their deliberations the Bill was defeated.  No notice whatsoever is being taken by the Leader of the Government of that decision of the Seanad.  Instead, he avails of constitutional rights and brings in a motion here to nullify the action of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a matter of the utmost importance. This body costs the country thousands and thousands of pounds yearly.  The first time it defeats a measure presented to it by the Government, the Taoiseach and his Government decide: &ldquo;We will not accept your decision.  We have no regard for it.&rdquo;  Is that not what the Taoiseach and his Ministers are saying of the decision in the Seanad, not only here but throughout the length and breadth of the country?  I think I am entitled to refer to the existence of the Upper House, particularly since it receives no recognition from the Government of <Col N="1691" /> the day.  I bow to your ruling.  Sir, and I shall leave the point now, though much more could be said on it.</P>
    <P>Mention was made yesterday that the people were thoroughly conversant with the issue before them; they knew the pros and cons, it was said.  Some Government speakers expressed their annoyance at the continuance of the debate here.  They held there was no need for the debate to continue and the matter should now be left to the people to decide.  Let us examine whether or not that is the position.  I do not want to reflect personally on any member of this House, but a Government speaker yesterday&mdash;he had a lengthy document before him&mdash;told us that this measure was of little or no importance because whether or not it was passed, it would make little difference.  He substantiated his claim in the following manner: he said that in 10 constituencies in his part of the country at the last election 37 Deputies were elected; he said of the 37, 36 would have been elected, irrespective of whether the straight vote or proportional representation applied.</P>
    <P>Surely there never was such a ridiculous or nonsensical statement made in this House by a Government speaker.  Everybody knows that the proposal is that we shall have in future single member constituencies and, therefore, instead of ten contests to elect 37 Deputies there will in future, if this measure is passed, be 37 contests.  Yet, this Government speaker felt that no matter what system applied, the result would be the same, with the exception of one out of the 37.  Is it not reasonable to assume that if a member of this House is labouring under such a delusion, many people throughout the length and breadth of the country must be labouring under some delusion, so far as the outcome of this measure is concerned? Clearly, they cannot be conversant with all the pros and cons and it is only right therefore that every effort should be made here and elsewhere to make them clear as to the issue which will confront them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth spoke on this measure <Col N="1692" /> and he received a good deal of publicity from the Fianna Fáil newspaper. During the period in which I listened to him yesterday, he made it quite clear that he believes, in relation to the position which obtains in Northern Ireland, that the representatives there are thoroughly representative of the people.  He believes that the Unionist representation in Parliament is fair and adequate representation for the Unionists and that the other Parties similarly have fair and adequate representation.  That was very definitely stated by Deputy Booth, one of the most enlightened members&mdash;so he is described&mdash;of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Will some Fianna Fáil Deputy explain for us now the many statements made over the past 40 years by Fianna Fáil speakers that there is nothing in Northern Ireland but gerrymandering and dictatorship and that every effort is made to deny the Nationalist groups proper representation?  I have heard many Ministers make such statements; I have heard many Fianna Fáil Deputies make such statements. Yesterday, however, this enlightened member of the Fianna Fáil Party came in here and said that all these statements are nonsense; that there is no truth in them; that there is no justification for them; that Northern Ireland representatives are truly representatives of the people; that there is nothing wrong&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;with the membership of Parliament in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Someone may ask, listening to the discussion here, why are the Opposition annoyed about this?  I have listened to Opposition Deputies saying that, when this goes <Col N="1693" /> before the people, the people will defeat it.  I would warn these optimistic members of the Opposition to be cautious.  They are not alive to what is happening.  The Government expect that sections of the people throughout the country who will not be conversant with the issue may not go to the polls and, as a result of their apathy, the measure will go through. Opposition Deputies should bear in mind that throughout the country, there are small Fianna Fáil groups active in every district preparing for this contest and hopeful of getting their voters to the polls.  There is nothing wrong in that, but how do they expect to get them to the polls?  How do they expect to provide the transport and the finance necessary?  They expect to derive both as a result of the letter which was sent out by the Taoiseach-designate, the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, to various people throughout the country, particularly industrialists and businessmen, demanding subscriptions from them.</P>

      <P>What do Fianna Fáil aim at achieving by the adoption of this system, and what is the background to its adoption or to the proposal to adopt it?  We need go no further than the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party for the answer to that question.  Time and again, over the past seven or eight months, he has made it quite clear that the reason for <Col N="1696" /> this amendment of the Constitution, the reason for the proposed change from P.R. to the single-seat constituency, is the action of the Irish people in 1948 and 1954 in electing an alternative Government to the Fianna Fáil Government, and placing him and his Party in Opposition.  Is that not a peculiar excuse for the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to put before the people to secure their approval to a change in the method of election to this House?</P>

      <P>What is the need for a general election, if it is not to give the people the opportunity of voting for whatever candidates present themselves, and allowing the people to elect the candidates they favour most, and when these candidates are elected and become members of this House, they assemble here and determine by majority vote who will be the Leader of the Government and of the House. Is that not what the elected representatives of the people did here in 1948 and in June, 1954?  Was there anything wrong with that procedure?  The Taoiseach believes there was, and that it was so wrong that he is taking steps to ensure that never again will it happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second excuse proffered by the Taoiseach regarding the reasons for the implementation of this measure-and it is secondary only to the first excuse&mdash;is that &ldquo;if we do not take advantage of our over-all majority now, never again will we have an opportunity of doing so.&rdquo;  With that statement, the Head of the Government makes it clear to all and sundry that he does not expect Fianna Fáil ever again to get back with an over-all majority under the present system. That is the only reasonable interpretation which can be placed on his <Col N="1697" /> remarks.  Why should he believe that, having regard to what I may term the very substantial majority which he now enjoys, a more substantial majority possibly than we have seen in any Parliament since the State was set up?</P>
    <P>Why should he make such statements or have such a pessimistic outlook as to the future support he will get from the Irish people for himself and his Party?  He knows very well, that during the last election campaign his Party took advantage of every possible situation, international situations and otherwise, to belittle the efforts of the inter-Party Government, and he knows very well that the future Taoiseach, the present Tánaiste&mdash;if Fianna Fáil ever again win-made such statements as the one he made in Clery's Restaurant in O'Connell Street that 100,000 jobs would be provided for the workers of this country if Fianna Fáil were elected.  Naturally, these statements and assurances were responsible for getting a sufficient number of votes for them, to bring about this big majority they now enjoy in the House.  Seeing that none of these promises have been implemented or are likely to be implemented, the Taoiseach knows it will be extremely difficult for his Party at the next election to get any promises similar to those which will gull the people again.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is the second reason why we have this measure before us.  Indeed, one may say this is a very peculiar time for the introduction of a measure on the basis of a fear of instability of government and that we should have it brought in 40 years after the establishment of the State before a Parliament which, as I have said, has the strongest majority of any parliament back through the years.  Is there any evidence of instability, as a result of the system in operation, in the fact that Fianna Fáil got an over-all majority at the last general election and enjoys a majority of ten or eleven?  Is that evidence of instability, and as I mentioned before when speaking during a previous debate, is it a majority of 20, 30 or 40 they want?  Is their majority of some 9 or 10 not sufficient for them?  What happened in previous Parliaments? <Col N="1698" /> Was not their lifetime, as has been pointed out by various speakers in this debate, as long as the lifetimes of Parliaments in other countries who operate under other systems of election.</P>
    <P>The only short-lived Parliaments we had in this country were when the Taoiseach did not agree with the decisions of the people and he dissolved the Dáils set up in 1932, 1937 and 1943 within a year of the preceding general elections.  He was not satisfied to seek help or support from any of the other elected representatives in this House.  He wanted dictatorship, as he wants and hopes to get it through this measure.  That is the clear-cut aim of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Does not everyone know there is no system devised which gives a fairer and more effective representation in this House&mdash;and in any other Parliament&mdash;than the present system obtaining in this country?</P>
    <P>Without quoting from this book-I seldom if ever do quote from any document&mdash;I ask does it not clearly prove that the charges made by such people as the Minister for External Affairs that the conditions which obtained in France, Italy and other countries, that as a result of the P.R. system they had instability in their Governments and had frequent elections, clearly disprove those charges? It is a book written by an independent research body and it disproves all these statements.</P>

      <P>We are told by the Government Party that they made a mistake in the past, that what they <Col N="1699" /> stood for in the past was entirely wrong, that the Taoiseach and other members of the Party who were so strong in upholding P.R. in 1937 and other periods now admit they made a mistake.  We are told it was wrong when the <i>Irish Press</i> said it was a fair, simple and effective method of election. They say now that viewpoint was quite wrong and that they should have agreed long ago to follow the Northern Ireland decision to change from P.R. to the straight vote and single seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>They argue now that statements and adverse comments which they made regarding the Parliament established in Northern Ireland were without foundation, and some 30 years afterwards they say that the Northern Ireland system of election is the correct and proper system, and should have been introduced here long ago.  They claim to be fully conversant with the admirable merits which they allege will flow from the abolition of proportional representation.  Years ago they had not that admiration for anything British, but the wheel has gone around full circle, and what was correct some years ago is now incorrect and what was incorrect some years ago is now the correct procedure.</P>
      <P>It would not be impossible to compare conditions obtaining here and in Northern Ireland and England as far as elections are concerned.  At the same time let us examine what is happening in Northern Ireland and what is happening in England during elections.  It was mentioned that a number of constituencies in Northern Ireland do not even know what an election is because there is no need to have elections in them at any time.  Some constituencies have been arranged in such a way that one Party is bound to secure the seats and it is futile to oppose that Party. That does not obtain in elections to the English Parliament.  Irrespective of whether a Party is strong or weak, an election takes place in every constituency, but what is the result of this system in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not proper that we should comment on the English people, possibly, but I do so because the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1700" /> Government say they are satisfied that the English system is an admirable one.  However, everybody knows that probably no fewer than 70 per cent. of the seats in the British Parliament are known and termed as &ldquo;safe seats,&rdquo; and that even though a contest takes place in those constituencies the results are well known in advance.  It is well known that a Conservative, or a Labour candidate, will be elected in a certain constituency and does not everyone know what happens if a member in one of those safe constituencies retires or dies?  Is what happens there not likely to happen here?  If the Conservative member for a constituency in Northern Scotland dies or retires, is there not a move made by potential members of Parliament all over the country to be nominated for that constituency even though they may not be known in the constituency? They know that if nominated by the Party Chiefs they will be elected.  Is that not what happens?  If that system were introduced here could it not happen here?  Take the constituency I represent, West Cork, one of the furthest removed from this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Suppose there is a safe seat for one Party in that constituency and, in case Deputy Booth or Deputy Haughey find fault with me, I shall base my assumption on the fact that Fianna Fáil had that safe seat in West Cork.  I shall assume they had a two to one majority and that the existing Fianna Fáil representative retired.  Headquarters in Dublin would know it was a safe seat. They would have a number of applicants from the area, but possibly those applicants would not have sufficient influence with the big noises&mdash;if I might use the term&mdash;and possibly Deputy Booth or Deputy Haughey. having lost their seats in Dublin, would get the nomination.</P>

      <P>Does it not happen frequently in Britain under the British system of election?  How often does it happen that a Party-man from London seeks and secures nomination <Col N="1701" /> in a constituency in Scotland or Wales?

Díreach i ndiaidh an Dáil seo a bheith tofa tháinig an Lucht Oibre le chéile ag Ard-Fheis agus d'aontaigh siad, d'aonghuth, nach nglacfadh siad páirt a choíche arís i gComh-Rialtas ar bith eile.

    <P>The Government's aim in introducing this Bill and asking that it be deemed to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas was simply to give the people an opportunity of deciding for themselves whether they preferred to continue to elect members to Dáil Éireann by the present system of proportional representation or whether they preferred to change to the proposed new system of the single non-transferable vote.  I was always led to believe that it was the essence of democracy to give the people the opportunity of deciding important questions such as this, particularly questions involving constitutional changes.  Evidently the Opposition believe that it would be more democratic to set up a commission to decide questions of this kind but we on this side believe in putting the case to the people.</P>
    <P>We also believe in agreeing to whatever decision the people come to. When a change of such importance as this is proposed it is obviously the duty of every Deputy to examine the proposed new system and decide for himself whether or not it will give better Government.  Unfortunately nobody is perfect and it was clear from the beginning that the human element was bound to enter into the question and that this whole matter would be examined more from the point of view <Col N="1703" /> of its effect on the Party and the individual Deputy than from the point of view of whether or not it would improve the country's Government.</P>
    <P>We are convinced that the change is necessary.  The present system, as has been stated on numerous occasions, lends itself to the creation of small Parties.  Where we have a multiplicity of small Parties we must have coalitions; there is no option.  As we know, not only from the effects of coalitions in other countries but from coalitions in our own country, they ultimately tend to economic and political disaster.  Coalitions are formed by Parties which are often diametrically opposed to one another, as happened here with Fine Gael and Labour.  The leaders of these Parties are lured by the very human desire for power and proceed to explain away their deviation from long-held and oft-expressed principles by saying that they are sinking their differences and working together for the good of the country. We know from our own experience that coalitions have never gained the confidence of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is not a question of any intrinsic merit on the part of coalitions but rather because of the peculiar historical circumstances in which this country found itself.  It was a fact because in the first place the country was divided roughly in half&mdash; pro- and anti-Treaty.  Secondly it was because the coalitions were faced with one single Party which refused under any circumstances to betray the principles for which it stood for the sake of gaining office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate result of the proportional representation system would be that we would have four or five Parties forming a Government and three or four Parties forming an Opposition.  Then we would be faced with the grave dangers which we have already pointed out.  We would have no agreement on policy and we would have a constant shelving of responsibility as we found during the period of office of the last two coalitions.  It is common knowledge that on each occasion when the coalitions broke up the supporters of Fine Gael&mdash;I do not say the Party, or the leaders who were always hoping for another coalition&mdash;said that everything would have been all right except for Labour and the Labour supporters said that everything would have been all right except for the ultra-conservatism of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>It is only right to say that we on this side are not the only Party opposed to coalitions.  Immediately after this Dáil was elected, the Labour Party decided unanimously that they could not take any further part in a coalition.  That proved, of course, that they must have felt ashamed of their part in previous coalitions.  Shortly after that a number of the Fine Gael leaders called on the people to rally around the Fine Gael Party and to give them sufficient support to form a Government composed only of Fine Gael.  For that reason, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Opposition speakers who quite obviously do not believe what they are saying and are opposing this change in the election system simply for the sake of opposition.  It has been said on numerous occasions here that by introducing this Bill we are endeavouring to take away the rights of minorities from having representation in this House.  Of course that is not true.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking from an electoral point of view there are two types of minorities.  One is a <Col N="1705" /> body of people who are racially, culturally or traditionally different from the vast majority of the people among whom they live.  I would agree that if we had such a minority here there would be a necessity for certain constitutional safeguards, but we have not got that type of minority here.  The closest we could come to it would be a religious minority.  However, during the debate on this proposed change the only two independent members who claimed to represent religious minorities as such voted in favour of the change, that is.  Deputy Sheldon and Senator Cole.</P>

It is the duty of this group to endeavour to the best of their ability to put their case before the people and to change this minority into a majority, and that will come if the people believe the policy advocated by them is the best policy.  It is clear that under the straight vote system they would have a better chance.  If a minority really believe in what they advocate they will not want to remain a minority. They will want to become a majority so that they can put that policy into effect.  It appears that in some cases Parties are set up not because they may some day become a majority but because some day they may have the opportunity of bargaining for a post in the Cabinet in return for their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this country, whether the Opposition like to agree to it or not, two great bodies of opinion, one which believes that the Government of the country would best be left in the hands of the Fianna Fáil Party and the other which believes that an alternative Government would be best.  Obviously the straight vote system would help best in the election of these two bodies. It does not suit the Opposition to agree to this because it pays them better to go forward with opposing policies to get votes, like Fine Gael, for <Col N="1706" /> example, with their policy of lower taxes and the Labour Party with their policy of improved social services. Fine Gael got support from the people who felt it was better to have lower taxes and Labour got support from people who thought it would be better to have improved social services. Those two Parties came together afterwards in spite of the fact that those two policies were entirely opposed to each other, because one of them meant a reduction in expenditure and the other meant an increase in expenditure.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from listening to the various arguments put up by the Opposition in regard to the right to have all types of opinion in this House, that Dáil Éireann was a political shop window rather than a body elected to govern.  It has been stated here already on a number of occasions that the abolition of P.R. would lead to dictatorship.  In fact it has been said that was the object of this Party but we know that from a study of conditions in various countries&mdash;I do not want to go into this because they have already been mentioned on numerous occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;those countries which had the P.R. system, became dictatorships.  Somebody has referred to this booklet which has been published by <i>Tuairim</i> and mention has been made of the fact that there were conditions which led to Germany and Italy becoming dictatorships other than the P.R. system.  The fact is <Col N="1707" /> that because they had the P.R. system they were not able to grapple with the problems which evolved from the conditions after the War and that in itself helped to bring these dictators to power.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton has on every possible occasion stated that our object in bringing in this Bill was so that Fianna Fáil would rivet themselves in power. The facts are that in a democracy the votes of the people determine who will be in power.  If the people want the Fianna Fáil Party in power they will vote for them in sufficient numbers to put them in power and if they want another Government in power they will vote in sufficient numbers to return them.  The will of the people is paramount.</P>

We are inclined to believe, as they believe in every other country, that whatever might have happened, that whatever disasters overtook other countries because of a particular system of election, these disasters could not possibly overtake us.  Until 1948 the majority Party, the Party who had the greatest number of seats in the House, always formed a Government but in 1948 a change came and while the Party with the most seats in the House had more seats than all the other organised parties together and was obviously the choice of most of the people, the other Parties formed the Government.</P>

That might be justifiable criticism if the Dáil had power to change the Constitution but of course the Dáil has no such power.

      <P>Deputy Dillon opposed the proportional representation system at one stage; he now favours it.  If Deputy Dillon genuinely believes that he was wrong the first time and that he is right now, it would not only be his right but it would be his duty to change.  But one cannot help doubting his sincerity when one listens to the type of argument he has put forward to bolster up his case.  He began by stating what is a fact:&mdash; that there is no true democracy in Stormont, that while there may be a facade of democracy, the spirit of democracy is dead as far as that area is concerned.  But then he proceeds to argue that the adoption of the single non-transferable vote system in the Six Counties was responsible for this.  Of course, that is entirely wrong and was refuted by Deputy Booth in the figures he gave last night.</P>
      <P>The facts about the absence of true democracy in the Six Counties are these.  In the first place, that area was specially selected by the British Government in conjunction with the Unionists to ensure that, as far as humanly possible, power would remain in the hands of the Unionist ascendancy. In the second place, specific areas where it was not possible to ensure this were gerrymandered in order to ensure it.  Under any system of election the Unionists will control Stormont because, as I said, the Six County area was specially designed for that purpose. Surely Deputy Dillon does not pretend that should anybody wish to gerrymander in this part of the country, it would be possible to do so?  The division of the Six Counties is along well defined lines; in this part of the country that is not so.  Deputy Murphy also mentioned &ldquo;Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I do not know where that is, unless he meant Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> Referring again to the Six County area, I have given the true reasons why there is no democracy there.  If that is the Deputy's main argument in favour of proportional representation, it shows the extreme weakness of his case.  I have no doubt that when the people get the opportunity&mdash;which we are giving them and of which the Opposition would like to deprive them &mdash;of voting on this very important issue, they will change the election system to the system of the single non-transferable vote.</P>

      <P>Two very comforting facts emerge at this stage of the progress of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  One is the absence of a motion to abolish the Seanad, and the other is the near deification of the people by the Fianna Fáil Party and at every possible opportunity their obsequious devotion to the will of the people.  We in this Party welcome that great constitutional development.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested, no later than by the last speaker, that it was our object to keep this matter from the people and not allow them to give their ultimate decision on it.  I can say for the Party to which I belong that we have at all times accepted the will of the people on all matters of national importance and that we are prepared to accept the ultimate manifestation of the people's will in this referendum, but we are not prepared to allow this matter to leave Parliament without full and adequate discussion upon its various facets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the demand for this change and the motives underlying it, one would have thought, to use Deputy Faulkner's phrase, that, after all, Parliament is the will of the people.  Parliament here is composed of the Oireachtas&mdash;the President and two Houses.  By virtue of their majority &mdash;which they freely admit, even from the Taoiseach down, they will never have again&mdash;it has been possible for the Fianna Fáil Party to push this motion through Dáil Éireann, but not without that full and adequate discussion which they sought to stifle under the guise of the necessity that it should be given to the people at the earliest <Col N="1710" /> possible opportunity for their decision. Having been passed through this House, it moved into Seanad Éireann and was defeated by the Seanad which, after all, represents to a very great extent, too, the will of the people. When one takes the 11 nominees of the Taoiseach from the 28 members of Seanad Éireann who voted in favour of this measure, one is left with 17 members out of 60 supporting it. And of that 17, one&mdash;Senator Mrs. Connolly-O'Brien&mdash;has declared that at the ballot box she will vote &ldquo;No.&rdquo; So that, you are left with 16, and I would suggest that even of that 16, the Fianna Fáil Party are not certain what each and every one of them will do on the polling day for this referendum.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that the two Independents, who represent what Fianna Fáil now would like us to believe is the only minority in this country&mdash;a religious minority&mdash;have voted in both Houses in favour of the measure.  It is true that Deputy Sheldon voted in this House in favour of the Government's proposal.  However, I think I can leave it at that and say no more about Deputy Sheldon's vote on this occasion than that it is in keeping with his traditional position in this House of voting with the Government in power and supporting them in all proposals they bring in.  As for Senator Cole's support in the Seanad, well, one could hardly expect that a nominee of the Taoiseach would go against him in a matter of that kind. In fact, if you examine the various votes in the Seanad, you will find that Senator Cole absented himself on two occasions at least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision which gives the power to override the decision of the Seanad.  However, I shall leave it.  In relation to this measure, we must consider if there is any public demand for it and the lack of such demand from any section of public opinion, coupled with the lack of any mention of it in the course of the last general election by the Government Party, affords the proof that there was <Col N="1712" /> no demand.  If it were in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party at the last general election, they carefully kept it from the public whose will they now purport to respect so very much.  There was no public demand, and I challenge the production of one title of evidence from any Fianna Fáil Party member to show that at any level of national or local government, in borough council or urban council, in Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme or the Country Women's Association, in Church or State, in any shape or form, there was any demand for this change, or even any debate prior to September last in which P.R. was the subject matter of discussion.</P>
      <P>If we had any doubt that the Taoiseach's press conference last September was the first time this proposal was mooted to the public, that doubt was dispelled by the recent letter which was published over the signature of the Minister for Industry and Commerce appealing for funds for the referendum and for the Presidential election.  In that, he is asking for funds that will ensure a vote &ldquo;worthy of Mr. de Valera,&rdquo; as he puts it, and &ldquo;sufficient to carry the proposals in the referendum which he has proposed.&rdquo; There we have it from the Tánaiste himself that the proposal comes from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to the attempt of Deputy Booth yesterday to distinguish between boss control and Party discipline. Deputy Booth sought to tell us and to impress on us that boss control was entirely absent from the Fianna Fáil Party; that Party discipline was their guiding rule.  He defined Party discipline as &ldquo;that discipline that emerges after a full, free and frank discussion within the Party of any contemplated changes&rdquo; and that &ldquo;after a vote in the Party upon such changes, majority rule was accepted and made the Party policy&rdquo;.  How can anybody dare to say that Party discipline, as so designed, guided the introduction of this proposal into the House from the Fianna Fáil Party, when the Taoiseach himself in September told the members of the Press that he had not even discussed it with the Government, that his own Ministers <Col N="1713" /> did not even know what was in his mind at that time?  Eventually, I suppose it came to them.  Then it came to the Party meeting at which we were told there was unanimity. We have also heard otherwise, but that is of no consequence because, as Deputy Norton put it yesterday, when paint and feathers for war are required, every member of the Fianna Fáil Party dons the necessary equipment and prepares for battle at the Chiefs slightest exhortation.</P>
    <P>We had the same thing at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis&mdash;not a dissenting voice&mdash;and now we have been debating this subject in the House for practically six months.  Why was this House summoned for January 7th this year instead of in February, as usual? Deputy Loughman told us today&mdash; and I take it he was speaking with the authority of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;that were it not for the fact that Opposition speakers spoke for so long and obviously so ridiculously this referendum would be taking place in this month, and that that was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party and, obviously, the intention of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Why were we recalled on 7th January?  It was a fraudulent move to secure a fraudulent objective.  The Fianna Fáil Party had taken into full consideration long prior to the Christmas recess that there was a possibility that they might be beaten in the Seanad.  They had taken into consideration the 90 days' delay that would be the inevitable consequence of such a defeat and, making allowance for the actual speaking power on the net talking days in Dáil Éireann, they made certain, by recalling us on 7th January, that the referendum would take place on the same day as the Presidential election and that it could not go beyond it.</P>
    <P>I solemnly believe that; I believe that the vast majority of the country believe it, in spite of Deputy Loughman's pronouncement to-day that it was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to hold it this month, in which month, by the way, the Presidential election could not take place.</P>
    <P>We must examine, then, in the <Col N="1714" /> absence of demand, in the light of the Dáil being summoned unusually early, in the light of all that has taken place and all that has been said, the motive behind this proposal.  We are asked to believe that its purpose is to give effective government.  We were told the other day by the Minister for Education that it means our economic survival.  We have been told by various Government speakers, including their Ministers, that it is an effort to avoid the calamities that overtook other European countries as a result of P.R.  Nobody has proved in the course of these debates that, where countries did suffer calamities, P.R. was responsible.  Neither has anybody proved that the particular form of P.R. &mdash;of which there are upwards of 200 forms&mdash;being used in those countries where violent changes took place politically was the same form of P.R. as we have here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the form of P.R. we have here.  Deputy Dillon has been taken to task for being at one time opposed to P.R. and now seeking to defend it.  If I interpret what Deputy Dillon said on all the occasions which are brought up against him now, he was opposing P.R. as debauched by the Electoral Acts of 1943 and 1947 by the Fianna Fáil Party in reducing the multi-seat constituencies, coupled with gerrymandering in some of the constituencies, in order to effect a Fianna Fáil majority at all costs.</P>
    <P>The motive is pretty clear.  Whatever we may hear about economic survival and whatever we may hear about other countries, the motive is the very simple one of trying to get rid of any possible circumstance wherein the Fianna Fáil Party might be defeated again and to ensure&mdash;I use Deputy Norton's words deliberately&mdash;that they rivet themselves in power on the votes of something around 35 per cent. of the electorate. Last evening, Deputy Loughman solemnly avowed that he understood the P.R. system.  He gave us examples and tried to make deductions to prove a certain point.  All he succeeded in proving, in fact, was that either he did not understand the system or that his case was not sound.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> Deputy Loughman took the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny as an example.  He sought to prove that the five persons elected for that constituency were the five persons who secured the five highest number of votes and that the single non-transferable vote would make no difference in Carlow-Kilkenny.  However, he omitted to demonstrate that the people there with the five highest number of votes were three Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael Deputies. But if the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency is divided into five neatly-arranged strips, the result at the next election will be not three Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael candidates but five Fianna Fáil candidates, which is exactly what the Fianna Fáil Party want on a 35 per cent. vote.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, Deputy J.A. Costello asked the Taoiseach what had brought about the change of mind since 1937 when he used the now well-known phrases &ldquo;The system we have we know.  We have to be grateful that we have P.R.&rdquo; Everybody knows these phrases now. At that point.  Deputy Dillon interjected and said &ldquo;1948&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach, apparently for once off his guard, gave a straight answer and said &ldquo;Precisely&rdquo;.  His attitude was: &ldquo;P.R. defeated me and my cohorts in 1948 and again in 1954 and I am determined to abolish it, lest the Party I am now attempting to leave should, without my wisdom, counsel or almost mystical presence, suffer similar defeats again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not a question as between single-Party government and coalition government.  Nobody has proved here that coalition Governments are any more unstable or less effective in the implementation of policy than the single-Party Government or that, even going further, in countries where the Straight vote operates or, as I prefer to call it, the &ldquo;limited&rdquo; vote, there are fewer coalitions.  In England, in the period from 1924 to 1942, it is a fact that in only 5½ years of that time did a single-Party majority operate in the House of Commons.  As Deputy Norton also said, I fear that appeals <Col N="1716" /> to the Taoiseach at this stage to pause and listen to the voice of reason, to give the matter further consideration, would be useless having regard to his history in all those respects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughman said yesterday that all symposia arranged by chambers of commerce and other bodies had been arranged beforehand obviously in collusion with various members of the Opposition.  I have spoken at some of these.  There was no such collusion.  Everybody who came to them was interested.  At some of them, votes were taken.  As they went on, it was remarkable that it was the Fianna Fáil Party that first objected to votes being taken at such symposia.</P>
    <P>I am going to a symposium shortly, organised by a voluntary organisation. Before the Fianna Fáil Party agreed to send a speaker, they sought to impose three conditions&mdash;(1) that there would be no vote; (2) that there would be a neutral chairman, which is normal enough, and (3) that the Press would be allowed to give only a summary. There is an example of muzzling the meeting with regard to a vote and muzzling the Press with regard to what would be said at the meeting.  I am happy to say that that voluntary organisation did not accept those conditions. I am equally happy to say that Fianna Fáil, having failed to establish those conditions prior to sending somebody, are now sending a representative.</P>
    <P>The very latest argument by Fianna Fáil as to what might emanate from P.R. was given to us yesterday afternoon by Deputy Booth who said that P.R. might give Communism.  He quoted a gentleman named Togliatti, who wrote an article in the real <i>Pravda</i> under the heading, &ldquo;The Possibility of Using the Parliamentary Path for the Transition to Socialism.&rdquo; That is the brand new reason for abolishing P.R. Side by side with that.  Deputy Booth sought to tell us that the evil of proportional representation was that it created a political minority and cited and named Deputy Dr. Browne as an evil of proportional representation.  I wonder what the 6,000 or 7,000 people&mdash;I am <Col N="1717" /> not certain of the figure&mdash;in Dublin South-East who voted for Deputy Dr. Browne think of Deputy Booth's indictment of them?  Deputy Booth says: &ldquo;Much worse, it allowed him to create a political Party&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To what end are we moving?  Do we propose, through the medium of Parliament, to stifle all independent thought?  I would have thought that it would be better to have a Parliament made up even of independent men of widely divergent views, irrespective of what those views were, once they were sent here by the various people in the various constituencies rather than that the people in those constituencies would be deprived of the right of electing whomsoever they wanted to elect.  Deputy Booth bewails this opportunity, inherent in proportional representation, as he says, to create political minorities.  Why cannot there be political minorities?  What is wrong with them once the people will it?</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the obsequious pandering in words to the will of the people on the part of speakers on Government benches. What is wrong with the will of the people once its result is either to create or to elect minorities?  I find Deputy Booth very much at variance on this minority question with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare who, as late as 1951, on the occasion of the General Election, said they wanted minorities.  He was referring to P.R. when he said that Fianna Fáil did not want to destroy minorities, that they wanted to have them represented. Again, of course, they have changed their minds in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth also referred to the operation of this system of the single-member seat and the single nontransferable vote in the Six Counties of North East Ireland.  He was quite complacent about it.  He said it was right there, that the result was right and everything was grand and that if the Opposition had lost face in any way, had lost strength in any way, it was their own fault.  I do not know if that is the view of the Fianna Fáil Party now or not, that the situation in Northern Ireland is to be approved <Col N="1718" /> through their spokesman, Deputy Booth.</P>
    <P>I asked him a question, &ldquo;What about the uncontested seats?&rdquo;  He ran away from that.  Really, the big trouble in the Six Counties resulting from the uncontested seat is the absence from the minds of the people of any idea in relation to Parliament or its relationship with them.  Such a situation cannot be other than frustrating in the extreme.  It drives people into channels of thought and action into which they might not be driven if they were afforded the opportunity of sitting side by side with, or even opposite to, the representatives of other interests in the Northern Ireland Parliament.  I am firmly of the view that if proportional representation obtained in Northern Ireland, even with three-seat constituencies, in most of the constituencies there would probably be two Unionists and one Nationalist elected.  I do not care whether you identify Unionists with Protestants and Nationalists with Catholics or not.  If there were a situation in Northern Ireland whereby, say, the three members, two Unionists, Protestants, one Nationalist, a Catholic, would be going on deputations to the Minister and would be conferring together about matters of common interest, it would start that healing and unifying influence within that area much better than the present frustrating situation admits of and, indeed, actually impedes.</P>
    <P>I want to be perfectly clear on this. In a country of our history, whose political maturity is not as yet of the highest, by reason of historical movements and various consequences of political changes, the initiation of native government, civil war and all the other things that go to make up our political history, I would not support the system if it meant, for instance, that there were to be three Fine Gael Deputies in the area which now makes up my own constituency of North Mayo.  It would be embarrassing in the extreme.  The ease with which a person can appproach the person who represents him in Parliament is very important in the political life of a nation, particularly in our <Col N="1719" /> political life.  In the present scheme of things, those who elect me in North Mayo write to me when they want anything done.  When I am in Government they write to the other Deputies. In the main, the people go to the Deputy for whom they vote.</P>
    <P>It would cause considerable embarrassment if the people had to move away from that system and had to go to Deputies for whom they did not vote and ask them to do something for them.  Eventually, after a few elections&mdash;this could happen in favour of Fine Gael or of Fianna Fáil or of Labour&mdash;we would have a situation where people would stop contesting elections in certain constituencies and you would be faced then with the problem of a discontented minority who would lose all interest in the public weal, who would take no part in public life, good, bad or indifferent, who would say: &ldquo;Let them carry on from one election to another&rdquo;.  That is the situation which obtains in Northern Ireland at the present time. It is certainly not a situation that I would welcome here.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Assuming that the referendum goes through, a great majority of constituencies will be built around towns or heavy centres of population and the result could be that there would be an urban Dáil as opposed to a rural Dáil.  In certain parts of the country there would be vast numbers of people who would be unrepresented.  It is possible that on the reorientation of all these matters you might have a stretch of country for which there would be Fine Gael Deputies only and another vast stretch from which you would have only Fianna Fáil representatives in the Dáil.  The opposing people outside Parliament in both stretches would be unrepresented and their voices never heard.  I do not think that is a situation which the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party appreciate&mdash;I speak particularly now in relation to rural Deputies&mdash;but it is appreciated by those who represent the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>You will not bring about any unity <Col N="1720" /> as a result of this referendum&mdash;that unity of which the Minister for External Affairs spoke here yesterday. With the exception of the natural antagonism of the Labour Party, as a minority, to the abolition of a system and its replacement by one designed to make that minority a still smaller one, I think&mdash;this cannot very well be denied&mdash;this whole campaign both inside and outside the House is being fought on the resurrection of hatreds, bigotries and indifferences of opinion which should have long since subsided.</P>
    <P>Not for one moment do I profess to be a saint because, under provocation and in the heat of argument, one thinks up the counter-argument&mdash;an argument that very often would be better left unsaid.  But, human nature being what it is, one will have that heat in debate, in argument and counter-argument, engendering further hatreds and bigotries and resulting in a situation in which unity and unified effort become well-nigh impossible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the course of the Budget debate spoke of his longing for the day when this House will really become a deliberative assembly.  The amendment in the names of Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy asks that this House should act as a deliberative assembly now.  Speeches have been made, principally by Ministers, in the course of this debate which would have been better left undelivered.  They were calculated only to revive bitternesses which might prove useful in a subsequent electoral contest.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave this discussion without referring to Deputy Haughey's speech.  I want to know principally whether it is the Fianna Fáil creed that policies are something to be implemented for the good of the people, or whether they believe they are something deliberately conceived to bluff the people?  Here is what Deputy Corry said at Col. 1399 of Vol. 174:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely no one will tell me that if Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy John A. Costello, Deputy Dillon and the rest of that Front Bench spent a third of their time thinking out a decent <Col N="1721" /> policy for the next election&mdash;if they could agree on it&mdash;they could not bluff the people?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that what is inherent in policy?  Is policy something with which to bluff the people?  I should hate to think that even the Fianna Fáil Party would have that view and I should like some responsible Fianna Fáil speaker in the course of this debate&mdash;whatever little is left of it&mdash;to disown that statement categorically, a statement which more than impliedly asserts that policies are something conceived deliberately for the purpose of bluffing the people.  At times, we know that they do.  People are bluffed.  Nevertheless, I should hate to think that it would be a sustained and progressive part of our political development that the bluff would go on proportionately to still greater lengths, until eventually we would reach the stage wherein Parliamentary institutions and the public men who constitute them would be in the same position as the boy who cried &ldquo;Wolf!&rdquo; too often.</P>
    <P>Parliament, as Deputy Faulkner pointed out correctly, is the manifestation of the will of the people.  It is something sane.  It is something sound. It is something that should be preserved. It is something in which opposition, whether it be made by one Party or by several Parties acting together, is essential to ensure that very necessary vigilance vital to the national life of any democratic country.</P>
    <P>In this debate on proportional representation we have rambled all over Europe.  I heard the Minister for Health say at a disputation in the Marian College in Ballsbridge that proportional representation was something, in the last analysis, designed by mathematicians.  That, I felt, was a statement of gross disloyalty to his mathematician leader.  In all the ramblings all over Europe, France was pretty well abandoned fairly early on when it was discovered that proportional representation was in operation in France only for a few years after 1945.</P>
    <P>The arguments in relation to Germany and Italy are unsustainable when viewed in their proper perspective. Mussolini rose to power in Italy in <Col N="1722" /> 1922.  Hitler was well on the road to power in the early '30s.  Ascribing their rise and the tragedy that followed to proportional representation merely has the effect of belittling the intelligence of those responsible in the Fianna Fáil Party for putting proportional representation into the 1937 Constitution after the example of the 1922 Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not think one needs to go outside our own country at all.  It is a geographical unit and within that unit, a singular contrast exists.  Contrast what happens on one side of the Border with what is happening on the other side.  If the desire is to abolish proportional representation here to achieve the set of circumstances, which Deputy Booth holds rightly obtains in the Six County area at the moment, then, surely, the motive is to give an assured long-standing majority to one political Party and a voice in the affairs of the nation to no other Party, or Parties.</P>
    <P>I view this whole proposal with suspicion in face of the avowed statements by the Taoiseach and those supporting him that this is designed to prevent coalitions and ensure stability when neither of these arguments can be made to stand in face of analysis. Deputy Gilbride gave a fair interpretation of these proposals when he came into the House on the Second Reading debate and said that the Fianna Fáil Party were loyal to their leaders, loyal to their country, loyal to those who sent them here, namely, the Fianna Fáil voters, and it is for that reason they are willing to take a chance: &ldquo;We are loyal to those that come after us and we are willing to take the chance to give them security.&rdquo; That kind of security is riveted in Craigavon and Brookeborough or the succession of less safe heads in the Kremlin.</P>
    <P>I do not believe you will achieve any unity by this.  I do not believe you will achieve anything in the way of national well-being or advancement. I believe that once again a division is being created among our people that will have no other result than the impeding of the national effort, the destruction of public confidence, <Col N="1723" /> an added impetus to emigration, and no cure for the unemployment which besets us.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is too late &mdash;in fact it might be even too early&mdash; to make a final appeal, not to the Taoiseach, but to the younger people on all sides of the House, to consider the matter in this way: Do they know any shopkeeper or any farmer, big or small, who, having arrived at the end of his effective days, calls his sons together and says to them: &ldquo;The system which made my shop or my farm a success over all these years was a bad system; you change it now to another system which I think will serve you better&rdquo;?  Do you know anybody like that, and if you did, would you not suspect his motives, and would you not think that such a desire for such a change was far removed from the advancement or betterment of his family?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that last simile was out of joint. One main difference, at any rate, has already emerged between the opponents of this proposal and ourselves.  We in this Party are united on it and there is no qualification whatsoever to that unity.  We are satisfied to take the judgment of the people.</P>
      <P>It is strange that a very prominent leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon, who declared himself in 1947 as being against P.R. and who, having been challenged on his opposition to it, now goes back and in column 1425 of volume 174, No. 10, repeats his conviction that P.R. should be abolished. He says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I urge on the House that, perhaps, the best thing it can do is to pass this Bill in order to manifest to the people the obvious fraud that proportional representation has become in this country.  That would be a valuable step towards the abolition of this system of election&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Here are the operative words which I want to emphasise&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" />&ldquo;and the substitution therefor of single-member constituencies with the transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should complete the quotation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would ensure that the individual who ultimately secured the support of the largest numbers of voters residing in the constituency would be elected to represent them in this House...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the reduction in the numbers of seats.  Originally in my constituency of Galway, we had nine seats, but, because we reduced some of the constituencies down to five, four or three seat constituencies, we are said to have &ldquo;debauched&rdquo; the system of P.R.  What adjective or description is one to apply to the single member constituency with the transferable vote?  I do not know exactly&mdash; somebody referred to it here last night; I think it was Deputy Booth&mdash;how you can refer to the single individual as giving a constituency and all the interests in it, proportional representation, unless we have regard to the claims which have been made, again by Deputy Dillon himself, of being capable of representing all interests.  If I had my choice as between a ten seat constituency, and the transferable vote in a single member constituency, I would plump every time for the ten seat constituency.  The single member constituency with the transferable vote is more capable of manipulation than our present arrangement of multiple seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to, but there have been many speeches made on this.  I have not, I think, made a speech on the question since the debate began, and I should like to tell the Deputy that I became quite bored listening to the repetition in the speeches of others which hardly had even a difference in words, one from another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me try to give an example. Take a constituency in which you have Fianna Fáil as the largest element; the <Col N="1725" /> second largest is Fine Gael; and there is only one other element interested in representing the constituency, and let us say that is Labour.  You must now remember the area is only one-third the size of a three member constituency&mdash;I am assuming that it will not be cut down by more than a third&mdash; so is it not quite obvious to the Deputy that if you get a highly organised third minority in that small area, that minority is much more easily capable of manipulation and machining for the benefit of the second minority than is now possible in a three, four or five member constituency?  I certainly would not take the risk of it.  Anyway, I prefer, as I say, the seven, eight, nine, or ten seat constituency to that type of arrangement.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is not P.R. and we have here the words, in 1947, confirmed in 1959, of Deputy Dillon, who is one of the most prominent members of the Fine Gael Party, declaring himself publicly as being against P.R.</P>

      <P>There have been many references to the Civil War in this discussion, but so far as I can recall there has been no reference to the Civil War from this side of the House. I think it regrettable that the Civil War should have been mentioned and I do not see why it should be brought in at all.  I do not see why any arguments about P.R. and its application <Col N="1726" /> and results 30 years ago should be brought in.  Let us judge the question on the results as we now find them. I think that is the sensible thing to do.  I was very resentful last night when I heard the leader of the Labour Party referring to the 1922 Constitution, P.R.'s being in it and to strife. He used these three words.  I know he did not use the words &ldquo;Civil War&rdquo;, but he did refer to the 1922 Constitution, P.R. and strife.</P>
      <P>I think he might have left the reference out for this reason: in my constituency of Galway, the intrusion of the Labour Party into the 1922 election for the purpose of breaking the Collins-de Valera pact had a very regrettable and tragic result, the very memory of which causes the greatest bitterness in the ranks of the old I.R.A. in County Galway.  Associated with what I am saying is the name of Liam Mellows and I shall just leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan might allow me, by the very moderate comment I have made on remarks by the leader of the Labour Party, to prevent their being repeated and thereby causing further bitterness.  What he said last night can have that effect on the people who were very active at that time in both the political and military operations.  That is my purpose in making any reference to what the leader of the Labour Party said last night.  He told us that there was no doubt in the world that Fianna Fáil will be walloped&mdash;that is the word he used&mdash;when we bring this question to the people.  That has been said by various Opposition speakers since this debate began.  If they believe that to be true, why not let the people decide it?  Why make cross-road speeches in this House?  Why not let the people have a say and take the matter out of Leinster House and let the ordinary work of Leinster House&mdash;and this is a very busy time for it&mdash;go ahead?  The public are completely conversant with the arguments which have been put up. Whatever arguments have been put up <Col N="1727" /> by the Opposition have been made over and over again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton instanced countries where P.R. is in operation&mdash;Denmark, Sweden, Belgium and Switzerland&mdash; and said that they have no emigration and no 10 per cent. unemployment, because they used P.R. and we did not. This is somewhat analogous to the argument which was attempted in relation to what happened in Sligo in 1919. He says that we have not made progress in these things because we did not use P.R. Let us examine that statement. Who are the people who did not use P.R. when they got into power? After all, Deputy Norton was three and a half years fiddling with the Social Welfare Bill and in the end he did not succeed in bringing it in.  Was he not the one who did not use P.R.?  We were only six months in office when we were able to bring in a Social Welfare Act, so we did use P.R.</P>

There has been talk about using P.R. for the economic and social development of the country.  We commenced to establish a transatlantic air service. We bought the planes and assembled the maintenance staffs.  There is another example of our using P.R. for the economic development of the country.  But when the first coalition came in, they scrapped that plan.  The planes which had been bought for dollars were sold for pound notes which were not re-convertible into dollars.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton asked another question: what has happened since the time when the present Taoiseach was so enamoured of P.R.? Well, the World War happened, for one thing.  We have a good imitation war here, too, and it happened since the first coalition came into office.  In spite of the fact that this House is the only authority for declaring war, nevertheless we had a war and the coalition have put up an extraordinary proposition, that we should prosecute the war through the medium of the district courts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael should merge.  I have heard this argument time and time again in this House.  Usually it came from the Labour ranks.  I often heard Deputy <Col N="1729" /> James Larkin using it when he looked at our serried ranks, obviously thinking: &ldquo;Break up that Party and Fine Gael will get an element out of it and Labour will get an element out of it and we shall all gain&rdquo;.  I suggest to Deputy Norton that if he is planning for this amalgamation of Fianna Fáil with Fine Gael, he should also add Labour to it. So far as I can see, his political philosophy applied to national economics when he gets responsibility is not a lot different.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any capitalists who went to the United States looking for assistance for industries who could have done any better than Deputy Norton did when he told the industrialists of the United States that one of the advantages they would have here is cheap labour.</P>

Now, there is a new element introduced and the one person giving expression to it is Deputy Dr. Browne.  More than once, he said quite frankly that he is a Socialist.  I do not mind the term &ldquo;Socialist&rdquo; because he wants us to believe that this country, in fact, is not socialist already.  I maintain that it is.  I maintain that England is Socialist and that the United States is Socialist, particularly <Col N="1730" /> since President Roosevelt came into office in 1932.  References to socialism when I was a young man were somewhat equivalent to the references we now hear to Communism.

      <P>Very well, but I do think it is important to stress the need for an exact meaning of terms&mdash;dictatorship, socialism, and all the terms that are being bandied about.  Nobody knows exactly what is meant by them. I take it, therefore, I shall be in order if I refer to Deputy Dr. Browne as being the only person who has expressed a view, fundamentally different from that held by the rest of us, from the point of view of political philosophy. I shall delay the House for as short a time as I possibly can, but I do think Deputy Dr. Browne is entitled to a reply.</P>
      <P>He said that we have not replied to a great many questions that had been put and, for that reason, we should refer this matter to a commission.  I want to say that I am satisfied he believes every statement he makes and, if his statements or opinion are open to question, it is probably due to lack of the fullest information.  I believe he is quite honest in all his statements, in all he believes, and, that being so, I think it is up to us to give him our opinion on the questions he puts and on the opinions he himself expresses.  For instance, he says that political figures, political institutions, had been discredited as a result of the conduct of the political Parties.  I do not know whether he can apply that to Fianna Fáil.  We had 78 Deputies returned in the last general election and, as a yardstick of discredit, I do not know how he would like to apply that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He makes a statement like this: &ldquo;The most efficient&mdash;if it is efficiency you want&mdash;the most efficient type of government would be Fascist or Communist dictatorship.&rdquo;  I should like to <Col N="1731" /> know what he means by efficiency and, for that matter, what does he mean by socialism, communism and dictatorship?  I freely agree that dictatorship will give you the best military machine, but we do know that it did not give the biggest supply of butter to Germany before the war, nor to Russia at the present time.  It is true, of course, that, whatever shortcomings there may be, dictatorships do not allow people to say anything about them.  I also question their efficiency, even in the military field.  The democracies seem to have won every time, though, perhaps, it took them a little time to do so.</P>

      <P>I am most grateful to him.  Deputy Dr. Browne seems to think that there should have been a different approach in the presentation of this question to the people and he made a statement like this: &ldquo;The proposal originated from an individual. There should have been an incessant demand from the cumann to the Ard-Fheis.&rdquo; Let me say that I appreciate that tribute to the Fianna Fáil cumann. It has been a very much abused institution for the past quarter of a century in this House, and I am glad one of the freshest and most vital thinkers we have amongst us has such a good opinion of it that it is so good an institution it should have been the sieve through which this proposal should have come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where I join issue with him on this matter is that he evidently dislikes leadership.  A Government are elected by the people and they give their whole time to the thinking out of the handling of matters of this sort.  It is the duty of the Government to show initiative in all matters of public concern, to propound a plan and submit <Col N="1732" /> it.  Another criticism of his was: &ldquo;There is a certain lack of acceptance of the idea that an individual can, at will, change a very important aspect of Government.&rdquo;  I agree, but that has not happened in this case.</P>
    <P>When he was in the first Coalition did his leader not indicate that the name of the State was to be changed, and make the announcement in Canada?  There was great use made of the change; it was described in fact as a declaration of the Republic.  That declaration was made in Canada; and, only two days ago, there was an article in a paper which indicated that Mr. Seán MacBride, who was Minister for External Affairs at that time, had actually informed the then British Minister that there was no intention of repealing the External Relations Act, while at that very time the leader of the Coalition was making in Canada the announcement of the change.  If Deputy Dr. Browne remained in the coalition Government as a Minister, after that took place, how can he find any fault if, as he suggests, this proposal has come about in the way he suggests?</P>
    <P>He said that this question could be debated for 20 years before the full truth could be ascertained in relation to it.  He indicates that it has not been sufficiently debated and that there has been no demand for it, but I can tell him that this year I shall have been 34 years continuously in public life, and I have heard P.R. debated by election workers and organisers at every general election that has taken place during that time.  I have heard people of very high intellectual attainments making the most erroneous statements concerning it.  Therefore, it is not true to say that it is a system of which the people have become enamoured because of their acquaintance with its workings.</P>
    <P>A commission, of course, is the easy way out.  As a comment on the complaint of Deputy Dr. Browne about our unwillingness to refer this to a commission and our readiness to submit so many other matters to commissions, I would say that whatever about vocational organisation of society, banking, arterial drainage or a great many other <Col N="1733" /> things on which we have commissions, the public are well informed about the system of election.  They are sufficiently well tutored to be able to make a comparison for themselves and I do not believe any commission set up to enlighten the people would produce one tittle of enlightenment for them.  In fact I have heard highly intellectual people making the silliest remarks with regard to it.  This is a matter which has far more intimate relationship with the public than the type of matter that usually is referred to these commissions.</P>

      <P>Táim ag fánacht leis an chuid eile de.  Another comment Deputy Dr. Browne made is that if the people choose coalitions it is because they like them, because they regard them as a better form of Government. I do not want to cavil at the Deputy's line of argument, but he had no solid argument.  Does he not know when he makes a statement of that sort that the people have no other choice and when you have no other choice you have to take Hobson's?  Another statement Deputy Dr. Browne made was that if a Party wants to make itself felt it should not be outlawed so long as it observes all the democratic ritual. Here again the Deputy deludes himself. There is a little more than ritual required. I take it that if we were to do what he suggests with regard to the administration of the economic affairs of the country and were to nationalise everything from top to bottom, whether they succeeded or failed Deputy Dr. Browne would be satisfied so long as the ritual had been observed.  A failure with the proper ritual is far more acceptable than success under private enterprise in the absence of the ritual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given most of my attention to the arguments and comments put forward by Deputy Dr. Browne because he is the only speaker I have heard who seems to entertain a fundamentally different point of view about government from what the rest of us hold which goes a little deeper and further than the difference <Col N="1734" /> between P.R. and the single member system of voting.  He said a Socialist Party could very easily catch the rest of us out under this straight vote system if it were to go ahead, and this is the only thing about it that appeals to him: that it might come about under the proposed system that a majority of Socialist Deputies would be elected to this House by a minority vote.  He says they would then be imposing on the majority of the people a system of Socialism in Ireland and he puts that up as an argument against what we are doing.  My answer to him straightway is that we shall accept his proposition.</P>
    <P>Let us put the thing somewhat conversely to the way he has put it.  If he can get a majority of the voters of Ireland to be so indifferent as to whether the largest minority is elected as a Socialist Party then I say: &ldquo;good luck to him&rdquo; and he is entitled to his majority.  But if you have any issue that is of fundamental importance, he can take it from me the majority who might be greatly divided on one hundred and one other things would unite to form a solid phalanx against him.  Therefore he has nothing there on which to hang anything.  We are not proposing to do anything irrecoverable.  I know that is scoffed at.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Mulcahy had ceased his interruptions I would not use up the ten minutes in this irresponsible fashion.  But seeing that the Deputies over there are anxious to speculate about the future, I think we are entitled to speculate.  It helps the public mind to form a judgment as to what is likely to happen and that is a reasonable thing to do in connection with what we regard as a fundamental change.</P>
      <P>I concede to Deputy Flanagan that the time will come when the Fianna Fáil Party will be a minority Party like the others.  We could not hope to be a majority Party always.  I am saying to Deputy Flanagan that there will be no other majority Party if proportional representation remains.  In that situation you could not pass this legislation through the House and proportional representation would be a fixture; but the straight vote will never be a fixture.  That is the fundamental difference between the two.  Having said that I should like to demonstrate to Deputy Mulcahy that I am not seeking to use up the ten minutes irressponsibly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary meandering for a time in the English language and reverting to Gaelic in an effort to fill up to 3 o'clock, I do not think there is very much in what he said to which I can reply.  He commenced his observations by referring to statements which Deputy Dillon made on an occasion when he was referring to the system of election.  At that time he found fault with the action of the Fianna Fáil Government in relation to the number of large-member constituencies in&mdash;if I may borrow the phrase to which the Parliamentary Secretary took so much umbrage&mdash;debauching proportional representation by the great increase in the number of threemember constituencies.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks he challenged me to support the point of view that the single-member constituency with the transferable vote had any advantage over the single-member constituency with the non-transferable vote, which the Government are now submitting to the people as the alternative to proportional representation.  I do assert that when the people under proportional representation used their lower preferences they have very effectively given a clear indication of what they wanted.  If three candidates go forward in a single-member constituency&mdash; this is what the Parliamentary Secretary asked me to reply to&mdash;and if you have not the transferable vote, then it is clear&mdash;and it has happened repeatedly in Britain&mdash;that a candidate securing a minority of the votes cast gets the seat, and it is quite probable that the majority who are not represented, if they had a following preference could have indicated another choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all watched counts and repeatedly down through the years we have seen how effectively our people <Col N="1737" /> have grown to use proportional representation and how emphatically they have declared, by virtue of the competent use of the ballot box, their desire to have a succeeding choice in the selection of candidates.</P>
    <P>It was alleged by the Parliamentary Secretary that when the first inter-Party Government was formed, it did not have a mandate.  We looked with interest to the first occasion that arose to discover whether there was in fact anything in that allegation.  The first opportunity that presented itself was a by-election in West Donegal.  There were three candidates.  Fianna Fáil headed the poll on the first count. There was a second count and, on the elimination of the Clann na Poblachta candidate, there was a higher proportion of transfers to elect the other inter-Party candidate than had been experienced in the previous General Election as between two candidates in the same group.  That was clearly an endorsement of what the inter-Party Government had done in forming the Government in 1948.  Let us examine the situation which exists in Bournemouth.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Tariff Quota on woollen fabrics is operated on the basis that when imports from all sources amount to 5% of total home production, the rate of <i>ad valorem</i> duty is increased from 25% to 45%.  For 1958 the &ldquo;break-point&rdquo; was established at 14.2 million lbs. but because of falling U.S. production, the &ldquo;break-point&rdquo; for 1959 has been fixed at 13.5 million lbs.&mdash;a drop of 700,000 lbs.  This reduction must necessarily affect adversely this country's ability to export mill-woven woollen fabrics to the United States.</P>
      <P>The special arrangement under which the increased duty is limited to 30% in the case of hand-woven fabrics remains unaltered.</P>

We have made repeated representations to the United States authorities concerned with a view to the introduction of an alternative system or even for greater scope for trading.

The position is that at present there is a world shortage of hides, owing to a variety of reasons, but particularly because of heavy purchases by countries that did not previously import hides on a large scale and a falling-off in slaughterings in the Argentine and in the U.S.A.  This shortage has caused an increase in the price of hides.  It is not possible to predict what the effect of this will be on the prices of footwear and leather goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the legislation introduced by the Minister last year to encourage people to reconstruct and repair their premises, does the Minister not think that it would be advisable to reduce that minimum in order to encourage people who cannot afford to spend £20 or over to carry out some repair work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for this figure, in the first instance, so far as I can find out, was that works costing less than £60 could not be regarded as repair or reconstruction work but would be more in the way of decoration or maintenance work.  The figure of £60 was regarded as being so low that anything done at a less cost than that would be maintenance rather than reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that applicants are being encouraged to bring the cost of repair or reconstruction up to a minimum of £60 although, in fact, the work could be carried out more economically?  Would the Minister not consider reducing the figure for the reason I have stated, to encourage people in poor circumstances to repair their houses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point, that, under the conditions governing reconstruction or repair grants, regard must be had to the time when a previous grant was received.  If we were to allow small, almost maintenance, jobs to be regarded for grant purposes the other features of the legislation would come into play and possibly prevent people from getting a grant for reconstruction and real repair work a few years later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring before Question Time to the fact that very considerable dissatisfaction exists where the single non-transferable vote operates and there is a great volume of opinion in favour of adopting the system which we are now asked to discard.  I was referring to recent occurrences in the constituency of Bournemouth where a member of the Conservative Party disagreed with the action of his Government on a certain episode, which, no doubt, is a very serious occasion of difference to very many people throughout Britain.  Because that Member of Parliament exercised an independent viewpoint, we find that it is possible under the electoral system for his Party to take such action that it would be impossible for him to secure re-election to the House of Commons.  If that country had the system that we are now asked to abandon, it could be left to the electorate in his constituency of Bournemouth to register an opinion as to whether that Member was right or wrong in the views he expressed and the action he took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the North of Ireland we find that, there again, there is a fellow Irishman, a member of that Legislature, who expressed views that differed from his Party and his Government and he, likewise, has been subjected to complete abandonment and a situation created where it would be impossible for him to secure re-election. At any rate, the pros and cons of <Col N="1762" /> these controversies are not resolved by the ordinary people.  They are resolved by the Party bosses.  These incidents support the claim we make that the single-member constituency and the non-transferable vote will lead to &ldquo;bossism&rdquo; and dictatorial control over members of Parliament, a control which cannot be exercised under the more democratic system of election by proportional representation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance travelled over a wide field.  He used some expressions of opinion, adumbrated during the course of the debate by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Norton, for the purpose of lecturing us on the various types of government there are in the world.  He attempted to adduce that some of our economic ills flow from the fact that Governments here, since we attained self-government, had not used P.R. effectively.  He cited particular examples.  He challenged me to reply justifying the action of the inter-Party Government in selling the Constellation aircraft on their accession to office in 1948.</P>
    <P>The answer I shall make is that the Government at the time assessed different priorities as compared with the Government that preceded them. They felt the first needs of the people were houses, hospitals, sanatoria, better services in regard to health, land reclamation and so on.  When all these things had been attended to, then it might be possible to look at the more expensive, but less lucrative and less beneficial idealistic priorities which found favour with the previous Government.  That is why the inter-Party Government at the time took that action.</P>
    <P>All this is, of course, quite unrelated to the system of election.  It must be agreed that the Party now in office secured longer terms in office and greater majorities than any other Party in the State and they cannot claim that they were hampered during all those years because of a system of election which their own Taoiseach had written into his own Constitution as recently as 1937.  It is rather late in the day to try to pass off the failures to implement policy as being due to the system <Col N="1763" /> of election.  Surely, if that were true, the system of election would have been adverted to when the people were called upon to elect a Government on the basis of policy and on the basis of the economic situation prevailing.</P>
    <P>On no single occasion in the course of the last general election did the Party now in office say that, given a majority, they would initiate all this controversy at a time when the people expect them to apply all their energies to solving the problems affecting the country generally.  The introduction of this controversial measure has disrupted the business of this House.  It has disrupted the attention of the people.  It involves considerable expense, expense that could have been saved and the savings devoted to bringing about an improvement in economic conditions generally.</P>
    <P>We are upbraided for not permitting this issue to go to the people with the utmost despatch, as if this were something upon which there was a time limit, as if an amendment of the constitution were something that should be treated lightly, something that must be got out of the way as quickly as possible.  When this proposal was first mooted, the country was shocked by the announcement that it was proposed to put this issue in front of the people at this stage.  It is a serious matter.  It is a matter which this House, representing the people, should examine home in all its facets. It is a matter in relation to which every opportunity should be given to our people to learn the true value of the system they have&mdash;the system, as the Taoiseach says, they know so well, the system that has worked so well and for which they should be so thankful.</P>
    <P>Rather than permit the people to take a leap in the dark and, by doing so, impose on this part of our country the iniquities and injustices that operate in Northern Ireland and in Britain under the system of election our Government are now asking the people to adopt, we felt that all the disadvantages involved in the proposed change should be brought home <Col N="1764" /> clearly to the entire electorate before they went into the polling booths to register their opinion.</P>
    <P>It is particularly regrettable that the people will not be permitted to give their opinion on this issue as a separate issue, divorced from all other issues.  The Constitution provides that, in relation to a particular issue put before the people, that issue should not be confused with any other issue.  In framing the Constitution, the Taoiseach was careful of the necessity to divorce any constitutional change from any other issue.  Despite that lip service paid to that principle in the Constitution, we are now told that the people will have, on the same day, in the same polling booth, and possibly in the same ballot box, to register their opinion as to the identity of the individual who will occupy the position of President.</P>
    <P>A large volume of opinion in the country is resentful of that and resentful of the fact that important personalities are being thrown into the issue on the side of the referendum, the results of which will operate not alone for the lifetime of whatever President may be elected, but for the lifetime of the youngest among us today.  It is in that atmosphere that the people will be given an opportunity of registering their opinion.  They will not unfortunately be given an opportunity of calmly and deliberately examining what is really contained in this proposal presented to them by the Government.</P>
    <P>We resent the allegation that the Opposition are delaying the decision of the people on this matter.  The Government say they are anxious that the will of the people should prevail.  It is of vital importance that, before the will of the people prevails, the people should be informed.  We have been told that every forum has been provided, every opportunity availed of to bring home to the people what is involved in this issue.  Yet, when the Government Party were challenged to appear in the main forum of our capital city, namely, in the Mansion House, to meet members of the Opposition in open debate, they declined the challenge.  Why?  They <Col N="1765" /> declined because they dared not stand before the electorate in the city of Dublin in open debate with members of the Opposition in defence of the action they are taking in steamrolling this through this House.  There were other occasions in which the opportunity for public debate was stifled because the Government Party were not happy about the case they would be compelled to make before an intelligent audience.  We have no apology to offer for having availed of every moment here to examine home all that is implied in this proposal.</P>
    <P>This matter has been re-submitted to the Dáil because the Upper House rejected the Government's proposal.  I am aware that we are not permitted to refer to personalities in the Seanad, or to criticise the decisions of the Upper House, but we respect the volume of public opinion which is represented in that Chamber just as we respect the volume of opinion represented in the Dáil.  We can claim that in the Seanad there are individuals who are very learned people, people who represent spheres of higher education and who, no doubt, gave grave consideration to this measure. Despite the fact that the Government were never before defeated in the Seanad on any other issue, they rejected this Bill.  We must take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that this is something which the House should not adopt, that an amendment of the Constitution should be submitted to a commission. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance referred to commissions in general and described them as &ldquo;an easy way out.&rdquo;  I wondered if I were hearing correctly, because I sat on the opposite benches when a thundering Fianna Fáil Opposition demanded, day in and day out, that a commission be set up to deal with the costings of the production of a gallon of milk.  That would suggest that Fianna Fáil had some faith in commissions set up by this House.</P>
    <P>We have had commissions on many subjects.  We have even had commissions on electoral reform, and it is not long since the Government bowed to public opinion which was expressed in <Col N="1766" /> that respect in relation to election to the Seanad.  That was certainly something to which the Government had to hearken and they set up a commission, but, mind you, it was not empowered to examine the position in relation to Senators nominated by the Taoiseach. It was confined to Senators nominated by outside bodies.  At any rate, the commission sat but its establishment was in response to public demand.</P>
    <P>We on this side assert and repeat that there was no public demand whatever for what the Government are now doing.  I do not accept that commissions are set up by any Government merely as an easy way out.  They are set up because the problems to be examined are complex, and because we have, within our society, experts in various walks of life who are competent to sit down and examine in detail all that is involved in the problem presented to them.  Here is something that is fundamental to the entire future of our country and we say it is something that should not be rushed, something which no Party should steamroll through the Dáil, but which they should think over well and send to a competent commission for examination and report.  In this issue, we are asking the people to abandon the system they have enjoyed for 38 years and to adopt merely one alternative, an alternative that we see operating unjustly and unfairly within our own shores in Northern Ireland, as if there were no other alternative.</P>
    <P>We again refer to the fact that the first Constitution enshrined a form of P.R. as the most suitable for this country and, having had experience from 1922 to 1937, the Taoiseach, in the prime of his life, presented a new Constitution to the country and enshrined a particular form of P.R. in that new Constitution.  We are told by the Minister for External Affairs that he, in fact, thought otherwise at that time, that he held other views, but that he was afraid the Constitution would not be passed, if such a fundamental matter as a change in the system of election were included in it at that time.</P>
    <P>We know that having secured the passage of the Constitution, there were <Col N="1767" /> several years after its enactment when, by legislation here in the House, the system of election could have been changed without a referendum.  We made an effort to discover what occurred to change so radically the Taoiseach's mind&mdash;as he is solely responsible for the presentation of this Bill at this time&mdash;and we were told it was the fact that he was displaced in office in 1948.  That is a political statement. The Taoiseach and others may say that there is something vile or something retrograde in what the people did in electing an inter-Party Government, but that is a political issue.  It is not an issue to be resolved by changing the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We could advert to countries that have succeeded admirably under P.R. and that annihilates any contention that there is any economic benefit to be achieved merely by changing the system of election.  Even in Britain&mdash; and we know that the system of election is a vested interest there&mdash;there has been considerable complaint about the operation of Parliament.  Sir Winston Churchill had this to say&mdash;and I ask those Deputies who think there is some great wand that will be waved merely by a change in the system of election which will secure for the country some great economic benefits to listen&mdash;about the situation in Britain:</P>
    <P>We have certainly reached a parliamentary deadlock or stalemate differing in its character from any in living experience.  It is not true that the Liberal Party here, or, what is of far more importance, the Liberal Party in the country, can by simply throwing its weight on to one side or the other, determine the issue. Any step that was taken as a mere bargain or deal might not only be difficult to implement, but might well produce unfavourable reactions for those concerned.  The nation might deeply resent the feeling that its fortunes had been bartered about without regard to principle by a handful of politicians no matter what party they come from, and that its vital interests were but a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> We know, of course, what could occur under the system the Government would have our people adopt. We know that if we, on the Opposition side, are to preserve any hope of securing election to this House, we have been advised to go behind closed doors and engage in a type of intrigue which this country never knew before, where the Parties or the Party bosses and the candidates come together and barter among themselves: &ldquo;You take that pocket borough and I shall take this; you dissuade your people from putting forward candidates to contest your area, because if you do not, I shall not reciprocate in my area.&rdquo;  That is what we are told to do because it is conceded by the Government Party that where they are opposed by more than one candidate, without having the transferable vote, the Government would get the seat.  That is admitted and we are told that the solution to that problem is to engage in this back-room intrigue.</P>
    <P>Surely it is an important matter that where three or four candidates go forward in a single-member constituency, as would happen if the people vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this referendum, the situation could arise&mdash;and it has arisen often where the system operates which we are now being asked to adopt&mdash; that one candidate would get 5,000 votes, another candidate would get 4,000 votes and a third would get 3,500 votes, that there would be only the one count and that the candidate with the 5,000 votes would be elected and the other 7,500 votes would be discarded as if the voters had no second preferences.  The Taoiseach simplifies that and asks: &ldquo;Why should we accept it that the man or woman who got 4,000 votes was preferred by the people to the man with 3,500 votes, rather than the man elected at the top of the poll?&rdquo;  That is why proportional representation gave the people the opportunity, in their lower preferences, of exercising that opinion among Parties and candidates.</P>
    <P>That is one of the most beneficial results of P.R.  In the previous debate here I cited examples with which I shall not weary the House now, but we do know how effectively the people <Col N="1769" /> used P.R. and expressed their desire to record more than one choice among the candidates presented to them for election.  There are people who might like to see a smaller constituency.  I was amazed today to hear Deputy Faulkner say that Deputies opposing the Government on this issue were doing it for Party and individual advantages. There is not a Deputy who would not like to have a constituency embracing one-third of the area that he has to cover at present, or one-fourth, or one-fifth, as the case might be. There is not a Deputy who would not have a better sense of achievement from having less people to look after and from having a smaller area to cover and, incidentally, less expense to incur.  It cannot be alleged that any Deputy who spoke here on behalf of multi-member constituencies was acting in any selfish fashion.</P>
    <P>The advantages to the Deputy elected under the straight vote system will be readily recognised.  We know the advantages enjoyed in Britain, where one-half of the members of the House of Commons reside in the City of London.  Certainly under that system they have nothing to complain about, a system that will re-elect them; they need not go near their constituencies because they have succeeded in getting into favour with the Party bosses.  In that country, and in the other countries where the system operates, the safe seat develops.  It is alleged, truthfully, that it may not exist here now but if it does not exist that is a tribute to P.R. because that is one of the greatest evils that could come upon any country. What do we find?  We find that since proportional representation was jettisoned in the North of Ireland, there was a vast increase in the number of uncontested seats.  In 1921, when they had P.R., every single seat was contested and the highest number of uncontested seats in 1925 was eight. They changed the system of election and in the first election subsequent to the change nobody could be got to contest a seat against the Unionists in 22 constituencies.  Since that time six or seven elections have been held and on many occasions no fewer than 20 seats were uncontested.</P>
    <P>Is the Government hoping to create <Col N="1770" /> a situation here where they will secure the uncontested return of a number of their outgoing Deputies?  If that is their hope they are doomed to disappointment, should the people be foolish enough to adopt the system that would make that possible.  That would be fought by the Opposition in the same spirit as they are opposing the proposal to create the situation that would make it possible.</P>
    <P>We are told that all the problems that exist in the North are attributable to the gerrymandering which has been perpetrated there.  We know that they gerrymander in the North but when Mr. Gallagher was writing his book <i>The Invisible Island</i>, he adverted to the fact that the system of election was also contributing to that.  Others have also adverted to it and have proved that it was the amalgam of gerrymandering and the system of election that has made it possible for those in control to treat the minorities as they are treated in that area.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister speak here recently and he referred to the fact that proportional representation led to a multiplicity of small Parties.  He said that there were several small Parties in Opposition in this House.  I do not know what he would call a few, or much, or several, but of course everybody realises that we have not got several small Parties in this House.  If he wanted to look around to find some Parliament where there were several small Parties in Opposition he would not have far to go because he would find that situation in Stormont, under the system we are told would lead to a situation where there would be only two Parties in existence.</P>
    <P>There are nine recognised Parties in Stormont to-day, despite the fact that they have not had proportional representation since 1925.  Surely that disposes of the argument that proportional representation is responsible for the creation of a number of small Parties and that, obversely, the straight vote system&mdash;the British system&mdash;leads to two major Parties and the elimination of all the smaller groups?  At any rate, there is a considerable difference of opinion among Ministers as to the <Col N="1771" /> consequences of the enactment of this change in the Constitution, if it should be effected.  Every kind of guess is being advanced as to what the consequences would be.  Surely before a Government would embark on such a serious step, or ask the people to adopt such a change, they would have been in a position to assess the consequences of that step?</P>
    <P>We know, of course, that an assessment has been made and we can fairly well guess the reasons why this is being done at this particular time.  But we do urge on the Government that they have missed an opportunity of presenting this whole matter to an impartial commission.  They have missed an opportunity, without losing face, of realistically examining all that is involved and letting that commission present a report.  The report might recommend a system different from the one we are now exercising, but which also might be different from the system which the Government are presenting to the people as the only alternative to the system we have operated so effectively and for so long.</P>
    <P>We are informed that the Government are desirous of giving the people every opportunity of examining all that is involved and we have had a slight example of what life would be like if the Opposition, and the minority groups, were squeezed out of existence by a change in the electoral system. We saw last week that a motion tabled in the Seanad, which referred to the provision of information for the public on this issue, was regarded so contemptuously by the Government that for the first time in the history of this State no Minister was sent to the Seanad to sit in and listen to the discussion. That is indicative of the contempt which members of the Government have for the provision of information to the public.  I am not saying whether there was much sense in that motion or not, but it was intended to convey more information to the public about the pros and cons of this issue.  The least that could have been done was to have honoured that House with the presence of somebody who <Col N="1772" /> would represent the Government, who would listen to what was said and reply to it.</P>

      <P>One would think from all the allegations made against the system of proportional representation that it was something the Government were abandoning, whereas they are abandoning it at the moment only in regard to elections to the Dáil.  It is being retained for the election of a President for very sound, sensible reasons.  When Deputies get up to ascribe all these evils to the system of proportional representation, will they please remember that the Government are abandoning proportional representation at the moment only in relation to elections to the Dáil, that they will have to defend the retention of proportional representation for the election of a President and, furthermore, that they have not yet indicated what their policy is in relation to the future of local elections?</P>
      <P>It is indeed significant that no denial has been made that the Government&mdash; if the people adopt the alternative system which is presented to them&mdash; will steamroll through the Dáil a simple measure introducing a similar system of election in local authority elections.  It would not be a popular thing for them to make such an announcement at this stage, and, if it were not the Government's intention to do that, it would be a very easy matter for somebody to say there is no reason why the system of voting in local authorities should be changed also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous for Deputies to repeat that many of the troubles which came upon countries in Europe came upon them solely because of the system of election they had.  Germany is often <Col N="1773" /> referred to; yet we know that in its worst days, when the Nazi tyranny was crushing down the German people and seeking to spread its hateful policy and hateful dogma throughout the world, Herman Goering is on record as having said it would be a desirable thing if Germany adopted the British system of election because, if it did, the Nazis would occupy every seat in the Reichstag.  There was another assessment of what could happen if the people adopt the system of election they are now told it is in their interest to adopt.</P>
    <P>We are informed that under proportional representation violent swings in policy are possible.  Anyone who examines the matter, for even a short time, must realise that more violent changes of policy, as well as more frequent changes of Government, have occurred in Britain than we have had during the period in which we have had self-government.  It is to the credit of our electoral system that we have had this type of change over from one Party to another without disrupting the country in the violent changes of policy which other countries have experienced, to their detriment.</P>
    <P>The frequency of elections is another matter.  There is no doubt that the people at large, particularly people in business, resent the disruption of business, the general expense and uneasiness that attends the holding of a general election.  It would be an attractive thing to say to the people that if there were a change in the system of election, and if there were a very strong Government elected&mdash;a single Party Government&mdash;we would not have the frequency of elections which we would have under an inter-Party Government.  Yet, the average life of Fianna Fáil Governments was only two and a half years, and the average life of the two inter-Party Governments was longer.  That, therefore, disposes of that argument.</P>
    <P>I could not follow Deputy Bartley today.  He was mystifying in his reference to conditions that prevail under proportional representation.  He referred to wars, and a war that was instituted by the previous Government <Col N="1774" /> and carried on in the district courts.  It was a mysterious statement and one on which some speaker of his Party following him might throw some light indicating what they had to say in criticism of anything that occurred in that respect in recent years.  If they could then relate that to the system of election, we could possibly know what was in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind when he made that statement.</P>
    <P>He referred also to a priority of opinion in the country in relation to the change in the electoral system and the order in which he placed them was: the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, the Fianna Fáil cumainn and Parliament. Of course, that was the order in which the Taoiseach had treated the priorities of public opinion when he was announcing his intention in this regard.  Dáil Éireann came third in the priority.</P>
    <P>One other factor in relation to the change in the electoral system, if it is effected, which is of considerable importance, is that the Dáil would not get a better type of Deputy under the single non-transferable vote system for this reason: The area of the constituency is reduced and the Deputy elected in a small area, say, with one large town, would find that he was continually meeting the same people. Among them, there may be some organisation which wanted something done.  It may be a fantastic idea but all he would have to do to retain his popularity would be to row in behind this proposal and every six months stand up here and say something about it.  In that way, he would be proving to his constituents that he was doing their work and looking after their interests.</P>
    <P>At the moment, you have a constituency which quite often in the rural parts extends over a fair stretch of country, 70 or 80 miles.  Deputies are obliged to take into consideration the people who live in that constituency. They may vary in their walks of life or in their attitude to various problems. Therefore, the Deputy is better informed in relation to general matters. In the single-member constituency one finds that, in the first place, the Parties would be encouraged to select a candidate from an urban area with <Col N="1775" /> a concentration of votes which would mean the diminution, if not the annihilation, of agricultural representation in this House.  At any rate the great objection to this is that if the people in that constituency elected a Deputy who had failed to come up to their requirements, they would be saddled with that Deputy, and with that Deputy only, for the entire five-year period or for whatever was the life of that Government.  At the moment, if a Deputy is <i>hors de combate</i>, if a Deputy is remiss, there are two, three or four other Deputies there.  If, as is alleged, there is some competition among Deputies which results in increased work for them, that is their own fault, not the fault of the system. Under the present system, when Deputies speak on Estimates or on various Bills presented to the Dáil, they have a more comprehensive outlook towards the provisions in the Bill or whatever measure is before them than they would have if they were restricted to a small bit of country and to a limited number of people.</P>
    <P>No doubt the same applies in the cities, with which I am not familiar, but if there is not a great area involved, at least there are wider differences of opinion and consequently when a number of Deputies are elected from a large area of the city, they can be regarded as representing a cross-section. If they are elected from a minute part of a city, all they need do is apply themselves to local problems so that the Dáil would be reduced almost to a local authority.</P>
    <P>It would be more beneficial to the future of the country if the Deputies elected had to give consideration to a wider range of subjects and to a greater number of people than they would have under the new system.  It would be possible under the system the Government are recommending to the people to secure the election of a very powerful Government from a minority of the votes cast.  As long as the transferable vote was there it operated as a liaison between Parties to bring home to them the desires of the ordinary elector.  Deputies were fortified in their policies and in their <Col N="1776" /> attitude by being aware of the feelings of the electorate as expressed in the preferences on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the straight vote system, where several Deputies could be elected from a minority of the votes cast in each constituency would mean that when the new Dáil met, it would be authorised to elect a strong Government representing only a minority of the votes cast.  That could create a very disturbing situation for whatever Government was in office and that is quite apart from the fact that we would be denying to substantial minorities the representation which would give them some hope of advancement.  No matter how we may differ in our views, we must admit it is a legitimate ambition for a Party to want to advance and, as has been said by Deputies on the opposite side, eventually to attain that progress which would give them a mandate to take over government.</P>
    <P>If we advise the people to enact an electoral system that will make it impossible for such people to take their seats in this Dáil, surely, apart from the consequences in relation to public confidence, we would be doing an extremely unjust thing.  We have accepted down through the years that these people have the right to express their opinions.  We should not deny them the right to express them in the House because this is the forum of the nation.  If we did that, it could reap an unwelcome whirlwind for some Government in the years to come.  That was the first thing which animated this Party in taking their decision to oppose this proposal and to recommend to the people that they should reject it.  We felt it was unfair and unjust to the minorities and could only result in feelings of frustration that could very well show themselves in undesirable ways.</P>
    <P>The attention that has been devoted to this measure since it was first introduced has been worth while.  We still feel that this is an opportunity to impress upon the people&mdash;it has been said that the members of this House are to a very great extent authorities on the subject&mdash;that they should not at this stage lightly jettison a democratic <Col N="1777" /> right, something they have enjoyed for many years, something they have used effectively and something which the Taoiseach said they should be thankful for having.  It is particularly undesirable that we should have to discuss this matter at a time when so many other problems are crying out for resolution, when we should be applying our time and energies towards bringing about that improvement in the economic life of our country which the people desire.</P>
    <P>It is in that atmosphere we regret the Government could not see its way to adopt the amendment tabled by Deputies Costello and Mulcahy asking that a commission be set up to examine the pros and cons.  It is not a matter which is of extreme urgency and if the people do not weigh the pros and cons and if they take a decision lightly, they may very well regret it.  We feel that all that has been said has been necessary and that it would be well for the Government to accept the realistic amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party.  They do not intend to do so and seemingly insist on their powers as a strong Government to steamroll any measure they want through this Dáil, irrespective of the consequences.</P>

I think that in rejecting the Bill, Seanad Éireann acted wisely. A member of Dáil Éireann must ask himself what were the reasons which prompted Seanad Éireann to reject this measure.</P>

      <P>It was simply because they felt it was not in the best interests of the country.  That is why the Dáil is given an opportunity of dealing with the Taoiseach's motion asking this House to assume that the <Col N="1778" /> Dáil and Seanad have passed this Bill. To that, an amendment has been moved by Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy.  It is a reasonable, common-sense amendment and one which, in the opinion of the common-sense people throughout the country, the Government ought not to reject.</P>
      <P>Our present electoral system could last for the lifetime of this Dáil.  Why can this matter not be decided in a calm atmosphere by a joint committee of Dáil and Seanad, as indicated in this amendment?  We all know the motive behind the rushing through of this legislation.  The Fianna Fáil Party know that this could not be attempted without having the present Taoiseach as a medium to spellbind the people into voting for this proposal. We have heard of strange people and strange happenings, but the Taoiseach seems to have an art not possessed by anyone else in Fianna Fáil, that is, the great art of spellbinding the electorate. It is because they want to use this great national spellbinder on the occasion of the referendum that they want to have this decided on the same day as the Presidential election.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate yesterday, we had an observation from Deputy Dr. Browne that an important issue of this kind should be decided on its own, apart from any Presidential election.  He went on to suggest that if Deputy MacEoin withdrew his candidature for the Presidency, there might be a different result.</P>

      <P>I agree, Sir, but I felt that as Deputy Dr. Browne dealt with the matter yesterday, at least some observations ought to be made, particularly in view of the fact that should this amendment be rejected, presumably this issue will be put to the people and the referendum and the Presidential election will be held on the one day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what way the Fianna Fáil Party may endeavour to paint this in the country, we all know that it is being done with one intention: to give a lasting reign to the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1779" /> Party.  The Fianna Fáil Party know quite well that as a result of their activities over the past two and a half years, in an election under P.R., the writing would be on the wall for them. If at this moment the Taoiseach decided to ask the President for a dissolution, I venture to say that, under P.R., the Fianna Fáil Party would be completely wiped out of the political life of this country.</P>
    <P>The test of the matter is that in the last general election&mdash;no matter what the Minister for External Affairs may say about promises prior to an election&mdash;Fianna Fáil promised everything a Party could promise, but there was no mention about a change in the electoral system.  That was something they had up their sleeves.  If the Minister for External Affairs is concerned about the proper type of government for the people and if he feels that each Party should place its policy before the electorate in advance of each general election, I should like to ask him why there was no mention of P.R. by the Fianna Fáil Party in the last general election.  How is it that prior to the last general election the electoral system was all right? The electoral system was all right until the time came for the Taoiseach to get out of politics.  Then I presume there was panic within the Party.  If the old spellbinder was eliminated from the Party, there would be nobody else to perform.  The only way in which the spellbinder could be replaced would be by altering the present system of election and by rigging and gerrymandering the constituencies.</P>
    <P>The principal motive behind this Bill is to bring about a state of affairs here whereby the electorate will be prevented from changing the Government. It is all very fine to say that after a number of years there can be changes of Government, that public opinion will alter, that no matter how many candidates you put into the field, you will have results similar to those under P.R. I feel you will not.  If P.R. goes, you will have in this country a state of affairs similar to that which exists at present in the Six Counties.  Whatever Government is elected in the general <Col N="1780" /> election which follows the abolition of P.R., that Government will be in office for very many years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that what he would like to see in this country is a strong Government and a strong Opposition.  If P.R. is abolished, what you will have here is the Government Party, the Opposition Party and no small Parties whatever.  We are told that this is an attempt to squeeze out the Labour Party and that it is an effort to squeeze out the Farmers' Party.  We are told this is an effort to destroy the new Parties that may be on the horizon.  We are told by a Minister that after the next election even Fine Gael will be wiped out.  I put it to the House that that is exactly the aim of the Government.  They have now reached a stage of saturation in drunkenness with power and authority. The strange thing about our people is that the harder and firmer the Government put their heel on their heads, the better the Irish people like it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  This situation would not be tolerated in any other civilised country. Fianna Fáil have now come to the conclusion that they will lose the referendum and that P.R. will not be abolished.  I am convinced that when the electorate are asked to change the system, to surrender their right, to give up the measure of freedom they possess and which has brought stability to the country, they will use their own wise judgment and tell Fianna Fáil that they will not be deprived of their right to send whatever Party they like to Parliament or to send the candidate of their choice there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for the Taoiseach to say that what we want in the future is stability.  Not so long ago, the Taoiseach said in this House that he detested the men opposite him.  That is on the records of the House.  He went further and said he detested and hated inter-Party and coalition Governments. What is wrong with coalitions?  If the people want that type of Government, are they not entitled to it?  If they do not want it, they are entitled to the <Col N="1781" /> results of any other form of government they choose.  I think it is a nice thing that the people, in accordance with the freedom we have, should be able to send whatever Party they like to Parliament and if they want to vote for an intelligent man who will look after their interests and who will have a good progressive policy, they are entitled to choose him.  If they want a dud, a man who says nothing and does nothing, they are entitled to choose him under the present electoral laws.  I think that is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>It is extremely dangerous to restrict the right of the voters.  It is wrong to deprive Parties of the right to come into this House; it is wrong that an effort should be made by Fianna Fáil to prevent the people from sending whom they like to Parliament, but the most serious part of this legislation is the rigging of constituencies.  Let no member think that there will be anything other than rigging of constituencies. There will be gerrymandering that would teach lessons in gerrymandering to the people in the Six Counties.  If we are to judge by the conduct of Fianna Fáil in the past 20 years, what else could we expect but gerrymandering?</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, we are told that three Deputies representing the Government, three Deputies representing the Opposition with a High Court or Supreme Court Judge as chairman, will form the Constituency Commission. If they are not unanimous, or if they disagree, the decision will be left entirely in the hands of the High Court or Supreme Court judge who will be appointed by the President.  I fear that is the most dangerous, damaging and serious part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is true that in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium, P.R. exists and works.  It would be interesting to know what argument the Taoiseach has when he goes on to say that for the future we want stability and strong government. Have we not had stable government here in the past?  If you go back where you have the single transferable vote, as you have in England, and if <Col N="1782" /> you take the period from 1922 to the present day you find that there have been nine prime ministers, nine different Governments there.</P>
    <P>They have had Lloyd George as Prime Minister, Bonar Law, Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, Sir Anthony Eden and Mr. Macmillan.  We have had only three since 1922, Mr. Cosgrave, Mr. de Valera and Mr. Costello.  That entirely destroys any argument the Taoiseach has in favour of the abolition of P.R.</P>
    <P>P.R. has worked well here and has given fair representation to all sections of the community.  It has not debarred people of different religious denominations from this House; it has not debarred Independents or any small Party that has arisen in recent years from coming here if they wanted to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government in their efforts to obtain power and authority have already made an attack on P.R.  In 1935, Fianna Fáil endeavoured to slash P.R. by increasing the number of three seat constituencies from six to 22. Under the 1923 Electoral Act, there were one nine-member constituency, three eight-member constituencies, five seven-member constituencies, nine five-member constituencies, four four-member constituencies and six three-member constituencies.  There was a revision of constituencies in 1935 when the first attack was made on P.R. and, as a result of the changes made since then, we now have nine five-member constituencies, nine four-member constituencies and 22 three-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil increased the number of three-member constituencies to 22 because they wanted to set up in those constituencies conditions under which, through graft and intrigue and organisation and any other method, they could have two seats out of the three in each of the 22 constituencies.  That worked to some extent.  Now, they are endeavouring to take it a step further and to have the single-member constituency.</P>
    <P>I feel that the single-member constituency, while it may be a small constituency <Col N="1783" /> to govern, will not send to this House the representative who will come with the wishes of the majority of the people.  It will be the representative who will be sent here against the wishes of the majority of the people.  That is where I think the proposed system is very bad, unreasonable and will not work too well in this country.  It is one which I feel will be rejected by the electorate when the opportunity presents itself next month.</P>
    <P>I should like, if I may, to ask the Government: why all the immediate anxiety about the future of this country and about depriving the people of the right to have further Coalition Governments, if they so desire?  Is it not a fact that Coalition Governments have been more satisfactory in this country and have given better government than the strong Fianna Fáil Government? One might say that that is a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>I feel that what the people of this country want is not strong government but efficient and good government. There is a great difference between what one may term a strong Government and an efficient and good Government. From 1932 to 1948 we had an uninterrupted term of office by the Fianna Fáil Party.  At the end of that long term of office from 1932 to 1948, there were fewer cattle, fewer sheep and fewer pigs in this country than ever before since the days of the Famine.  Fewer people were at work. Our exports had vanished.  The economic position of the country was in complete chaos until the change of Government came about in 1948. Were it not that P.R. gave the electors the right to send to Parliament the various Parties which comprised the 1948-51 Government, the country would probably be in such a state of economic depression now that it would be a land of very old and very young people.</P>
    <P>The electoral system in this country that will enable the leaders of political Parties to come together and form a Government is something of which we should be proud.  I should like to ask the Minister for External Affairs or any member of the present Government <Col N="1784" /> why the law should prevent the leaders of any small Parties from coming together after any general election and forming a Government, if it is in accordance with the wishes of the people of this country?</P>

      <P>If it is in accordance with the wishes of the people, what is wrong?  Is there any difference between forming a Government after the election and proceeding with the work or going out to the people before an election, making promises and, after being elected the Government, breaking all the promises and doing the very opposite of what they were elected to do?  Where is the difference?  I do not see where the difference exists.  That is where I can see a great danger.</P>
      <P>Take a Party such as the Labour Party.  If there is nobody in this House to speak for organised Labour, what will the position be?  Take a constituency with 20,000 working-class people.  If, for that constituency, a Fianna Fáil candidate is returned and if, as the Fianna Fáil Government have done in the past, they decide to introduce a system of wages standstill, it is the height of insanity to try to paint the picture for the labouring man that the Deputy sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches and representing his constituency and representing him will be opposed to a wages standstill in his area.</P>
      <P>Who will air the grievances in this House of the thousands voting against the man who is elected, if he is a Fianna Fáil man, as was quoted to me this morning?  There is really only one Teachta Dála in this House and he is the Taoiseach.  He speaks for all.  To say there are 77 or 78, or whatever the number may be, is all right so far as figures are concerned but there is really only one Teachta Dála in this House.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out that, unfortunately, the Minister for Lands happens to be in a different <Col N="1787" /> position from that of the great majority of his own Party.  The point has been made in this debate more than once that if proportional representation is abolished you will get a better type of Deputy.  How does that arise?  The electorate will not have a choice under the straight vote system.  At present, if the electorate want to elect a Fianna Fáil Deputy they can do so but there are Fianna Fáil supporters who have a kind regard for Labour and Fine Gael candidates and they give them their second and third preferences, as has happened at every general election. I got 5,000 Fianna Fáil votes in my constituency.  There is a large number of people in every constituency who vote for the man, not for the Party or the policy.</P>
      <P>If the people are deprived of a choice of candidates, in many instances they will have to vote for a man they do not know or a man who may be forced upon them by the Party organisation. It is depriving the electorate of their democratic right to send whom they like to Parliament to represent them. If the elector has not a choice of candidates, he cannot be expected to vote wisely or to elect the best man on the ballot paper.  The most dangerous thing we could do is to interfere with the system of election to this House. A change in the Constitution ought to be viewed by the electorate in the gravest possible sense.  The electorate should endeavour to divorce this great national issue from any political tie-up or issue.  One way by which that could be done would be to comply with the terms of the amendment in the names of Deputies Costello and Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>Down through the years Fianna Fáil have been the great Party and the great Government for commissions, plans and schemes.</P>

      <P>The office of every Fianna Fáil Minister is bulging with plans and schemes surrounded with dust and covered with cobwebs. The shelves are cracking under the <Col N="1788" /> weight of plans and schemes.  No action is taken in regard to them.  The Minister for Lands may be inclined to sneer but it is quite true to say that when the inter-Party Government took office in 1948 they found plenty of plans and plenty of schemes and plenty of files waiting there.  It would be wrong to deny Fianna Fáil a certain amount of credit that is due to them. However, all these plans were covered with dust and surrounded with cobwebs and none of them was put into action.  There were recommendations from commissions and bodies set up by this House to report on various economic problems affecting the nation.  They were all lying there, tied up and put away because they had served their purpose.</P>
      <P>The very Party that are so fond of setting up advisory bodies and commissions to investigate this, that and the other thing, and to decide issues of national importance, refuse on this occasion to set up a commission of representatives of all Parties in this House and in the Seanad to investigate the very greatest issue of national importance. The best day's work ever done for this country was the rejection of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill by the Seanad.  Senators who were not entirely tied to the Fianna Fáil Party voted against the measure and advised the country to reject what they termed &ldquo;this dangerous proposal&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the Fianna Fáil Party's refusal to set up a committee to consider this issue calmly and to report on it is not understood in the country <Col N="1789" /> because the Fianna Fáil Party have been asking for co-operation and suggestions. When co-operation is offered by every other Party and when suggestions are made to have the matter discussed around the conference table, where it can be considered in an atmosphere of commonsense and business, the Taoiseach comes into the <Col N="1790" /> House with his team behind him, for the purpose of bulldozing this legislation through.</P>

      <P>The total expended in the various categories does not correspond with the amount expended under the Acts as it is affected by the extent to which stocks of capital stores are run down. The amounts have therefore been expressed as percentages of the total cost of telephone capital works in each year.</P>
