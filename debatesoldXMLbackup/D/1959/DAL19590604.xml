      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing law, there is a special restriction on the building of bridges over the Shannon in that a work may not be executed if it constitutes an interference with any right including a right of navigation.  This means that in any case where a bridge over the Shannon with an opening span requires reconstruction, the new bridge must also contain an opening span, even though a fixed bridge with sufficient clearance would satisfy navigation requirements.  Bridges with opening spans are much more costly to build and maintain and it has been estimated that the total additional initial cost for providing opening spans for a number of Shannon bridges which are likely to require reconstruction by local authorities in the immediate future is at least £100,000.  No one would grudge the extra cost if genuine navigation interests were involved, but in fact the Shannon is already limited to navigation by fixed bridges at its entrance and by narrow locks with high sills.  Most of the so-called &ldquo;opening&rdquo; spans have been in effect closed for very many years, yet the navigation using the river has experienced no difficulty in passing under <Col N="960" /> them.  The Bill, therefore, proposes to remove the legal restriction I have mentioned and to enable the merits of an opening versus a fixed span to be considered in each case.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Bill does not introduce any new principle in the matter of navigation rights.  It was at one time assumed that the bridge order procedure under Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1946, enabled a bridge to be constructed even if it involved a curtailment of navigation rights.  The original intention of subsection (1) of Section 40 of the Local Government Act, 1955, was to put this beyond doubt.  After the section had been opposed by some Deputies, the then Government agreed as a compromise to introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage in the Dáil to exclude the River Shannon from the scope of the subsection.</P>
    <P>The local bodies concerned have protested repeatedly against the restriction thus imposed on the reconstruction of the Shannon bridges. They are acutely aware of the extra cost involved, and they are also aware of the actual facts regarding navigation. The Government are concerned to ensure that the defective opening span will be replaced by new spans as early as possible, and they consider that the legal position should be remedied so that money, time and effort will not be wasted.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that every consideration will not be given to rights of navigation.  The procedure to be followed is laid down by the Local Government Act, 1946, as amended. The consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is the Minister chiefly concerned with navigation interests, is required to any bridge order made, and he would not agree to any unwarranted interference with navigation rights.  Furthermore, before a bridge order is made providing for the replacement of an opening span by a fixed span, a local inquiry is held at which the pros and cons are fully thrashed out in public.  I can assure the House that there will be no question of a fixed span being provided at a site when the clearance is not adequate for navigation purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> In the case of Athlone Bridge special provision is made in Section 2 of the Bill.  This is necessary because a local inquiry has already been held and there would be no point in expending the money and time involved in a further inquiry.  The evidence clearly showed that a fixed span would be adequate at this site.  Apart from the general limitations on Shannon navigation imposed by the fixed bridges at its entrance and by the locks, it appears that the existing &ldquo;opening&rdquo; span at Athlone has failed to open since 1942, yet navigation including C.I.E. launches can pass under it.  A new fixed span will afford the same clearance.  I may mention that the public bodies concerned have made repeated representations to that effect since the Athlone Bridge Order, 1956, was made.  That Order had to provide for an opening span because of a proviso inserted in Section 40 of the Local Government Act, 1955.  The Bill therefore proposes to amend the 1956 Order by providing for a fixed span instead of an opening span.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to stress the urgency of the Bill.  Severe weight restrictions have been imposed in the case of some of the Shannon bridges and reconstruction work is urgently necessary.  The enactment of this Bill will enable work to proceed at once on the design and construction of a relatively simple new span at Athlone, and will enable the necessary steps to be taken for the provision of the new permanent spans&mdash;fixed or open, as the evidence warrants&mdash;at the other sites requiring urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand this Bill, it is an enabling Bill more than a mandatory Bill.  It enables a local inquiry, when considering the question of the reconstruction and replacement of the new bridge across the Shannon, to consider whether it should be a fixed or a movable bridge. I cannot see in present circumstances anything against that.  I understood the Minister to say that the Westmeath County Council have requested that, in respect of Athlone, the facilities in this Bill be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> I should like the Minister to confirm that I am right in thinking that this Bill enables each local inquiry to consider the problem on its own merits.  I should like the Minister also to give us a list of the bridges involved across the Shannon so as to have them on the records of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPEgan" hpid="Mr. K. Egan Mr. K. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has introduced this Bill.  It will be welcomed by the various local authorities who, at the moment, are faced with the task of replacing the swivel span in respect of bridges over the River Shannon.  At the moment, Offaly County Council are engaged in that task with the bridge at Banagher. About six months ago, they engaged an engineer to prepare plans for this bridge which would under existing legislation have to be a swivel bridge. At a recent meeting of the county council, the engineer submitted the plans.  The estimated cost in this case was £85,000.  We were informed by the engineer that if this were a fixed span the cost would be only about £15,000.  Therefore, this Bill will save the Exchequer and the ratepayers a considerable amount of money.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>

    <Title>Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> This Bill is designed to supplement the income of the Road Fund to enable it to deal with two special road problems.</P>
    <P>The first of these has arisen out of the recent closing of branch railway lines.  As the House is aware, a number of these lines were found by the transport undertakings to be uneconomic; in fact, in the case of lines affected by the closing of lines in the Six Counties, it was impracticable to keep them in operation.  The resultant extra bus and lorry traffic has created urgent problems in the areas affected. The roads concerned would ultimately be dealt with under the road improvement programmes of the counties concerned, but the existing level of their road grants and the other roads requiring attention would prevent them from dealing effectively with the problem in a reasonable time.  It was decided therefore that special assistance should be given to these road authorities.</P>
    <P>The second category of problem arose where a major industrial undertaking has created a considerable increase in road traffic and given rise to a need for major road improvements on a scale which the road authority would be unable to deal with on the basis of their existing grant allocations.</P>
    <P>A review of the position of the Road Fund showed that it could not bear the extra grants involved.  The effect of previous loans and of commitments in respect of past grants involves that the present scale of Road Fund grants, approximately £5 millions, is unlikely to increase substantially in the next five years, even if the income from motor taxation continues to increase gradually.  It will be recalled that, following the Capital Fund appropriation of £500,000 in 1956/57 and the high level of grants maintained for a number of years, commitments on the Road Fund had amounted to £4.18 millions at the end of 1956/57, compared with £1.8 millions on 31st March, 1954.  It was necessary to borrow £900,000 in 1957/58 to reduce these commitments and so enable the level of Road Fund grants&mdash;at about £5 millions&mdash;to be maintained.  That <Col N="964" /> exhausted the borrowing powers of the Road Fund, and while it cut down the commitments considerably, they are still at an abnormal level&mdash;£3¼ millions on 31st March last.</P>
    <P>The Government therefore decided that the income of the Road Fund should be supplemented by special measures to enable it to assist the road authorities to deal with the two types of problem I have mentioned. The total supplement to the Fund will not exceed £2 millions, and this will be spread over a period of 5 years. Half of it will be a free grant to the Fund and half of it will be a repayable loan.</P>
    <P>Two million pounds is a very considerable sum, and it should help the road authorities to deal with the more pressing road problems arising under the two heads I have mentioned, but I would be slow to say that they can all be solved out of these funds.  For that reason grants must be strictly confined to cases which clearly come within the specified conditions.  In the case of the railway lines, the closings must be recent ones, i.e., either in the last couple of years or currently.  Similarly, the grants for public roads serving industrial undertakings must be confined to major undertakings and to acute road problems affecting them.  In regard to both the railway lines and the industrial undertakings, there is the further criterion that the road problems involved must be so substantial that they cannot be dealt with under the road authority's normal grant allocations. In the light of what I have said, it will be seen that I have had no option but to reject, with regret, quite a number of applications for grants already.</P>
    <P>I have allocated the following grants for 1959/60 to counties affected by recent and immediately prospective railway closings:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Until estimates are received for these works, I shall not be in a position to say how much is involved and what the effect will be on the total funds available.  The expenditure will in general be spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will have no hesitation in accepting the principles of the Bill and giving it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this Bill.  As usual we listened to the lamentation about money that has been spent.  The money spent has given us a road system which is the admiration of strangers coming to this country.  It may be that if any fault was to be found it would be that the road system was built at too high a standard.  If we are serious about the tourist trade something about which we may be reasonably satisfied is that we have now in this country a road system which, in so far as the <Col N="966" /> tourist trade is concerned, compares favourably probably with the road systems in any other country.  There is however a certain aspect to which regard should be had.  First, having built a very fine road system it is a matter of very great consequence that the surfaces of the existing roads should be preserved.  Secondly, having provided for the tourist requirements of this country we should not forget that in addition to tourists there is a large body of natives like ourselves who conduct their business carrying milk over the roads to the creameries, or driving cattle and sheep and farm produce on what are commonly described as county roads.  On these few matters I want to say a word.</P>
      <P>Is there any general line of policy laid down as to the extent of the expenditure that is legitimate for the easing of corners?  When this programme began it seemed a rational kind of procedure to remove dangerous corners but I see operations being carried out for the removal of corners which, so far as I can see, and in my own experience, never created any hazard in themselves although they imposed on persons approaching them some degree of caution and required them to lower the rate of speed at which they were driving their cars from that appropriate to a long, straight stretch of country road to a more moderate pace.  But if such corners existed is it necessary to undertake an expenditure of £40,000 or £50,000 to remove them, unless there is an abundance of money available which can be readily disposed of? That is a circumstance which I do not anticipate arising in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time as these immense undertakings for the easing of corners are proceeding, I get the impression that some of the trunk roads which have been constructed at considerable cost over the last ten years, are being allowed to deteriorate.  It strikes me frequently travelling these roads, as I do a great deal, that much of the expenditure on these large operations &mdash;involving excavation by machinery and the transport of large quantities of stone and materials for the raising of levels, or the removal by heavy machinery of slight bumps in the <Col N="967" /> roads&mdash;entails starving the proper maintenance of the excellent trunk roads that exist.  I should like to hear from the Minister if, in respect of the trunk roads, a due preference is required for essential works maintenance before what may be described as luxury operations are undertaken.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is this.  I understand that grants from the Road Fund are mainly related to the maintenance and development of trunk roads but there must be some relationship between the expenditure on trunk roads and the expenditure on county roads.  I think there are certain parts of the country in which the comparison between the condition of the county roads and the trunk roads is becoming so glaring that a legitimate resentment arises in the minds of farmers who have to use the county roads and who feel that they are being denied a reasonable degree of consideration in order to make it possible to carry out elaborate works on the trunk roads from which the local people feel they derive little or no benefit.</P>
    <P>It is immensely important, if we accept responsibility here for appropriating large sums of money, and for their expenditure, to ensure that we shall retain the full and understanding sympathy and approval of people who see the money spent.  I should be glad to hear what other Deputies have to say about this matter.  Do they experience, with me, some concern on the magnitude of some of the road straightening operations that are taking place, as compared with the scale of work on the maintenance of road service which is proceeding?  I should also be interested to hear some Deputies express their view of whether they think it a good thing, if we wanted to develop tourist traffic, to ensure that we had a system of roads which would excite admiration in our visitors, rather than that having been drawn here by our tourist advertising, they should say that they found them almost impassable.</P>
    <P>I think we would be very foolish if having made that great capital investment on the trunk roads we <Col N="968" /> allowed it to be frittered away for the want of adequate maintenance and repair.  We should bear in mind that when these great sums of money are being spent on what I shall describe generically as road straightening operations, the local people very understandably feel that, over and above the fact that they derive relatively little benefit from these dramatic improvements in the trunk roads, the labour content from which they might hope to derive indirect benefits on these large operations is relatively slight, whereas maintenance works, even if they do not give the local people any very large benefit from the enjoyment of the amenity of the road, at least give them the prospect of employment on them.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose it is possible for the Minister or his Department to supersede the discretion of the county engineers and the local authorities, but I do not think it would be unreasonable, when the Oireachtas is making over £5,000,000 available for road works generally, if the Minister gave some indication to local authorities of the priorities we expected to be observed in the general schedule of road works undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody will disagree with what Deputy Dillon has said, but I was not prepared for the type of discussion he initiated. While agreeing with him, I should prefer to make my prepared statement, shall we say, on the actual Vote. I think the Minister must agree that much of what Deputy Dillon said is entirely correct.  There has been a considerable amount of experimental work on roads in recent years, experiments which have proved very costly for the ratepayer and the taxpayer and which, I might add, have not been entirely successful.  However, more about that on the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how tightly the Miniister is confined in the cases in which he may make grants to local authorities for the reconstruction or improvement of roads, but I want to make a plea to him to reconsider another type of road to which a grant might be <Col N="969" /> applied.  Perhaps I had better give a specific example: the new road needed between Wexford town and Gorey.  I mention this specific case in view of the fact that the Minister himself mentioned county councils to which the new grant would be applied.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I should like to tell him the situation.  As he is probably aware, a bridge has spanned the River Slaney there for very many years.  Up to the present it is incapable of carrying any type of heavy traffic.  The result is that all commercial traffic to the town of Gorey from Wexford goes through Enniscorthy.  A new bridge is being built and will be available for traffic, I am sure, in about six months.  This means that all the traffic that hitherto went to Gorey through Enniscorthy will take the direct coast road from Wexford to Gorey.</P>
    <P>To say the least of it, that road is in a pretty bad state at present.  It is true that Wexford County Council have done what they could within their resources to give it a reasonably good surface, but it is an old coach road and has dozens of turns in it.  If these turns are not corrected, it will be very dangerous.  I would appeal to the Minister to assist, as best he can over a number of years, the Wexford County Council in trying to make that road what it will be regarded as, that is, a major road.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter the Minister should consider.  Quite a considerable number of tourists come to this country through Rosslare Harbour.  Invariably they make for Dublin.  When they ask for the direction to Dublin, they are told to go across the crooked bridge with the barrels.  They then find themselves on 26 miles of very bad road indeed.  It is their first introduction to the roads of this country, and it will be agreed they do not get a very good impression of Irish roads and the joys of motoring here.  I do not want to labour the point.  I know the Minister has considered this, but I would ask him to give it further consideration in the light of what I have said.  Possibly he may make further inquiries.  If he considers <Col N="970" /> the application of Wexford County Council and the points I have made here, I think he will be forced to agree that something, big or small, should be done to assist the county council in making this a reasonably good road.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister said to me by way of interjection in regard to a question of mine recently that the Road Fund gave a pretty substantial grant for the erection of Wexford Bridge.  That is true.  For that, the people and especially the county council were very grateful.  But it means that we have now got a magnificent bridge, a magnificent entry to a road which, even though deemed to be first class, is in actual fact a third class road.  I do not want the Minister to reply to me in detail.  I merely put these points before him so that he may consider some grant to improve the road in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though every member will welcome the introduction of this Bill as a very realistic approach to what has been a rather vexed problem for some time, I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister's statement did not indicate that the supplementary fund being made available will cover a number of requirements which I thought should be dealt with. In the course of his statement here, the Minister indicated that the amount available will be £2,000,000 spread over five years.  I take it that half that amount will be made available by way of free grant and half by way of loan to local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us the categories of roads to which it is proposed to allocate grants from this supplementary fund.  In explaining the list, I observe he indicated that roads which will replace railway services recently closed down would qualify.  But it appears to me from that statement that any roads coming within this category must be roads which will carry traffic which heretofore was carried by railways the subject of closing orders.  A number of railways have been closed in various parts of the country over the past ten years.  Their traffic was diverted to the roads, but, according to the Minister's statement, <Col N="971" /> these roads will not qualify for supplementary grants.  I should like to make a special appeal to the Minister to reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>I shall quote one instance, the road from Tralee to Dingle, which runs along the old railway line.  The railway line has been entirely closed down for, I should say, nine or ten years.  Since then the traffic, which was pretty considerable at one time and actually up to the last war, has been diverted to the road.  I would say this road at the moment is taking a considerable volume of traffic not alone of the type formerly carried by the railway but also haulage of manures, livestock and agricultural produce which in former days reached the local market towns by horse cart.  This road was never built to carry heavy traffic and it is beyond the capacity of the local authority to reconstruct the road to make it suitable and satisfactory for heavy traffic.  The grants given to the local authority for work carried out on the road heretofore have been normal grants such as would be given for any other normal road.</P>
    <P>I have tried to indicate that a road of that kind, replacing a closed railway service, should qualify&mdash;with similar roads in other parts of the country which are now replacing railway lines &mdash;for special consideration.  The only difference between the Tralee-Dingle road and other roads of that type is that the Dingle railway has been closed for a number of years while the other railways to which the Minister referred today have been closed down recently in accordance with the general policy of closing uneconomic lines.  It would be a pity to single out the few roads of the type of the Tralee-Dingle road and deny them the facilities extended under this Bill to a number of local authorities affected by this problem.</P>
    <P>It is because I noticed in the Minister's statement that Kerry county council is not listed either for allocation or consideration of any proposal put forward in this section that I raise the matter.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to give the case some special consideration and that before <Col N="972" /> the Bill passes, if necessary he will make whatever amendment, is appropriate to provide that the case I have mentioned can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is another category of road in mind for improvement under this legislation, the road which serves an industrial undertaking. That is very commendable because undoubtedly industrial undertakings must have good transport facilities to enable them to operate economically. One requirement is good carriageways or roadways from the main centres into the area where the headquarters of the industrial activity are situated.  I observe in the list given by the Minister of proposals under this heading that there are no proposals from County Kerry.  I should like to direct his attention to some industrial undertakings in Kerry which are to some extent hampered by the fact that the local authority has not been able to provide them with the necessary roads. There is a very large undertaking of Bord na Móna in the Lyrecrompane area which is a rather isolated area between Tralee, Castleisland and Listowel.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, with the assistance of special grants from the Road Fund, either road improvement or special employment scheme grants, roads have been made part of the way from Tralee and Castleisland into this area but the northern approach has not a good road from one section.  The Listowel end is now connected with a main road which has been steamrolled in recent years.  That is carrying a certain amount of traffic, light motor traffic, but it is by no means entirely suitable for use by heavy goods-carrying vehicles taking turf out of the district.  It is suggested that an alternative route from the area into Listowel is a more suitable road for the conveyance of fuel from the bog area but that road in its present condition is not able to carry heavy traffic.  It is not steamrolled; it has been considered on a number of occasions by the local authority but unfortunately it was not possible to add it to the list for special improvement due to the fact that funds from existing sources to the local authority <Col N="973" /> are not sufficient to do what is necessary in this case.  I should be glad if the Minister would examine this matter with a view to helping out the local authority with a subvention from the fund for this purpose.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was dealing with the necessity for roads to serve certain industrial undertakings, it occurred to me that we are inclined to lose sight of the necessity for roads for agricultural undertakings.  We are told agriculture is the primary industry and, from the point of view of productivity and national wealth, I think it would rate higher than any other industrial activity.  I suppose it could not reasonably be expected at this stage that the Minister should give his views as to the necessity to connect certain roads in certain areas for the purpose of facilitating the agricultural industry.  Later, I hope the Minister will have an opportunity of going into that.  I should like to point out that some areas, particularly areas producing large quantities of beet and rape, are at present badly served as regards roads.  In view of the high volume of employment that those districts are providing in the production of the commodities I have mentioned, I think that they should be classified on a somewhat similar basis to industrial areas from the point of view of being qualified for road improvement.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points with which I was anxious to deal in connection with the expenditure of money on the improvement of roads but I think it is not appropriate to dwell too much on that point at this stage.  I take it Deputies will get an opportunity at a later date on the Minister's Estimate to refer to these matters and I have decided to defer any further remarks in this connection until that opportunity arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to enlighten me on one matter in connection with tourist road grants.  I have been asking questions about this for the past five years.  I have had various answers from the Minister's predecessors and they were not satisfactory.  One of these Ministers told me that only Fior-Ghaeltacht <Col N="974" /> areas qualified.  There happens to be a Fior-Gaeltacht area in Waterford and that does not seem to qualify for this grant.  I did happen to notice, however, that tourist road grants are made available to counties that have no Fior-Ghaeltacht. I shall not mention the counties; the Minister would probably know these himself.</P>
      <P>As regards main roads, and the taking away of very bad bends, an enormous amount of money has been spent on this work and it has been the cause of great complaint down the country.  The roads are magnificent but some of these main roads are in need of maintenance immediately in view of the fact that there is traffic on them, up to 25 and 30 tons, which should not be allowed on them.  However, I shall have more to say about that on the Ministers' Estimate.  In regard to these road grants I should like the Minister to clear this matter up because it is a cause of some curiosity with a great many of my constituents who are supporters of the Minister and of myself.  Will he tell us how these grants are allotted and why they are allotted?  What does a county have to do in order to qualify for them?  What special qualifications or amenities should a county have to qualify for these tourist road grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I refrained during the course of the discussion from drawing the attention of almost every Deputy who has spoken to the fact that practically all of the matters they have raised are appropriate to the Estimate. The second Deputy who spoke, Deputy Corish, realised that and actually referred to it.  Unfortunately a number of erroneous impressions may have been created by some of the things that have been said to which I shall refer briefly; the others I intend to leave over until the debate on the Estimate which should be in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon had various complaints to make in regard to the costly realignment of roads, which was also mentioned by other Deputies, and the lack of money for our county roads. He seemed to suggest that a greater number of grants were given for main roads than for county roads and that, <Col N="975" /> generally speaking, while the money was being well spent from the Road Fund, too much of it was going to the main roads as against the county roads.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of realignment and other costly jobs on our roads is concerned, whether they be county or main roads, I have gone to very great pains since I became Minister for Local Government to indicate to our local authorities and to those dealing with these road proposals that it is only in cases where these realignments are absolutely necessary on proved accident record or where the road is being done and to leave over the realignment would be wasteful, that such jobs are considered.  Over and above that stipulation there is the general circular that went out to all local authorities over a year ago indicating to the local authorities that the elected representatives of each road authority are empowered to have a say on the merits or demerits of any proposal coming up from their county engineers to my Department, and, further, that the advice of the elected representatives will be taken and considered in my Department on all of these proposals in conjunction with, or in opposition to, the proposals that may be made by the county engineers or the engineering staff.</P>
    <P>Having gone that far, I think I have gone as far as I really should go and that the matter should, and can be, safely left in the hands of the local elected representatives whose local knowledge and common sense should get over the difficulties that have been suggested, should avoid any wasteful expenditure and indeed should ensure that expenditure on realignments and other costly jobs is undertaken only where it is absolutely necessary and that roads are not generally neglected because of these high-cost jobs being done in any county.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that more money is given to the main roads than is given to the county roads is completely wrong.  A sum of £1,000,000 is given for main road grants and £2.4 million is given for county road grants.  In addition to all that, in the very recent past, to meet the situation arising in some counties, we have indicated again <Col N="976" /> to the local authorities that where the road mileage of dust-free county roads is unusually low, we shall consider allowing a switch-over of the main road moneys to supplement their county road grants.  That is to meet that specific problem of trying to serve so far as possible the county road users throughout the country, who are the natives mainly, but also to serve these tourists whom all of us are anxious to see in the country.  However, this matter is more appropriate to the Estimate and I do not want to widen the discussion any further than it has been widened.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a grievance in Deputy Moloney's mind that no provision is being made under this Bill in respect of the Lyrecrompane road. The Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote moneys are being spent and will continue to be spent on this road until it is brought up to a satisfactory condition to enable it to carry the additional traffic that is being put upon it by the advent of Bord na Móna to that district.  Deputy Lynch from Waterford raised specifically the question of tourist road grant allocations, but I shall leave the answer to that whole question over until the Estimate comes up for discussion.</P>
    <P>I should like to get back to what this Bill is all about and to recall the background to it.  The counties that have been mentioned, and are mentioned in my speech to-day, as benefiting as a result of recent railway closing are counties some of which made a case over a long number of years and others in more recent years. These are counties in relation to which my Department and I were enabled to make a case to justify getting these moneys.  The counties mentioned are the counties that made the cases, as distinct from the counties that are now making cases and, no doubt, will make cases in future.  A certain number of them will be justifiable, undoubtedly. It should be stated that the counties now named as benefiting this year are the counties that made the cases on which we sought the Government's permission for the grants we are now making available from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Furthermore, in relation to the question of immediate railway closings or current railway closings, there is another condition.  It applies also in regard to roads for new industrial undertakings.  The inability of the local authority to carry out the work from their normal road grants is a second and very definite consideration and a condition to which full weight must be given when any proposals are sent up from any county for any part of these moneys.  That is a point which should be borne in mind in all cases because it is a specific condition which must be given due weight when we are considering any proposals and claims that may be made or which, indeed, have been made in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I need say at this stage that cannot be more appropriately said on the Estimate.  I shall keep a note of the points that have been raised that are appropriate to the debate on the Estimate and shall endeavour to answer them then to the satisfaction of the Deputies concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Táan Bille seo á thabhairt isteach chun Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929-1953, a leasú agus a leathnú.  Is é príomh-aidhm an Bhille an Ghaeltacht a thabhairt ar aon chéim tithíochta leisan tír i gcoitinne.  Nuair a bunaíodh an Stást seo, bhí cúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht ar gcúl go mór i gcomórtas leis an gcuid eile den tír.  I dTuarascáil Choimisiúin na Gaeltachta, 1926, moladh córas speisialta Státchabhrach a bhunú leis an scéal a leigheas. Glacadh leis an moladh agus, dá thoradh sin, ritheadh Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929.  Is féidir a rá gurb é an tAcht sin cairt na Gaeltachta i gcúrsaí tithíochta.  Faoin Acht sin, cuireadh buntáistí speisialta ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun tithe nua <Col N="979" /> a thógáil agus chun tithe d'fheabhsú. Leasaíodh an tAcht ó am go chéile agus, de thairbhe an cúnamh a cuireadh ar fáil, tógadh ós cionn 5,000 tithe agus feabhsaíodh beagnach 5,000 eile ar chostas milliún punt i ndeontais agus ceathrúmilliúin punt in iasachtaí, faoi 31 Márta, 1959.  D'ainneoin a ndearnadh, áfach, tá go leor le déanamh fós.  Meastar gur gá timpeall 3,000 teach nua eile a thógáil agus timpeall 5,000 teach d'fheabhsú, faoi na hAchtanna.</P>
    <P>Tá aidhm an-tábhachtach eile ag an mBille seo.  Is beag saibhreas aicionta atá sa Ghaeltacht ach tá saibhreas Gaeilge ann d'fhéadfái a shaothrú i bhfad níos tréine ar mhaithe le cúrsaí eacnamúla mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios ag na Teachtaí go bhfuil béim á leagadh, sna Meánscoileanna, ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  Chítear domsa go mbeidh a thoradh sin le braith go mór sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeidh níos mó cuairteoirí ná riamh cheana ag dul ann ag foghlaim nó ag cleachtadh na Gaeilge.  Is ceart lán-leas a bhaint as sin ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair, áfach, níl dóthain de chóiríocht feiliúnach sna límistéirí Gaeltachta le freastal ar aon mhéadú mór a thiocfadh ar líon na gcuairteoirí. Tá beartaithe sa Bhille seo, cúnamh a sholáthar do mhuintir na límistéirí sin le go gcuirfear ar fáil an chóiríocht a bheas riachtanach.  Faoi na hachtanna cheana féin, is féidir cúnamh d'fháil chun seomra breise, le haghaidh cuairteoirí, a chur le teach cónaithe.  Beartaítear cur leis an gcúnamh sin, sa Bhille seo.  Ina theannta sin, beartaítear cúnamh de chineál nua ar fad a chur ar fáil.  Tá go leor teaghlach ann arbh fhearr go mór leo teach a thógáil ar cíos sa Ghaeltacht ná dul ar lóistin ann.  Tá tithe feiliúnacha den tsórt sin gann go maith agus, mar sin, tá beartaithe agam cúnamh a chur ar fáil chun go dtógfaidh muintir na límistéirí Gaeltachta iostáin saoire nó chalets lena ligean ar cíos do chuairteoirí.  Bhéarfadh sé sin teacht isteach railta dóibh i míosanna an tsamhraidh.  Tá beartaithe agam freisin cúnamh a chur ar fáil do chomhluchtaí aitheanta le brúnna a <Col N="980" /> thógáil sna límistéirí Gaeltachta chun buíonta cuairteoirí nó scoláirí a thabhairt chuig an nGaeltacht.  Chuideodh na nithe sin uile le caighdeán maireachtála níos fearr a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní dhearnadh méadú ar bith ar na deontais, i leith teach nua a thógáil, a cuireadh ar fáil faoi Acht, 1949, d'ainneoin an méadú mór a tháing ar chostais i gcoitinne idir an dá linn. Thagair mé anois díreach don mhéid tithe nua a theastaíonn fós sa Ghaeltacht.  Leis an scéal a leigheas, tá beartaithe faoi Alt 2 (1) den Bhille cúnamh breise a chur ar fáil&mdash;na deontais atá ann faoi láthair a mhéadú £25 i gcás tí chónaithe nach gcuirtear soláthar uisce agus saoráidí séarachais isteach ann agus freisin I gcás tí chónaithe a gcuirtear ann iad ach a bhfuil uisce-sholáthar nó seirbhísí séarachais poiblí ar fáil; na deontais a mhéadú £50 i gcás tí chónaithe ina gcuirtear soláthar uisce agus saoráidí séarachais agus nach bhfuil uisce-sholáthar ná seirbhísí séarachais poiblí ar fáil.  Beartaítear freisin faoin Alt céanna suim bhreise nach mó ná £100 a chur ar fáil i leith seomra folctha feistithe a chur leis an teach.  Ceapaim gur mhór an gar a leithéid agus gurbh fhearrde sláinte an líontí é.</P>
    <P>Tá i gceist faoi Alt 2 (2) na deontais i leith teach cónaithe d'fheabhsú a mheadú £30 sa chaoi go mbeidh deontais nach mó ná £110, £130 agus £150, faoi seach, le fáil do réir mar a bhíos 3 sheomra, 4 sheomra nó 5 sheomra nó níos mó sa teach. Thagair mé cheana don mhéid tithe ar gá iad d'fheabhsú agus tuighfidh na Teachtaí go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach i gceantair inar gá go leor tithe nua a thógail, go gcoinneofar na tithe atá ann cheana i ndea-dheis.  Is chuige sin a beartaítear an cúnamh breise seo a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Faoi Alt 3 d'Acht 1929, arna leasú le hAlt 3 (1) d'Acht 1953, cuireadh deontas sláintíochta £50 ar fáil i leith soláthar uisce agus saoráidí séarachais a chur isteach i dteach cónaithe.  Bhí an deontas céanna le fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Ginearálta) suas go 1956.  Méadaíodh <Col N="981" /> ansin é go £60 agus, ina theannta sin, cuireadh an cúnamh ar fáil ina dhá dheontas freisin&mdash;£40 i leith soláthaír uisce agus £20 i teith saoráidí séarachais. Faoi Acht na dTithe (Ginearálta) (Leasú), 1958, méadaíodh na deontais sin go £50 agus £25 faoi seach nó £75 mar chomhdheontas.  Tá bearthaithe faoi Alt 3 (1) den Bhille seo dhá dheontas nó comhdheontas a chur ar fáil mar leanas: £55, £30 agus £85, faoi seach.  Tá bearthaithe freisin deontas nach mó ná £140 a chur ar fáil i leith seomra folctha a chur isteach.  Tuigfear gur mhór an buntáiste a leithéid, go háirithe i dteach a mbeadh cuairteoirí le fanacht ann.</P>
    <P>Is iomaí teach a bhfuil soláthar uisce nó saoráidí séarachais ann atá i riocht mí-fholláin nó atá lochtach ar shilí eile.  Beartaítear faoi Alt 3 (1) freisin deontas nach mó ná £40 a chur ar fáil lena leithéid d'fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Faoi Acht 1953, cuireadh deontas nach mó ná £80 ar fáil i leith seomra breise le haghaidh cuairteoirí a chur le teach cónaithe.  Níor baineadh an leas a raibh súil leis as an deontas sin &mdash;toisc laghad an deontais, measaim. Tá bearthaithe agam anois é a mhéadú agus a leathnú mar a luaitear sa Táible a ghabhann le Alt 3 (1).  Ós rud, áfach, gur cuairteoirí a mbeadh suim acu sa teanga atá i gceist, beartaítear nach mbainfidh an cúnamh seo ach leis na limistéirí atá sceidealta in Ordú na Límistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair, is féidir iasacht nach mó ná £100 a thabhairt i dteannta deontais tógála agus iasacht nach mó ná £40 i dteannta deontais feabhsúcháin nó deontais leathnúcháin speisialta.  Faoi Acht 1949 a cuireadh na hiasachtaí sin ar fáil agus ní leor anois iad ar chor ar bith.  Tá cuid mhaith teaghlach sa Ghaeltacht atá ina gcónaí i dtithe mí-fholláine nár leor na hiasachtaí sin i dteannta an deontais chun teach folláin a chur ar fáil acu.  Is le freastal ar chásanna den chiaeál sin a beartaítear nár hiasachtaí a thabhairt a luaitear in Alt 5 (1) agus (2) den Bhille .i. i gcás obair thógála, iasacht suas go comhmhéid an deontais agus, i gcás obair feabhsúcháin nó leathnúcháin speisialta, iasacht suas go dtí a leath de chostas measta na hoibre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> Cúnamh de chineál nua ar fad atá i gceíst in Alt 4.  Thagair mé cheana don bhéim atá á leagadh sna Meánscoileanna ar labhairt na Gaeilge agus don mhéadú is ró-dhóigh a thiocfaidh ar líon na gcuairteoirí chun na Gaeltachta.  Mar adúirt mé cheana, is iomaí teaghlach ann arbh fhearr leo teach a thógáil ar cíos sa Ghaeltacht ná dul ar lóistín ann&mdash;toisc, b'fhéidir, gurbh fhearr leo teach a bheith futhu féin nó toisc a leithéid a bheith níos saoire.  Tá ganntanas tithe feiliúnacha den chineál sin ann agus, leis an mbearna a líonadh agus le teacht isteach rialta a sholáthar do mhuintir na límistéirí Gaeltachta, beartaítear deontas suas go £200 a chur ar fáil chun iostán saoire amháin le haghaidh cuairteoirí a thógáil.  Is é an cineál iostáin atá i gceist, teach simplí dea-thógtha ar chostas réasúnach. I dteannta an deontais sin beartaítear, faoi Alt 5 (3), iasacht suas go £200 a chur ar fáil freisin i gcásanna inar gá sin.  Is féidir gur mhaíth le daoine níos mó ná iostán amháin a thógáil agus, mar sin, beartaítear faoi Alt 5 (4) iasacht suas go £300 a chur ar fáil leis an dara ceann a thógáíl agus iasacht eile suas go £300 leis an triú ceann a thógáil, más mian.</P>
    <P>Is cúnamh nua ar fad an cúnamh eile atá i gceist in Alt 4 freisin. Beartaítear deontas suas go £5,000 a chur ar fáil do chomhluchtaí aitheanta chun brú a thógáil sna límistéirí Gaeltachta.  Ceaptar go mbeidh gá le cóiríocht den tsaghas sin le haghaidh buíonta scoláirí&mdash;lucht aonscoile, etc., nach mbeadh an chóiríocht i dtithe na ndaoine féiliúnach nó dóthaineach dóibh.  Is é an cineál brú atá i gceist, áras a mbeadh cóiríocht chócaireachta, ite agus chodlata ann do bhreis is 20 duine.</P>
    <P>Tá faoiseamh fiche bliain ó ardú rátaí le fáil faoi láthair ag deontaithe faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) i leith obair a dhéanaid faoi na hAchtanna sin.  Dá bhrí sin, do thiocfadh d'fheidhmiú an togra in Alt 3 (1) den Bhille, maidir le daoine nach sealbhairí ar thithe cónaithe iad, nach mbeadh rátaí ar bith le n-íoc ag deontaithe dá leithéid.  Ina theannta sin, measaim nach gá a thuilleadh <Col N="983" /> faoiseamh chomh mór a thabhairt. Mar sin, beartaítear in Alt 6 den Bhille sompla a ghlacadh Ó Acht na dTithe (Ginearálta), 1958, agus faoiseamh céimnitheach a thabhairt feasta i gcás obair thógála.  Cé gur laghdú é ar an bhfaoiseamh atá le fáil faoi na hAchtanna faoi láthair, is mó é ná an faoiseamh faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Ginearálta).  I gcás obair nach obair thógála, áfach, tá i gceist an faoiseamh d'fhágáil mar atá faoi láthair ach an tréimhse a laghdú Ó 20 bliain go 10 mbliain.</P>
    <P>Faoi Alt 3 d'Acht 1929, ní féidir cúaamh a thabhairt faoina hAchtanna ach do dhaoine atá ina sealbhairí ar thithe cónaithe.  Mar gheall ar an gcoinníoll sin, dob éigin cúnamh a dhiúltú do dhaoine mar lucht ceirde, iascairí agus mar sin de, a raibh ar intinn acu pósadh agus socrú síos sa Ghaeltacht.  Is léir nach é leas na Gaeilge ná na Gaeltachta an coinníoll seo d'fhágáil ann.  Níl aon choinníoll dá chineál ag baint le hAchtanna na dTithe (Ginearálta) agus tá beartaithe faoi Alt 3 (1) den Bhille seo nach mbainfidh an coíimíoll feasta le daoine sna límistéirí atá sceidealta in Ordú na Límistéirí (Gaeltacht), 1956.</P>
    <P>Sa Sceideal d'Acht 1929, tá liostáilte na toghranna ceantair a chomhdhéanas an Ghaeltacht chun críocha Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just delivered his Second Reading speech in Irish.  The Bill has been circulated in English only so I propose to deal with it in the language in which it has been circulated.  The reason for the inconsistency is probably known only to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill mainly because it supplies a much-felt need and is a recognition by the Government of that need, and of the high costs of materials, and the high costs generally obtaining, and the relative inadequacy of the amounts of the grants and loans hitherto available to people in Gaeltacht areas.  There are, however, certain aspects of this Bill against which I do not make complaint but on which I make inquiry as to their meaning and their general application.</P>
      <P>First of all, there will be some difficulty&mdash;if not difficulty, certainly dissatisfaction&mdash;in the application and scope generally of the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law.  In the Bill, reference is made to one area, namely, the area defined as the Gaeltacht under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1956.  I recall that at the time those areas were being defined, were it not for my intervention and certain support from the Government, they would have been very much smaller.  If I had had my way, they would have been much bigger and they would have covered, to a very large extent, the congested areas as a whole.  However, that is now a matter of history, but it is something which should not be lost sight of because there is no Act of Parliament which cannot be amended or extended as the need arises or if the national interest demands it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one very welcome feature in this Bill, namely, that an applicant for a Gaeltacht housing grant may now get it, subject to the conditions laid down, <Col N="985" /> even though he has not previously had a dwelling house.  Up to now&mdash;I think I am correct in this&mdash;with some exceptions, and applicant could not get a housing grant unless he already had a tumble-down shack.  In my time, there was one such exception in one area known to me, and it is a good thing that that provision should be inserted in this Bill, namely, that a person can start afresh and say: &ldquo;I want to live in a Gaeltacht area and build a house there in which to bring up my family.&rdquo; The restriction of already having a house should not be placed on him.</P>
    <P>I wonder why it is that such an applicant is restricted to the area laid down in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1956, because, to my mind, that creates an inconsistency in this Bill to which I shall have to refer later, or perhaps, it would be better to deal with it now.  In the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, the Schedule sets out areas where Gaeltacht housing grants could certainly be applied for but not necessarily granted.  This Bill refers to the townlands in the counties of Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Mayo and Waterford, and applies, as I said, to the townlands scheduled in those counties in the Act of 1929.  An applicant for a housing grant or for a holiday chalet must live in the restricted areas set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1956. That is an inconsistency which will probably give rise to difficulties and dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I know the Minister has explained at the end of his speech that he has not received any application for a long time for a grant nor has sanction been given in those areas for an equally long time.  Nevertheless, from this Schedule in the 1929 Act go in one fell swoop these townlands scheduled there in the counties of Waterford, Cavan, Leitrim, Limerick, Louth, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary South Riding.</P>
    <P>It will probably be conceded that Irish as a living language no longer operates there to any great extent, but, nevertheless, in taking away from any person in those areas who wants to take a deep interest in the Irish language, to make it his own language, <Col N="986" /> and the language of his family, the right to such a grant, if he feels like it, is taking away from him whatever pride he may have in the language and the culture of our country.  It destroys any fresh incentive that might become apparent as the years go on.  Why, I would ask the Minister, could he not allow those areas of Waterford, Cavan, Leitrim, Limerick, Louth, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary South Riding to remain there?  There may not be any applications and there may not be any sanctions but to deprive them of the right of making an application would be to deprive an applicant who might be found to be adequately qualified and worthy of the amenities available under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The building of holiday chalets in the Gaeltacht areas is a very good thing but the restriction of area in the Ministers and Secretaries Act applies generally to the townlands in the counties I have already enumerated. There is, to my mind, an inconsistency there which should be examined. Perhaps it might be found that it is not an inconsistency at all, and if the Minister can explain it to my satisfaction and the satisfaction of the House, I shall have no difficulty in accepting his point of view.</P>
    <P>What is the object of the holiday chalets in this Bill?  Is it to promote the Gaeltacht and all its kindred activities, or is it to provide a certain income for the owner of the chalet who must be an Irish speaker and satisfy the Department before he gets a grant? Is there to be no limitation on the person or persons who will become the lessee or the lessees of the chalets for the holiday period?  I do not see that there is anything in this Bill at the moment to prevent anyone from London, Glasgow, New York or Melbourne from taking a chalet here in the Gaeltacht and speaking English all the time.  Intrinsically, of course, I do not see anything wrong with it, but why should the person who wants to set up a chalet be asked to qualify as an Irish speaker when there is no limitation to be placed upon the person to whom he is to let the chalet?  There <Col N="987" /> probably is a reason for that and, once it is given, I shall accept it.</P>
    <P>Section 4, subsection 2, states:</P>
    <P>Where a body of persons prosposes to erect, in an area which is one of the areas for the time being determined to be Gaeltacht areas by order under section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956 (No. 21 of 1956), a hostel for the accommodation of visitors and to furnish the hostel, the Minister may, in his discretion...</P>
    <P>give a grant not exceeding three-quarters of the estimated cost, or £5,000, whichever is the less.</P>
    <P>What kind of group of persons has the Minister in mind, or have there been any representations made to his Department from interested groups, from Connradh na Gaeilge, or any of the various Irish organisations that operate in the Gaeltacht like Gael-Linn who are interested in Gaeltacht holidays? As it stands, I see nothing to prevent a hostel that is to be put up by persons who would qualify as Irish speakers from becoming another Blackpool in the middle of the Gaeltacht. I see no restriction placed on the kind of people they will let or bring in here, but I do see in it an opportunity for people to get £5,000 of State money as a mere profit-making channel, without any reference whatsoever to the Irish language, Irish culture, or any of the other things associated with the Gaeltacht.  Probably the Minister will be able to give some account of the kind of persons he has in mind and whether any representations have been made to him by such a body of persons.</P>
    <P>On the question of relief from rates, I want to express my dissatisfaction with the proposed method.  Under the existing law, a person who built a Gaeltacht house, or an extension to a house and got any advantage under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, up to date was free from rates on the extension, or on the new rates over the old rate, for 20 years.  In this Bill, I see that the Minister proposes to substitute what I <Col N="988" /> might refer to as and what is, in fact, a sliding scale, whereunder, in the first year after the completion of the building, the rates would be reduced by nineteen-twentieths.</P>
    <P>A twenty year period is taken as the basis for consideration in the relief of rates.  In the first year, a person pays one-twentieth of the rates; in the second year, two-twentieths; in the third year three-twentieths and so on. There might be a good explanation for that.  The argument might be advanced that such a sliding scale would be in ease of the successful applicant, namely, that it would not come upon him so suddenly, but, in my view, the Minister would do well to reconsider whether he should revert to the provisions governing the relief of rates in the Housing Act of 1929.  In that Act, there was provision for a clear remission of all rates applicable to fresh building, or to extensions, for 20 years.</P>
    <P>On the whole, as I say, this Bill is to be welcomed and, subject to an explanation of what I have termed inconsistencies, I think the Bill should have a speedy passage through this House, so that the amenities it purports to provide will be made available to the people with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>Bá mhaith liom buiochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Mac Loingsigh a labhair sa dhiospóireacht ar an mBille seo agus is cúts áthas dom féin go bhfuil seisan agus a Phartai sásta glacadh leis an Bille seo i gcoitinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should tell Deputy Lindsay the Bill was circulated in English by virtue of the fact that it is an amending Bill, amending other previous Bills, and this was evidently the practice in this House with other Bills dealing with housing.  It would be very difficult, from an interpretation point of view, when we were referring to amendments in different other Acts, if we did not bring it in in this way.  As far as Limistéirí na Gaeltachta are concerned, the area included within these limits was fixed by Deputy Lindsay and his colleagues, though I do not know whether he was a member of the Government at that time.  I have no doubt due consideration was given <Col N="989" /> to the advice of the officials concerned as to what should be within limistear na Gaeltachta and what should be outside it.  I think the definition that has been made was made in an effort to get reality into this situation and not to have places scheduled as Gaeltacht areas that were not, in fact, Gaeltacht areas, and in which the language had not been spoken for years and years past.  From all these counties that have been excluded under this Bill, no applications have been received for very many years and, knowing these counties, I am satisfied, and am advised that there is no likelihood of receiving any applications from them.</P>
    <P>Possibly there might be one odd individual, such as a teacher living in one of these counties who, by virtue of his knowledge of the language, would formally qualify for a housing grant there.  That, to my mind, would be particularly bad from the point of view of the language and from the point of view of the Department. I do not think anything does more harm to the Irish language generally, and to those promoting it, than to have the criticism that some people, by virtue of the fact that they have a knowledge of Irish, can qualify for particular treatment outside the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>It is true that people who have Irish, living close to the borders of the existing Gaeltacht areas, will be entitled to the benefit of the Housing Acts but the new developments with which I shall deal in a moment, that is, the chalets and hostels, are limited solely to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area as already defined.  Deputy Lindsay asked what is the object of the chalets and, of course, quite plainly the object is to provide an income for the people living in the Gaeltacht.  I think it would be unrealistic to attach, as the Deputy has suggested, any kind of conditions, of language or otherwise, on the people who may make use of these chalets during the summer months.  The object of the chalets is to increase the standard of living of the people and to provide, if they take full advantage of this Bill, £150 or £200 a year that they should get by way of profit from these buildings. <Col N="990" /> That, coming in to these people with small holdings, with the poor incomes they have in the Gaeltacht, should have a tremendous economic impact on their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that explanation fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the First Reading of this Bill, tremendous interest has been displayed by different Irish organisations who were all, I am glad to say, ready and willing to co-operate in giving a larger slice of the national tourist cake to the Gaeltacht and particularly to promote these facilities in cities and towns throughout the country and to get as many people as possible to take advantage of them.</P>
      <P>A new rule is coming into the Department of Education under which oral Irish examinations will be held.  It is anticipated that there will be a very large influx of students with, possibly, parents and their families, when this rule comes into force so that the students will have an opportunity of practising the language.  I am satisfied there is not the accommodation to deal with this expected influx at the moment.  This Bill proposes to enable the people there to deal with this influx of students and many of the provisions are drafted with that end in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that special provision is being made so that the first chalet will be provided by way of grant as well as loan.  Each will serve, and is designed to serve, three different purposes. In the first place, it will deal with a social problem that we have in congested areas and in the Gaeltacht. That is that the chalet can and may be used as a dower house.  When this house is available and the young people get married, the old people can go to the chalet or <i>vice versa.</i>  I believe it will stop the many rows we have seen in our courts and the many differences that arise when what is called in the West of Ireland the &ldquo;young woman&rdquo; comes into the house.  Its second purpose is that where a man has a good dwelling house in the Gaeltacht, an attractive house that would bring in a good income if let in the summer months, he can move to the first chalet <Col N="991" /> and let his own house, if he so desires. The third purpose, combined with the other two, is that if none of these problems arises for him it will give him a start and encourage him to have at least one chalet for the purpose of letting in the summer months and getting whatever income he can from it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hostels, there has been a demand from certain organisations that some such facilities should be provided.  In the case of a local committee with which we are satisfied, we would be enabled to provide these hostels particularly for the purpose of housing students during the summer months.  The scheme will also enable schools in cities and elsewhere to have courses for their students in the Gaeltacht at certain times of the year, particularly during the summer.  They would have a place to put their own students where they would be looked after and under supervision and where they would get the benefit of living in the Gaeltacht and perfecting their knowledge of the language.  It may also well be, as we are now engaged in giving help for the provision of secondary education in the Gaeltacht which is extremely badly needed, that in these developments these hostels will be needed.  I am satisfied on every aspect of this matter, and considering the number of students we are expecting to come to the Gaeltacht, that such hostels would serve a very useful purpose.</P>

      <P>Will they be restricted to students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be restricted in the first instance to the committee, about which we shall have to be satisfied. The main purpose we have in mind is the purpose I have just stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the rates provision in the Bill, I have given some thought to this matter.  I felt, in the applicant's own interest, this change is desirable. The rates provision will go on, step by step.  It is generally more conformable with the existing law in the Department of Local Government, although the period we are giving is longer.  Taking one thing with another, I am satisfied <Col N="992" /> this is probably the better way, even from the applicant's point of view, of dealing with this question.</P>
    <P>Generally, this Bill provides a national scheme for the whole of the country as far as the Gaeltacht areas are concerned.  It is designed mainly to promote tourism in the Gaeltacht. It has been shown in other countries&mdash; in backward areas such as the Highlands of Scotland and backward parts of Austria and elsewhere&mdash;that the one type of industry with lasting economic effects that has been successful in these areas is tourism.  We are lucky in the Gaeltacht to have some of the finest scenery this country provides.  In parts of it, we have some of the finest fisheries available in this country.  We propose fully to exploit these advantages of the Gaeltacht under the provisions of this Bill.  When we get the accommodation, there are other local schemes for the purpose of promoting tourism in the Gaeltacht that can very well be fitted in with it.  The first thing we badly want there is accommodation. This, I think, is the quickest and best way of providing in view</P>
    <P>There is nothing further I need say in view of the way the Bill has been met here, except to suggest that because of the purpose of the Bill we should try to get it through this House, at least, as quickly as possible. I would ask Deputies to co-operate with that purpose in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  I am not quite clear about the impact of rates on these chalets.  There does arise in the case of persons availing of this grant two liabilities.  One is the maintenance and repair of the chalet when it is completed and the second is the impact of rates.  Is it intended that the valuation on buildings will ultimately be increased and a proprietor of a chalet will have his rates increased as a result thereof?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 3, the principle of this experimental scheme has been approved by the Minister.  He is assured of goodwill on all sides for anything he has in mind to help the Gaeltacht but I should like to put this aspect of the problem to him.  He says that his primary object is to attract tourists to the area in respect of the chalets.  The hostels have a dual purpose, the accommodation of students and the possibility, if there were periods where there were some vacancies in the hostels, that non-students might be accommodated also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is he moving on the right lines here.  I note that he has accepted the principle of hostels for students with all the ancillary accommodation that can be provided where <Col N="994" /> you have, potentially, 20 lodgers. What I am thinking of is tourists coming here from, say, America, or from Great Britain, and who are touring through the Gaeltacht.  What do they anticipate when they are told of this chalet accommodation?  I think I know what they anticipate. That means to them what are called in America, and indeed in Great Britain, motels.  When you go into a motel in the United States of America, or in Great Britain, the amenities provided in common are very extensive. For instance, every chalet on a motel site will incorporate in the chalet not only a bedroom&mdash;sometimes it is a bed-sittingroom or sometimes a small bedroom and a small sittingroom&mdash; but also a water closet and shower, or a bath, where there is hot and cold water available.</P>
    <P>That may seem to us to be a fantastically extravagant expectation in what we know to be an area remote from facilities of that kind, but tourists are not in search of what we think ought to be adequate for them. They are in search of what they expect to get.  The point I am making to the Minister is this: in respect of these hostels he has accepted the concept of a committee of local people combining to provide a hostel.  I wonder if in addition to the scheme here envisaged whereunder each individual smallholder can build a chalet on his own holding, the Minister ought not leave himself free where a village like Rosmuc, or Carna, but particularly Rosmuc, proposes to adopt this scheme.  Suppose all smallholders in the parish came together and instead of electing to build an individual chalet on each man's holding&mdash;and mind you these holdings are very small, four acres perhaps&mdash;said: &ldquo;We should like to avail of a bloc grant and with expert advice from the tourist board construct a motel which would comprise, say, six or ten or twelve chalets with central accommodation for eating and with modest sanitary arrangements annexed to each individual chalet, and thus give a tourist family which arrives in the family car complete privacy and comfort in their own chalet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can the Minister really conceive <Col N="995" /> that we can hope that amenities of that kind will be provided and maintained in individual chalets set on the several holdings of the people who may venture to build them under this Act?  Would the Minister not agree with me that if you had what we will, for the purpose of discussion, describe as a motel, that is a group of chalets with common facilities, in regard to the problem of maintenance one caretaker could be charged with the responsibility of keeping these chalets in the winter?  He could replace a slate, or fix a window, or put back a pane of glass readily if anything of that kind were necessary.  One caretaker would be there to receive the guests, to meet any complaint or difficulty, or meet any emergency that arises and be a source of local information for any family parties that came to occupy one of those chalets. I am not saying that the Minister should abandon all thought of individual chalets being erected by specially enterprising families but if he wants the scheme to be a success I wonder would be not be wise to acquire power to have the motel idea developed where the circumstances make that the more practicable application of this plan?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say in the first instance that while it is true my objective is to attract tourists to the Gaeltacht, fundamentally my idea has been that the small man with his family who would normally be going for a month's holiday to the seaside, say in Dublin or elsewhere, would be able to go to the Gaeltacht to one of these chalets and his children would have the opportunity of getting practice in speaking the language there. That is my fundamental aim.  In addition, the idea of providing these chalets is to help the people in the economic field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Dillon is aware that, in addition to the first chalet, each individual applicant is entitled to get a loan for two more, so that an enterprising man in the Gaeltacht will be able to have three. I have stayed in motels in America, to which the Deputy referred.  It <Col N="996" /> occurred to me that an enterprising man in the Gaeltacht would be able to start off with what is, in effect, a small motel with these three chalets. I feel that with the competition I expect between the different people in places like Cois Fairrge to improve accommodation, developments such as those envisaged by Deputy Dillon will come about with the existing help. Indeed, I have noticed, and many people I have spoken to have noticed, a tremendous improvement in the standard of hotel accommodation throughout the West of Ireland in recent times.</P>
    <P>However, I shall examine what the Deputy has suggested.  But I can see certain difficulties if we put it in this Bill.  You may have people coming to the Gaeltacht, for the purpose of a certain type of exploitation, who are not natives of the Gaeltacht and do not have a knowledge of the Irish language.  We might have the difficulty that the people the Bill is designed to help would be prejudiced, whereas people never envisaged under the Bill might reap the advantage.  But on consideration it might be possible to deal with the Deputy's suggestion under the existing structure in the Department.  However, the provisions as they stand are the best that can be devised at the moment.</P>

We have then the areas defined under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1956, but we have all the other areas in the Schedule to the 1929 Act open to apply for the ordinary building grant.  This matter may affect something in the future.

      <P>While I agree that the Chair may be technically correct, it might be more convenient to deal with the matter in this way.  While it is open to anybody in the whole of the island of Achill to apply for a building grant, should it not be equally open to the smallholders in, say, Dooagh, to be able to apply for assistance to build to holiday chalet?  The same should apply in Shraheens.  I am sorry to confine myself to my own constituency but it is an area well known to the Minister.  As a matter of fact, when the referendum is defeated, on the revision some of these areas might well be in the Minister's constituency.</P>
      <P>Take Ballycroy.  From the tourist point of view it has always been recognised by the fishing and shooting people in the smaller budget class. Why should a man who applies for a building grant under this Bill be deprived of the right to apply for a holiday chalet, if he qualifies in Irish? I know that it might cost more but I think the sourness and disappointment engendered would hinder the promotion of the Irish language rather than help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was against my will that Ballycroy was left out of the Gaeltacht on the last occasion.  As the Minister can learn from the statistics available to him, practically 90 per cent. of the population is Irish-speaking.  I found fault with the last census and there was not time to have another one.  The Minister knows very well that there is plenty of Irish, and good Irish, in the parish of Ballycroy, but in that census it was returned as almost blank.  As <Col N="998" /> a matter of fact I remember commenting then that since only five speakers had been returned for the parish, four of the nine teachers there must not have been Irish speakers.  The whole thing was inconsistent.  It would be a very good thing if the Minister would remove the area restriction on these applications.  He will not be deluged with applications, but if he is, there is a method of dealing with them at his end.</P>
    <P>I would urge that this area restriction be taken away.  I am sure the same considerations apply to areas in Donegal and, I imagine, in Kerry, Clare, Galway and West Cork.  I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this matter of area restriction in relation to these chalets and hostels and put them on the same grant basis whether chalet, dwelling or hostel, and make them all applications under the Schedule of the 1929 Act that still remains.  I shall agree to the deletion of the words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever is inside or outside Limistéirí na Gaeltachta is fixed and in my own experience I was very much surprised to find that some parts were left within when it was fixed.  I do not think they should be there.  There are some pockets here and there that possibly should have been included.  That is something we can examine.  I take the opposite view to that of the Deputy on this issue. My first view of this matter, having examined it, was to think it was desirable that all our activities should be confined to the Gaeltacht areas as defined.  There may have been&mdash;I suppose there was&mdash;a case some years ago to extend the Gaeltacht Housing Act into the Cenntar Cung areas close to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I am satisfied, however, that we could do much more effective work, and that administratively it would be better to confine all our schemes of this kind to the Gaeltacht areas as defined.  These, what I might call, generous provisions financed by the taxpayers are provided for the Gaeltacht people themselves to keep the Gaeltacht alive, to keep it there as a fount of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree to allow these <Col N="999" /> provisions, so far as chalets and tourism are concerned, to be utilised outside the people of the Gaeltacht for whom they are designed.  It is true that you will always have dissatisfaction when you draw a line about anything anywhere.  Naturally people outside that line will try to get any advantages that people across the line can get.  That is inevitable where you have scheduled areas as we have under the law here.  I should also say that as far as Achill is concerned, outside the parts defined under Limistéirí na Gaeltachta &mdash; indeed even in some of these parts, as the Deputy knows, not very many Irish speakers are left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am familiar with Achill Island and there is no use in the Deputy pretending it is in the same category so far as the language is concerned as Connemara or other Gaeltacht areas.  Achill Island, outside Limistéirí na Gaeltachta, has been very well developed from the tourist point of view.  This Bill is designed solely for the people of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and I would not agree under any circumstances to extend these provisions to people outside Limistéirí na Gaeltachta, nor do I feel it would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this to the Minister more as a note of warning than anything else.  I think we are in great danger of a dichotomy of mind which could seriously hinder the successful development of this scheme. I can well see that chalets intended for students are one thing but chalets intended for tourists are another. When I went to the Gaeltacht as a youngster I slept in a feather bed.  It was a very comfortable bed and it was no shock to me to find myself in a feather bed but I think if you get a tourist from Cincinnati or Birmingham and put him in a feather bed, he <Col N="1000" /> would get a shock.  He would be astonished.  He would feel this was not the kind of thing he anticipated. Students going to the Gaeltacht are much closer to the general mentality and outlook of the people there and can fit themselves into the pattern there even if it requires some adjustment. It is not an adjustment they find any serious difficulty in making when they are young and when they are our own.</P>
      <P>That is not true of the tourist from abroad.  He expects certain amenities that have become the common currency of international tourism and their absence would, I think, create a great deal of adverse criticism of a damaging character on the whole tourist amenities of this country.  If you are not going to face that realistically you could fall into a very damaging dilemma.</P>
      <P>If these chalets are for students I think they can relatively easily be made to provide all that is necessary; if they are designed for Irish families seeking seaside holidays I think the amenities reasonably readily available within this scheme will be adequate. If they do not like them they can go elsewhere but there will be no element of shock in what they find.  I do not think we can contemplate chalets primarily designed to cater for that trade as being adequate to cater for the tourist trade if we are thinking of American, British or Continental tourists.  I think we would make a great mistake if we tried to mix up the two unless you erect something in the nature of a motel which will provide the amenities expected by the foreign tourist, all of which will, of course, be very acceptable to the student or to Irish families seeking a holiday by the seaside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do suggest, however, to the Minister that he would want to watch the type of chalet which will be erected for the tourist trade.  If we are to have the two categories, the State ought to make it very clear to an enterprising person who is prepared to build a chalet that there are certain minimal amenities to be provided for tourists. You want a bed with an interior spring mattress and the sanitary arrangements <Col N="1001" /> to which I have already referred.  I do not think that is necessary if the accommodation is primarily designed for a student or for a small family party from our own country.  I am not trying to make difficulties.  I am trying to warn the Minister of dangers that could arise.  We need not be one bit reluctant to recognise that there are two categories of chalet to be considered under this Bill.  One is that designed for people such as I was when I went to the Gaeltacht many years ago, a student.  The other is the kind of chalet that can provide accommodation for anybody, foreign or domestic, who desires accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £234,320 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>In introducing this Estimate for a highly productive service I am glad to point to the substantial increase of 80 per cent. over the net total amount provided last year.  The main increase is under subhead G which includes for the first time grants to assist in the purchase of fishing boats.  There are other notable increases under subheads A and B which reflect the strengthening of the technical staff to cope with essential scientific and engineering work.</P>
      <P>In the past six months fisheries policy has received a good deal of publicity &mdash; both in the Government White Paper on the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and in supplementary memoranda which I circulated widely.  My main object on this occasion, therefore, is to report on the progress being made in putting the policy into effect.  But first I should like to mention the principal sea fisheries statistics for the last calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 1,687 men and 471 motor vessels solely engaged in sea fishing in 1958; of these vessels 142 were classed as 25 tons gross and over. During the year ended 31st March, 1959, nine new boats &mdash; seven of 50 foot and two of 56 foot &mdash; were issued by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to hire purchasers.  Six further boats &mdash; four of <Col N="1004" /> 26 foot and two of 56 foot &mdash; were allocated under the special Gaeltacht Scheme financed from the National Development Fund.  Another 56 foot boat issued was one of two for which grants had been provided in the Fisheries Vote.  Advances totalling £130,000 were made to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the provision of boats and gear bringing the Board's expenditure for that purpose to about £200,000 in the year.  The Board's four boatyards have been fully employed and I look forward to expanding activity to meet increasing demand for boats.</P>
    <P>Landings in 1958 were valued at £1,317,000 for all varieties of sea fish &mdash; including shellfish but excluding salmon &mdash; an increase of 13 per cent. over 1957 or 27 per cent. over 1956. The greatest single increase &mdash; £95,000 &mdash; once again came from herrings.  The overall quantities reached 259,000 cwts. for demersal fish and 288,000 cwts. for pelagic fish.  The value of shellfish landed, at £291,000 was 21 per cent. higher than in the previous year.  The catch of Norway lobsters or Dublin Bay prawns showed the greatest relative increase in quantity &mdash; from 6,800 cwts. in 1957 to 12,000 cwts. in 1958. Lobsters and crayfish represented almost two-thirds of the value of the shellfish and I should like to see further intensification of fishing for these valuable crustanceans.  Relatively small economical boats are found quite effective for this purpose and could at the same time be profitably used for sea angling at many centres.</P>
    <P>The greater part of 1958 was notable for a decline in landings of demersal fish: for the first nine months the quantity lagged about 11 per cent. behind that for the corresponding period in 1957 but the fisherman received prices averaging 15 per cent. more.  In the last quarter of 1958, however, the catch of whiting rose by about 78 per cent over that for the same quarter in the previous year and, despite the increased quantity, the average price realised was about 9 per cent. higher &mdash; thus illustrating the satisfactory outlets available and the scope for increased landings.  The average prices received by fishermen for the whole of 1958 <Col N="1005" /> were above the 1957 level &mdash; about 4 per cent. higher for demersal fish or 11 per cent. taking both demersal and pelagic varieties.  The average price of handdock rose 36 per cent. and that of herrings 43 per cent.  The high price for herrings is an indication of the fact that the demand &mdash; both at Dunmore East and in County Donegal &mdash; was sufficiently strong to absorb much greater quantities.</P>
    <P>In the first quarter of 1959 the increase in landings of whiting was maintained, the quantity being 44 per cent. higher and the value 75 per cent. higher than in the corresponding period in 1958.  For the quarter, landings of demersal fish rose from 44,000 cwts. valued at £140,000 to 52,000 cwts. valued at £176,000, landings of herrings from 70,000 cwts. valued at £63,000 to 82,000 cwts. valued at £100,000, the value of shellfish from £9,000 to £18,000 and the total value for all varieties from £214,000 to £296,000.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of home landings of white fish to meet the demand on the expanding home market inevitably gave rise to demands for increased imports of fresh fish.  It is important that the demand from housewives, hoteliers, etc., which is encouraged when supplies from home sources are plentiful, be not allowed to dry up because of seasonal scarcities.  If there are extended periods during which fish cannot be supplied, many customers will lose interest in it and change over to alternative foods.  On the other hand, the maintenance of supplies to meet the demand will benefit the fisherman by ensuring that there is an established market available for his catch when landed.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle that the importation of fresh or frozen fish should be controlled in the interest of the home fishermen.  This, of course, has been recognised for the past 20 years.  I came to the conclusion, however, that the control exercised until recently was too rigid to achieve the desired object: import licences were issued only at the last moment and lack of time sometimes prevented importers from locating the supplies needed or from buying to the best <Col N="1006" /> advantage.  In these circumstances I decided in January last to revise the licensing arrangements and at the same time ensure that the overall quantities imported would be strictly controlled and never excessive.</P>
    <P>The merchants who auction and wholesale fish told me that, when normal supplies of home landed fish are available, it would not be an economic proposition for them to import fish because of the extra transport cost involved.  They went further, however, and suggested the establishment of a fund to which they would voluntarily contribute a sum of 3/6d. for each stone of fresh fish imported by them.  The Fishing Industry Development Fund was thus created and importers pay their contributions before issue of licences so as to eliminate collection costs.  This fund will be utilised for the benefit of the fishing industry as directed by me after consultation with representatives of fishermen, wholesalers and retailers. As an example of expenditure from the fund I may mention recent advertisements to encourage demand for fish &mdash; which had then become more plentiful.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that in 1958 further progress was recorded in the export of fish.  Excluding salmon and freshwater eels, the export value of which was £565,000 in each of the last two years, exports in 1958 were valued at £796,000 which represents an increase of 28 per cent. over 1957 or 80 per cent. over 1956.  Exports of fresh herrings alone were worth £255,000 &mdash; an increase of almost £100,000 over the previous year.  The upward trend in fish exports has been maintained in the opening months of 1959.</P>
    <P>The scheme of reduced freight rates for the bulk transport of fish to Billingsgate Market, which had been in operation via Waterford and Rosslare for the previous twelve months, was extended in December last to cover exports from Cork.  Negotiations for its further extension are proceeding.  I might also mention that our boats are now free to make direct landings into British ports without payment of the 10 per cent. duty which applied up to January last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> I am confident that certain new undertakings promoted by private interests which are due to be brought into operation this year will play a useful part in the expansion of exports.  Encouraging progress is being made by private enterprise in the development of the processing side of the industry, particularly in regard to fish canning.  During the recent herring season, canning on a pilot scale was undertaken at Dunmore East producing canned herring for export.  A cannery is being erected at Kinsale.  A commercial fish meal factory has been established in Killybegs.  I expect too that a number of other undertakings will develop this year from proposals for the production of various kinds of processed fish.  Where home landings are insufficient to supply the requirements of canneries and processing stations, I am prepared to license landings by foreign vessels.  The interests of our own fishermen will, of course, be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Subhead E. 1 of the Estimate shows increased provision for scientific investigations &mdash; mainly in relation to shellfish and herrings.  The expansion of scientific activity is also reflected in subhead E. 2 which includes expenses of a second delegate to meetings of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.  In connection with subhead E. 5, perhaps I should say that a new and more comprehensive International Convention recently signed will, when ratified, supersede that of 1946.  It will extend to all species of sea fish and provide machinery for agreement on a wide range of measures for the conservation of fish stocks; the Convention of 1946 related only to certain species of fish &mdash; not including herring, for instance &mdash; and the mesh sizes of certain types of nets.  I should like to take this opportunity of making a further appeal to fishermen to realise that it is in their own interest to observe the existing orders in relation to undersized fish and net meshes.  These orders must be strictly enforced and for that purpose inspections are being intensified.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be in a position to report <Col N="1008" /> that a contract has been placed for the construction of the exploratory fishing vessel for which £45,000 is provided under subhead E. 6.  Of the sum of £20,000 voted last year, it was not practicable to spend more than £6,000. The vessel is to be delivered before the end of this year and I need scarcely say that there will be a very extensive and important programme of work awaiting it &mdash; particularly in relation to herring.  In the meantime the technical staff is being strengthened and plans are being prepared for a fully equipped fisheries research station.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the training scheme for fishermen for which provision is made under subhead E.7. Good, trained skippers and fishermen enjoy earnings comparable with those of business managers and highly skilled craftsmen on shore: There are skippers earning £1,500 a year and crew members £14 to £18 a week.  Herring fishing in particular is a source of very substantial income.  The fishermen's product is in international demand under conditions of market buoyancy. As I have said many times, the market for fish of prime quality is as certain as anything in this world.  Apart from the export potential, the retailers have told me that they can envisage a 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. increase in home consumption.  Fishing grounds are within our reach.  The seas around our coasts &mdash; the inshore waters, the Porcupine and Great Sole Banks &mdash; are all part of our heritage and should form the basis of one of our greatest industries. Young men should be coming forward for training to fit them for a fishing career.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to tell the House that some little progress has been made.  Seven fishermen who recently completed the course of training at the Town of Galway Vocational Sshool have been successful at the examination for certificates of competency under the Merchant Shipping Acts as second hands of fishing boats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He is in the position next to the skipper: he may, within limits, act as skipper though certified as second hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1009" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he, as it were, the first officer under the skipper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  These fishermen are the first to receive Irish certificates of competency issued under regulations recently made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am confident that this marks an important development in the history of the fishing industry.  I should like to record my appreciation of the co-operation of the town of Galway Vocational Education Committee and of their teachers in making the first course the 100 per cent. success it was.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have also played an important part in giving practical instruction on their offshore fishing vessels which, I hope, will be used to a still greater extent for training purposes in future.</P>
      <P>As I said when introducing last year's Estimate, I was disappointed at the numbers applying for training. Despite widespread publicity the response this year has been even less encouraging; only eleven candidates attended for interview.  I hope, however, that, as fishermen learn of the success of the first group of trainees and of the valuable knowledge and experience provided by the courses, applicants will come forward in ever increasing numbers.  It may well be that men who have for years been out of touch with school subjects &mdash; mathematics in particular &mdash; do not find it easy to face the prospect of going back to study at the theoretical course.  If that is the case it should be of great benefit to them if some preparatory spare time instruction could be organised in their home ports.  I feel sure that Vocational Education Committees would be willing to co-operate in this way should there be local demand for classes.  Indeed I understand that some committees are already providing instruction in navigational subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the pressing need for qualified fishing skippers and second hands there is a dearth of deck hands and enginemen for our existing vessels. As the fleet expands the position will become acute.  A fundamental need is the recruitment into the catching side of the industry of boys of about <Col N="1010" /> 16 years of age for training over a period of years as competent fishermen. With this in mind I am introducing a scheme for the training of deck hands and enginemen.  I am inviting the co-operation of competent skippers to make a success of this scheme.</P>
    <P>An allowance of up to £4 a week will be payable to a learner for a period of not more than two years if training as a deck hand or two-and-a-half years, including six months ashore, if training as an engineman.  Applications for admission under this scheme will be invited shortly.  When the learners have become experienced fishermen it is hoped that many of them will go on to take navigational training under the existing scheme and secure certificates of competency.</P>
    <P>These training schemes should lead to increasing demand for fishing boats &mdash; for which, as I mentioned at the outset, grants are provided under subhead G. Perhaps I might here refer briefly to the attractive facilities now available for the purchase of new boats:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First, a grant of 15 per cent. of the cost.</P>
    <P>Secondly, an interest rate of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the deposit a fisherman has to put down may be as low as 5 per cent. of the cost.</P>
    <P>These facilities do not apply to boats issued before they were announced.  I have received representations from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for extension of the 4 per cent. interest rate to other transactions and I am having the matter examined.  I have also received a petition from the National Fishermen's Organisation requesting application of the 4 per cent. interest rate and 15 per cent. grant to boats already issued and I have recently discussed this and other matters with a deputation from the organisation.  I am afraid, however, that I cannot hold out hope of applying the 15 per cent. grant to boats issued before November last.</P>
    <P>There is another new provision under subhead G of special interest <Col N="1011" /> to fishermen.  A grant is being given to enable An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to sell ice at the reasonable price of £4 per ton ex-factory.  I hope this will lead to the use of greatly increased quantities of ice which is essential to maintain the prime quality of our fish. The Board have ice-making plants in operation at Killybegs, Murrisk, Cleggan, Galway, Dingle, Schull, Ballycotton and Dunmore East and are providing plants at Caherciveen and Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>A further new item provided for is a fish cookery book in which I am particularly interested because I am convinced that fish consumption in this country can be appreciably increased by encouraging greater variety both as regards cooking methods and the types of fish used.  This is largely a matter for our schools and I am happy to acknowledge the co-operation of the Minister for Education and his Department in bringing it to the notice of educational authorities who, I feel sure, will play their part in popularising the use of fish.</P>
    <P>Subhead G. also provides grants for other development projects of the usual type undertaken by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, including premises and plant at various centres.  A sum of £43,250 is made available for salaries, fees, travelling expenses, miscellaneous items such as stationery, postage and telephones, and expenditure in connection with the head office premises.  A large part of this grant for administration relates to development activities.  For instance, payments in respect of boats do not cover the overhead expenses of administering the hire purchase scheme as distinct from the capital cost of the boats themselves.  On the other hand, the building and repairing of boats and the marketing of fish should be conducted on normal business lines.  I should add that the Board are carrying out a reorganisation to separate as far as practicable the purely commercial from the development side of their activities.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the arangements made to permit hire purchasers of boats to market their <Col N="1012" /> catches through approved auctioneers other than the Board have been operating satisfactorily.  Now that this contentious matter has been settled, I am relying on private interests to increase their capital investment in the industry and intensify their efforts to develop market outlets at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grant-in-aid, repayable advances are made to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Central Fund.  For the current year, advances have been authorised to a total of £240,000 of which almost 90 per cent. is for boats and gear.  Incidentally, I shall shortly have to introduce amending legislation to increase the aggregate amount which may be advanced to the Board.</P>
    <P>Subhead H. provides for a number of very important items described as technical assistance projects which include advice from foreign experts and visits abroad to study export prospects and improved techniques in fish handling and marketing and also to gather first hand information on fishing practice and on scientific work in a number of fields in which we are planning expansion.  In January last, for instance, three representatives of the retail fish trade accompanied by an officer of the Department attended a seminar on the improvement of distribution and retail marketing of fish and fish products which was held in Neuwied, Germany, under the auspices of the European Productivity Agency of O.E.E.C.  The seminar emphasised the need for special training facilities.  This and other recommendations are being studied and will, I have no doubt, lead to improved handling, presentation and display of fish in the shops and thus make it more attractive to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Icelandic expert engaged to advise fishermen in modern methods and techniques visited various ports and took charge of a boat for demonstration purposes.  Apart from his advice to individual fishermen, he made some general suggestions which are being considered.</P>
    <P>The Swedish consultant on fishery harbours will not complete his assignment for some time.  He is, however, <Col N="1013" /> making good progress with the assistance of the specially augmented engineering staff of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>A Canadian fisheries economist has been engaged through FAO to review the sea fishing industry.  He is to suggest the lines on which it should be developed as an export industry and to advise on the measures required to increase catching power and processing, to facilitate marketing and to attract the necessary capital.</P>
    <P>International experts can be of great assistance to us in giving detailed technical advice and making objective studies of our problems.  I should, however, make it clear that we have already formulated a general policy for sea fisheries expansion.</P>
    <P>I may repeat that, in the last analysis, the development of the fishing industry will depend on the attitude of our own people to the catching side &mdash; in which more men and more boats are urgently needed.  As I announced earlier, I am introducing a scheme of allowances to enable boys who could not otherwise do so to take up sea fishing as a career.  I am sure Deputies will join with me in inviting boys of the most promising type to come forward under this scheme and also in encouraging competent fishermen to seek training as skippers and to purchase boats for themselves on the attractive terms now available.</P>
    <P>Before passing from sea fisheries I should refer to the live question of exclusive fishery limits even though there is nothing new to report.  It is hoped that international agreement will be reached on this important issue at the further conference on the Law of the Sea which has been fixed for the Spring of next year.  The House will appreciate that it is most desirable that any extension of our limits should be achieved in the context of what is acceptable internationally rather than by unilateral action.  The system of drawing straight baselines from which to measure the breadth of the limits was, however, adopted at last year's conference.  This system has been under consideration with a view to its application to the Irish coast and the Minister for External Affairs has <Col N="1014" /> already stated that he will soon be introducing legislation to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should add that the drawing of straight baselines in accordance with international law is not a simple matter.  As an indication of the considerations involved, it may be helpful to quote the opening paragraphs of Article 4 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.</P>
    <P>2.  The drawing of such baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the régime of internal waters.</P>
    <P>Looking at the inland fisheries subheads as a whole there is a net increase of approximately £9,000 to £82,800 as compared with 1958/59.  If we disregard the rearrangement as between subheads F.1 and F.9 the nature of which I will shortly indicate, the true increases on various items as compared with 1958/59 total £17,997 while there is only one decrease, namely, that in subhead F.5.  In other words the £9,000 to be saved under this subhead in respect of compensation for the abolition of freshwater netting means that the sum available for productive purposes under other subheads is in effect increased by £18,000 instead of the net increase figure of £9,000 already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The rearrangement of provisions as between subhead F.1. entitled &ldquo;Payments to Boards of Conservators and to Local Authorities etc.&rdquo; and subhead F.9 entitled &ldquo;Contributions to the Salmon Conservancy Fund&rdquo; deserves a word of explanation. Taken together, subhead F.1 provides for £28,000 and subhead F.9 for £14,000, a total of £42,000 as compared with £34,483 for the like <Col N="1015" /> purposes in 1958/59.  The increase will be seen almost in its entirety on comparing the former provisions of £6,000 for grant to boards of conservators and £600 for contributions towards local schemes for the improvement of fisheries with the provision of £14,000 under Subhead F.9 by way of contributions to the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  This provision should be recalled when considering the new arrangements for supplementing the financing of boards of conservators which have been made under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>The new Act enables boards of conservators to issue a variety of salmon rod licences which may be available for use in all districts at £4 for the whole season, or for use in one district only at £3, or restricted licences for use after 1st July each year, as well as 21-day and 7-day licences at reduced rates.  I am glad to be able to say that my expectations in regard to these revised rates have so far been fully justified: they have met with very little objection from our own anglers and I have no doubt that they will be welcomed by visiting anglers for whom the former system of district licence and endorsement was most inconvenient. These increased duties have been estimated to yield between £9,000 and £10,000 additional revenue, the greater part of which will be surrendered by the Conservators to the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  The Fund will also receive &mdash; from the proceeds of the salmon export levy reintroduced in June 1957, and now incorporated in the Amendment Act of 1958 &mdash; a further sum of £8,000 to £10,000.  I may say in passing, that the export levy in 1958 yielded only £8,400 due mainly to the catch of spring fish being below the average.  This year's run of spring fish is widely reported as better than 1958 and it is to be hoped that the export levy will this season be nearer the £10,000 mark.</P>
    <P>The total funds being made available for the salmon fisheries in 1959/60 are estimated at some £85,000, as compared with some £64,000 received by the conservators in 1956/57.</P>
    <P>The total revenue from fishery rates <Col N="1016" /> and licence duties will come to £61,000; the proceeds of salmon export levy are estimated at £10,000, and provision is made in this estimate for exchequer grants and advances to the salmon conservancy fund, totalling £14,000. The comparable figures for 1956/57 are:&mdash; rates and licence duties, £50,000; Exchequer grants to Boards of Conservators, £14,000.</P>
    <P>The funds available to the conservators in 1956/57 were required almost in their entirety for purposes of current expenditure; of the additional £21,000 which will be available in 1959/60, £6,000, by way of grant, and £2,000, by way of advance to the salmon conservancy fund, are being provided to meet capital expenditure on projects which I shall shortly describe in some detail.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Conservancy Fund will be fed not only from the statutory sources just mentioned but also by grants and advances from the Exchequer. The sum of £14,000 set down this year is earmarked for the following purposes:&mdash; A sum of £6,000 will be available through the Fund to aid the revenues of boards of conservators, thus repeating the direct grant provided for under subhead F. 1 last year.</P>
    <P>Grants up to a total of £4,000 will be paid into the Fund to enable me to make contributions towards schemes for the improvement of salmon fisheries. These are of the type described in the White Paper <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, as designed to provide access to new spawning grounds, to improve the stocks of salmon and to induce runs of fish on the rivers at present relatively barren. One such scheme has already been embarked upon.  A survey has been made of the Falls on the River Inagh, near Ennistymon, and flow records are being compiled with a view to designing a passage to enable salmon to surmount these Falls which heretofore have almost completely barred the ascent of salmon to the extensive spawning grounds upstream.  A number of other projects of a worth-while nature have been listed for attention &mdash; the Bandon River and the Gweebarra River may be mentioned as examples.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, point out that works of this nature require close examination, sometimes over a prolonged <Col N="1017" /> period, of a variety of problems which concern not alone the fishery engineer but also the biologist.  Not only must the right conditions obtain for salmon to run the river in strength but it must also be determined before new stock is introduced that the spawning grounds are adquate and food supply sufficient and of the right types to ensure that salmon will reproduce their kind.</P>
    <P>The balance of £4,000 payable under Subhead F.9 into the Salmon Conservancy Fund will be provided half as grant and half as repayable advance.  This will enable assistance to be given from the Salmon Conservancy Fund in the first year towards the cost of a large scale salmon hatchery and rearing station at Cong, Co. Mayo, on the Corrib River system. The initial purpose of this establishment is to untilise for artificial propagation the fish which at present run past Cong into the Corrib/Mask canal and are lost to the river system as they cannot successfully spawn there due to the periodic disappearance of the canal through the porous rock which forms its bed.  The fry resulting from the stripping of these fish will for the greater part be reared to summerling or fingerling stage and put out in selected portions of the Corrib system. It is hoped thereby to speed up the rehabilitation of salmon stocks following on the set-back occasioned by the disruption of spawning beds in the course of the Arterial Drainage Scheme.  As the need for rebuilding stocks of the Corrib system diminishes supplies of fry will be made available in increasing quantities for the rehabilitation of other river systems which have suffered temporary injury or for the building up of stocks in newly developed rivers.</P>
    <P>The Cong Hatchery and rearing station is estimated to cost £10,000 of which approximately 90 per cent. will be provided by the Exchequer through the Salmon Conservancy Fund &mdash; half as a free grant and half as a repayable advance, the remaining 10 per cent. being found by means of local contributions. The operation and maintenance of this establishment is being undertaken by the Galway Board of <Col N="1018" /> Conservators and I have promised to help in meeting any operational losses that arise in the initial period.  When the hatching and rearing facilities are being used to full capacity, the Board will be able to provide a restocking service which should not only pay for itself and enable the Board's indebtedness to be repaid but also yield a modest profit.</P>
    <P>Returning for the moment to the increased revenues to be put at the disposal of boards of conservators, I must emphasise that in allocating such funds I shall take into account the efficiency of each Board and its organisation, the value of the work each has in hand, the capacity to undertake further work, the extent to which the work done by angling associations and the like is indicative of local initiative and self-help in such matters as protection, improvement and restocking. The officers of my Department will keep in close touch with the various bodies concerned and advise them on problems of reorganising protection services and on the type of development work best suited to local conditions. Thus I hope to ensure that the excellent spirit of voluntary service which animates the conservators and the various associations may be directed into useful channels and so integrated into the general policy for improvement of the inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the formation of a Standing Joint Committee of boards of conservators.  Most useful discussions have been held with representatives of this Committee which up to the present has addressed itself primarily to co-ordinating and examining critically a considerable volume of suggestions by boards of conservators for amendment of the fishery law.  I also hope to avail myself of the experience which members of this Committee can, I feel sure, bring to bear on the whole question of the measures best calculated to improve the fisheries.</P>
    <P>The payments which fall to be made to boards of conservators and local authorities etc. under the revised subhead F.1 are statutory payments of a kind made for a number of years <Col N="1019" /> past and do not call for special comment.</P>
    <P>No significant change appears in the provisions of subheads F.2 &mdash; Artificial Propagation of Fish &mdash; and F.3 &mdash; State Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.4 entitled Scientific and Technical Investigations shows an increase of £1,200 as compared with 1958/59, the new total being £1,800.  This is due to the cost of equipment and miscellaneous expenses (apart from salaries for which increased provision has been made under Subhead A) arising from extended scale investigations into inland fishery problems to be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>Surveys already initiated of the stocks of salmon rivers will be continued. Material has so far been compiled for reports on the stocks of the Shannon, Corrib and Erne systems and investigation of material relating to the Moy is in progress.  Future surveys of this kind will, of course, be extended to rivers which may be developed as salmon rivers &mdash; to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Another important investigation about to commence is the biological study to be made by arrangement with Bord na Móna of the effects on fish life and fish food of bog development work in the catchment areas of important salmon rivers.  This is by no means the first step taken towards alleviating the effects of this grave source of pollution.  Certain investigations were made on behalf of Bord na Móna on the River Boyne and in each of the past two years that Board has arranged with the Inland Fisheries Trust to carry out on its own behalf the reduction of predatory fish and the planting of fry in portions of the Boyne system not affected by turf production in order to maintain the salmon stocks of the river as a whole. A good deal of experimental work has also been done by Bord na Móna on other systems to try to prevent harmful discharge into the rivers from bog workings.  Now that a fundamental study of this problem is being undertaken I look forward to renewed effort on the part of Bord na Móna towards <Col N="1020" /> finding remedial measures.  I trust that on a future occasion it will be possible to announce a successful outcome of collaboration in this matter between the interests of fisheries and turf production.</P>
    <P>Investigations were also commenced in the Spring of 1958 into the underlying causes of another serious situation &mdash; the decline in stocks of the River Erne.  The origin of this decline can be attributed to the hold up of salmon during the construction works for the hydro-electric stations and the excessive netting which occurred for a number of seasons while the construction work was in progress.  As was to be expected this injury to the stocks had a cumulative effect over the years and the stocks of salmon had reached danger point by the 1957 season.  It was imperative to rest the stocks and I accordingly found myself obliged to prohibit all fishing by net and weir in the Erne for the 1958 season.</P>
    <P>At that time also my Department undertook in collaboration with the Electricity Supply Board a series of investigations into the possible causes of the continuing decline in stocks, the main subject of investigation being the conditions affecting descent of smolts passing the hydro-electric dams at Cliff and Cathaleen's Falls.  An ingenious contrivance being used in these experiments is an adaptation of one which an engineer of Fisheries Division observed in operation in the course of a study tour in Sweden a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. have also undertaken positive measures recommended to them to help improve the salmon stocks.  A small tributary lake of the Erne system has been cleared of all resident fish &mdash; mostly perch with a few brown trout, eels and rudd &mdash; and a quantity of salmon fry, determined by the amount of natural feeding available, has been introduced and will be reared to the smolt stage before being released into the main river.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that the Erne fishery has been reopened this season on a strictly restricted basis. This decision has been welcomed by the netsmen who recognise that even the short fishing time which is being <Col N="1021" /> permitted can only be regarded as a trial measure of a necessarily conservative nature.  I need hardly add that the situation on the Erne will be kept under careful review from season to season and that the fishing of the river will be varied according as the evidence shows any significant change in the stock position.</P>
    <P>During the past year the way has been cleared for development of eel fishing in certain directions by the enactment in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1958 of provisions which will make it possible for proprietors to bring back into fishing order certain eel weirs which had fallen into disuse as a result of restrictions imposed in 1939.  A further provision of the 1958 Act makes it possible to authorise the operation of an eel weir without the free gap heretofore common to all fishing weirs, subject to suitable alternative arrangements being provided for the free passage of salmon and trout.  These provisions are being implemented in consultation with the Boards of Conservators by the issue of temporary authorisations which will be subject to review when conditions as to how movements of fish are affected by operations of the eel weirs have been fully assessed.</P>
    <P>Any large-scale development of eel fishing would, of course, give rise to problems affecting not only the welfare of long-established game fisheries but also the interests of coarse fishing. It will be necessary to determine what forms of eel fishing can be practised in particular waters without detriment to other stocks of fish.  This will entail making a series of determinations as to the respective zones in which game fish, coarse fish and eel stocks can most suitably be exploited, having regard to all relevant factors, economic as well as biological.  A comprehensive survey of the eel stocks and potentialities for development will have to be undertaken and provision is made in the technical assistance programme for further study abroad of techniques best adapted to conditions in Ireland, both as regards fishing methods and the processing and marketing of eels.</P>
    <P>I now come to subhead F.5 which is the only subhead showing a real <Col N="1022" /> decrease.  It provides for compensation for the loss of freshwater netting rights through the operation of Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939.  Final clearance of a number of compensation claims has been delayed partly by protracted negotiations and partly by lack of satisfactory title.  Payments made to fishery owners and to netsmen up to 31st March, 1959, came to a total of £130,364 leaving about £16,000 still to be paid.  I should hope to see all outstanding payments in this connection cleared in the financial year 1960/61.</P>
    <P>The next item &mdash; Subhead F.6 &mdash; deals with the activities of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The provision under this heading shows an increase of £5,000 over last year's figure of £20,000.  The Trust's activities in the past year do not call for detailed comment.  Full information regarding the valuable work being done is readily available to any interested person in the Annual Report issued recently by it.  Suffice it to say that the year was one of steady progress although development work on certain rivers and lakes was seriously affected by the prevailing weather conditions and survey work was hindered by high water levels. Nevertheless large scale removals of pike and perch were undertaken at some 17 centres.  In all more than 33,000 pike were captured including over 10,000 at Carrigdrohid and Iniscarra reservoirs on the River Lee. Restocking with summerling and fingerling brown trout was carried out at a number of places.</P>
    <P>Lough na Leibe, Co. Sligo, which has been stocked with rainbow trout fingerlings each autumn since 1955, now contains a big stock of fish.  Test fishing carried out indicates that the fish weigh up to 1¾ lbs.  Kilbrean Lake near Killarney, which was stocked with rainbows in 1957 and 1958, will be open for restricted fishing in 1959.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £5,000 in the Grant-in-Aid this year is to enable the Trust to clear more waters of predatory fish by the use of Rotenone. This method of clearance, although costly, and not suitable for general application, is highly effective and enables the work to be completed and restocking to be carried out in much <Col N="1023" /> shorter time than by ordinary methods of predator control.</P>
    <P>The development work being carried out by the Trust on our inland fisheries under the Bord Fáilte 5-year plan is being integrated with the work being done to encourage and expand angling tourism.  The work of these two bodies in developing the fisheries last year can only be dealt with in brief summary form.</P>
    <P>Predator reduction was carried out on some nineteen lakes and rivers, and restocking was carried out on a number of these.  In sixteen rivers and lakes the predator position is now generally satisfactory.  Stocks of tench were released at seven centres in Cavan and Leitrim and at two points on the Royal Canal.  Stands and other facilities for fishing were provided at some eleven new centres.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are also co-operating with Bord Fáilte in the drive to make conditions more attractive for our visitors.  A new approach road has been provided at Lough Sheelin and approaches, car parks and jetties have been provided on the Corrib.  At Lough Carra four new approaches have been constructed while at Crossmolina a new approach, jetty, car park and caravan site have been provided. It gives me great pleasure to state that at Lough Carra and Crossmolina the local angling associations played a constructive and active part in the carrying out of these works.  It is on local co-operation of this type that the success of our angling tourist industry depends.</P>
    <P>The scheme for building boats for angling being operated through the medium of training courses provided by the various Vocational Education Committees continues to be highly successful.  It is expected that some 300 boats will have been made available as a result of this scheme up to the current year.  These are additional to the boats built by the ordinary commercial builder.</P>
    <P>Catering courses for housewives have proved popular and are being extended.  Over sixty people attended the residential course at Bundoran and <Col N="1024" /> courses were also arranged at eleven other centres in Leitrim, Cavan, Longford and Westmeath.  Courses such as these are essential if our angling tourist industry is to continue to thrive.  Our visitors will expect and must be provided with more varied and attractive fare.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made this year for the holding of four international sea angling competitions and nine other competitions have also been arranged to date.  The international contests have been fixed for Westport, Dingle, Wicklow and Greystones. There are now forty-two angling clubs affiliated with the Federation of Irish Sea Anglers.</P>
    <P>I personally attended a meeting in Paris at which the Chairmen of a number of angling associations, angling journalists and executives of transport and travelling agencies were present.  I also attended three similar meetings at British centres.  I have met representatives of the principal development associations in the Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford and Westmeath areas on several occasions.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has also been active in this direction and, early this year, decided to step-up the work of bringing anglers in touch with travel agencies and transport authorities and to assist in the organising of package tours.</P>
    <P>Indications are that the drive to attract foreign anglers is succeeding. Checks carried out at some 30 centres for coarse fishing during 1958 showed that bookings had increased by 53 per cent. over 1957, while a similar check carried out at the same number of trout fishing centres showed the significant increase of 79 per cent. in 1958 over the 1957 figure.  From the information available in respect of bookings in the current year there seems to be every reason to believe that this upward trend in the number of fishing tourists is continuing. Already the bookings over a representative area show an increase of 40 per cent. over last year and the season is only commencing.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that <Col N="1025" /> angling can and does play a very important part in our tourist industry. The Inland Fisheries Trust and Bord Fáilte are doing their utmost to assist, but ultimately, I am convinced, success or failure in this important field will depend on the many Angling and Local Development Associations which have been called into being and are still being formed.</P>
    <P>All that is needed is fair treatment for the visitors, accurate information as to the type of fishing available and reasonable charges for accommodation, boat hire and so on.  I appeal to all anglers' associations who are as yet not helping in the work to lend a hand and thus assist in this specialised sector in putting the country's economy on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer here to recent developments on waters controlled by the Electricity Supply Board.  A new fish pass has been constructed at considerable expense in the hydro-electric dam at Ardnacrusha.  This is a move to restore the Shannon to its former position as an excellent salmon fishing river.  Removal of predators from Lough Derg is being continued and local angling and development associations are co-operating wholeheartedly with the Board in this work. The Board has provided a large quantity of brown trout fry for restocking the lake.  The Board has also undertaken at the request of the local angling associations, experimental fishing in Lough Allen, with a view to obtaining accurate information on the stocks of fish present in the lake.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.7 provides for the usual State contribution of £1,000 to the Salmon Research Trust of Ireland. This is in respect of running expenses of which the State bears one-third of the total.  This Trust, as will be recalled, was established on the initiative of Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. Ltd., whose interest in salmon research and whose unstinted financial and other assistance I have pleasure in acknowledging.  The investigations which this Trust has in hand relate to such matters as the rearing of fish of known ancestry and study of their life history &mdash; a necessarily <Col N="1026" /> long term scientific investigation on the outcome of which it is hoped to throw some new light on the theory that &ldquo;like breeds like&rdquo; so far as salmon are concerned.  Some very interesting work is also being done on the problem of predation which goes to show that small brown trout, coal fish, pollack, mergansers and cormorants, are all important as predators of young salmon and may in some conditions cause heavy mortality among migrating smolts.</P>
    <P>The next Subhead F.8 &mdash; Fish Pond Culture &mdash; is a new one providing funds for the promotion of small scale fish farming.  This type of production, the rearing of rainbow trout for table use, is one which I am advised can provide farmers of small to medium-sized agricultural holdings with a worthwhile addition to their ordinary farm incomes at a cost of comparatively small capital outlay.</P>
    <P>Some preliminary work has yet to be done before I can encourage farmers to take advantage of the grants which I propose to make available for the purpose.</P>
    <P>It is intended to construct and operate some experimental units under varying conditions.  These units will be located on small farms in locations where the conditions generally favour further development on similar holdings. The ponds which are to be the basis of a demonstration or pilot scheme will be constructed, equipped, stocked with fry and provided with food in the first year on a repayment basis.  Farmers who agree to take part in the demonstration scheme will be given a short course of training in fish culture work and thereafter will be responsible for all operations entailed in rearing the fish to marketable size.</P>
    <P>Investigations of sites for demonstration units and testing of water supplies are being made in a number of areas and it is hoped to have the first locations selected and ponds constructed within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The token provision in respect of repayable advances to the Foyle Fisheries Commission has been deleted. This Commission, I am pleased to say, <Col N="1027" /> continues its successful administration of the fisheries of the Foyle Area. From the outset the Commission has been able to manage its affairs so as to show a credit balance in its accounts each year, and as disclosed in its annual report for the fishery year ended 30th September, 1958, has surrendered out of its surplus funds up to date a total of £28,200 in equal parts to the Fishery Authorities in Dublin and Belfast.  I consider it safe to assume that this satisfactory state of affairs will continue and have adopted a suggestion recently made by the Public Accounts Committee by not asking this year for the token sum formerly provided.</P>
    <P>I have referred on previous occasions to the serious harm which poaching &mdash; more accurately called illegal fishing &mdash; can do in destroying the fruits of all efforts to improve such a valuable national asset as our inland fisheries.  Fortunately the use of poison or explosives has diminished to vanishing point, and the destruction of fish on the spawning beds is becoming better understood as an indefensible and criminal act which strikes at the very life of this industry.  Minor instances of illegal fishing are, however, only too plentiful and I shall continue to give full support to boards of conservators in upholding their efforts to stamp out such practices.</P>
    <P>It is with considerable satisfaction that I refer in conclusion to the task of consolidating the Fisheries statutes. The revised version of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill which was introduced in Seanad Éireann in November last has recently been reported upon by the Standing Joint Committee of both Houses and the Bill is due for its remaining stages in the very near future.  Once the existing fishery laws have been re-enacted within the compass of a single statute the work of amending that law to take full account of present-day conditions will be undertaken.  Certain proposals to this end have already been elicited from boards of conservators and these, together with some matters of an urgent but non-controversial nature which have been noted by my Department as calling for amendment <Col N="1028" /> of existing legislation, are now being examined and I hope in due course to bring in proposals for amending legislation of fairly general scope.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not charge me with any discourtesy if I say to him that his discourse to-day reminded me of William Shakespeare who wrote a comedy once with the title <i>Much Ado About Nothing.</i> The Minister spoke at excessive length of results which do not justify such extensive oratory.  There are certain topics to which he referred on which I should like to comment.  One topic to which he did not refer at all and on which I should like a little information is the experiment of planting oysters at Killary Bay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was Killary Bay?  There were oysters planted in Killary Bay.  I am pretty sure of that. The Minister should look it up.  I should not like them to be forgotten. I have a recollection of oysters being planted in Killary Bay and if they are in Clew Bay also I should like to know what has become of them.  It is extremely difficult to establish oyster beds on our coasts and it would be very interesting to know whether that experiment had any success.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister referring to a number of enterprises that are proceeding and, as I listened, something struck me which recently happened in my own constituency.  I was making inquiries about the success of the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust, which I established.  One of my constituents came along and asked: &ldquo;Is Mr. Childers not doing great work with this Inland Fisheries Trust?&rdquo; I said to him with, I think, some pardonable indignation: &ldquo;Are you aware who started the Inland Fisheries Trust?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Mr. Childers has the name of it.&rdquo; It took me about a quarter of an hour to explain to him that, before the name Childers was ever heard in the Department of Lands, the inter-Party Government, of which I was a member, instituted the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> I give the present Minister full credit for helping the Trust since he came into office, but I want to salute the Inland Fisheries Trust, and Bord Fáilte which is collaborating with it, for having done invaluable work, not only in the sphere of trout fishing but of coarse fishing as well.  The full value of its work is now coming to be appreciated; the fruit of its labour is coming to be garnered now and will be garnered in the immediate future. I remember when we started it, there was a good deal of doubt as to its value and, when we extended the ambit of its activities to coarse fishing, there were many who thought that we were making a great mistake.  I am glad that the decisions we then took to press forward on both fronts have been so amply vindicated by the results.  I am particularly satisfied because the Inland Fisheries Trust was inaugurated on the basis of close co-operation between itself and the independent and voluntary angling associations throughout the country.  That colse co-operation has continued with great benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I still think that there is scope for more intensive work both in the preservation of the canals and in the development of their fishing amenities. I am sometimes worried when I see the intention of the transport authority to abandon the canals being made more and more clear lest that very valuable fishing amenity should be suffered to perish.  I think now is the time when something should be done to concentrate more attention on the coarse fishing facilities already available there with a view to improving and expanding them.</P>
    <P>I want to deal generally with the question of fisheries.  I see Deputy Cunningham here but I do not see any other Fianna Fáil members who are representative of the fishing areas in this country.  I want it to be made quite clear to me, and the Minister has a duty to make it clear to this House, what his policy is with regard to sea fishing.  Are we to go over to steam trawlers and wipe out the independent fishermen around our north-west, west and south-west coasts, or are we to continue the policy of protecting <Col N="1030" /> their interests as being the primary interest in the fishing industry? This is a very grave decision.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House if we slither or stumble into a policy founded on steam trawlers, we shall wipe out the entire sea fishing industry all around our western coast and, having once wiped it out, we shall never be able to revive it.  When I hear the present Minister &ldquo;pot-walloping&rdquo; about what can be done and what should be done, and how we should become a rival of Norway, or Iceland, I ask myself if he, or the Government, or the Party to which he belongs, have taken any clear decision as to what their intentions in this regard are.</P>
    <P>I have put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister which is, presumably, to be answered next week.  I shall repeat it now.  I am told that four trawlers have been ordered from a Dutch firm; two I think on behalf of some private fishmonger, and two on behalf of An Bord lascaigh Mhara.  I want to know what are they ordered for?  What do we propose to do with them?  Are they the beginning of a trawler fleet?  Because if they are, that is the end of inshore fishing.  What I am wholly unable to understand is, if there is to be a system of trawlers and people encouraged to buy these deep sea trawlers, why we are continuing to provide 50 feet and 60 foot boats for the fishermen.  They will not be wanted if the trawlers are allowed function.</P>
    <P>I recall to the House that there were trawlers operating into Dublin port years ago which were operated by a particular firm of fishmongers in this city.  I notified that firm that they could not continue, that if these trawlers were permitted to continue they must be operated on behalf of An Bord lascaigh Mhara and the proceeds go to the fishermen who were members of An Bord lascaigh Mhara.  Ultimately I was told at that time that if I insisted on that I would have to find vast compensation for the fishmonger who operated these boats. Subsequently I went out of office and I heard that this firm went out of existence because there was no compensation forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> I was approached repeatedly when I was Minister for Fisheries by Icelandic combines, Dutch combines, Norwegian combines and British combines who were most anxious to establish a trawling industry based on this country and I turned them all down quite deliberately.  There would be no difficulty about getting a trawling company based in this country. All you would have to do would be to put a notice in the newspapers in the morning and you would get half a dozen applications from powerful combines in either Norway, Iceland or Great Britain, who would be glad to operate a fleet from this country, but the result of that would be the complete disappearance of the entire fishing fleet of our north-west, west and south-west coasts.  I think that policy is wrong.  I believe the right policy is to develop the 50 or 60 foot boat to promote the fishing industry among the fishing population of our western seaboard.  If I did not believe that, I would throw open the fish market of this country to free and open competition from all quarters.</P>
    <P>There is only one possible justification for protecting the fish market of this country.  That is to provide the kind of employment that the fish market is providing in these inaccessible parts of the country where alternative employment is virtually unobtainable. If you establish the trawler business, you will not only wipe out all the fish but all the boatyards which are giving very good employment in these places and providing invaluable technical training for young men who can either go to work in these boatyards or go to the shipbuilding yards in Great Britain and get highly paid work as skilled technicians. There is no other kind of training available to youngsters in these places, such as Fanny's Bay, Baltimore, Killybegs and West Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have the courage to get up and say bluntly does he intend to introduce steam trawlers designed to go to sea for a fortnight <Col N="1032" /> and to return with the kind of catches that steam trawlers must bring back, if they are to be economically operated at all.  If they do bring catches of that volume into the ports of Dublin and Cork, they may wipe out completely the entire fishing fleet along our west coast.  It is time the Minister stopped indulging in ambiguous declarations and stated quite categorically what his view is on that fundamental question. Until that fundamental question is settled, there can be no intelligible fishery policy in this country.  I have no doubt at all on that question; I never had.  I am 100 per cent. in favour of the family fisherman with his crew and boat operating from our own shores.  I am against the establishment of large trawling companies operating into Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talked about the landings of fish and so forth, he ought to have dwelt more clearly on the remarkable and indeed unpredictable event of the arrival of the herring shoals on our shores.  At some stage in his speech, he stated he would set up a great scientific inquiry into the ways of the herring, why they come in shoals and why they go away again.  If he finds out the answer to that question, his name will go down to posterity as one of the most remarkable contributors to the fishing science in all of history.  As far as I know, since the dawn of time, nobody knows why herring shoals arrive and why they go away.  They simply come and they go. You are lucky when they come; you are unlucky when they go.  I am told that herring shoals have left certain parts of the coast of England recently and turned up on our south-east coast in great volume.  It is something about which we may well rejoice, because their disappearance from the traditional fishing grounds in England has created a strong demand in England for our fresh fish and has opened markets for our cured and processed fish which heretofore were relatively glutted.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which worries me a little.  We have the boats and we have the men, but it does not appear to me that this fortunate development of the arrival of the herring on our <Col N="1033" /> coast, contemporaneously with its disappearance from certain parts of the British coast, has been fully exploited by our own fishermen.  As far as I know, we are now in the ridiculous situation that we have the herring shoals and have a scarcity of herring, relative to the demand that exists in our own territory.  The Minister might have said a word about that.  I do not understand it.  It seems a shocking thing that the fish should be there and that our own boats should not go out and get it.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit excited by the announcement that the catch of whiting rose by 78 per cent. over the same quarter in 1957.  When I was Minister for Fisheries, I was exasperated by the quantity of small unsalable whiting that used to be dumped upon us. Some of the fellows would not go out beyond the whiting for good fish, but would sail out and collect a cart load of unsalable whiting, dump it on top of us and have a demonstration because they could not be purchased by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara at prices that would yield an immense profit.</P>
    <P>The arrival of great quantites of herring is a matter of great significance, but I believe at present, far from even meeting the demand for herring for the fresh market and for processing, we are not producing a surplus requisite to keep the fishmeal factory at Killybegs operating.  I see the Minister says that a fishmeal factory is being built at Killybegs.  The factory was started two years ago by a German firm, which came here in 1956, but I am told that although there is this great abundance of herring around our shores, we are not bringing in enough of it to provide the surplus requisite to keep the fishmeal factory in full operation.  The Minister ought to face that problem.</P>
    <P>I have always championed the rights of our fishermen in this House, but I am quite prepared to criticise them where criticism is due.  If the fish are there and if they have the boats and do not go out to get them, they ought to answer for their conduct.  The community here has been asked in the past, and is being asked now, to make quite substantial sacrifices to keep the <Col N="1034" /> fishermen in a state of relative prosperity, which they have been in for the last ten years, but there is a corresponding duty on them to use the equipment made available to them to the very best advantage.  If they do not do that, the Minister should tell us and should not recoil from his duty of seeing that what ought to be done is done.</P>
    <P>I am told there will be an exploratory fishing vessel.  The Minister spoke 27 pages long.  He said this vessel is to be delivered before the end of this year &ldquo;and I need scarcely say there will be a very extensive and important programme of work awaiting it &mdash; particularly in relation to herring.&rdquo; Now, what is the programme for it in relation to herring?  I think that is all ballyhoo &mdash; if the Minister had anything present to his mind, he would have told us what it was.  What is the important programme of work in relation to herring that awaits delivery of the £45,000 boat which is being purchased as an exploratory fishing vessel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is to look for and locate herring shoals that are known to exist and are no longer fished.  They were fished years ago. That is one of its purposes.  It will serve the whole herring industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to pour cold water on any scheme which has in it any germ of sense, but I am damned if I can understand why we want the boat to go out and search for shoals of herring <Col N="1035" /> when we know if the herring shoals are there, they will very quickly be found by anybody looking for them without an Irish exploratory vessel ploughing the Seven Seas to look for them.</P>
      <P>Let us come down to brass tacks. Great herring fishing fleets are being operated by every country in Europe, all looking for herring.  None of us knows where the herring are; they simply turn up.  None of us knows why they turn up or whence they come.  I very well remember suggesting that we should fertilise Galway Bay &mdash; I am not sure it was not right &mdash; and spread superphosphate on top of Galway Bay in order to maximise the growth of plankton known to draw into an enclosed body of water of that kind the small marine life on which pelagic and demersal fish live. It might never succeed but the thought occurred to me for the reason that when you are dealing with pelagic fish, it is a completely unresolved mystery why they shoal in certain places and an even greater mystery why herring shoal in places for generations, and suddenly in one year disappear.  I do not suppose an exploratory fishing vessel ploughing the Seven Seas looking for shoals of fish which the seagulls will find much more quickly will make any material contribution to that problem.  However, I do not want to pour cold water on anything the Minister said but I think he should tell us more about the purposes for which this £45,000 vessel is required, because I believe it is largely <i>brouhaha.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that he is training men as second hands on fishing boats.  Perhaps this is necessary now: I was trying to train skippers and I brought a man up from the marine division of the Army and put him to sea with the fishermen in an effort to get them trained.  He did train them.  I believe he subsequently resigned from the Army and became a fisherman himself because he found it such a remunerative occupation. I was never aware in my time that the urgent need was for second hands; what it appeared to me we <Col N="1036" /> wanted badly was skippers.  I wish the Minister success but I do not think he is going to engender very great enthusiasm in Ireland if he is to propose a five year course to train men to be second hands on fishing boats.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister is to establish a hatchery at Cong and that he anticipates this will in due course prove self-supporting.  We have had a hatchery at Glenties for the past 40 years which I understand is very efficiently run, but I have no recollection of its ever having been self-supporting. Perhaps I am wrong, but my recollection is that it requires a subvention every year of its existence and that, on the whole, it was thought the subvention was worth while.  I often wonder if these salmon hatcheries are of very real value.  I remember inspecting the hatchery at Glenties where they were stripping the fish, rearing fingerlings and working away as busy as a cow calving.  Suddenly somebody said: Did it ever occur to you.  Minister, that one good hungry pike sweeping through a lake would eat more salmon fry in an afternoon than this hatchery could produce in 12 months?&rdquo; I said that it had not occurred to me but he said it was so.</P>
    <P>I often stood and watched them taking out the salmon, solemnly stripping them and going through all the paraphernalia and it often occurred to me that if you let the poor salmon go on up the river and let her have her children where she was in the habit of having them, everything would be all right.  What is the purpose of these if you are trying to restock <i>ab initio</i> a river that had become denuded of fish.  That is really a transferring operation from one river to another; but I often wonder has the whole business of hatcheries been investigated as to whether they are a useful activity. There are two schools of thought and I do not profess to be sufficiently expert in regard to them to form a final opinion in this matter, but I never experienced any great urge when I was Minister for Fisheries to increase the number of hatcheries beyond the number we had at Glenties.  On the <Col N="1037" /> other hand, I never felt sufficiently strongly about it to direct that it should be closed down.</P>
    <P>I think it was started some years ago by some private person and taken over by the Department which has operated if for some time now. I have never been convinced that hatcheries serve any useful purpose, even though a good many people get &ldquo;het up&rdquo; and excited if you question the value of hatcheries because, at first glance, it seems to them so obvious.  But when you stop to think why you do not let the poor salmon go up river and have its family in peace and quiet, the answer appears to me to be a lemon.  What we want is to prevent the pirate fish eating the family, whether the family is born in the spawning bed or the hatchery and that, I think, the Inland Fishery Trust is very effectively doing.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister's observations about the bog pollution study.  What is the study?  The plain fact is that Bord na Móna have got the bit between their teeth and have said they do not give a damn about pollution and that they are going to pour more and more dirt into the Boyne River.  They are large employers and they are blooming well not going to submit to any kind of control.  I think they should be required to do so.  The situation on the Boyne is a great scandal and I believe that if Bord na Móna were required to refrain from river pollution as everybody else is, the problem would be easy to overcome by an adequate system of settling beds.</P>
    <P>What is wrong at present is that they are pouring unrestricted quantities of &ldquo;moolach&rdquo; into the Boyne, raising the acid level of water to a point which is almost inconsistent with the maintenance of fish life.  If an unfortunate flax scutcher up in Monaghan did that, he would be up before the District Justice in the morning.  He has to provide settling beds.  A creamery in the South of Ireland would be prosecuted ruthlessly and threatened with the removal of their licence if they did not provide the necessary settling beds <Col N="1038" /> to enable the milk solvent to settle out of an effluent before it was poured into an adjoining river.  However, Bord na Móna does not give a damn.  I would strongly urge upon the Minister to enforce the law and tell Bord na Móna that simply because they are under the aegis of Kildare Street they are not above the law and that if they pollute a river they will be prosecuted.  If you prosecute sufficiently often they will find a way very quickly of preventing the continued pollution of rivers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the fundamental research on Shannon salmon conducted by the Salmon Research Board of Ireland is progressing so satisfactorily, more especially as I had the pleasure of inaugurating it in collaboration, as the Minister says, with the firm of Messrs.  Arthur Guinness &amp; Son who, consistent with their well-known reputation for public spirit, have made a very valuable contribution to this desirable work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear the Foyle Fisheries Commission is now realising a comfortable profit, when I look back upon the fact that I established it.  In fact I am glad to read from the Minister's statement the satisfactory progress report of the valuable work here referred to, almost all of which I am happy to think the inter-Party Government of which I was a Minister had the prescience and the privilege of inaugurating: the Foyle Fisheries Board, the salmon research enterprise, the Inland Fishery Trust, and, I hope, the expansion of what used to be called our inshore fishing industry.  My present apprehension is that they may be destroyed by the Minister if he allows himself to be induced to stumble into the catastrophe of having a trawler industry established in this country.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Dillon on this subject before.  He was very strong on this idea of the inshore fishermen and the inshore fishing industry, and maintained that anything that would in any way interfere with that industry should not be tolerated.  We must look at it this way.  We have three markets for the products of the fishing industry.  First, we have the home consumption; secondly, we have the foreign market, which according to the Minister's statement is growing apace, and, thirdly, we have the industrial market, that is, the manufacture of fishmeal and of other products.  The production of fishmeal is an important industry, an industry which helps other industries within the country and if we are to go into the foreign market we must adopt some of the modern methods employed by other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot afford to compete in foreign markets with our fish if we adopt the older, more expensive and less scientific methods of catching fish that other nations have.  Therefore, as well as the inshore fishing fleets we must have the larger vessels.  These must be manned by experienced fishermen and they must have, above all, the latest devices by way of radar, echo sounders, and so on.  Take the case of the ordinary fisherman of <Col N="1041" /> which Deputy Dillon speaks, who with his sons goes out to fish in a 30- or 40-foot boat.  I do not think they can compete in foreign markets or in the fishmeal industry with the larger type of trawler manned by experienced and trained technicians and equipped with all the modern devices.  I do not think there is any hope that the family fisherman of whom Deputy Dillon speaks can compete in that activity.</P>

      <P>If we want to set up a further protected industry, we can do that but I maintain that we must have the other if we are to expand the fishing industry, increase exports of fish and satisfy the needs of the fishmeal factories and other factories which may be started based on the fishing industry.  What Deputy Dillon says is true, that the existing fishmeal factories cannot get supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Their set-up at the moment is such and the home and foreign markets are such that there is no surplus of fish for that industry. The only way to get fish for them is to get bigger boats so as to increase landings of herrings, for which there is a market in the three places I have mentioned &mdash; the home market, foreign markets and the fishmeal factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think that the boats at present available are being used to capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can judge from the Minister's statement, I think his policy in that regard is <Col N="1042" /> correct, that we must march with the times and, while we should not allow large foreign trawler fleets to be established in this country, I do not think there is any danger that huge combines will come into being within the country or will be fostered by the Minister's Department.  The Minister has stated that he will not allow foreign trawlers to operate from here, apart from landing fish at a time of shortage.</P>
      <P>The biggest obstacle to expansion at the moment is the non-availability of fishing boats.  The younger people are more interested in the fishing industry now than was the case heretofore. I know several young men who are trying to get boats from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There is long delay in that regard.  Some time ago I suggested that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should avail of some of the second-hand boats which can be found outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why cannot they get new ones built?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that many of the smaller private fishermen in Scotland and England have sold out to some of the bigger co-operative trawler combines and that, as a result, second-hand fishing boats of the 50 to 60 foot class and over are readily available at a reasonable price.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be empowered to purchase these boats and have them serviced, where necessary, and made available at prices much lower than those obtaining for new boats.  That would be a way of rapidly increasing our fishing fleet and would entice people who may not be prepared to purchase a new boat, the cost of which would be at least £12,000, to invest in a second-hand boat at half that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the work which is being done in regard to inland fisheries, the development of lakes and rivers.  In this regard the Inland Fisheries Trust must be complimented together with Bord Fáilte.  Angling Associations who, among other activities, run very successful fishing festivals, have contributed a great deal to this development. <Col N="1043" /> It is a development that is benefiting and improving the rivers and lakes of the country and clearing them of marauding fish.  It is improving the stocks of trout, salmon and so on.  The fact that good fishing exists on most of our lakes and rivers is being advertised by these festivals and many tourists, who hitherto spent their holidays on English lakes and rivers, very few of which are very good, the better ones being preserved, private property, find that excellent fishing is obtainable in this country. Some of them are greatly surprised to find that fishing on quite good rivers and lakes in this country is completely free.  The result is that over the last few years and particularly last year there was a very large influx of angling tourists.  Nothing pleases these people so much as to take part in a competition and to go home with a record and, perhaps, cups and medals to show for their holiday in this country.</P>
    <P>Any efforts which the Minister may make in regard to the training of fishermen and of fishing hands and experts with knowledge of navigation should meet with general support.  In that connection, an effort should be made to enlist the aid of the various vocational committees, especially along the western seaboard.  Some of these committees are already doing certain work along certain lines, but it is not altogether easy for them.  The cost is sometimes more than these vocational committees can bear.  If the Minister would make available to these committees persons who could give lectures and classes and generally train fishing trainees, that would go a long way towards solving the present problem. The other facilities needed could then be provided by the vocational committees themselves.</P>
    <P>I understand the course in Galway was a success and I should like to see more courses along the same lines instituted in other areas.  I would suggest in that connection that the courses should be, first of all, of shorter duration and, secondly, cover other subjects as well.  If a boy is given a short course, whether it be as a deck hand, <Col N="1044" /> in the engine rooms or in the navigational sphere, if he is really keen he will himself subsequently find other ways of increasing his knowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the Foyle Fishery Commission.  We are glad to note that that is working very successfully, both financially and otherwise. Last year the profits of the Commission were in the region of £20,000.  The Commission has been making money steadily since it commenced operations. As well as making money, it is developing the fishery at the same time.</P>
    <P>Some of us in touch with the fishermen along the Foyle feel that in some cases too stringent regulations are in operation.  During the year there was a change in the regulations; instead of the season opening in the middle of April the season was curtailed and a new opening date fixed for 1st May. Nothing in the records and nothing in the reports of the Foyle Fishery Commission would seem to warrant or justify any curtailment because the run of spring fish and the catches of spring fish on the various rivers are on the increase.  It is a pity the fishermen there would not be given an opportunity of getting some benefit from this increased run of fish which start to run from March until the end of April.  There is a break then and it is only about the beginning of June that any more fishing operations can be carried on.  The last fortnight of April would, therefore, give the fishermen there an opportunity of catching some of the earlier run fish.  At the moment, although the season has now been opened from 1st May, very few of the people who have taken out licences have gone near the river at all.</P>
    <P>It is not the licensed fishermen on the Foyle who are doing the greatest damage; these fishermen operate on a very wide stretch of the river there. Private netting on the river Finn is doing much more damage.  Instead of shortening the season down river, which really is tantamount to putting fishermen off altogether down river, this private fishery on the fresh waters of the River Finn should be purchased by the Commission and be brought in under the ordinary regulations governing operations on the Foyle.  That <Col N="1045" /> would be a better step to take towards preserving and improving the fishing on the Foyle network than any other action that could be taken.  However, there is nothing that can be done about that this year, but I suggest those two points should be kept in mind for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Killybegs is our premier fishing port and expenditure there has proved both successful and profitable.  There is one part of the Donegal coast &mdash; almost half the coast &mdash; about which we are worried. It extends from Downings right round to Lough Foyle.  All that coast line is being steadily neglected because of the absence of landing facilities.  We are trying to have the position remedied. The Minister is very much alive to the situation and I would urge that a decision in regard to Glengad and Greencastle should be taken at a very early date.  The provision of facilities in these places will fill a long felt want and will cater for that large section of coastline off which there are some of the finest fishing grounds in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Defence on having sent into the waters of Lough Foyle, for the first time in recent Irish history, the fishery patrol vessel &ldquo;Cliona&rdquo; carrying the Irish flag into the waters of Lough Foyle.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Buncrana had the greatest landings of herrings as compared with anywhere else.  For some reason that trade has disappeared.  I think one of the reasons is that the industry there was confined to Scotch fishing boats landing herrings at Buncrana and having them shipped subsequently to various markets elsewhere. Modern methods of fishing have obviated the necessity of landing fish at intermediate stages.  It is my belief that the fish are still there and the trawlers come along and catch them but, instead of landing them at Buncrana, they are now able to bring them back direct to the Scotch ports.</P>
    <P>An effort is being made to revive the fishing industry in Buncrana and along the Swilly.  A request was made to the previous Minister to have a survey carried out of all the fishing grounds in the mouth of Lough Swilly.  I do <Col N="1046" /> not think that is the correct approach. Even if fishing beds are to be found there, the best we can hope for is that some trawlers or some Irish fishing boats may come along but their catches will not be landed in Buncrana.  I have been advocating for some time that Sea Fishery boats which belong to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be lent.  We could start with a small nucleus like that, and if these boats are as successful as we are quite confident they will be, we feel that other private individuals will come along with a demand for further boats and, in that way, we can hope to revive, while some men with fishing experience are still there, the fishing industry there.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the emphasis was on the disposal of fish.  The difficulty was not in getting fish, but in disposing of it.  That difficulty has been solved, to a great extent, and we now find that the needs of the various markets we have, both inside and outside the country, are not filled by our catches. In future, our efforts should be directed of course to improving the markets, but, first of all, to increasing our catches by adopting better boats, better methods and by giving better technical training to the crews who will man them.</P>
    <P>Another thing that would improve the volume of our catches is an extension of the three-mile limit.  That is something all the fishing organisations throughout the country are advocating.  Everyone seems to be in favour of it, and it is something which, to my mind, would help very much in the improvement of our fishing industry.  It would mean that we could not only operate the inshore type of boats which Deputy Dillon talked about, but we could also operate side by side with them the larger type of boat.  I must say that with the three-mile limit, we hear and have heard in previous years, many complaints about the lack of protection given to fishermen and to the fishing beds inside our three-mile limit.  Over the past 12 months, except in one special case, the fishery patrol service has been doing a very good job and the fines which have been imposed in cases where captures have been made have been reasonably <Col N="1047" /> high, and have acted as a deterrent to those people who chanced coming inside the three-mile limit.  While it would be very difficult to patrol an extended limit, still the benefits which would accrue are so great that no opportunity should be neglected, when this matter is being discussed at international level, in backing up any suggestions or any plans which would enable us to have a much extended territorial limit.</P>
    <P>It must be very disappointing and discouraging for the Minister, having given us a very clear outline of what has been done and what is proposed for the coming year and, having during the course of the year done very good work, when he comes to render an account of his stewardship for a person like Deputy Dillon to get up and start off with the statement which Deputy Dillon used in his opening remarks. In the first place, that statement is not correct, and in the second place, it will do no good, and I for one would say to Deputy Dillon that it would have been better if that statement had not been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken misrepresents what Deputy Dillon said.  Deputy Dillon was very fair to the Minister and he congratulated him on the work he has done and made a really constructive speech.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he will tell us when he is replying what the position is with regard to salmon fishing in particular, where arterial drainage is carried out.  I suppose the Minister knows what I have in mind. In relation to the proposed arterial drainage of the Moy &mdash; I am not, I think, taking the Minister at a disadvantage when I ask him at this stage because a good deal of the work has been completed &mdash; in view of the fact that the Moy is, to my knowledge, the next of the seven, eight or ten rivers already completed or partially completed and that very serious opposition was raised on the question of the alleged destruction of the salmon fisheries, I should like the Minister to clear up that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the other rivers that <Col N="1048" /> have been done, I do not think any complaints have been received.  The Corrib, like the Moy, is also one of the best salmon rivers in Western Europe and at the time work was commenced on it, I do not think the same outcry was raised as is being raised in this instance.  For myself, I am seeking information because I do not know where the truth lies.  I do not know whether or not a good deal of the scare created has any substance behind it, and if people's livelihoods would be threatened, but I have a suspicion, and I should like the Minister to let me know if I am right or wrong in thinking that a good deal of the noise which has been created has no substance or foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>The second point to which I want to refer is that during the year, very good work has been carried out around some of the fishing lakes of the west &mdash; Lough Carra, Lough Mask and Lough Corrib &mdash; in the line of providing small piers and so on. Might I suggest to the Minister that is not even half of the work which is necessary.  The suggestion I make is that he could use some of the funds under Subhead F. (6) to improve the approach roads, steam-rolling them, if necessary.  That would be of terrific benefit to tourists.  It would be a terrific draw to tourists and it would increase the tourist potential of these lake areas.  The work done during the year certainly deserves great credit and it was work which needed to be done in the past.  I ask the Minister, if he can do so, to take it up with the local authorities or whoever is concerned, and to have the roads steam-rolled and improved right up to these piers.  If he does so, he will be making a very worth while contribution to the tourist business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us a very extensive review of fisheries but two things struck me as being absent from his statement, in so far as it relates to sea fisheries.  He has stated on previous occasions that there is a very rich harvest of fish off our coasts.  He has also stated that we have a good export market. <Col N="1055" /> The gist of his remarks on sea fisheries was that if we can build up a stronger sea-going fleet, then everything will be all right.  Does it not strike the Minister that there are two reasons why this state of affairs does not obtain here?  Mr. Whittaker's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> which is published by the Government, states the need for better harbour facilities for fishery purposes.  It also states that a review is being carried out by a Continental expert to ascertain whether those better facilities should be provided.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's long statement, covering a good many pages, he made no reference whatsoever to harbours or to what the Continental expert had advised.  Before people can be encouraged to invest their money in fisheries, in private enterprise which really is the ultimate aim in development as against State development, they must feel confident of protection. I understand that the Government are devoted to private enterprise &mdash; or so they have often told us.  There is only a very short statement relative to the protection of fishery grounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister must know that although there are increasing quantities of fish off our coasts there is considerable anxiety among fishery folk with regard to the inroads made on those grounds.  I do not necessarily mean to imply that overseas fishermen are coming inside our territorial waters as they exist at present.  What must be made crystal clear to the Minister by those who represent the fishery association and such Deputies as represent maritime constituencies is that these foreign trawlers with their extensive modern, up-to-date equipment, are doing considerable harm to the spawning grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those seem to me to be the two vital features connected with the development of our deep sea fishery industry.  The Minister, to my knowledge, having gone through his speech and listened to the greater part of it, did not refer to these things. Admittedly he referred, <i>ensemble,</i> to territorial waters.  He indicated he thought the Minister for External Affairs was introducing legislation <Col N="1056" /> soon to deal with the new rule or base territorial line but that does not make any vital contribution towards our difficulty.  Nobody will invest considerable sums of money in an enterprise unless there is sufficient protection. We protect our industries here. Why can we not protect our fishing industry as well?</P>
    <P>I am always told it is quite impossible for us to take any action on our own.  I know that any action that might be taken is not a matter for this Minister directly.  It would be more a matter for the Minister for External Affairs to initiate legislation or to take whatever action might be thought desirable.  But the Minister, as the Minister for Fisheries, as one who has espoused the cause of fisheries and is directly appointed to that task, has direct responsibility in the Government.  If he is to develop fisheries they must be fully protected.</P>
    <P>There have appeared in the past couple of years off our coasts considerable shoals of herring.  The Minister knows that as well as I do. He has been told it often enough or he sees it in the papers.  The general tendency towards fishery development in the world as a whole has produced a greater and more up-to-date type of craft.  I understand they are using a new type of netting which sweeps the floor bed and is highly injurious to spawning grounds.  In addition, it frightens the fish out of the area altogether.</P>
    <P>Another season will have come and gone before another international conference is held.  This is a matter of vital interest not only to the people I represent in a maritime constituency but whom my colleagues also represent, particularly on the South-East coast or in other maritime constituencies. Another herring season will have come and gone before we have another conference.  Briefly the position is that it is estimated by those who can get the information that there are approximately 1,000,000 tons of fish off the coasts of Wexford and Waterford.  It is also estimated that in the past two years 220,000 tons of fish have been caught there and that the greater part of that amount of fish has <Col N="1057" /> been caught by foreign trawlers.  It is further estimated that the heavy rate of fishing in the area where the majority of these fish are is bound to have an injurious effect in the destruction of the spawning grounds and the modern equipment is likely to drive the fish away.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to bear in mind as well that the reason these foreign trawlers are off our shores is because we have one of the few really fertile fishing grounds left in the North Atlantic.  Iceland has another.  They still have considerable quantities of fish and they have spawning grounds as well.  Perhaps if you want to seek a fertile fishing ground after Ireland you will have to go as far South as the Canary Islands.  The demand for fish and for processing fish is very heavy. There is an ever increasing number of trawlers as a result of the investment of capital in this industry in other countries.  Naturally they will come to those places where the fish are.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Council of Europe.  I am a member of the Committee of Agriculture of the Council of Europe.  Recently we had a discussion in Committee and in the Plenary Session in Strasbourg on the subject of fisheries.  I raised this matter in Committee.  Fifteen nations took part in the discussions.  I put the Irish point of view as I am putting it to the House now.  I pointed out that we have the fish here and that, on our present territorial waters basis, dangerous fishing is taking place on the very edge of our territorial waters where the spawning grounds are, mainly, and that there would be considerable destruction of these grounds. In other words, I made it clear that, by leaving us as we are without an international agreement they, in effect, are killing that fishing area.  I pointed out that they were destroying the fish and other amenities as well.</P>
    <P>I met with considerable sympathy in that Committee.  No dissenting voice was raised among all the other people there.  They suggested to me to bring up the matter again at the Plenary Session, which I did, under the same conditions, and again no dissenting voice was raised.  I did not bring up the <Col N="1058" /> matter by suggesting we should deny our responsibilities and depend on territorial waters because I was not in a position to do so.  In the first place, I was not speaking for the Government and, in the second place, as a result of Parliamentary Questions asked in this House, it was obvious to me that the Government did not intend to take any direct action on the matter.  What I did bring up at this international Assembly was the suggestion that the United Nations should be asked to take an early decision on the matter of territorial waters.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that two conferences have taken place.  As far as my information, which I believe to be correct, goes, it is really only a matter of whether they can reach common agreement, if all countries are agreed that it would be desirable to extend territorial waters to six miles. A great many of the countries consider that the extension should be to 12 miles but they cannot reach general agreement on that matter.  Whatever the rules of this conference are, they apparently cannot get international agreement unless everyone is in full agreement.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point. The major portion of our marketing of fish is to Britain.  Fishing conditions have changed somewhat in Britain from what they were heretofore.  The British Navy, that is, the Royal Navy, the permanent force there, existed always on the reserve personnel from the fishing fleets.  Fisheries were very largely subsidised and received huge sums of money.  The controlling head was usually a retired admiral who had considerable experience in those matters.  In those days, it was necessary for Britain to secure permanent personnel to man the boats in times of emergency.  Things have since changed. There is not the same demand for sea personnel as heretofore, with the result that the British industry is not as heavily subsidised as before.  Therefore, there is a large potential not only for us but for every country in Europe, in the export of fishery catches to Britain.  That seems to be the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts, it does seem to me to be reasonable to <Col N="1059" /> suggest, and I am submitting it to the Minister who is the member of the Government associated with fisheries as part of his collective responsibility, that there seems to be no reason why we should not have a bilateral agreement with Britain with regard to our territorial waters.  We would not be breaking a treaty with anybody by doing so.  Exactly the same thing happened with regard to the Faroe Islands.  They agreed to an extension of their territorial waters, but it would be to the interest of both countries if we extended our waters.  We have fish; we want to protect those fish and to develop our fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with that, but the case I am trying to make is that Britain wants fish and that we have fish.  We can catch the fish if we are protected and that is the interest of the Minister and the responsibility of the Minister.  I do not see anything in the Minister's statement today to suggest that it is possible to expand on those lines, unless he thinks in the direction I am thinking now, but as always, in deference to the Chair, I shall not discuss the point any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go now to the question of harbours.  We have no harbour in <Col N="1060" /> County Wexford which is fully protected from winds.  We have one or two harbours which may have protection against winds from a particular direction but they are vulnerable, at the same time, to winds from other directions.  If we are to expand our fleets and to be able to go into deep sea fishing, which appears to be the ideal at which the Minister aims, we shall have to provide harbours for our fishermen.  Otherwise, we shall concentrate our fishing boats in the one area.  There is no deep sea anchorage from Dublin to Waterford, that I know of anyway, and unless you concentrate fishing fleets and fishing personnel in particular areas, you will not expand the fishing fleet.  If there is a rich harvest around our shores and all that potential for the development of that type of industry, surely this is one of the things that require not delayed action but immediate action.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now been in office for two years.  I believe that he is doing his best to develop the fishing industry, but why is there always delay?  Why is it, when you have a White Paper issued by a Government in which it says that one of the potentialities for increasing our economy is the further development of our fishing fleets, that no substantial sum of money has been allocated?  Why have there been no plans for developing our harbours?  If we are to start fish processing here, we shall have to concentrate on the area where the fish are.  Already there is one fish processing factory in the country.  As far as my knowledge goes, it is in Galway and there are no fish in Galway at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there was a pilot scheme for fish in, I think, Dunmore East, or somewhere like that, and that it had been tried out.  Now as I read his report, I see that it is to be moved to Kinsale.  Perhaps I am wrong in that, but certainly you cannot put the cart before the horse.  The first thing you have to do is concentrate on the catching of the fish, on the exporting and processing of the fish, where the fish are, and to do that, you have to provide the facilities where the fish are.  I see nothing in the Minister's statement to suggest that he is paying <Col N="1061" /> due attention to any particular area whatsoever.  I cannot really see anything in the Minister's speech &mdash; and I am referring to deep sea fishing &mdash; to suggest that there is any likelihood of any great development in deep sea fishing.</P>
    <P>True enough, there is a sum of £25,000 for an additional fishing boat which has been questioned by Deputy Dillon this afternoon.  The Minister indicated that it is for the purpose of sounding out where the fish are.  It does not make sense to me that we should want a boat specially for the purpose of finding out where the fish are.  We saw what happened recently. We had the fleets of the world off the east coast.  One of the trawlers &mdash; I think it was a German one &mdash; operated its Asdic sounding apparatus and discovered where the fish were.  It sent out the information on its wireless and that brought in the other fishing fleets which picked up the message.  Why do we want to spend that money on an experimental boat?  It may be that there are other reasons for it but if it is solely for the purpose of locating fishing beds, then I think the money could be spent on something else.</P>
    <P>Before I leave sea fisheries I want to say that if this Government are really serious with regard to the development of the sea fishing industry and really mean to make an exhaustive drive to give considerable employment and to encourage private enterprise to invest in it, I do not think there is anything like a sufficient sum of money available as matters stand at present. I stand subject to correction on this matter.  When replying perhaps the Minister will say where the fish are and what are his plans for the immediate development of that area.</P>
    <P>As far as inshore fisheries are concerned, the development of that potential to aid tourism by stocking lakes and so on, I think some progress has been made.  What Deputy Dillon said is perfectly true.  Deputy Dillon started that, but the Minister has made a good effort to work along those lines and encourage fishing as much as possible.  I am particularly glad to see that coarse fishing is being <Col N="1062" /> developed in this country, but I think an effort should be made to eliminate entirely destructive pests such as pike. The damage they can do is untold.</P>
    <P>I am fortunate to own a small lake of three or four acres myself.  I have plenty of small trout in it.  The lake has been there for a great many years. I have had to do nothing with it.  It is always reasonably supplied with trout because there never has been coarse fish in it yet.  It would be desirable to eliminate coarse fish from our fresh water lakes as far as possible. That applies not only to pike but to perch and other fish.  They can do absolutely untold damage.  As Deputy Dillon said, they can destroy in one afternoon as much fish as you could put into a lake in 12 months.  A 12 lb. pike could account for a four lb. trout without any difficulty.  Any action the Minister takes in that regard will be welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no industry of greater interest to us who reside on the western seaboard than the fishing industry.  We have at our hands the raw material in profusion for the expansion of what should be one of our main industries in this country. As everybody knows, especially those living on the western seaboard, an <Col N="1063" /> expansion of that industry would mean a reduction in emigration and more employment in areas where industries are few and far between. The fishing industry can create employment, add to the national wealth and stem emigration, something that is very desirable as far as the congested areas and the Gaeltacht areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his excellent report on what he terms a highly productive service, namely, the fishing industry.  His approach to the problems of this important industry since he took office has been stimulating and, as I have already said, his efforts have been welcomed by fishermen and those who have an interest in the expansion of this industry.  His visit to the western seaboard some months ago was welcomed.  It is pleasing to note that many of the points raised by the fishermen have been dealt with. These points were very varied, dealing with the provision of new boats and various arrangements in Donegal, for instance, the provision of beacons and pilot lights at the approaches to our smaller harbours and other matters that have been a source of trouble and annoyance to the fishermen engaged there for many years.  We are glad that these points are at last being dealt with, and the fishermen are grateful for the interest the Minister is taking in their problems.</P>
    <P>We were very glad to see that last year in Donegal we had one of our best herring seasons for many years. Other parts of the country participated in that harvest as well as Donegal. In the course of the debate here some Deputies mentioned the fact that herrings had the unfortunate habit of disappearing very quickly and appearing again in other places where they were not expected.  Although there may be no good reason for their disappearing in that way, fishermen feel that they disappear because the waters in which they have been spawning have been over-fished.  Perhaps that is the reason they have left the English coast and suddenly appeared on the Irish coast.  It would be a grave disappointment <Col N="1064" /> to all of us, and particularly the fishermen concerned, if as a result of the overfishing of Irish waters, which I am afraid has taken place at some of the ports on the east coast, the herring would disappear from there as quickly as from the English waters.</P>
    <P>Deputies also mentioned the question of the fishmeal factories and the fact that they were not in full production. We in Donegal were very glad that the fishmeal factory at Killy-begs was not occupied fully or even for part of the time during this season. That meant that the fishermen were getting, and are continuing to get, better prices for their herrings and had not to resort to the fishmeal factories where the price offered is indeed very small.  If we were to depend on the fishmeal factories to keep our fishermen fully occupied, I am afraid the industry would fall to pieces on the western seaboard.  As everyone should know, fishmeal factories are not the foundation stone of a much needed expansion of the herring industry. What is needed is an export market and in that connection I must again congratulate the Minister on the efforts he has made in obtaining markets abroad for our herring fisheries.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that interest is being taken in the development of lobster fishing.  Certainly, people in the West of Ireland and in the Gaeltacht areas of County Donegal should benefit, because as the Minister said, the smaller economic boats are suitable for that type of fishing and these are available on all the islands along the coast.  I hope the people will take full advantage of the lobster fishing which can be one of the most lucrative ends of the industry.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will remember that when in Burtonport, Kincasslagh and Bunbeg some months ago, he was told by fishermen in all these places of the necessity for the establishment of processing plants and canning stations at the smaller harbours.  This would go a long way towards helping the industry and would take care of any gluts that might take place from time to time.  It is one of the facets of the industry that have not been dealt with <Col N="1065" /> yet in a serious way by the Department and I hope that in the coming year something will be done along that line.</P>
    <P>Very little was said on this occasion regarding the poacher who does so much harm to the salmon industry by taking a salmon now and again from the rivers.  I agree that everybody in the Dáil would set their faces sternly against the organised type of poaching that has grown up here over the last five or six years.  Everything that can be done to deal with that type of poacher should certainly be done. Poachers do great harm to our rivers and the full rigours of the law should be employed to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Another facet of the salmon industry is the netting in our estuaries.  That, I believe if pursued, can be a system of poaching very detrimental to the future of the rivers.  If poachers at one end of the river do so much harm and should be dealt with, I think some steps should be taken also to ensure that the owner of the salmon fishery will give a guarantee that he will not over-fish the estuary.  The decline in salmon catches in many rivers is due to over-netting and there does not seem to be any way so far as I know of dealing with these people who are ruining their own property and a very valuable national industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the inland fisheries have come so much into the picture in recent years.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister he very rightly gave this precedence as one of the finest assets to our tourist trade and I am sure the present Minister thinks along the same lines.  Every help should be given to people to fish our rivers and lakes. Schoolboys should be encouraged to take up this type of sport because it would mean in years to come the development of an industry that would be of great value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Estimate referred to imports. I think that was a development about which quite a number of Deputies were rather surprised.  People, especially those not intimately acquainted with the fishing industry, take the view that the problem is to <Col N="1066" /> get a market for the fish caught in our waters and that there is little or no question of any deficiency arising.  It is rather disturbing to hear from the Minister that we have a little import problem also.  I think the greatest danger that faces the industry is connected with that import problem.  In the first place it leads to irregularity of supply and, as the Minister has pointed out, it upsets the continuity of an estimate made on the home market.</P>
      <P>I think it is about time that a serious examination were made of the reason for imports of fish, particularly at certain periods of the year.  There are, I think, two reasons.  The first is that our fishermen have not been prepared in the past to exert themselves as much as might reasonably be expected by going quite a distance out to sea and staying there for some days to get the fish and bring it back in large quantities as foreign fishermen do.  The second reason probably is that we have not the necessary facilities for cold storage of fish when obtained in abundant quantities.  The industry is one that has been built up after many years' hard work by successive Governments and if we have now reached a stage when we still have a problem with regard to supply I think it is time we should handle it.</P>

    <P>A number of Deputies have pleaded that canning stations and processing plants should be erected at certain fishing ports.  I wish to add my voice to that plea.  I was rather disappointed that the Minister made no reference today to the possibility of installing a quick-freezing plant at Dingle.  That equipment has been promised to Dingle port for a number of years and while some progress has been made &mdash; to the extent that a site has been obtained and conveyed to the ownership of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; no further steps have been taken to install this plant.  A number of Dáil Questions elicited information from the Minister which indicated that the supply of fish at Dingle did not seem to be sufficient under present circumstances to warrant erection of such a plant.  I am glad to learn, however, that the Minister has made provision in the current year's Estimate for the amount of money necessary to install the plant.  I have <Col N="1067" /> been informed locally that there are reasons for supposing that the supply of fish is not sufficient in Dingle to warrant the erection of a plant.  The absence of a plant to some extent has brought about that state of affairs.  The information I have from the fishermen is that when there is a supply of fish which cannot be marketed, the fishermen find themselves obliged to accept an uneconomic price.  It has been suggested that a plant should be made available which could take this fish into cold storage and in which it could be processed, and that a general standard price should be obtainable at various periods for catches.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for the setting up of smaller plants in the line of canning stations which have been recommended here by other Deputies. I do hope that when the Minister is taking action in that connection, the small fishing ports in county Kerry will not be lost sight of, particularly Dingle, which is a well-known port and which has been dying because there are no local industries and the sea port business has been in decline for years. Such an industry, even a small industry of the type suggested here, would be a welcome asset to the town of Dingle. I hope the Minister will see that every effort possible will be made to erect this deep freeze station which has been expected at Dingle for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the unsatisfactory results in regard to the recruitment of trainees as boat skippers.  One would have expected that, with the very big problem of unemployment, the recruitment of these trainees would have been regarded as a good opening for young lads of 17 or 18 years of age.  The scheme was well publicised and I am rather surprised that, with all these advantages, only a dozen candidates or so presented themselves for training. It is a well-known fact that when boys of a similar age have gone into comparable employment abroad, they found themselves in receipt of substantial remuneration.  I have made inquiries in fishery districts from fishermen and their sons as to why <Col N="1068" /> the younger boys were not inclined to apply for the training that was available through this scheme.  The argument was that in the first instance the payment being made to trainees was not sufficient, and in the second place, the future of fishing was anything but bright.</P>
    <P>The first argument falls flat because the rate of pay made to these trainees who are really only apprentices is considerably more than would be given in any industry or trade.  As regards the second argument, this pessimism about the future of the fishery industry as a whole is to be regretted. We must all agree that the industry has at least been holding its own. Certain sections of the industry might have a recession from time to time, but in other sections, you will find there has been considerable advance. Perhaps progress has not been very spectacular, but any industry which shows gradual progess as this industry has been showing is one that holds a future to some extent for those people who are prepared to go into it.  It is especially important that the sons of fishermen should be induced to go forward for training under the scheme. They have certain advantages that boys outside fishing areas would not have and eventually when they have completed their course of training, they should make very good fishermen.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad the Minister referred today to the question of cooking.  I hope the Minister will be able to make some arrangement with the vocational schools to impart the necessary instruction in this connection. The people who are engaged in the hotel business and catering generally seem to know very little about how fish should be cooked.  A foreigner to whom I was speaking some time ago and who has a good knowledge of this matter told me that no matter how efficient our organisation or our marketing arrangements were, two things were necessary. The first was that we should maintain a fairly regular supply of fish and the second, which was actually more important, that we would have to train housewives and hotel cooks in the correct way to cook and serve <Col N="1069" /> fish.  I am glad the Minister has found it possible to deal with that question of which we have been losing sight in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the Cong hatchery and rearing station. The people in the South of Ireland have long been expecting some development from the Department of Fisheries in that connection.  I am not quite clear as to the full line of activity that will be undertaken by the Cong hatchery and rearing station, but from the very title it appears to be exactly what some areas in the South, where fish is a very important part of the local economy, have been expecting for some years.  Perhaps there is scope for further expansion in that connection and if there is, I exhort the Minister to remember the interest the southern fishermen have in having established such a hatchery and rearing station.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the effect arterial drainage seems to have on the fishery potential of a river.  I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy.  From my information, the damage is not as drastic generally as seems to be complained of by fishermen in the west of Ireland.  Part of my constituency is adjacent to the River Feale which was drained under the Arterial Drainage Act and I have the authority of certain fishermen to say that the damage generally caused is not too extensive.  It has to be admitted, however, that some damage was caused and the arterial drainage section of the Office of Public Works has some responsibility to local fishermen and I should like to enlist the Minister's assistance in this connection.</P>
    <P>Valuable salmon pools which were in the river in question for a number of years disappeared largely after the drainage work was carried out.  Since then, repeated applications have been made by local angling associations to the Office of Public Works for a renewal of these pools.  So far, no action has been taken in the matter and, to that extent, fairly considerable loss of salmon has been caused.  It is suggested that if the pools that disappeared could be remade or partly remade in the river, it would lead to <Col N="1070" /> a considerable increase in the number of salmon and a consequent improvement in the returns of fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to one very particular aspect of fishing.  He indicated that steps had been taken to deal with bog pollution.  The effluent from boglands has been causing a good deal of trouble in fishery rivers.  Local people are convinced that considerable damage has been caused.  The Department was rather slow to accept that that was the case.  It is satisfactory that it has accepted it at long last and that steps are about to be taken to correct the matter.</P>
    <P>One thing that impresses me in regard to the fishing industry in general is the volume of public co-operation that is forthcoming.  I refer, particularly, to the fact that in recent years fishermen have come together and formed responsible angling associations.  At one time, such angling associations were merely protective associations to focus attention on imaginary grievances and to protest where people were prosecuted for illegal activities.  Thank goodness, that is no longer the case.  I was very happy to have the opportunity recently of being present at the annual meeting of an angling association.  The general trend of the proceedings showed a radical change from the position that obtained ten or 15 years ago.  The angling association impressed me very much by the manner in which it conducted its annual meeting and their realistic approach to the problems presented for consideration and genuine offers of co-operation with the central authority and the boards of conservators with whom they have to deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just coming to that.  I think Deputy Dillon for the reminder.  Local angling associations, generally speaking, were not aware of what important organisations such as the Inland Fishery Trust and Bord Fáilte and other bodies of that kind were doing for the fishing industry up to a few years ago. Because of the fact that they have had <Col N="1071" /> occasion to come into contact with these bodies, there is a different spirit prevailing, a spirit of co-operation which was so long absent from this whole business.  In the matter of sea angling, there is a marked advance due to local co-operation, backed up by the technical assistance available from Bord Fáilte.  In Dingle, which is part of my constituency, a most successful sea angling festival was held last year. The festival is being held again this year.  A most energetic committee have already got to work, they have collected prizes, have made first-class arrangements for the carrying out of the festival and have already attracted a considerable number of entries.  We cannot have too many of that type of festival.  Such festivals attract outside people into this important industry of fishing.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to endorse wholeheartedly the appeal made by Deputy Blowick this afternoon with regard to access to fishery resorts such as piers or rivers.  That is very important and I congratulate Deputy Blowick on referring to it.  Unfortunately, the roads leading to such places are, on the whole, not in good condition. I do not know why that should be, but, generally speaking, it is almost impossible to find a road leading into a fishery pier or river that is in good condition.  I would join with Deputy Blowick in appealing to the Minister to work out some scheme with the Department of Local Government to have such roads classified and given priority for such grants as tourist grants or county road improvement grants. Personally, I think such roads should qualify for tourist grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not here for the Minister's speech.  I assure you that I shall be very brief and I hope the matter I want to deal with will be in order.  All that the Minister has done to increase the consumption of fish is very laudable but for some time past I have been asked to table questions on the subject of the price of fish.  It would seem that in the first three months of this year, a considerable quantity of fish was imported to the Dublin market.  Although the fish came from Holland, it was sold at a price 100 per cent. cheaper than the price at which our own fish was sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a little extreme &mdash; 100 per cent. cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between 3/6d. and 7/- would work out at that percentage.  I have listened to the 9 o'clock news from Radio Eireann giving the prices of fish on the Dublin market.  I have heard brill and turbot being quoted at 1/- and 1/3d.  In most of the fish shops around the centre of the city on the same day, the price was 5/6d., 6/- and 6/6d.  The price of mackerel was quoted in the market report as 5/- and 6/- a stone and I have paid 3/6d. for three mackerel.  On making inquiry, I was informed that there would be no fewer than 28 mackerel to the stone.  There, you have mackerel at 5/- to 6/- per lb.  I myself paid 3/6d. for three mackerel.  I mentioned mackerel, but in January, February and March filleted plaice was 7/6d. per lb.  Yet that plaice, imported from Holland, was as low as 3/6d. per lb. in the market.</P>

      <P>There is obviously need for intervention on somebody's part to remedy the present unsatisfactory situation.  We are appealing to the people to eat more fish.  At the same time, we are denying them the opportunity of eating fish even on Friday.  I know little or nothing about the fishing industry, but I do know what is happening both with regard to the price of fish and with regard to the availability of fish, even in coastal counties.  In Ennis, for instance, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get many of the fish I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I received a complaint some months ago from an outstanding fish merchant in the City of Dublin.  A contract had been accepted for the export of two tons of eels.  The firm got in touch with the E.S.B.  In their storage tanks there was an abundance of eels.  Yet, though that firm were prepared to pay 1/- per lb. more than was being received from other buyers, they were told they could have only one cwt.</P>
      <P>I prefaced my remarks with the qualification that I know little or nothing about the fishing industry.  Nevertheless, I know that there are complaints. I know that there are factors which are militating against the poorer sections of our community consuming fish.  That is particularly true of Dublin city.  I hope that, apart from what he has done up to now, the Minister will endeavour to ensure that in future there will be no justification for the exorbitant prices charged for fish in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been a very friendly and a very helpful one and I do not think there is very much that I need say at this stage.  However, I should like to deal with the suggestion <Col N="1074" /> made by Deputy Dillon that the policy of encouraging larger boats may destroy the inshore fishing industry.  I have no intention of destroying the inshore industry.  Neither do I think that the introduction of 60- to 80-foot middle water trawlers will have any ill-effects on the inshore industry.  There is an enormous unfulfilled demand for fish throughout the country.  That demand has grown of late as a result of improved standards of living since the war.  Yet the demand cannot be supplied regularly.  Equally, there is a growing export market arising from the same reason.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why we should not co-ordinate the work of the larger trawlers with the existing inshore fleet so that both can prosper.  My whole purpose is, in fact, to see that fishing of every kind prospers here.  Long before the advent of any proposal for larger trawlers, a situation had developed in which one could see a decline in fishing by those fishermen who only fished part-time in the smaller harbours. Over the last 10 years there has been a decline in that kind of fishing.</P>
      <P>In so far as the measure of the inshore fishing is concerned, I see no reason why it should be damaged by the advent of larger trawlers.  I am not thinking in terms of large steam trawlers and there is no proposal at the moment for large ocean-going trawlers, penetrating right up to Newfoundland or Iceland.  It is simply a question of extending the fleet by encouraging skippers to take grants and arrange for hire purchase of the kind of boats which can go further away from the coast and fish on the Porcupine Bank and the Grand Sole Bank, and go even further up for tunny fishing, thereby extending the area of fishing.  Surely, that should be possible.</P>
      <P>The nations of the world are catching fish all round our coast.  There are roughly four major exporters of fish to Europe and the importing countries take 456,000 tons of fish per year. Within that ambit there should be opportunities for export from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked about the work of the exploratory boat.  We are the only nation without such a vessel.  The object of the exploratory boat is not <Col N="1075" /> pure scientific research.  It is rather the really practical work of ascertaining the movements of herring.  We know the herring exist but they are not fished.  One of the reasons why they are not fished is because the fishermen got out of the habit of fishing for herring.  They are not prepared to take a very large commercial risk in going out to look for herring, with all the changes involved in gear and so forth.</P>
    <P>The exploratory boats which operate for the Norwegian Government have had a practical significance.  They have traced the herring shoals.  They have traced the movements of cold and warm currents.  They have followed the movements of the herring and they have been of practical assistance in developing an enormous industry in which, if I remember rightly, the catch of herring in one particular year off the Norwegian coast was 240,000 tons in a particular month.  We may not ever achieve anything like that, but we can use this exploratory boat for doing work which it is impossible to ask fishermen to do because they cannot risk either their capital or their time in making what may be purely experimental journeys.  Deputy Dillon may probably know that at one time herring were fished in Killala Bay.  The matje herring was fished off the Donegal coast.  That ceased, but we have no reason to believe that the herring are not still there.  The same may be true also in the case of other fish species.  I can assure the House the work of the boat will be purely to assist fishermen to fish more profitably and successfully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke of Bord na Móna and the effect of the turf effluent.  Unfortunately we have observed that the mere provision of settling beds is not sufficient.  The matter gets washed away very rapidly and the purpose of the investigation work is to see whether or not we need better types of settling beds, whether the material may have to be dredged or whether various types of coagulants may possibly have the satisfactory effect of eliminating the effluent.  It will be a fairly complex business, but I can <Col N="1076" /> assure the Deputy and the House that Bord na Móna are showing very great co-operation in this matter and that they will work with the Department in a very sympathetic way to try to prevent the turf effluent from damaging new rivers where effects have already been seen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also asked a question with regard to the training course.  The course is not sufficiently advanced for fishermen to qualify for skipper's certificates. They, therefore, receive certificates as second hands.  So far as we are concerned, the training they receive is so much more extensive than that which was available before, that they should be able to take over 56-foot boats and act as skippers, even though their certificates qualify them as second hands.  That was the position in the case of trainees under the Gaeltacht scheme mooted by this Government before Deputy Dillon took office but which was carried out by him.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke about arterial drainage.  In particular, Deputy Blowick talked about the Moy fishery. The position there is that under the Arterial Drainage Act the Board of Works consult the Fishery Section of the Department of Lands on the effect of arterial drainage upon any particular fishery.  It is impossible for me to make any definite statement about the position of the Moy because the final consultations have not taken place.  As most Deputies know, the amount of damage caused by arterial drainage depends on the natural conditions in the river, the extent of the drainage, very considerably on the method of drainage and the extent to which the drainage authority carry out their work in such a way as to permit spawning to continue at the correct season during the rotational work done on each tributary.</P>
    <P>The damage can be put right to some extent&mdash;to a considerable extent, in many cases, by restocking and because of the fact that the spawning beds seem to come back on a natural basis by the establishment of an artificial spawning gravel, by the establishment of new beds of gravel, and by other means.  It is true that a number of the rivers that have been drained <Col N="1077" /> have since had very satisfactory runs of fish.  I am unable to say any more about the Moy fishery except to point out that the agricultural production which can be brought about by that drainage scheme is of very great importance to the community.  At the same time, the fishery itself is of very great value to the country and there will have to be a reconciliation as far as possible between the two interests in order that the greatest amount of good can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made some observations on harbour development. Really major steps have been taken to provide a number of satisfactory harbours and the Deputy can take it for granted that one will be constituted in the south east coast in relation to the herring fishery there.  There is now a much larger staff in the Board of Works and they are catching up on the tremendous arrears of harbour investigation which had accrued; they have been aided, in turn, by a consultant who has been able to present an overall picture of harbour needs so that, with more officials in the Board of Works working on it, we will get a considerable extension in harbour development work.</P>
    <P>I become very impatient at the time it takes to do public works of any description but I know that, in the case of harbours, it is quite evident that when they were first constructed they were not constructed with sufficient care.  Many of them were designed by able men, but they simply did not go far enough into the complications, into the movements of the sea and sand.  Therefore they did not design harbours which would protect the boats when the wind was in a certain direction.  It may sound fantastic &mdash; I hate to think about it because it will cause delay&mdash;but we have to get an actual model of the harbour built, with artificial water lapping against it, before we can make any decision.  That is now the recognised practice and the most hardheaded engineers have to accept it in works of this kind.  It invariably prolongs the final decision on the design, and the final work being carried out.  As I say, there are more <Col N="1078" /> good men on the job than ever before and I hope they will produce results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke on the question of oysters.  I find that he was right in that some time ago experiments were carried out by the late Mr. Farran at a number of places including Killary but the results were inconclusive and it was left to the local people to develop the beds.  There is a long term experiment at Clew Bay which is designed to ascertain the most favourable conditions for oyster growing, namely, the temperature, the heat and the nature of the sea bed and whether profitable conservation could be undertaken.</P>
    <P>As some members of the House may know 100 years ago oysters were the food of the poor.  In Great Britain some 500 million were sold but the number is now reduced to 8,000,000 by over-fishing and by the great virus plague which swept their coast and our coast also.  The experiments carried out in Clew Bay and in Great Britain have not had very pleasing results. Under conditions which obtained before the oysters were supposed to breed with facility and with great propensity. I hope to examine the question as to whether we could not in addition to carrying out these breeding experiments fatten the oysters deliberately by putting down the beds not specifically for breeding.  We may undertake that at a later date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made several references to the necessity for the protection of the Dunmore East fishery.  I have every sympathy with what the Deputy said but the whole question of the extent to which we collaborate with another country bilaterally in regard to conservation and territorial limits and the whole question of establishing territorial limits is a matter for the Minister for External Affairs.  If Deputies drew a straight base line around the coast of the country which is notional they may make mistakes when it comes to what the practice should be in relation to the laws established. They will see there should be some considerable improvement already, and I hope that there will be satisfactory results from the conference in 1960, <Col N="1079" /> but I do want to make it clear that we do not intend to do anything unilaterally, under our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the very small number of persons coming forward for training.  The training scheme has been going only a short time, the full scheme of training, and I hope that it will be more popular later on. Of course, a career in fishing involves not only personal courage, but a particular liking for the sea, for the adventurous and hazardous life of the sea and, though a good income can be got in the case of a first class skipper with a good crew, it is not the sort of life which appeals to everybody.  However, I believe there should be a sufficient number of people around our <Col N="1080" /> coasts who would like to go into fishing and I hope this course will attract more as time goes by.  I also hope the new course for apprentices, for fishing hands, will result in young men coming forward who have not experience of the sea.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points that were raised.  Any other observations made by Deputies, I shall have considered as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 9th June, 1959.</P>
