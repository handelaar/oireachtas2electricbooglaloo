      <P>I have received no complaints whatever of inferior footwear, differing from samples, having been exported.  I am fully satisfied that there is no justification for any such allegation.  My information is that the reputation of our boot and shoe manufacturers stands very high in the countries to which their products are exported; and, indeed, the implications of the Deputy's question are wholly inconsistent with the large and growing volume of footwear exports disclosed by recent trade returns.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has not issued a standard specification for shoes, though they have done so for men's heavy boots.  It is doubtful whether men's and women's shoes are suitable subjects for standard specifications.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for transfer of contributions from Great Britain made during 1957-58, for the purpose of obtaining unemployment benefit, was 10,180.</P>
      <P>Under the reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain relating to disability benefit, where an insured person moves from one country to the other and claims benefit, the claim is proper to the first country until the claimant has been resident in the second country for six months.  The insurance is then due for transfer to the second country and that country becomes liable to pay benefit in respect of claims.</P>
      <P>Where a person insured under the Irish Acts goes to employment in Great Britain but returns before the expiration of six months in that country any claim to benefit made by him is proper to this country and takes contributions paid in Great Britain into account.  In the year 1957-58 there were approximately 4,700 such persons.</P>
      <P>Where a person who was insured under the British Acts completes a period of six months in this country and in consequence has his British insurance transferred to this country, his insurance is treated as Irish insurance and claims to disability benefit made by him are then proper to this country.  Approximately 8,700 insured persons had their British insurance transferred in the year 1957-58.</P>
      <P>As records of British insurance are not kept separately from the main records of insurance in my Department, it is not possible to state how many of such persons claimed disability benefit in the year 1957-58.</P>

      <P>Information about disability and dental benefits is normally obtainable from local agents.  In an area where a vacancy for a local agent exists and the area is being administered for the time being by the headquarters of the Department, every insured person is advised by letter that claim forms for disability, marriage, maternity and treatment benefits may be got at his nearest employment exchange, branch employment office or social welfare officer station.</P>

      <P Just="Center">ARTICLE 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> 1.  In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.</P>
    <P>2.  The drawing of such baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the régime of internal waters.</P>
    <P>3.  Baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them.</P>
    <P>4.  Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under the provisions of paragraph (1), account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by a long usage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the numbers and names of local authorities who have adopted a scheme for the payment of grants to those reconstructing and/or improving old houses, and for the granting of loans to those purchasing such premises; if he is aware that the delay of local authorities in not adopting such schemes is holding up building operations with consequent unemployment, and is causing dissatisfaction to would-be applicants; and if he will consider publishing in concise form particulars of the grants and loans available when such a scheme is adopted, and of the steps to be taken by intending applicants.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities are not required to submit for my approval schemes for the making of supplementary grants to persons carrying out reconstruction, repair or improvement of houses or for the making of advances in respect of the purchase of old houses.  A survey of the grant and loan operations of housing authorities for the year 1958-59 which will take account of the effects of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, will be undertaken at the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the findings of the survey, full information is available to me <Col N="345" /> only in the cases of those housing authorities who have prepared schemes to make advances available to persons carrying out works of reconstruction, repair, etc.  Twenty-four housing authorities (including three county borough corporations and 12 county councils) have prepared schemes for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There are wide variations in the manner in which applicants in different areas defray their portions of expenditure on works of this character.  In some areas, the amounts, if any, which they would wish to borrow from the housing authorities would not be significant.  In these circumstances I am not prepared to say that there has been delay on the part of the local authorities generally in making arrangements for the payment of grants or in adopting schemes, where necessary, for the making of advances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last part of the question, I circulated last October to each member of each housing authority details of the grants and loans that may be made available and I bespoke their co-operation in bringing them to the notice of all persons likely to be interested.  I also obtained considerable Press publicity for the new financial facilities under the Act of 1958.  In view of what I have said as to the variations in the requirements of applicants in the different areas, I think that it would be appropriate that any further publicity should be given, where necessary, by the housing authority from whom the particular facilities are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to pass the Fifth Stage of this Referendum Bill.  It is certainly a thing of shreds and patches even though it contains a little more sense in its propositions now than when it was originally introduced.  I do not know whether it is like the case of Bodach an Cóta Lachtna or the case of Cóta an Rí Coigríche.  If a consolidation of the referendum amending Acts is carried out in 12 months' time, I certainly should like to see how much of that would have to be changed in order to show a properly set out statute containing provisions for a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As presented to us originally, the Minister proposed that the electorate be asked to vote a single &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to three separate proposals. The Minister is still in the position <Col N="380" /> that he insists on the voting paper being one which will ask the electorate to give a single &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a mixture of things which are very different in themselves and on which they cannot give separate decisions. The attitude seems to be that, because the Constitution presented to the people is an omnibus thing and the people cannot be expected to give a separate decision on every particular Article or sub-section of an Article, amendments to the Constitution can be omnibus amendments, too; and that six, seven, eight, nine or ten propositions can be put into a Constitution (Amendment) Bill and then presented to a referendum of the people, in which they will be asked to give an omnibus decision, where they are in a position to accept points one, four, seven and nine and refuse to give assent to the others.  That is a sinister and absurd provision.  Looking at the various additions and patches made to this Referendum Bill, one can see how very little consideration was given to the preparation of the measure in the beginning and, on the other hand, how much it was deliberately intended to withhold from consideration by the Dáil and to withhold from the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to enshrine in this amending Bill a proposal by which, at any rate, if the people are asked to vote in an omnibus way, they will be given individually, at the time in which they are advised that there is a referendum on, fairly definite information as to what is proposed by the Bill.  We have had a bit of a struggle to get that appreciated and accepted. It is put in now in a rather detailed way in the Appendix.  If this is a sign of a certain amount of conversion on the part of the Government, in that they think it would be well that the people should know something about it, we accept that, even though it is not a very satisfactory approach to the preparation of statutes governing a referendum.</P>
    <P>The principle which is enshrined in the First Schedule, that is, the copy of the voting paper, is a principle which, I think, is absolutely and entirely wrong; and I hope this will not be <Col N="381" /> used to create a precedent for dealing with this particular matter.  If the Constitution is being amended in a number of ways, the people should be given an opportunity of saying, in respect of each type of amendment, whether they are for it or against it. Under the proposal which will go before them now, they will be asked to wipe out the multiple constituency&mdash; that is one very definite idea&mdash;which gives in a fairly substantial but nevertheless conscious way, an opportunity to various sections of the people who are conscious that they represent particular aspects of our economic or social life, a reasonable chance of getting a representative returned.  It is proposed to create a situation in Dublin in which Dublin will be carved up into small draught board squares of 20 or 30 different sections, depriving the various concentrated interests&mdash; political, social or economic&mdash;in the City of Dublin, of an opportunity of expressing themselves in a reasonable kind of way.  That is one thing which it is proposed to do.  In addition, it is proposed to wipe out the transferable vote and to set up a commission.  It is quite wrong, and it is contrary to any serious principle in regard to amending Constitutions, that the electorate should be asked to vote for these or against these in an omnibus way.</P>
    <P>I think also that the House is being treated with very shocking discourtesy, which indicates again the lack of sincerity and the evasiveness of the Government, when at this hour of the day, we cannot be told whether the Presidential election and the referendum will be held on the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The general tone of the discussion on each stage has been that we have not shown a courteous attitude to the House&mdash;either I have not or the Government as a whole have not.  The general reasons trotted out for that charge are that we have not said enough.  That seems to be the theme this afternoon again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has been elaborating on our lack of couresy in not giving information as to whether or not these two matters are to be decided on the one day.  That is not a matter which comes within the orbit of the measure which we are discussing now. I appreciate the views of the Opposition and their desire to get clarity on this matter as soon as possible.  However, I feel that they should appreciate that it does not come with the ambit of this Bill this afternoon and that it is not really a question of being discourteous &mdash;that I am not in a position to say to them what will in fact be the day or days on which these two votes, the Presidential election and the referendum, will be taken.</P>
      <P>In so far as the general terms of the Bill are concerned, despite what has been said now about the &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; to get us to see the light in these matters, I think there never was really any struggle in the getting of agreement from this side, at any rate, as regards the statement to the public and the circulation of some document to the voters prior to the election or the taking of the referendum setting out the main points involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the very outset and as I might state once again, I was anxious to see how this might best be done and I had that point considered.  At the first opportunity, when the desire from the Opposition, Labour, Fine Gael and others, was voiced, I lost no time in getting in touch with those people unofficially and outside the House and the culmination of that effort was that we did get the agreement in regard to a statement for circulation which is now being circulated and which everybody will agree is perferable to any of the other suggestions made during the <Col N="383" /> course of the debate on the various stages of this Bill, that is, that a statement setting out the main proposals which are the subject matter of the referendum would be circulated and in the hands of the electors prior to the day of the election.  That is something that we can be quite happy about in that it will meet the particular case in this event, at any rate.</P>
    <P>In so far as the other matters raised just now by the Deputy are concerned, I do not agree that the manner in which this Bill has been dealt with shows any lack of thought or shows that there is anything sinister behind it.  I do not understand that charge of there being something sinister in the whole approach to this Bill.  I just cannot see where that arises, nor can I see why the Deputy should make the charge.</P>
    <P>In so far as the actual form of ballot paper is concerned, about which we had our differences on Committee Stage and on the various amendments, I can still only say that I believe that our form of ballot paper as now outlined in this Bill is a much more clear and concise method of approaching this referendum than if we were to adhere to the type of ballot paper provided for in previous legislation, and I feel that any charges of our having any ulterior motives in bringing about a change in the form of the ballot paper are completely without foundation and that, indeed, the Opposition who are making those charges have not given any evidence or made a case to show that there is any foundation for this charge.</P>
    <P>There is nothing further that has been raised on this stage that I feel I am called upon to answer and I shall conclude on that note.</P>

      <P>In actual fact, we are changing &ldquo;April&rdquo; now to &ldquo;June&rdquo; because we believe that we would not have the Bill in time to give practitioners sufficient time to examine the Bill and we are extending the date to June.  When it was &ldquo;January&rdquo;, we were discussing the matter early in November and we thought that we would have the Bill through by 1st January.  We now feel that we are too near to April to insist on April and we propose June for the purpose I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow that.  The amendments speak of deleting the word &ldquo;January&rdquo; and substituting the word &ldquo;April&rdquo;.  To take a typical one of these amendments, the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Parts II and III of this Act shall not apply to the estate of any person dying before the first day of January, 1959.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And the amendment is designed to make that read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Parts II and II of this Act shall not apply to the estate of any person dying before the first day of April, 1959.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Where does June come into it?</P>

I am now asking, with the permission of the Chair, to substitute &ldquo;June&rdquo; for &ldquo;April&rdquo;.  I have already mentioned the purpose behind the change.

      <P>I understand that no principle is involved in this at all.  The Minister's amendments were circulated on the basis that the Bill would be through the House and available to give practitioners time to make adjustments before 1st April.  That is not now practicable, I understand.  Consequently, it is desired to substitute &ldquo;1st June&rdquo; for &ldquo;1st April&rdquo;.  Instead of getting ourselves tied up with the amendments, can we not look at the target, instead, and arrange to let the Minister do whatever he wants to do with the amendments which have been submitted and, when embodied in the Bill, give the Minister permission to substitute &ldquo;1st June&rdquo; for &ldquo;1st April&rdquo;?

It does not seem to fix by statute the burden of costs on one particular person. The Minister says that this merely gives statutory effect to existing practice.

This is the Report Stage of the Bill and we do not want to hold up the Minister in getting this Bill through the House, but it is wise that this matter should be fully ventilated so that the Seanad, if corrective measures are necessary, may be made aware of the position through this debate.</P>

      <P>The jurisdiction, in relation to any land, exercisable by the Circuit Court under this Part of this Act shall be exercised by the judge of the Circuit Court for the time being assigned to the circuit where the land or any part of the land is situate.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to specify the particular judge of the Circuit Court who is to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on that court under Part III.  The Circuit Court is given jurisdiction in regard to the vesting of land and the registration of ownership of land in Sections 20 and 22. This jurisdiction is a type of title jurisdiction.  For that reason, it has been decided to make the provision in regard to it similar to the existing provision for ordinary title jurisdiction and rectification of the register. This latter provision will be found in Section 52 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  There is no need for the words which it is proposed to delete.  Allowing them to remain in the section might cause confusion. This is because of the fact that Section 25 will not come into operation until the 1st June next.  It is from this date that the Statute of Limitations provision will stand amended although the Statute, as unamended, has been in operation since the 1st January last.  The need for amending the Statute is that the Bill proposes that real property will, after the 1st June next, devolve on the personal representative.  We want to make it clear that, where the property so devolves, the personal representative may plead the Statute, except where he is guilty of fraud.  This new type of personal representative is not covered in the Statute of Limitations for the simple reason that he did not exist at the time the Statute was enacted.  The devolution of real property on the personal representative will arise only as regards deaths on and after the 1st June next.  I am mentioning this because there seems to have been some doubt as to the necessity for Section 25 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Statute of Limitations, 1957, was, I understand, a consolidation Act when it was passed by this House and the Seanad.  I understand it was then said to be the case that in this country all Statutes of Limitations were now to be found in one Bill which had become an Act, to wit, the Statute of Limitations, 1957 (No. 6 of 1957).  It seems a pity that <Col N="395" /> having achieved that operation of consolidation, we are now amending that consolidating Statute of Limitations, 1957, not by another Statute of Limitations, but by a section in the Administration of Estates Bill.  I wonder would the Minister consider bringing in Section 25 as a separate Bill, under the title of a Statute of Limitations, so that the consolidated law relating to Statutes of Limitations would continue to be available in Statutes of Limitations rather than the wide diversity of Acts which will be the case if the procedure here followed is adopted elsewhere?</P>

      <P>I move&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1959, for Aviation and Meteorological Services, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The first sub-head of the Supplementary Estimate provides for an additional sum of £67,000 for land acquisition for airport purposes.  The second sub-head is a grant-in-aid for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  There will in fact be no increase in the net total of the Vote as the additional provisions can be offset by savings on other services and the surplus in the receipts appropriated to the Vote.</P>
      <P>The additional amounts needed for land acquisition are £29,500 in respect of Dublin Airport, £27,000 in respect of Shannon Airport, and £10,500 in respect of Cork Airport.  In the case of Dublin, it was expected that the bulk of the 282 acres of land which were being acquired would be transferred in the previous financial year, but owing to legal difficulties, only two holdings were in fact transferred in that year. The remainder of the lands, excluding one holding, will, it is expected, be transferred in the present year and will create an excess of about £29,500 in respect of these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lands to be acquired at Shannon Airport are expected to cost about £41,400.  That sum is expected to be expended in the present year and will <Col N="397" /> create an excess of about £27,000 over the amount originally voted in respect of these lands.  The lands being acquired for Cork Airport will cost about £40,500 and will be paid for in the present year.  There is an excess of about £10,500 in respect of that item.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second item, when the Government decided to provide all facilities necessary to equip Shannon Airport to receive jet aircraft, they had under consideration also the taking of other measures which would ensure the fullest possible utilisation of the airport and the maintenance of employment there.  It was felt that the advent of the new jet aircraft would tend to lower the level of transit activity at the airport, unless some positive steps were taken to promote the use of the airport otherwise than as a transit stop.  With the view of securing new traffic, particular attention was paid to the possibility of developing air freight traffic at the airport.  The desirability of increasing terminal passenger traffic in order to offset the expected contraction in the airport's transit traffic was also realised and it was felt that this might best be secured through promotional activities directed primarily at the North American tourist trade.</P>
    <P>However, no suitable organisation for undertaking the work was in existence at that time.  The work was of such a nature that it could not very well be discharged satisfactorily within the framework of departmental organisation; furthermore, there was no State or semi-State body which could be expected to undertake all the varied activities required.</P>
    <P>It was decided, therefore, to entrust the responsibility for commercial development of the airport to the Comptroller of Sales and Catering. The House is aware that the comptroller was primarily responsible for the building up of the airport's restaurant and shopping services into the present major industry which employs about 600 persons.  The comptroller agreed to accept these additional responsibilities, namely, the responsibility for the development of transit traffic, the development of tourist facilities at or near the airport <Col N="398" /> in order to attract terminal traffic, and the active promotion of freight traffic at the airport.</P>
    <P>In carrying out his new duties, the comptroller operated as the &ldquo;Shannon Free Airport Development Authority&rdquo; and he was authorised to spend up to £50,000 annually out of the revenues of the sales and catering service to meet the running expenses of the authority.</P>
    <P>On a review of the initial working of the authority, it became clear that it would be necessary to give special attention to the promotion of freight traffic at the airport and that progress could also be made in the promotion of industries there.  The encouragement of industries at the airport is a matter requiring special treatment.  One of the steps deemed necessary is the provision of limited factory accommodation for renting in advance of actual demand.  The provision of such accommodation is a matter for the development authority.  For this reason, and from the experience which the authority have already acquired in negotiation with interested firms, it became obvious that it was necessary to give the authority legal status for the general conduct of its business and, in particular, for such matters as the leasing or the letting of factory premises, the acquisition of rights in physical assets, such as premises and equipment, and the making of contracts and agreements.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, decided that the authority should be reconstituted as a limited liability company with the title &ldquo;Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited&rdquo;. That company has been incorporated and the Government have approved of the introduction, in due course, of legislation to provide capital for the company by enabling the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares in it and to provide moneys annually by way of Grant-in-Aid to enable the company to perform its functions.</P>
    <P>Negotiations which the company have in hand with prospective manufacturers have reached an advanced stage and it would be harmful to the whole development scheme if the provision of capital had to await the <Col N="399" /> enactment of legislation.  The Government have decided, therefore, that for the purpose of providing the company with capital, in advance of legislation, the name of the company should be added to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act of 1954, so that the Minister for Finance may guarantee borrowings by the company.  That is the purpose of the motion which I propose to move seeking the approval of the Oireachtas to the making of an Order under the State Guarantees Act to add the name of the company to the Schedule and so empower the company to borrow £200,000.  It would be the intention of the company to use that money for the construction of factory space for letting at the airport.</P>
    <P>When the legislation, which I have mentioned, comes before the House, it will be seen that provision is being made to ensure that capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance will be applied, in the first instance, to the repayment of any moneys which the company may borrow on foot of the guarantee under the State Guarantees Act.  It will be clear, therefore, that the arrangement now being made is a purely provisional arrangement to ensure that the company will not be handicapped owing to lack of funds between now and the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the avoidance of delay in bringing into effect the plans of the company to promote activity at the airport is of special importance.  The changes in the traffic pattern of air transport over the North Atlantic which are upon us indicate that the probability is that the transit traffic on which Shannon has heretofore depended for the bulk of its revenues may diminish, although, as Deputies will have noted from Press reports, Shannon has had the best year ever in 1958.  It is clear that vigorous and prompt measures are necessary to ensure that the level of activity and the employment position at the airport will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to provide the company with funds by way of a Grant-in-Aid to enable it to meet all administrative <Col N="400" /> and general expenses, including, in suitable cases, grants for the construction of buildings and grants towards the provision of industrial plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that, as the company supersedes and assumes all the responsibilities of the authority, all expenditure incurred on the service by both the authority and the new company to 31st March next should be met out of the Grant-in-Aid.  Provision to meet the authority's expenditure was made in the Estimate for the year by way of a deduction of £50,000 from the receipts of the catering service.  The receipts can now be surrendered in full without deduction thereby increasing the Appropriation-in-Aid by £50,000, which, of course, offsets the amount required for the Grant-in-Aid.  To that extent, that part of the transaction is merely a matter of book-keeping.</P>
    <P>I think I should assure the House that the establishment of this Shannon Free Airport Development Company will not result in any overlapping between the functions of the company and those of the Industrial Development Authority or of An Foras Tionscal.  Very full consideration was given to all aspects of that question in consultation with these bodies and I am satisfied that industrial development at Shannon Airport will present very special problems with which neither An Foras Tionscal nor the I.D.A. is equipped to deal with adequately and for the satisfactory solution of which a special company, provided with sufficient powers, is required. There will, of course, be full consultation with and co-ordination between all those bodies in relation to industrial projects at the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's concluding remark that this was a provisional arrangement acted as a reassurance in relation to the procedure it is proposed to adopt in this connection. It will be generally agreed that any steps which can be taken to maintain employment at Shannon should be taken.  For a great many years, it has been suggested that modem developments, particularly the introduction of jet aircraft, would militate <Col N="401" /> against traffic at Shannon, since, as a result of increased power, aircraft would be in a position to overfly Shannon.  That suggestion has been repeatedly canvassed in different quarters.  Strangely enough, last year, as the Minister remarked, was a record year for Shannon.  Nevertheless, it is fairly obvious that, with the introduction of jet aircraft over the Atlantic, there is a likelihood of Shannon being more frequently overflown in the future.  It is, therefore, in the interests of all concerned that steps should be taken to provide employment for those whose positions may be jeopardised by modern air developments. It is only right that the House should know what arrangements will be made and what new industries are contemplated.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that it is not proposed to utilise the facilities provided by the State Guarantees Act, except as a provisional arrangement.  I think that is satisfactory.  I hope that the permanent legislation will be introduced shortly.  It is undesirable that this arrangement should be used for any permanent scheme.  Although there is provision in that Act that additional bodies may be added to it to which State guarantees attach, nevertheless, the terms of that Act were, in the main, drawn because of temporary arrangements that had to be made in certain special cases during the emergency or for particular short term arrangements in respect of cases such as occurred when supplies of commodities were short, or where steps had to be taken which required speed rather than the normal consideration which would be given to legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, however, like to hear from the Minister what industries have been established and whether there are any similar industries in existence in other parts of the country.  I should also like to know if duty-free facilities are essential in these cases.  Can the Minister indicate what is the extent of the duty-free business other than that done by passengers either in transit or who embark at Shannon and who purchase commodities in the shop in the course of transit or embarkation?  Also, can the Minister state whether there are <Col N="402" /> separate companies or is this development entrusted entirely to one company &mdash;the Shannon Free Airport Development Company?  Is it possible to segregate from the freight business done there business other than that confined to the shop and the sales available in the airport building?</P>
    <P>So far as one can gather, the customs-free airport of itself has not attracted the business which was anticipated. On the other hand, the sales in the shop and the general business done there have increased greatly.  It is important, I believe, that, unless the business depends on the free port facilities, consideration should be given to establishing industries adjacent to Shannon rather than in Shannon.  It may well be that, no matter what efforts are made either by this company or by the State, with modern developments, unless the freight business depends either on raw materials which are imported and carried by aircraft or, alternatively, depends upon the special facilities available at the Airport, it might be wiser to consider directing the energies and the attention of the promoters to either Limerick or Ennis.</P>
    <P>I mention that because I believe that unless the free airport facilities are essential or some special attributes exist there, either because of these facilities or, alternatively, because of the practicability of importing materials by air or exporting them, then, of itself, there are no special attractions or advantages in having an industry established at an airport.  In the case of Shannon, it is quite some distance from sizable towns and other normal facilities which exist where industries may be established.</P>
    <P>I want to reinforce what I said initially, that this procedure normally is not very satisfactory and I am glad the Minister has undertaken that permanent legislation will be introduced. It is satisfactory for temporary arrangements to meet the particular circumstances that have arisen.</P>
    <P>The persons charged with the responsibility of running this development company have proved themselves competent to run the catering arrangements <Col N="403" /> and generally run the shop and other facilities as well as the airport itself.  It is imposing on them considerable responsibility to expect them to go further in establishing and maintaining industries which have probably nothing like the connection with an airport of which they themselves have special experience.</P>

      <P>I regard this proposal by the Minister and the Supplementary Estimate as something in the nature of an exercise of casting our bread upon the waters in the hope that the process will pay dividends in the long run.  I take it that we are discussing the Estimate with the motion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would be quite futile for us to close our eyes to the fact that there are very definite and growing difficulties confronting Shannon. Some of these difficulties may be of a kind which we cannot control or circumvent, no matter how generous we may be towards Shannon or no matter how ingenious we may be in enacting legislation.  I think&mdash;and I have expert authority for what I am saying&mdash;we are now going to have a substantial upswing in aircraft development. I think all the indications are in that direction.</P>
      <P>The upswing may take two forms. One, which has already manifested itself, is the new jet and the other is a possibility of vertical landings by aircraft which may make landings an entirely different problem in the future from what they have been in the past and up to now.  One thing is clear.  The long-flying fast jet has already entered the arena of commercial aircraft and it is quite clear that an increasing number of these planes are coming on the market, offering such facilities for speedy transport as to make it almost impossible to refuse the invitation to travel by these planes because distances are almost annihilated by the power of the engines driving the planes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think therefore, that Shannon, no matter what we may do, will be compelled to face up to really serious problems. So far as I am personally concerned, <Col N="404" /> I am in favour of facing up to those problems, but at the same time I am not in favour of minimising their seriousness or imagining that all we have to do is to make a little manoeuvre here and everything will be all right at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport has been an excellent undertaking nationally.  It has helped to establish Irish prestige throughout the world.  In fact, people know where Shannon is who do not know where Dublin is.  I talked with people throughout the world who know where Shannon is located, but who were not so clear whether Dublin is north, south, or in the centre.  They are clear enough where Shannon is because they have experience of landing at Shannon in the course of flights between East and West and West and East.</P>
    <P>As I said, Shannon carries a very substantial amount of State investment. It carries a considerable number of people on its payroll.  People have built themselves into Shannon. Shannon represents permanent employment for many hundreds of workers. It represents in the area a very substantial national asset which should be safeguarded at all costs.  I, therefore, look with sympathy and understanding upon the proposal to safeguard what we have invested at Shannon, and at the same time, to minimise the possible adverse repercussions on Shannon Airport which might be brought about by these developments in aeronautics.</P>
    <P>The scheme of making Shannon a customs-free area is, I think, in the nature of giving hostages to fortune.  I can understand a drive to locate industries at Shannon in order to take up a possible sag in landings there, in consequence of the advent of the new aircraft. I do not see the operation in any wider sense than that, because, for the purpose of producing goods here for sale on the export market, the whole country is a customs-free zone.  At present, materials can be imported from anywhere in the world.  They can be fabricated here and assembled here. That is permitted so long as they are exported from here.  If the rest of the country has obvious attractions for the <Col N="405" /> purposes of the export market it is difficult to see what Shannon has to offer in that field that the rest of the country has not got, so long as the aim of the new industry at Shannon, or elsewhere, is to set up an export market.</P>
    <P>As I see it, you could probably justify it on the grounds that you have to endeavour to locate an industry at Shannon in order to take up a possible sag in employment there, but there is a lot to be said for not regarding the Shannon area alone as a possible location for industries which might, for a variety of reasons, thrive and be as good, or perhaps better, elsewhere. Nobody wants to live for ever at an airport.  Nobody wants to have to travel 15 or 20 miles a day, every day, to and from work.  Some of these attractions which are offered at Shannon could, in fact, be located elsewhere in circumstances which would obviate having to live at an airport or having to travel 20 miles to and from work each day.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point that I recognise that Shannon may be up against very serious difficulties and these difficulties may justify doing something on that account which probably would not be justified if that problem were not there.  I should like to know from the Minister who has to some extent surveyed the possibilities of Shannon Airport being overflown by jet aircraft, what is his estimate of the future use of Shannon by jet aircraft?  As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I recognised that we were then faced with the possibility of these new jet aircraft overflying Shannon Airport and landing, perhaps, in London, or on the Continent of Europe, from which airports people could be shuttled to any place in Europe.</P>
    <P>For that purpose, I instituted discussions between the Secretary of my Department and top people in the British, American and Canadian air companies, to ascertain what their intentions were.  It was not possible at that time to ascertain their intentions but I was then in favour of extending the runways at Shannon in order to take this new type of aircraft, not that I had any definite reason for believing <Col N="406" /> on the basis of assurances from the American companies, that they would land there, but at least to remove any excuse for not landing there, if that were offered as a reason for the overflying of Shannon by such aircraft.</P>
    <P>The position has become clear since then.  The jets are now in the sky.  They are offering flights from London to New York in six and a quarter hours and it is quite clear they are going to beam their propaganda on the tourist who wants to get across the Atlantic in a short time, even though he has to pay, perhaps, something more for the trip in the fast travelling plane.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister what are the possibilities that these new jet planes will land at Shannon.  It is vital from our point of view to endeavour to get them to land there, because of the possibility of increasing use of that type of aircraft.</P>
    <P>While you may sell second-class travel on a railway line which has all its wheels on the ground, it is questionable whether you can sell second-class travel on a plane, where the emphasis on safety is much greater than it is when deciding whether to travel first or second class in a train which has its wheels on the earth.  Therefore every possible effort must be made to get these aircraft to land at Shannon, because in the course of time, the position may become still more difficult for us, unless perhaps public taste might turn to the attraction of using the slower jet or piston-driven aircraft at lower prices and that would necessitate the continued use of Shannon for that type of aircraft, but it is not the best or the safest bet.  From our point of view, it would be better if we could manage to get the fast flying jet planes to use Shannon, now that facilities for landing, there have been made available or are being made available. There are some very obvious attractions in the high standard of catering at Shannon, plus the duty free airport, but even the duty free airport may not be left to us as an exclusive monopoly.  Other airports are already using a duty free shop; other airports are advertising a duty free shop; other <Col N="407" /> airports are endeavouring to arrange, where planes start from these airports, that passengers will have a long time to look around the duty free shops so that they may be attracted by the goods and the commodities displayed there.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if, at this stage, the Minister could give us any more information on the subject of the utilisation of the airport at Shannon for the fast flying jets than we have had up to now.  I appreciate his difficulties. I know how difficult it is to get precise information from companies which are concerned not with our economic welfare but with their own balance sheets, but it is a matter on which the Minister might do a good deal of good by taking the House into his confidence so far as possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Another possible difficulty, too, in respect of Shannon is the future operation of aircraft across the Atlantic.  I do not think we are very far from the day when there will be a merger of five or six companies which are at present using Shannon, or if not using Shannon regularly, are using the Atlantic route.  One of these fine days, I think we will wake up to discover that five or six of those companies, now operating as separate companies, will have merged into one.  Obviously, there are financial attractions in such a merger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Including Air France, Lufthansa and Sabena.  I think there are considerable opportunities for those companies in a merger of that kind. That again will have repercussions on us.  If we were ever to get into such a merger and continue to use Shannon, of course we shall have to stay in the air between Shannon and the United States; otherwise we will have very little voice in the direction of a policy of a merger of that kind.  I think such a merger is bound to come and I think it is going to bring consequences to Shannon in many directions.  It is not wrong to think for a few minutes of the economies which could be effected <Col N="408" /> by a merger, and to realise the possible repercussions.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the last question I want to ask the Minister.  I do not know if it is possible for him to give us the information, but I understand that the contract with the firm for the hire of the present Aerlínte aircraft on the Atlantic route will expire in about 12 or 18 months.  I am not quite certain of the date, but already the question as to whether that agreement will be continued with the company at present operating, or whether we are to continue on the transatlantic air route is a question which must be under consideration at the moment.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I should like to ask the Minister if, in order to hold our place on the Atlantic route, it is intended to buy these new jet aircraft instead of continuing to rely on the type of plane at present in use?  I think everybody will agree that there is a very decided preference for jet aircraft and I do not know if the Minister feels we can withstand that criticism by using the existing type of aircraft on the Atlantic route.  If the new fast-flying type of aircraft is to be purchased it is going to involve a very considerable sum of money, but it may be, in the long run, the best policy to spend that money at this stage rather than risk a sagging in our reputation by continuing to use the present type of plane.  I should like to get information on these points.  I do not know if the Minister can furnish it now or not, but we can get it at a later stage on the main Estimate.</P>

      <P>I hope I did not misinterpret the Minister when he said the State Guarantees Act Schedule is being applied to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company only until permanent legislation is introduced.  May I ask him if he will indicate to the House that, when that is done, part of the permanent legislation will remove the Shannon Free Airport Development Company from the Schedule of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of us who have been in Government have known the anxieties that attend on the Minister for Industry and Commerce's deliberations&mdash;whoever he may be&mdash;in regard to the <Col N="409" /> future of Shannon.  I remember drawing down on my head, some 14 years ago, universal execration because I ventured to prognosticate that the future of Shannon was extremely precarious if energetic measures were not taken to gather into the airport all the large-scale facilities that, at that time, were available nowhere else in Europe. I do not know if the Minister remembers me pressing him on that point some 12 or 14 years ago.  I foresaw a time in the reasonably early future, in which the facilities of Shannon Airport for transatlantic passenger craft would become supernumerary, owing to the improvements in the form of aeroplanes that would be available.  I suggested that when it would be possible to travel from an airport in Europe to Idlewild, New York, in a matter of six hours, or to cross from Scandinavia across the North Pole to San Francisco in a very little longer period, the likelihood of passenger traffic using Shannon extensively would begin to recede, but there was a use for Shannon which, in my suggestion at that time, even in the event of jet aircraft materialising, could be developed. That was the transport of goods.</P>
    <P>It does not matter how far jet development goes.  I believe there will always be plenty of traffic for the less expensive form of transport than jet transport, for the relatively slow moving traffic of goods.  If Shannon has a future, is is as an <i>entrepôt</i> distribution centre for goods to the Continent of Europe and, if we had got into that business energetically, some 12 or 14 years ago, and provided warehousing facility at Shannon, in all its various forms, for breaking bulk goods, I believe we would have a very considerable business there now, employing a very large number of persons, and with a degree of security which we can never hope to have in regard to passenger traffic in that centre.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies have forgotten the fact that Hamburg and Rotterdam on the Continent of Europe have become great ports as transit ports for goods.  I do not know what advantage we are to confer on Shannon by making it a free port for the purposes of establishing factories there. <Col N="410" /> As Deputy Norton pointed out, the whole of Ireland is a free port for the purposes of establishing factories for the export of manufactured goods, bringing in raw materials and exporting them after manufacture free of duty.  It is true, of course, there is a good deal of administrative work, but there is an immense advantage in a free port, as an <i>entrepôt</i> depot, because there you can bring in any form of goods in bulk, break in bulk, and distribute them without going through the whole cumbersome procedure involved, if you bring them in within the tariff wall that surrounds this country.</P>
    <P>In addition, and I do not profess to be an expert on transport matters, it is astonishing how specialised warehousing problems can become in regard to various types of merchandise that pass between the United States and the Continent of Europe, and how difficult it is for bulk exporters to find warehousing accommodation, which is essential for the safe conduct of their produce, at the existing air terminals in the world, especially where it is their intention to break bulk and redistribute from a point of contact with the European Continent.</P>
    <P>I believe that the increased load capacity of a freight aircraft, which can make Shannon its terminus in preference to Paris, is a very considerable advantage for Shannon that could be exploited, but only where speed is not a primary consideration.  But, if an air transport company can carry ten or 15 more tons of merchandise to a distribution point at Shannon, because it has to carry that much less petrol to come as far as Shannon than it could carry if its destination were Paris or Rome, it is a valuable natural advantage that Shannon has which could be exploited and one on which, I think, it is reasonable to hope that a permanent and valuable trade could be built up for that airport.</P>
    <P>At present, that airport costs us between £200,000 and £250,000 a year to keep in being, and it is impossible to collect from the transit traffic fees sufficiently high to meet the full burden of that charge.  I think I am right in saying the net cost, after crediting everything else to the Exchequer, is <Col N="411" /> something between £200,000 and £250,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Norton has said.  There are now a great many men employed there and there is a large investment involved.  Anything, within reason, that can be done to preserve the investment already made ought to be done.  I think we ought to try to make up our minds, as Deputy Norton suggested, to face the probable future honestly and courageously.  None of us can foresee with certainty what will happen, but I think we should ask ourselves, if it is possible to fly to London from New York in six hours, or perhaps less, is it likely that you will get traffic for an aircraft that takes 12 hours to do the journey, more especially when at the present time, I understand the big jets are providing second-class accommodation at the tail and first-class at the top or <i>vice versa</i> and that for a large part of the year, jet liners, being so large, will not probably be fully occupied.  That would suggest that sooner or later fares will be more competitive on jet planes in order to draw more traffic on them because if they have to fly at all, they might as well fly with a full load as half full.</P>
    <P>If one can get a non-stop train, nobody will travel on one which stops en route.  On the other hand, if you can transfer freight or goods cheaper and faster by using Shannon airport as an <i>entrepôt</i> or depot, we may develop a most valuable trade which no other country can take from us.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister how far this development company he speaks of will cater for that and how far they will consult with the experts in this business as to the kind of warehouse facilities that would have to be provided, if this trade is to be adequately catered for&mdash;and we must cater for it before we get it. We cannot wait to provide facilities until the demand is made upon us.  Our only hope of getting this trade is to make a gamble by providing facilities because it will be a very competitive struggle to get that trade into our hands.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be <Col N="412" /> justified in advising the Government to consult transport experts in America and elsewhere to find out what sort of facilities would attract trade and make the gamble of providing such facilities, in the full knowledge that we might fail to get the trade.  I am thinking of such things as refrigeration and insulation and various other forms of unusual storage that cater for the highly specialised <i>entrepôt</i> trade I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister is he yet in a position to tell us what are the enterprises that we are to contemplate being set up at Shannon Airport?  One never knows whether it is wise to ask these categorical questions in the Dáil or better to leave them unspoken, but if you do not ask them and get the information authoritatively stated, all sorts of fantastic rumours circulate; if you do ask for them, you are told: &ldquo;Now, you have done great injury to some grand prospect that might have matured if nobody talked about it&rdquo;. In the long run, I believe it is best to get the truth.</P>
    <P>Is it true that we are to manufacture bubble-gum?  Is it true that we are to manufacture juke-boxes; and is it true that we are to make nine-pins there? If it is, if we can legitimately manufacture anything which would employ Irish labour and procure foreign currency, I would not have the slightest hesitation in embarking on it.  Nor ought we to deride any enterprise which is of a legitimate character and calculated to employ labour, pay good wages and earn foreign currency.  I am not in the least worried about the nature of the enterprises, provided they are legitimate, remunerative and calculated to give employment at a reasonable rate of wages, but I think it would be useful if the Minister would tell us what the present prospects are, so that incorrect rumours can be laid and legitimate hopes based on solid authoritative information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak, but I should like to stress, in regard to points raised by Deputy Dillon, that I think it is a very dangerous precedent to establish to give information to this House on any <Col N="413" /> proposed industrial project.  We know from experience that great damage has been done by facts being publicised in the past and I do not think the Minister for Industry and Commerce, particularly in these instances, should be requested to give details.  Those of us who live in the area contiguous to Shannon Airport, Deputies on all sides, members of my Party as well as Deputies Russell and Carew, are united in this.  We wish Shannon to prosper and I think we are all satisfied from our contacts with the people who have the duty of seeing that these projects will be a success that they have a very good chance of succeeding.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that Deputy Dillon should be critical because 12 or 14 years ago facilities were not established at the airport for the provision of warehouse accommodation.  Surely Deputy Dillon must have a very short memory, because it was he, in the first instance, who &ldquo;wrote off&rdquo; Shannon Airport completely and forecast that we would have a knitting factory for the rabbits running wild there.  We do not have rabbits there at present, but we have chinchilla, which, I am glad to say, we are exporting even though in a very small way.  I do not consider that chinchilla, or even the manufacture of bowling alleys, is the limit to which we can go.  Those are two very minor projects, but I am satisfied, as are my fellow Deputies from the area on all sides of the House, that very big projects are being considered for the Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fatal in dealing with the national economy or with any project of this nature to suggest that we must have an absolute guarantee that everything is cut and dried before we venture to risk any State backing for the project.  Aviation is a most unpredictable business as we can see when we consider the trends it has taken through the years.  I doubt if ten or 15 years ago anyone envisaged the time would come when transatlantic airliners would be flying the Atlantic in six hours or less.  I do not think that even Sir Frank Whittle, when he invented the jet, in his wildest dreams envisaged that.  The Government have faced up to their responsibilities <Col N="414" /> in providing this jet runway at Shannon and I think it will be money well spent and that the soundness of the decision to spend it will be proved in the years to come, both from the point of view of the warehouse facilities that are to be provided and also from the tourist point of view.</P>
    <P>Tourism does not come under discussion at present, but the two things are linked as both bring people into the airport and the contiguous area. If the State had not provided this jet runway, Ireland would definitely be by-passed.  This is a most commendable project.  To attract international operatives, we must make the facilities and the incentives more attractive than in other places in the world.  It is an admitted fact that we are doing that. Anyone who studies civil aviation journals can learn of the high praise given to the Irish Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce for their foresight in taking this step. It may be that in years to come other countries will copy us.  It has happened with regard to the customs-free airport shop.  Other airports have tried to cash in on that brilliant idea, but it is the people who are concerned in the initial venture, those who get in on the ground floor, who succeed in the long run.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned&mdash;he did not stress the point very much, to give him his due; he must be hopeful about the outcome of all these projects&mdash;that Shannon Airport costs the State between £200,000 and £250,000.  I am not aware if those figures are correct, but no one can discuss in terms of money the invaluable asset to this State constituted by the 1,800 employed in the airport.  No one can assess in terms of money the value of our second biggest industry after agriculture, namely, tourism.  I would ask Deputy Dillon: what would it cost the State for the payment of unemployment or social welfare benefits if those 1,800 workers and their families had to suffer as a result of unemployment?</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure, and those who have the welfare of Shannon at heart welcome it.  From what I know &mdash;and I know as much as any other member outside the Government&mdash;I <Col N="415" /> think, and those on the Opposition Benches who live in the area will agree with me, that the greatest success will result from the efforts of the authorities in the customs-free airport.  If there were less talk about what will happen to Shannon in the jet age and more enthusiasm and more co-operation towards seeing that the proposals of the Shannon Free Airport Authority are a success, I for one would not have any fears for the success of the venture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to express an opinion as to the extent to which companies operating on the North Atlantic air routes will utilise Shannon Airport in the jet age.  I do not know that it is possible to give any confident opinion on that question at this time, but there are some observations which I think I could make.  Passenger-carrying companies on the North Atlantic routes used Shannon Airport for two reasons: one, operational and the other, traffic. They used Shannon Airport when the limitations of their aircraft or other operational considerations made it necessary for them to do so, and they used Shannon Airport when there was a prospect of getting traffic on the routes to and from Shannon.  It is reasonable to assume that, with the advent of the jets, the operational need to use Shannon Airport will diminish, although it is to be noted that the jets now in use have had frequent operational cause to come into Shannon during recent weeks, mainly because of adverse weather conditions in the places to which they were bound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which these companies will be inclined to continue to operate services scheduled to stop at Shannon because of the traffic potential there is difficult to estimate.  It is probably true to say that the terminal traffic at Shannon, the number of passengers embarking and disembarking there in this year, will not fall very far short of the total number of passengers who used Shannon ten years ago, and the purely commercial considerations that will determine the policy of the companies in regard to the use of Shannon <Col N="416" /> will be based upon their estimate of what the volume of traffic is likely to be.  All the experts anticipate that the number of people flying across the Atlantic will increase each year, and if we assume that the proportion of them starting or terminating their journeys in Ireland will be the same each year, then we also can expect a corresponding expansion in the terminal traffic at Shannon.  What the influence of that may be on the policies of the companies, I cannot say.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from the scheduled services operating on the North Atlantic routes, there is a great and indeed increasing volume of business in servicing charter planes.  The charter traffic across the Atlantic has been quite considerable and it is certainly likely to be many years before jet aircraft are utilised on that charter work.  Again, the volume of that traffic depends upon a number of considerations not all of which it is possible to calculate.</P>
    <P>As regards freight business, the potentialities there must be considerable. We are only at the beginning of the air freight age.  I have often argued here that it is certain that, as the years go on, more and more freight will tend to travel by air where there is any commercial advantage in doing so. We are anticipating that development at Shannon.  At the present time arrangements have been made with Seaboard and Western, which is the only American company licensed to operate an all-freight service across the Atlantic, to centre their maintenance business at Shannon, and a hangar is now being erected there for the purpose of servicing their aircraft. Heretofore, there was no aircraft hangar at Shannon.  In addition, a transit shed is being erected to facilitate growing business in freight and new freight handling facilities are being installed.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in guessing what the future of Shannon may be. So far as the Government are concerned, we have taken the decision to provide at Shannon the runway facilities and the air navigational aids which the jet aircraft require.  We are providing the freight handling facilities <Col N="417" /> which will enable the airport to cater for a growing volume of freight business and we have set up this development company to promote all forms of activity at Shannon.  It is possible that, by improving the facilities there, particularly the attractions of the duty-free shop, air companies operating the North Atlantic route may find that some of their passengers may prefer to be routed on flights which stop at Shannon, in which case they will certainly seek to meet the wishes of their customers in that regard and it is certainly reasonable to anticipate an increase in terminal business.  One of the activities of this company will be directed towards extending tourist traffic through the airport.  That can be done, first of all, by the promotion of package deals, which is the term now used&mdash;that is, holidays in Ireland involving air transport to Shannon, where the customer pays the all-in cost in one sum&mdash;and also by improving, of course, the holiday amenities in the vicinity of Shannon and in the West of Ireland generally.  Indeed the Chairman of this Shannon Airport Development Company is also at present Chairman of An Bord Fáilte. Therefore, in so far as the development of the North American tourist traffic is concerned, there is an assurance of complete co-ordination of activities between Bord Fáilte Éireann and the Shannon Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Arrangements which are being made to facilitate freight business will help Shannon to attract a growing share of that business.  At the present time, it cannot be said to be very considerable in actual tonnage, but it is notable that the freight coming into Shannon in transit is, nevertheless, more substantial than the freight coming into Shannon on terminal flights. Certainly, the freight operators on the Atlantic are abundantly confident of a very substantial continuing increase in transatlantic freight business in the years ahead.  The development of the industrial estate at Shannon should help the growth of freight business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me what type of companies are being established there.  Apart from mentioning <Col N="418" /> any names, I can say that the Shannon Development Company are in negotiation with a large number of companies. The procedure is that, when they have made their arrangements and agreements with these companies, the question of a licence to operate at Shannon, under the Act which we passed last year, arises.  I have decided to utilise the Industrial Development Authority as my adviser in regard to the issuing of such licences.  That procedure ensures that there will be no possibility of conflicting projects being developed&mdash;one by the Shannon Development Authority and another by the Industrial Development Authority. On receipt of a favourable report of the Industrial Development Authority, I will issue a licence.  It will be appreciated that some of these discussions which have been proceeding between the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority and individual concerns have had to mark time, until the authority was converted into a limited company which could enter into binding agreements, and until it got the necessary authority&mdash;which it will have from this Vote&mdash;to commit itself to the definite expenditure which will be involved in some instances.</P>
    <P>I found the members of that company, when I met them recently, quite confident that they could promote a substantial degree of industrial activity there.  The type of industrial activity which they are trying to encourage is that which involves the utilisation of air transportation.  Indeed, I consider that, under the Act which we passed last year, there is an obligation on me, before issuing a licence to any company to operate there, to satisfy myself that it is a type of development suitable for the airport in the sense that air transportation is likely to be utilised, as well as the obligation of seeing that the development will not prejudice the interests of any existing firm in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked to what extent the existence of duty-free facilities at the airport was important in that industrial promotion campaign.  It is not easy to answer that.  It is true, as Deputy Norton said, that almost equivalent facilities can be given in any part of the country and, indeed, it <Col N="419" /> seems clear that the main attraction&mdash; apart from the tax concession for which we legislated a few months ago &mdash;is the availability of these air transport facilities on a very substantial scale, on a scale which is hardly reproduced at any other airport, where connections across the Atlantic to termini in Europe or U.S.A. for freight business are available daily.  It is true that, in one instance, a company which came here with the intention of establishing an undertaking at Shannon Airport decided on reconsideration to establish the undertaking elsewhere in the country, having come to the opinion, apparently, that the facilities available at the airport were outweighed by the facilities available elsewhere. The belief is, however, that when the factory accommodation is provided&mdash;and there is none there at the moment&mdash;it will all be utilised and that some quite important industries are likely to be located there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked if I could give some indication of the future intention regarding the Aerlínte services.  It is not easy to do that.  As he assumed, this is under very active consideration at the moment, but all the factors which have to be taken into account have not yet been ascertained.  No one knows, for example, what the economics of jet operation are.  The companies which are operating the jet aircraft hardly know that themselves; they have not been in the business of jet operation very long; and whatever they do know they are not telling. There is a general assumption that jet planes are an economic proposition, but that has yet to be proved.  It was only in the past few days that the International Air Transport Association came to a decision on a differential in fares between jet aircraft and propeller aircraft; and I have not even yet secured the opinion of the Aerlínte management as to the effect they think that decision of the international organisation is likely to have on the traffic available for either type of operation.  Clearly, we will have to take decisions fairly soon; but, having regard to the importance of the decisions, we would not like to do so until we are clearly satisfied that we <Col N="420" /> have all the information we should have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that we are now in the beginning of a new technical development in regard to transatlantic air operations.  That is true; but it would be wrong to assume that developments of that kind are occurring year after year.  The amount of money which is invested in a transatlantic aeroplane is very considerable; and no company will invest money in such a plane without having a reasonable assurance that it will be able to use it, that it will not become obsolete, for the period of years required to depreciate it.  Air companies generally, I think, try to depreciate their equipment every ten years.  The effect of that in this very important commercial undertaking means that changes in the technical design of aircraft generally come over ten-year periods.  When the Aerlínte project was first mooted in 1947 and the decision then taken to buy the Super Constellation aircraft, there was a great volume of expert advice that no major development in aircraft design or performance was likely to occur over ten years which would make those aircraft obsolete during that period.  The same considerations which led us then to take the decision to acquire them were affecting the policies of all the companies operating on the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Many of the aircraft which have been used on the North Atlantic have not been fully depreciated.  There are some companies which have been getting deliveries of new propeller aircraft in the past couple of months and the need to recover the capital they invested in them will be a very important factor in their decisions as to how they will operate their services in the North Atlantic in the years immediately ahead of us.</P>
    <P>Similarly, at the present time, the main volume of expert opinion appears to be that the jet aircraft as it is now coming off the production lines of the various manufacturers is more or less stabilised for a period of maybe ten years.  Technically, they say it is possible to build aircraft that will travel three times the speed of sound; technically, it is possible to build <Col N="421" /> aircraft which will take off vertically; but, at the present stage of development, these futuristic types are completely uneconomic, so uneconomic that no company would entertain for a moment the idea of acquiring aircraft capable of these performances and, indeed, it is quite certain that the very competent individuals controlling the destinies of these vast air corporations are not committing themselves to the purchase of the type of aircraft now coming into use without being reasonably certain that they will have the necessary ten years in which to depreciate them. Consequently, we can make our decisions, when we have to make them, reasonably satisfied in our own minds that we are in for another eight or ten year period of reasonable stability in aircraft types.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon appears to be under some misunderstanding regarding the financial results of the operation of Shannon Airport.  Shannon Airport is now earning revenue which is substantially in excess of its outgoings.  No doubt, if one were to prepare a balance sheet of the traditional type, with provision for depreciation of the assets, a book-keeping deficit would be thrown up, but even that deficit would be substantially less than the figure which the Deputy quoted.  However, we can be reasonably satisfied with the present situation in which this surplus of income over outgoings is being realised.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport is the largest single employer of industrial labour in the West of Ireland and, whatever arguments might be advanced regarding the future pattern of air transport development, as far as we are concerned, the existence of the airport is a fact that we must always keep in our minds when making our calculations and, in so far as there has grown up around that airport a social situation which is dependent upon the availability of employment there, we have the obligation of ensuring that the level of employment will be at least maintained, if not increased.  We assume that in the circumstances ahead it may not be possible to maintain that employment solely on airport operations and, therefore, the decision has been taken to supplement the sources of <Col N="422" /> employment by the development of an industrial estate in the vicinity of the airport.  It may well be that the success of that operation will increase employment there.  I hope it will have that result.  Indeed, already, we have had to give some consideration to housing problems arising in that connection and amongst the activities of the new company will be the development of a housing estate there for the convenience of the executives of the new industrial concerns.  I think discussions with the local authorities will be necessary in regard to the housing needs of their staffs.  It is clear that every development of that kind will make more secure the whole organisation established there and that it will tend to grow of its own dynamism into something still more substantial in the future.</P>
    <P>When I met the board of this new company, I gave them my views as to how they should operate and as to the circumstances against which they had to make their plans.  I also expressed to them the idea that if, in fact, they did succeed in the industrial sector of their operations, it could well be that they would have brought to our attention a device, an instrument, a method of procedure which might be applied with equal success in handling some economic or social problems that may arise from time to time in other parts of the country.  Therefore, I think we can encourage this company to go ahead, with our good wishes for their success, success far exceeding, if possible, the immediate object of maintaining the level of activity generally in the airport area.  I was very much encouraged by the competence, the enthusiasm, the energy which the company have shown up to date and I am quite certain that it is bound to pay off in substantial results.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide a sum of £39,000 to meet payments which are expected to arise in the present financial year in respect of three matters, namely, the improvement of transatlantic passenger facilities at Cobh, grants for the development of major tourist resorts and grants for the provision of new hotel bedrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total grant made to Bord Fáilte Éireann for the current financial year <Col N="424" /> was £440,000, but this amount is insufficient to meet the payments which will arise before the 31st March next in respect of the three projects which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>At my request Bord Fáilte Éireann has during the past year reviewed the adequacy of the accommodation and the facilities at Cobh for transatlantic passenger traffic.  The board became satisfied, as a result of the review which it had carried out, that a higher standard of passenger facilities was desirable in the interests of tourism.  In the board's opinion it is necessary to provide for the enlargement of the customs examination area and for the provision of waiting accommodation for the convenience of friends and relations of arriving and departing tourists.  The tendency in recent years towards road transport as the popular means of conveyance of passengers to and from the Cobh terminal has resulted in greater numbers of people visiting Cobh for the purpose of meeting or seeing off transatlantic passengers.  It is now estimated by the board that 75 per cent. of the passenger traffic to and from Cobh in connection with the liner services is by road.</P>
    <P>As regards customs examination space, the board has pointed out that 300 passengers and their baggage can at present be dealt with in one operation. There is a measure of discomfort for the passengers when the number exceeds 250 but when it exceeds 300 the discomfort involved becomes quite acute.  During the season the numbers disembarking are frequently in excess of 300 at one time.  It is estimated that almost half of the total eastbound traffic each year for the past few years has been handled in crowded and somewhat uncomfortable conditions.  Deputies will appreciate that Cobh is our principal transatlantic seaport and an important terminal for tourist traffic from North America.  A high standard of service and of passenger accommodation is provided by the shipping companies operating on this route. the interests of encouraging and expanding seaborne tourist traffic from North America it is imperative that Bord Fáilte Éireann consider that in <Col N="425" /> shore facilities at Cobh for the handling of the traffic should be brought up to a proper standard of comfort and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The improvements which are to be carried out are on C.I.E. property and they will be executed also by C.I.E. under an arrangement with Bord Fáilte Éireann.  The works have already commenced.  It is hoped that they will be completed in time for the coming tourist season.  Efforts were made by the board to get other interested parties to contribute something towards the cost of the scheme but I am sorry to say these efforts were not successful. Accordingly, the full cost of the scheme. estimated at £35,000, will have to be borne by Bord Fáilte Éireann. In the present financial year a total sum of £27,500 will be required of which £7,500 will be provided by the board out of its existing Grant-in-Aid funds and the remaining £20,000 will be provided in this Supplementary Estimate.  The balance of the total cost, the remaining £7,500, will be met by the board out of its grant for 1959-60.</P>
    <P>In 1951 certain improvements were carried out in the passenger handling facilities at Cobh but these improvements are inadequate in the light of present-day conditions.  Since 1951, the numbers of passengers disembarking at one time have tended to get bigger, with the result that the customs examination area is now too small.  Furthermore in 1951 improvements were planned on the assumption that the bulk of the internal passenger traffic to and from Cobh would move by rail, whereas, in fact, the tendency over the past few years has been for more and more passengers to travel by road.</P>
    <P>As announced in the White Paper on Economic Expansion the Government have decided to set aside at least £1,000,000 to assist, by way of grants, the financing of a ten year programme for the provision of amenities at major tourist resorts.  The new grants, which will supplement expenditure from local resources and the guaranteed loan facilities already available through Bord Fáilte Éireann, will be confined to non-revenue earning works and are intended to enable such essential items as the provision of promenades, parks <Col N="426" /> and other similar basic developments to be undertaken.  The grants will be subject to two conditions, namely, that the works to be carried out at any resort will form part of a fully coordinated plan of development for that resort and that a substantial local contribution will be forthcoming either from a local development group or company or from the local authority concerned.  The scheme will be administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that the programme for the development and improvement at our major tourist resorts should get under way as soon as possible. At my request, Bord Fáilte Éireann has been in consultation with local authorities, local development companies and other local groups with the object of arousing interest in the scheme and stimulating activity on the part of these local bodies.  The board hopes to get this scheme started in the present financial year.  It has indicated that works can proceed immediately in a number of holiday resorts.  The probable expenditure up to the end of this month is put at about £10,000.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of grants for hotels was introduced last May to encourage hotel owners to provide more accommodation for tourists.  The scheme, which, again, is administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann, applies to tourist hotels and motels.  Grants are made under the scheme to cover portion of the cost of providing additional bedrooms and bedroom-bathroom units.  The grants cover 20 per cent. of the cost involved, subject to maximum limits which range from £275 for a double bedroom with bath to £175 in the case of a single bedroom without bath.  Where central heating is installed a further grant of one-third of the cost, subject to a maximum limit of £25 per bedroom, is payable.  It is anticipated that some ten projects involving grants totalling £9,000 will be completed before the end of this financial year.</P>
    <P>Next year and in subsequent financial years, the maximum annual grant of £500,000 at present payable to Bord Fáilte Éireann will be inadequate to cover the cost of resort development and hotel bedroom grants. <Col N="427" /> Accordingly, I propose to bring before the House in the near future a new Tourist Traffic Bill to provide the additional funds which will be required to finance these two schemes on a long term basis.</P>
    <P>I feel there will be here general agreement regarding the desirability of incurring the expenditure for which provision is made in this Estimate. Therefore, I recommend that the House should approve of the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is undoubtedly general agreement that tourism is a valuable trade for this country.  It provides revenue; it promotes trade dispersed over a wide area.  In fact, it is decentralised in the best sense and offers possibilities for further development. I have always held the view that we have never fully exploited the possibilities here in the way in which they could be exploited.  On the other hand, it is often difficult to see what tangible results are achieved from a good deal of the expenditure and arrangements that are made.  Due to, perhaps, a variety of causes in the past, An Bord Fáilte has not functioned as effectively as it might. I do not want to discuss the reasons now for that; I only hope that it will be possible for the board and all concerned, with the very considerable sums that are being placed at their disposal, to promote a further influx of tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the American experts visited here a number of years ago, they recommended strongly that certain steps should be taken to extend the tourist season.  As a result of that, An Tóstal was initiated.  I think nobody is happy about the results of that scheme.  Perhaps in a matter of this sort it was not possible to proceed otherwise than by trial and error, but certainly we have had enough experience now of the working of the Tóstal to consider what changes are necessary or desirable.  In that regard, I believe that insufficient attention is being paid to specific festivals or events for particular localities. A number of specific events and festivals have been undertaken in various parts of the country very much by, or as a result of, local endeavour and <Col N="428" /> initiative, and I believe that they have attracted more tourists and brought more people to the localities than any events of the Tóstal, as it was organised heretofore.</P>
    <P>In addition, I believe that An Bord Fáilte should consider, where possible, promoting or attracting conferences or congresses here.  Admittedly in that respect, regard must be had to the availability of these conferences or congresses and also to the interests of the bodies concerned and the suitability of this country, or particular parts of it. The effect of having a conference in a locality, more especially if it is possible to hold it in the off-season, or at the beginning or end of the season, is very considerable.  I suppose in a matter of this sort, while tourism benefits the country as a whole, many of us are constrained to consider it from the point of view of our own constituency. Certainly those of us who, like myself, represent a constituency which benefits to a considerable extent from the tourist or holiday trade, have a special interest in it.  Therefore, I welcome the provision for increased bedroom accommodation and the money which it is proposed to make available for resort development.</P>
    <P>There, again, close attention to local interests and local needs should be paid by Bord Fáilte, in collaboration with local development companies, if such exist, and the various local authorities.  In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, quite a number of matters require attention which grants of this sort should make possible. Very often for a comparatively small expenditure, improvements, or better amenities, can be provided which prove attractive to visitors and to tourists.  It is for that reason that consultation with the local authorities concerned and with the local interests is important.</P>
    <P>In connection with the provision for improved accommodation, I should like to know from the Minister whether such improvements will involve any revaluation of the premises.  If this proposal&mdash;even though a grant is provided &mdash;involves a revaluation as a result of an improvement, it will undoubtedly act as a deterrent.  The holiday season <Col N="429" /> here for most parts of the country, if not for all areas, is a short one, and the fact that hoteliers and proprietors of guest houses may find themselves liable for increased valuation means that they will regard it as a deterrent, despite the attractions of a grant.  For that reason, I believe that consideration should be given to an amendment of the law, if such is necessary, to prevent a revaluation taking place.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is possible at this stage to say what resort developments are contemplated in the immediate future, or whether that depends on consultation between the board and the various local authorities concerned.  In some cases, particular events attract tourists and visitors, and so far as the area itself is concerned, it does not really matter if they are visitors or tourists, as long as the overall effect is to promote business and bring trade.  So far as the main holiday centres are concerned certainly they are areas which, to a large extent, depend on them for business.</P>
    <P>The energies of Bord Fáilte should be devoted towards extending the holiday season and on the other hand, promoting conferences, or congresses, or gatherings of one sort or another, at the beginning or at the end of the holiday season, as a means of extending that season.  In that regard, close consultation with various bodies is essential.  I believe that many of the facilities which are now available for improvements should act as a further incentive, and for that reason, I welcome this proposal and hope that care will be taken to see that the money is expended wisely and with the object of utilising it to the maximum advantage of the localities as well as of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if it would be at all possible to let us know how exactly An Bord Fáilte arrives at its figure for the income derived from tourism.  There are quite a number of people at the moment who are, rightly or wrongly, critical of a certain type of expenditure by An Bord Fáilte and I think some of this criticism may be wrongly directed because of lack of proper information as to what An Bord Fáilte <Col N="430" /> is accomplishing and what the total income from tourism is.</P>
      <P>I have tried to find out the method by which certain figures of tourist income are arrived at.  I have not been able to get anything like reasonable information in that regard.  We are told that the tourist trade is second in importance to the cattle trade as a source of income to the State.  That statement was made by responsible people and the least they might do is to give us the method by which those figures are arrived at, in order to satisfy the general public as to the accuracy of such statements.</P>
      <P>From inquiries I have made, it would appear that if the ordinary Irish man and woman returning home from even a fortnight's stay in Britain register in a hotel in Dublin on the way back to rural Ireland, they appear in the figures for tourists.  I also understand that people going to the West of Ireland on their annual holidays from Britain who stay overnight in Dublin also appear on the list of tourists.  Such people could be described as migrants who come back here in the summer time or come back twice a year, such as is common in Donegal and Connemara. If such people appear in the tourist figures, I think it is unfair for Bord Fáilte or any other body to suggest that they are tourists, because it is not due to the influence of Bord Fáilte or anybody else that they come here. If we broke down the figures, I think we would find in one way or another that 80 per cent. of the people described as tourists are Irish men and women coming back here from work either in Britain or America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the law of averages, the more people we export from this country through emigration, the more we will have coming back on holidays, if conditions are good in the country to which they go.  In recent years, conditions have been good in Britain, with the result that Irish men and women there have been able to take holidays. That is why I ask, when we are told tourism is our second best industry: does the description of tourism as our second best industry depend on the export of Irish people?  Is it not a fact <Col N="431" /> that if emigration figures had been reduced drastically over the past ten or 15 years, we would not have anything like the number of people described today as tourists.</P>
    <P>However, when I criticise this method of assessing the income from tourism, I should like to see us getting down to brass tacks in regard to the tourist industry.  While there is great justification for increasing hotel accommodation in tourist resorts, in my opinion, there is a limit to what can be done in that connection.  Over the past few years, the aim has been to extend the tourist season at both ends.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, one of the means adopted to that end was the introduction of An Tóstal, and we know the flop that was.  One of the things we are up against here, above all, is the weather.  No matter what facilities we put at the disposal of tourists, we cannot guarantee them fine weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe they do not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham is merely bringing out the point I am on.  We must concentrate on the type of tourist not really interested in fine weather, but I am afraid our drive is not in that direction.  If we are to make grants available for bedroom accommodation in seaside resorts, I believe there is a greater argument for giving priority to hotel accommodation and the guest rooms in fishing resorts, whether on the coastline or inland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people are beginning to realise now that the fishing tourist is the soundest of the whole lot, whether he is interested in sea fishing or inland fishing.  That aspect of tourism deserves priority at this stage. I do not think this or any other Government will have large funds available to experiment with means of extending the tourist season at both ends.  We cannot afford to continue making mistakes like the Tóstal, which dishearten people who would like to see the tourist trade expand. When funds are available, it is most <Col N="432" /> desirable that we channel them into lines which will give the greatest return.</P>
    <P>Again, if we are able to produce facts for the general public, there will be more agreement as to the necessity for the expenditure.  If we are told that the tourist trade as a whole is worth £30,000,000 a year, let the people responsible in the Statistics Office, Bord Fáilte, or whoever they may be, break down the figures and give us the figures of income derived from the fishing tourist.  I know it may be a difficult thing to do.  At the moment, we have development committees for the lakes and rivers inland and tourist committees at some of our ports and points near the sea where sea fishing is a good proposition.  It should not be difficult to estimate the financial return from those people utilising these resorts in pursuit of their hobby, fishing.</P>
    <P>Before we entice tourists in here, it is desirable that we should ensure that the facilities they want are available to them.  Judging by the publicity in Britain in recent years, the aim seems to be to attract the &ldquo;super-duper&rdquo; tourist.  Possibly it is not fair to criticise An Bord Fáilte for its efforts to attract wealthy people here, but at least the same amount of money should be made available to attract the ordinary man, the ordinary man who may prevail upon his friends to follow in his footsteps.  It would be more desirable to spend money attracting that type of tourist rather than direct one's attention almost entirely to people who would probably prefer to holiday in the South of France, Hawaii or some such places.</P>
    <P>The tourist who is interested in fishing is not interested in elaborate and luxurious accommodation.  He wants cleanliness, good food and plenty of fishing.  His requirements are simple and can be met without the expenditure of a great deal of money.  Some funds should be channelled into attracting that type of tourist.  Indeed, money would be better spent in that direction rather than in festivals, or any other way.  If one town has a festival, the neighbouring town immediately decides they must have a festival, too. <Col N="433" /> I have nothing against festivals, but, if there is to be a festival, then let it be a good one and something which will attract visitors.</P>
    <P>Conventions have been mentioned. It must be remembered, in relation to conventions, that we are off the beaten track.  As far as Europeans are concerned, they prefer London, Paris, Rome, or somewhere like that.  I do not want to be taken as against the idea of attracting conventions to this country. All I am anxious to ensure is that the right order of priority will be kept. We have a potential tourist market in Britain so far as fishermen are concerned and every effort should be made to attract the fisherman tourist to this country.  Fishing is not dependent upon weather conditions and fishermen are not unduly worried if the day is wet or the sun fails to shine.  So far as weather is concerned, we have very little to offer tourists in our holiday resorts when the weather is bad.  Is it the intention to spend money developing these resorts, equipping them with the facilities which the tourist finds in Monte Carlo, and elsewhere?  Or is it the intention to spend money developing those resorts where the tourist will not be interested in the weather?  I am interested in the question of priorities and, in my opinion, priority should be given to the fishing side of it.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the travel agencies in general needs more attention.  At the moment, C.I.E. are making week-end excursion tickets available to people in Westport, Galway, Killarney, Limerick and so forth to enable them to spend from Saturday night to Monday morning in Dublin.  The fare for the week-end is equivalent to the single fare journey. If Bord Fáilte co-operates properly with C.I.E., they will insist that this arrangement be reciprocal and that people who wish to travel from Dublin to these places will be accorded the same facility.  It is only when things like this are brought to the notice of C.I.E. by a body like An Bord Fáilte that we can hope to get anything done.</P>
    <P>I would not raise this matter were it not for the fact that, when I tried to put down a question, I found I was stymied by the rules of procedure.  I <Col N="434" /> was told that the Minister had no responsibility. Therefore, I am glad to take the opportunity of making it as clear as I possibly can and of bringing it under the particular Estimate as well as I possibly can, because I believe that the questions of Bord Fáilte and C.I.E. are ones which in general at any rate the Minister has responsibility for.  I would not go any further than to ask him to bring that point to the notice of Bord Fáilte and to have the facilities that are made available for the people in the rural areas available to the people in the cities.  These arrangements should be reciprocal.</P>
    <P>What we find is that well-intentioned people sit down in the city and devise ways and means of making money for their own particular State body.  The very fact that they are stuck in Dublin very often leaves their mind far removed from what might be good for the country as a whole.  It is only when an opportunity is given to people who are based in the rural areas to give their views and find that a certain amount of heed is given that we can get proper satisfaction and results.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, request the Minister to get Bord Fáilte to have a consultation with C.I.E. on this matter, because it is of importance not only for those whom we might describe as the tourist who goes down the country but also for the people who might come back from Manchester, Liverpool or London on a Friday night and who might like the opportunity of going to Westport, Castlerea, Roscommon or Galway at the excursion fare which is now available to persons from Galway and Roscommon coming to Dublin.  I think there is nothing wrong with that cutting both ways.</P>
    <P>I think it is very important because we find the people who live in the country towns are hard hit as things are at the moment and there is no very great sign of an improvement taking place.  If we want to get their co-operation and goodwill for a tourist industry, then we must get their goodwill through C.I.E., Bord Fáilte and other State bodies.  You will not get the goodwill of those people unless they see that their predicament will <Col N="435" /> not be made worse than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Nobody disputes the fact that it is of advantage to the people in rural areas to get to Dublin for a bit of shopping.  They are entitled to that. It is desirable to provide that opportunity once a week, but at the same time facilities should be given to the rural areas to attract down the country those people from Dublin who would like to go down.  There is only one way of doing that, that is, by making the facilities available to those people who want to come down.</P>
    <P>Do not give the impression to the people in the West and South of Ireland that everything must be channelled into the city.  If we see co-operation between Bord Fáilte and C.I.E. on a matter like that, it will restore the confidence that is missing at the moment with regard to a mentality which we feel is portrayed by the minds of the people charged with the responsibility of running such bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in this Estimate is making provision for what I regard to be three very important items.  I think that the first one is the most important one. It has been in the minds of people who are interested in attracting tourists to our country that every effort should be made by our customs authorities to facilitate the entry of tourists here, that no obstacle should be put in their way and that whatever customs formalities are required&mdash;and they are required, we admit&mdash;should be as expeditious as possible and that these examinations should be carried out with as little trouble as possible to the incoming tourist.  By doing what is proposed in No. 1 of this Supplementary Estimate, that is by providing in Cobh extra accommodation, the Minister is thinking along the right lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that Cobh is only one point of entry to our country and that an eye should be kept on the facilities, the method of examining the baggage of passengers and the general attitude of the customs authorities, at all the major points of entry at least.  It is not <Col N="436" /> very much good for the Minister to provide the facilities by way of extra accommodation, if the ordinary customs men have the feeling that an inspector of the Revenue Commissioners is hiding somewhere and spying on their activities.</P>
    <P>It would be well for the customs men to know how far they should go. The regulations are very strict.  A customs man may think that it is not enough to open up a case.  He may have the fear, as many of them have at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, in this Estimate, he is not concerned with anything other than the provision of accommodation, but I think that on this occasion the proper thing for me to do is to point out the other part of the landing transaction where the tourist is concerned.  Most countries have realised that it is very necessary to provide all the best possible facilities for tourists when they enter and again when they leave the country. It is very aggravating for people who have travelled long journeys by air or by sea to find they have to queue or that they have long delays at customs, at ports or at frontier posts. By a provision such as this, the Minister can make it very attractive and less delaying for our tourists.  If he could emphasise upon the Minister concerned the desirability of the other matter which I have raised, it would also help very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> I was surprised that Deputy McQuillan thought it would not be wise to make all this provision, all this over-provision which he feels is being made for tourist resorts.  The provision of better facilities in our tourist resorts is the best method of securing the decentralisation, which most of us desire. Our aim should be, not to cater for our tourists in the big cities and towns, but to persuade them to visit the various tourist resorts and the small towns in the country.  It is good to note that most of the resorts have very active and very useful development committees which are making an honest effort to help themselves.  These committees have been doing very good work since they were formed and, in many cases, they are perfect examples of local co-operation and initiative.  It is only right that the Government should come to their assistance in the way visualised in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Grant-in-Aid for additional bedroom accommodation is a grant which has been in operation since the middle of 1958.  Until then, hoteliers had to depend solely upon loans.  Hotel accommodation is the number one attraction for tourists and food comes second, so that when hoteliers are facilitated as they are being facilitated by this Supplementary Estimate and make extra and better bedroom provision, they are, in an extensive way, helping our tourist industry.  The addition of the new bedrooms and bedrooms with bathroms and central heating will, when this programme is in operation for some time, be a big capital asset to our tourist industry.  The grants which range from £275 down to £175 are a fair portion of the cost&mdash;at least, they are an attractive portion and one which should encourage many small hoteliers to enlarge their premises in such a way that the enlargement will be of benefit to themselves and pleasing to tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how much would it cost &mdash;has he any idea?&mdash;to provide for a year that any tourist wishing to bring his motor-car to this country could do so for nothing or at a nominal cost of, say, £1&mdash;transport from Great Britain <Col N="438" /> to Ireland.  I am told it costs more to bring a car to Ireland than to any continental country, that is, travelling from Great Britain.  The facilities here are deplorable, and when you bear in mind that if you could induce the tourist to bring his car, it usually means, instead of one person, three or four come in a family party and pay revenue duty of something like one shilling a gallon for every gallon of petrol they consume, it seems to me that it would be a well worthwhile proposition to make a drastic effort to improve facilities for bringing cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister think about it?  The present position is that this is the most difficult country in Europe to bring a car into.  I should like to make it the easiest, even at considerable cost for a period of years, after which time if one could popularise this place as a place to take a motoring holiday, the position might even be that no subsidisation of freight rates would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the first matter to which I wish to refer.  The second is this. Deputy McQuillan seems to be under a misapprehension.  I am glad to pay tribute to An Bord Fáilte for the help they willingly provided to the Inland Fisheries Trust right from the first time they were asked to provide it. It was one of the most gratifying and satisfactory experiences I had as Minister that when I approached An Bord Fáilte to meet the Inland Fisheries Trust with me to discuss developments, unlike what so often happens where inter-departmental jealousies often frustrate good intentions, there was no evidence whatever of that, and <Col N="439" /> there was an understanding and intelligent approach to the whole problem, as a result of which I think a great deal has been done for the improvement of the inland fisheries of this country.</P>
    <P>In that context, I only want to say that I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will continue to give the same encouragement to An Bord Fáilte to co-operate with the Inland Fisheries Trust as did his predecessor. I have no doubt the Minister will do the same.  I would, however, say&mdash;I do not wish to be thought of as a carping critic&mdash;that I agree with Deputy McQuillan in so far as he says that we ought to emphasise the things in which we are in a position, as he says, to be really outstanding.  Our fishing facilities for salmon, trout and coarse fish are as good as or better than any which can be found in Western Europe or any place else, and they are capable of steady improvement. It is well within our resources to maintain them where they are excellent and to bring them up to the level of excellence where they are no more than good.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that that is true of our deep-sea fishing amenities.  I have seen deep-sea fishing off the coast of Australia, off the Florida coast, and off the coast of Southern California, which are the great deep-sea fishing waters where you get deep-sea sporting fish. It is that kind of fishing which is ordinarily associated with travel abroad for deep-sea fishing.  It is perfectly true that in the waters surrounding this country, you get large fish, but as to whether it is prudent to seek to establish internationally that we have deep-sea fishing facilities which compare favourably with those ordinarily associated with the sport, I think is open to doubt.  I think we could overemphasise that aspect of our sporting facilities, to the grave detriment of our publicity in respect of amenities here which need be second to none.  But a great many people attach so much importance to sporting fish in inland waters that they underestimate the attraction of coarse fishing.  It is perfectly true that salmon and trout, for <Col N="440" /> a considerable body of persons, are their prime concern with fishing, but for a much larger body of persons, who are much more likely to confine their holiday-making to Ireland, coarse fishing is the attraction.</P>
    <P>I want to make this suggestion which I have made before&mdash;but nobody listens to you in this country until you have said something ten or 12 times, and then somebody begins to prick up his ears&mdash;we have a potential in the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal as valuable fishing waters, if they were properly developed with coarse fish&mdash; and they are.  If nothing is done to maintain them as a fishing amenity&mdash; and it is manifest policy that C.I.E. is to be allowed to abandon them&mdash;if they are abandoned, those of us who have some knowledge of abandoned canals, like the Royal Ulster Canal in County Monaghan, realise they become not only a public menace but a public eyesore.</P>
    <P>If we made them really attractive by stocking them with coarse fish, several purposes would be served.  One, they have the unique advantage of having a walk all around them which was originally designed for the horses which drew the boats; secondly, they bring tourist traffic into various parts of the country where there is no other tourist attraction; and, thirdly, it is important to remember how easily one can underestimate the attraction coarse fishing in them has until you go to the black areas in the North of England.  There you find rows of responsible citizens along a canal, the smell of which would lift the hat off your head and the colour of which would amaze you, solemnly fishing with cork and float, in waters in which to our eyes one would not dream of taking a fish.</P>
    <P>Then you discover, to your amazement, that that stretch of canal is the property of a corporation ward of these citizens and one of the conditions is that they put all the fish they catch back in again.  There you find one of these energetic citizens catching a fish four inches long, detaching it from his cast, throwing it into the canal and then going on to catch the same fish again and throw it back in <Col N="441" /> once more.  It is an extraordinary thing that they manage to take a fish at all. If you look at the water, it is surprising, but, in fact, fish are thrown back by agreement, so that the anglers will not completely denude these canals of the limited sort of fish which is indigenous to them.</P>
    <P>To such people, therefore, well stocked canal waters, easily accessible, and where inexpensive guest-house accommodation would rapidly become available for visitors, without any such restriction on their activities over unlimited lengths of waters, is, I think, a facility which would draw a very large tourist population to this country. Deputy McQuillan would be wrong if he thought nothing was being done on that line.  A great deal is being done by An Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  All I am suggesting is that more might be done.  It would greatly help if the Minister responsible for this Vote would re-emphasise that the decisions taken by his predecessor in this office, of encouraging Bord Fáilte to give every facility they can to the Inland Fisheries Trust, were unreservedly endorsed by him.</P>
    <P>I think Bord Fáilte should be warmly encouraged to pursue its signposting activities and the practice of putting up descriptive plaques at all places of interest.  Some Deputies here may have had the experience I had of visiting Gettysburg and its immediate vicinity in the State of Pennsylvania. There, signposting is carried to its extreme limit, with the scene of practically every event in the battle of Gettysburg being marked by descriptive plaques, scattered all over the countryside by the authorities of the State of Pennsylvania.  It is an immense attraction, to any person who is interested in the civil war history, to visit that scene and to be led from site to site by authoritative plaques describing the events which actually transpired.  Similar incidents may not fall to be described on such plaques in this country.  Much could be done, however, by means of such facilities. There are a great many people who will pass by a place of interest and be indifferent, but there must also be a great many people who are anxious to know the local history, and who will <Col N="442" /> be greatly intrigued to find a descriptive plaque where they can get a responsible body of information on the history of such a landmark.</P>
    <P>A very good development, and one on which I congratulate Bord Fáilte, is the practice of marking the names of rivers.  At present, I am discovering the names of rivers I have crossed and recrossed during the past 40 years, since Bord Fáilte began to put up names on the bridges over rivers. Anything that gives the passing tourist information about the scenery through which he is passing is of great value, and adds considerably to the amenities of the countryside.  The great danger we may fall into is to imagine that that which is so familiar to us as to be pedestrian, may still reek of romance to the casual tourist who meets it for the first time.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I think, Bord Fáilte deserve to be congratulated&mdash;and I am still talking about their general function&mdash; on the publication of the monthly illustrated bulletin, <i>Ireland of the Welcomes.</i> It is quite excellent.  The standard is magnificent and it is a credit to the people who produce it.</P>
    <P>I see that we have provision here for additional bedroom accommodation. Let us make up our minds about this.  In so far as the American trade is concerned, &ldquo;bedrooms without baths won't wash&rdquo;.  America is greatly changed.  I remember one time when I was in Castlerock&mdash;I think I told the House this before&mdash; taking a bedroom in a small hotel in the far west of the United States and, when I went to bed, the landlady came up to tell me I would not be sleeping with more than five men in the one bed.  I had to barricade the door in order to prohibit the additional population with which I was threatened, but those days are gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Those days are gone and in any part of the United States to which you go now, no matter how simple the hotel, if there is any tourist <Col N="443" /> attraction, the bedroom itself may be no bigger than a cabin in a ship, but it will have annexed to it a bathroom, and without that, American accommodation is quite inadequate.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal in what Deputy McQuillan has said.  But Americans are not the only tourists on the beach and people from the Continent and Britain do not attach the same passionate importance to that kind of amenity, but if we are to embark on an extensive programme of additions and improvements to hotels, every encouragement should be given to people who are adding rooms in this latter half of the twentieth century to provide, so far as possible, that there shall be annexed to any new bedroom built a bathroom, however small, provided it contains the usual amenities.</P>
      <P>That brings us very far afield because it means that running water, sewerage and so forth, must be adequately catered for by the local authority and I do not think we can reasonably raise these matters on this Estimate.  However, we must bear in mind that if a great deal of the money provided in this sort of Estimate is not to be wasted, there is a very grave obligation on local authorities, if they have any ambitions to promote tourism in their area, to see that the ancillary services such as water and sewerage are adequate and above all, water supplies, which are abundant from 11 o'clock in the morning until four in the afternoon will not do.  There are too many places where the water supply is abundant for perhaps six hours of the day and for another six hours is exiguous, and for 12 hours is cut off altogether.  That is an impossible situation, if you wish to draw tourists to urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourists will accept that kind of thing if they stay on the banks of a canal or far away from any urban centre, but if you expect to draw them into towns, they assume there will be a constant water supply and reasonable sewerage facilities.  I assure the Minister that if an adequate check were made, he would be astonished to discover in how many rural areas the water supply system habitually fails <Col N="444" /> and you are regarded as a crank if you object to its being turned off altogether two or three nights a week.  Subject to these observations, I think this Supplementary Estimate should be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, particularly those who happen to come from well-known tourist areas, I welcome the announcement regarding tourist development in the recent White Paper &ldquo;Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo;.  There are just a few items which I wish to bring to the Minister's attention.  The White Paper mentions the co-operation of local authorities.  It is some months since the White Paper was issued and quite a number of local development companies and similar bodies naturally took advantage of the announcement without undue delay.  In the past, many plans for development of tourist amenities were shelved because of difficulty in getting adequate grants from State sources, and more particularly because loans were not then available to meet the expenditure involved in non-revenue earning projects.  The new plan provides that loans may be made available in instances where hitherto they would not be given.</P>
      <P>Local development companies all over the country have been in touch, I expect, with An Bord Fáilte in connection with their plans.  I know one or two such companies that have, in fact, contacted Bord Fáilte.  It is indicated in the White Paper that the co-operation of the local authority is necessary and I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure that this co-operation will be forthcoming without undue delay.  In matters of this kind, we know how difficult it is to get co-operation from the engineering departments of local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of money is provided here under Section 7 and it says specifically that it is for the administration and general expenses of An Bord Fáilte.  That surely is not for the development of districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is under three headings and the Minister indicated that certain operations must be carried out with the co-operation of the local authority.  It is because of that that I am trying to draw the Minister's attention to the apparent difficulty that existed in the past and which, in my opinion, still exists, in getting local authorities to give their co-operation in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have reason to know that the engineering staffs of some local authorities take the view that co-operation of that sort is entirely outside the normal scope of their activities and they do not agree readily to co-operate in matters of this kind.  Their co-operation is absolutely necessary; the Minister has made that clear and so has the White Paper.  On page 45 it is stated as a condition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and (2) that a substantial local contribution will be forthcoming either from a local development group or from the local authority concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the previous sentence, it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That works to be carried out at any resort must form part of a fully co-ordinated plan of development for that resort....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be as brief as possible as the debate has probably already been prolonged. I ask the Minister to make <Col N="446" /> an official approach through the proper channels to local authorities to ensure that their co-operation will be readily available when sought by local development companies.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with the scope of development it is proposed to undertake at tourist resorts.  I am rather worried, however, with regard to the definition of &ldquo;tourist resorts&rdquo; in the statement.  It refers to &ldquo;major tourist resorts.&rdquo;  I do not know what a &ldquo;major tourist resort&rdquo; is, because as far as I know tourist resorts here are not classified as major or otherwise. I hope An Bord Fáilte will not be too conservative when listing any resorts.  In my opinion, there are many attractive resorts throughout the country in remote places that have not had an opportunity of being developed in the past.  Such places, I think, should be entitled to a certain amount of priority in any plan that may now be considered.  Under the development that is to take place, I understand promenades and car parks will be constructed. Those are very desirable amenities which are now lacking in most of our tourist resorts.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if this new plan, with regard to the development of tourism, is to succeed, local co-operation is absolutely necessary.  The most desirable form of local co-operation is through limited development companies. When the tourist legislation was overhauled some few years ago, quite a number of those companies were formed throughout the country. However, as time went on, Bord Fáilte did not seem inclined to continue assisting the formation of those local bodies.  Recent experience seems to indicate that the organisation we have at the moment is in the form of development associations, and these bodies are not as effective, certainly not as influential, as a limited company would be.  I suggest to the Minister that he might take up this matter with Bord Fáilte in the hope that the board might see the wisdom of encouraging local areas to form companies limited by guarantees.  In the past the normal legal expenses of forming such companies were paid by the board, and I am sure the board will find it possible <Col N="447" /> to continue that arrangement in the future.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion also, from the little experience I have of putting forward proposals to Bord Fáilte, that the staff of engineers in Bord Fáilte is quite inadequate. It takes a considerable period from the time a proposal is put before the board until it is possible to have that project examined locally through the board's engineering advisers.  It is now absolutely necessary that the number of engineering advisers attached to the board should be increased.  We are now entering a new era as far as the board is concerned, and I hope that is one of the first things the board will do.</P>
    <P>The formation of local organisations, too, should be encouraged. There should be a recognised standard type of local organisation to deal with the administration of tourist problems in every tourist area.  I hope the board will find time to take care of this important matter.  With a little encouragement and co-operation from the board, many of our undeveloped tourist resorts will be able to take advantage of the assistance that is now forthcoming by way of grant or loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice there is an increase of about £160,000 in this Vote.  I would welcome this increase if I were fully satisfied as to how it will be spent.  I can claim to come from one of the greatest tourist centres in this country, and, in view of the lack of industries in my area, insufficient money is being channelled into the tourist industry in Galway and the West in general.  In the West, the tourist industry was built up by private enterprise.  They need thank no Government for what they have built up there.  They can thank God for the scenery, and all that, but they looked for little assistance from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many hotels in the West have built additions and these additions are occupied for three or four months in the year.  When hotels are not occupied all the year round the owners would be justified in getting a certain reduction in their liabilities.  I would <Col N="448" /> ask the Minister to use his good offices to obtain such a concession for these people.  I do not wish to detract from the facilities that exist in Cobh, as have been mentioned here, or from the desirability of having them there, but I should like to remind the Minister that we have facilities second to none in Galway when it comes to a question of catering for the American tourist.  We have done it before and we can do it again.  We, in Galway, look forward to assistance from the Minister, now that Galway is to reopen its port to liner traffic from the United States.  Galway is at least 100 miles nearer to the American Continent than any other port in Western Europe.  Facilities for liners are being offered by Galway which can save a great deal of time in travel for the tourist.  Already quite a number of liners have been listed for calling this year, and next year and in future years they will double and treble.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice is the importance of propaganda through the radio, the cinema or through the provision of films by Bord Fáilte for showing on television on the Continent.  We have only scratched the surface of tourism.  There is a great potential which has not yet been exploited, and a great deal can be done.  The use of the radio through stations such as Luxembourg would be an advantage. Quite a number of people listen to those programmes and maybe some of our own people might hear of the facilities we have to offer.</P>
    <P>The tendency at the moment is for the Irish tourist to travel to the Continent. Last year was an exceptional year with pilgrimages, and so on. Many of us feel that unless we travel to Spain or Paris and get that lah-di-dah atmosphere about us, we have not travelled.  We should be encouraged to see Ireland first.  That was one of the slogans on our postage stamps some years ago, and it is something that should be considered again.  We have quite a number of people in this city who think Ireland is just outside the Phoenix Park.  If they saw what this country has to offer, it might open <Col N="449" /> their eyes.  We should encourage our own people to see our own country as well.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to use his good offices to see that a train service is provided between Galway and Dublin on Sundays during the tourist season.  I do not see myself in agreement with Deputy McQuillan regarding holding conventions in this country. He said something to the effect that congresses of importance would not be held here.  I would remind him that in the last year the most important congresses of all have been held in Galway and some more international congresses are listed for the coming year. Galway has the claim that it is a university city and it will facilitate them in every way.  The Minister should encourage such associations to hold their congresses in this country, irrespective of where they are located.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more money spent in tourist areas.  The hotels in my area provide facilities second to none and the Tourist Board should do its part.  Unfortunately, we had recently a devastating fire in what has been described as a gem in Connemara. I put it to the Tourist Board that they should come to the assistance of the community there, that one of the scenic beauties of the West is Kylemore Abbey.  The tourist has always been welcome there and can see things there which are unrivalled in any part of the Continent.  I put it to the board that they should give certain facilities to enable that building to be put in proper order again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate because it represents a national advance, to assist our second greatest industry.  It is something which will help our people and help our country as it will tend towards ensuring a favourable balance of trade at the end of the year.  I welcome any facilities which can be given to tourists&mdash;whether they are our own people coming home or foreigners coming in to visit our country.  They are eating our food here and helping to make our country more prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the customs facilities, as better customs facilities will be an encouragement to people <Col N="450" /> coming in here.  People on holiday do not wish to be knocked about too much.  If the customs officers have facilities for examining baggage quickly, it creates a good impression and visitors will speak about it to their friends and be good ambassadors for us.  On the few occasions when I was out of this country, I noticed, especially in France, the courtesy shown to visitors, the way people tried to make it easy for them.  That was an encouragement and created a good impression.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the grants towards the reconstruction of hotel rooms.  It is a liberal grant and I hope those who have hotels and who want to reconstruct rooms will avail themselves of it. A grant of £170 for a single room is very good and it is money well spent, as it is in the national interest.  I hope hotel, guest-house owners and others will avail themselves of those grants.</P>
    <P>In regard to local amenities, this is a question on which I have been very keen for a long time.  I know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done everything he could to encourage local tourist development associations to get grants through the Tourist Board.  I feel that local authorities, especially in seaside resorts and tourist resorts, are not pulling their weight.  We have tourist resorts adjacent to the City of Dublin in my own constituency; and while grants are made available for the improvement of tourist resorts, one of the most essential tourist attractions which can be given to an area is a supply of water and sewerage facilities.  Legislation should be brought in to compel the local authorities to co-operate more than they co-operate at present.  We had the farce in my constituency during a hot summer, of water being turned off in one of our biggest tourist areas at 7 o'clock in the evening and turned on again in the morning.  Sometimes it was left on until 10 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I am raising this point in regard to the third item on the Estimate, <Col N="451" /> under which grants are to be given for the improvement of local amenities.  I am dealing with what I believe is the greatest local amenity as regards the encouragement of tourists.  There should be more co-ordination between the various Ministers on these points. I have been almost 15 years here and I have spoken on every such Estimate about the lack of these amenities in areas adjacent to the City of Dublin. We tried many times to get some co-ordination between Dublin County Council and the neighbouring local authority in regard to local amenities.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Dillon said on this matter, that we have a long way to go before there is proper co-ordination, to assist us with the national programme which the Minister has initiated over the years and for which he is introducing the Supplementary Estimates now.  All of us should do everything we can, in the national interest, to bring more visitors to our country.  I had the experience of spending a fortnight touring the greater part of Ireland last year&mdash;16 days altogether&mdash;and I found in hotels I went to in the country that, unless I had telephoned from 20 or 30 miles away and said we were coming for dinner, we would not be facilitated. The ordinary tourist on tour requires better service than that.  I know it may not be just of me to criticise those hotels.  They cannot have meals cooked expecting A, B and C to come as, if A, B and C do not come, those meals go to loss.  Certain hotels should be more accommodating to visitors. I had the experience of being on my way out of one hotel without having been served when the manager ran after me and said: &ldquo;I understand you are Deputy Burke.  We have a spare table now.&rdquo;  It is not good for the tourist industry that people should not be able to get a meal at a hotel when they are passing through a district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The visitor is informed that there is not a spare table available, that all the tables are booked up or, in some cases, that visitors were not expected on that day.  I have <Col N="452" /> heard criticism of that kind of thing. Hotel owners have been given great facilities and every encouragement by Bord Fáilte and by the Dáil and they should try to meet the tourists in every possible way so as to encourage them to return to this country.</P>
      <P>There are holiday camps situated in my constituency the owners of which, while carrying on their own business, are doing work of national importance by encouraging people to come to this country.  Hotel owners and holiday camp proprietors who go abroad for the purpose of encouraging tourists to come to this country should get special grants because they are our best ambassadors for the tourist industry. Bord Fáilte are doing a very good job, but encouragement should be given to those who, of their own initiative, go abroad or pay others to go abroad for the purpose of attracting tourists to this country.  Such people are making heroic efforts to boost an industry which is second in importance to the cattle industry. There are other matters that I shall raise on the main Estimate.  I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on this Estimate will be brief.  There is no difference between the various Parties on the desirability of developing the tourist industry to the utmost limits.  If there be any difference at all, it is only as to the rate at which we ought to progress and the directions on which we should lay the emphasis in our attempts to secure maximum development.</P>
      <P>Tourism, of course, is a vital part of the national economy.  Were it not for tourism and the income we derive from it, our payments would be seriously imbalanced, not merely in one year, but permanently.  Tourism gets us a net income in the form of invisible exports of about £33,000,000 a year and, next to the cattle trade, is the best export we have, although grouped under invisible exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the best ways in which we can sell good wholesome food is to the stomachs of tourists who visit this country.  In that way, the payment for the food is more remunerative than <Col N="453" /> if it were exported in the uncooked or unprocessed state.  From every point of view, tourism is not only an important element in the national economy, but a highly desirable social activity which should be cultivated because of the part it plays generally in the economy.</P>
    <P>The only difference between the various Parties on this matter is in their anxiety as to the amount of money which it is possible to devote to advertising our tourist potential and attracting visitors to the State.  In that respect, all Parties wish that more money could be devoted to propaganda aimed at attracting more visitors to the country.  I still believe that there is a very substantial number of potential tourists to be found among the top-class people in England, people who save from one end of the year to the other in order to give themselves a holiday on the Continent who would find a holiday in Ireland not only invigorating and exhilarating but much cheaper than it is possible to spend a holiday at present in any country on the Continent of Europe. A holiday in Ireland for the British tourist and, indeed, for the American tourist, has the advantage that it is cheaper than a holiday in the more publicised tourist resorts on the Continent of Europe.  More emphasis should be placed on that feature of holidays in Ireland in our propaganda than has been the case up to the present. It takes a lot of the good out of a holiday to realise that you have paid two or three times more for hotel accommodation and food than you would pay if you had remained in your own country and availed of the facilities it has to offer.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that even the debate on this Estimate will indicate to the Tourist Board the support which it has among all Parties in the House for an all-out drive to attract the maximum number of tourists to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for improved facilities at Cobh.  That need is obvious to anybody who has the experience of going through the customs centre there.  People who are completing a long sea voyage, perhaps <Col N="454" /> not in the best of weather, cannot be blamed if they get irritable when, at the end of the voyage, they find the arrangements for examination of their cases not as smooth and efficient as they would wish.  Any money spent in that direction at Cobh is all to the good as being calculated to give us a good name or, at all events, to avoid getting us a bad name.  Money so spent is a worthwhile investment.</P>
    <P>As we are discussing Cobh, although this is not the Minister's responsibility, he might, when discussing the amenities at Cobh, have some regard to the facilities provided for taking passengers from Cobh to the liner and from the liner to Cobh.  I do not want to dwell on this at any great length, nor do I want to bring down on my head the wrath of the city fathers in Cork, or the sea lords of Cobh, but it is only too obvious to anybody who sees the tender that there is need for a new and modern tender to take passengers and goods to and from the port.  The present tender is not adequate for the requirements. It is not very pleasant for passengers to have to travel on it in wet or windy weather and particularly when the seas are choppy.  It would be a good investment, although it might cost more money than the local authority may have to spare at the moment, if a new tender were brought there. Present tender facilities are the subject of derisory comment by many passengers who look at the tender from the ship, when not using it, or who have occasion to use it and know that it is by no means the most pleasant method of conveyance to the middleharbour.  I am sure the Minister is conscious of the need for improvements there.  Anything that can be done will be all to the good in establishing amenities for our tourists.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Tourist Board are responsible for this. If they are, they ought to be advised by somebody to be more careful in their choice of friends.  A lady named Elsa Maxwell arrived in this fair land last year.  Because she was not treated with the regal pomp which suited her concepts of graciousness, first, she started a row at the airport.  When that row died down, then others took place at different points afterwards.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over what other Deputies have mentioned, but I should like to speak about the country from which most of our tourist trade comes.  It comes from across the Channel.  Deputy Burke said we should do everything we possibly can to promote our tourist trade and improve it.  I would ask some of our Ministers of State to stop talking about English people as if they had the mange, as they often do in this House.  They get hot about them.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the cross-Channel trade, in order to extend the season, the Minister established An Tóstal. Many people say it was a failure.  I shall give the Minister credit for trying: that is the main thing.  He had a go.  It may not have been a success in many places; it was a success in other places.  If the Minister had not profit out of it, he gained experience, and I am sure he will profit from the experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the promotion of tourism, it is important to bring tourists here in the off-season when we could deal with them.  There is the matter of the motor-car trade. A concession was given in respect of the months of April and May when motor-cars could be brought from Great Britain to this country at a much cheaper rate.  Many people took advantage of that concession.  I would emphasise that experience to the Minister and urge that it should be followed up during the months when cheap week-end fares or cheap week-end tours are available.  I have in mind now the long week-end from Friday to Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am old enough to remember these <Col N="457" /> cheap tickets from England to Ireland and from Ireland to England in happier days.  I think that is worth while investigating.  Hoteliers would welcome it.  They could easily cater for the people who would come over. An enormous number of our people now live in England.  A very large number of men and women who are married and have settled down in England would be glad of the opportunity to bring over their families so as to let their parents in this country see them.  That would be a big expense on ordinary working people at the full rates but, during the tourist off-season, cheap week-end fares should be available. The Minister should ask Bord Fáilte about the matter or, through his Department, should ask C.I.E. to have the matter taken up with British Railways.</P>
    <P>With regard to the American trade, it is good that the amenities at Cobh are being improved.  Let us hope that one of the first boats ordered in the new dockyard at Cork will be a new tender for the Cork Harbour authorities. I have noticed that many Americans are interested in the history and traditions of this country and I want to compliment the Tourist Board on the erection of plaques in various parts of the country.  A very good job was done at Kinsale.  It would give even a stranger an idea of how the whole battle of Kinsale was fought. The same thing was done at New Ross.  I have not recently been in Limerick, but I am sure the same thing could be done in Limerick and in other places.  The Tourist Board are doing a very fine job and deserve all the encouragement the Minister can give them.</P>
    <P>It is usually fine in this country in the months of May and June.  That is a point which we could put to people so that they might come here earlier&mdash; especially when we would be giving, if at all possible, these cheap fares I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I come to the matter of grants to resorts.  These grants will be given in conjunction with the local authorities and local companies.  I am a member of a local authority and I do not think that the local authorities <Col N="458" /> are the best people to promote tourism in their areas.  I may be calling coals of fire down on my head, but what usually happens with the local authorities is that perhaps somebody from the other end of the county will want so much money from the local authority in order to qualify for the grant and the local authority will say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That makes it very difficult for the local people.  Where there are local companies, they deserve support from the local people, but if the support from the local people is not as great, say, as the Minister would demand at present, then as often as not, the Minister would need a great deal of money for small resorts.  I think the board should be asked to meet these resorts.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the position of my constituency as regards these grants. Since I came into the Dáil, I have discovered that my constituency comes out very badly whenever there are State grants available.  We do not seem to be able to get a portion of them at all.  I was appalled at my colleague, Deputy Coogan, who did not seem to be in any way grateful to the Government for anything that might have been done in Galway.</P>

      <P>I think, perhaps, that one of the reasons why my county might be overlooked is that we are a quiet and conservative people down in Waterford.  The ambassador of the Republic to the United States of America is a Waterfordman and he has a beautiful article this month in <i>Ireland of the Welcomes.</i>  He invites everybody to come to Ireland and tells of the beauties and the glories of the country and, being the decent, conservative man that he is he did not brag about his own county.</P>

      <P>When a case is put by the tourist resorts in Waterford, as I know there will be, I ask the Minister to bear with the people and remember that they have never got their fair share of any of the grants, or any <Col N="459" /> of the hand-outs, that were given over the years.  They have been passed by.</P>

      <P>I think An Bord Fáilte, and the Minister, would be well advised to take steps to clear up, and to make more presentable, the best strands in the world, which we have. There is no worthwhile amenity at them; the entrance to them is difficult and, I regret to say, the amount of litter left after a Sunday is very disheartening. If there was a specimen or pilot unit taken to show what could be done with them, it would be of very great benefit.  I have several strands in mind and it does not matter whether they are at Waterford, Galway, Dublin or elsewhere, but to a person from the Midlands, it is very disheartening to see the condition of these strands&mdash;which are some of the finest in the world&mdash;being left in a very unhealthy looking state, to say the least of it.</P>
      <P>With a very small expenditure, a great deal of work could be done which would be an inducement to our own people to go to them and if our own people go to them, the tourist will also follow because where our own people go, they are the greatest ambassadors for our tourist resorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is, of course, concerned with only three details of administration: the improvements at Cobh, the inauguration of the tourist resort amenity scheme, and the hotel grant scheme. Many Deputies spoke about the more general aspects of tourist trade development and I do not propose to deal with their comments now.  There will be, as I said, a Bill to extend the resources of An Bord Fáilte introduced in the Dáil in a couple of weeks' time and either on that, or on the main Estimate, these matters of wider import can be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the three items of detail with which the Supplementary Estimate is concerned, I should like to say, in relation to the Cork scheme, that the matter of new tenders to service the liners is fully appreciated by the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  They are, in <Col N="460" /> fact, proposing to acquire a new tender and to recondition the second tender, and the only matter at issue at the moment between them and myself is the amount of State grant for which they are to qualify.  It is a small matter of detail.</P>
    <P>In regard to the hotel bedroom scheme, that of course, is based upon the assumption that in respect of the type of tourist who utilises the hotel services, the bottle-neck limiting the expansion of trade was the inadequacy of the number of hotel bedrooms.  The schemes initiated before for the giving of financial help to hotel-keepers to extend accommodation, involving guaranteed loans or other financial assistance, had not produced the desired results and, therefore, it was decided to supplement them by this very direct inducement of a cash grant, in addition to the loan facilities which are available.  The grant&mdash;to meet the point raised by Deputy Dillon&mdash;is greater if the hotel bedroom accommodation provided incorporates bathrooms as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked if a hotel which extends its accommodation in this way would be liable to revaluation. Under the law, of course, there is no change in valuation for seven years, but no doubt revaluation will come eventually.  But it seems to me that the availability of a substantial cash grant, plus a loan which, at the discretion of the board, can be made in a way which defers for a time both the interest and the repayment charges, would be a very substantial offset to the higher charges arising from the eventual revaluation.</P>
    <P>In the case of the resort development schemes, I want to make it clear that the essential conditions for the giving of a grant are the two which I mentioned.  One is that those responsible for the development of a particular resort will plan that development in a comprehensive way.  It would be undesirable that they should come along looking for a grant this year to provide a park, or erect a promenade, or a public convenience, or some other necessary amenity, and next year seek a grant for something else and then, in the third year, find <Col N="461" /> that they had put the first development in the wrong place and want to shift it.  The intention is that there must be a comprehensive scheme in the fulfilment of which the local authority would have to co-operate, with its own road development, water and sewerage plans and so forth. The whole scheme of development cannot be executed in one year or two years, but each particular part can be undertaken as resources become available and can be fitted into that ultimate, full development pattern already decided on.</P>
    <P>The requirement of a local contribution is, I think, also very necessary. In any event, in so far as the amount of resources available for resort development is limited, it will at least mean that these resources will go to areas in which interest in development for tourist purposes is keenest.</P>
    <P>The local contribution can come through the local authority, but it does not necessarily have to be so.  In many of the resorts with which discussions are proceeding, there is a local development company already set up under the Tourist Traffic Acts which is taking the initiative.  In fact, the local contribution can be put into a part of the scheme which itself will be revenue earning.  Some parts of these schemes must be revenue earning. It is not essential that the local contribution should be in the form of an outright grant.  Providing the whole scheme is approved by Bord Fáilte, the unremunerative parts of it can be covered by the grant they give, and the remunerative parts can be covered by investment of the local development company.  The development that took place at Arklow, of which Deputy Lynch is aware, indicates the type of development that the local company could undertake with an expectation of making a profit rather than a loss.  I assure him that in the case of Tramore, something as substantial is possible.  I hope whatever may happen in Tramore will be less controversial from my point of view than the previous attempt I made to develop amenities there.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to An Tóstal.  That is part of the general <Col N="462" /> plan for tourist trade development and I do not wish to comment on it. Deputies will have learned that this year changes have been made.  It is obviously common sense to keep changing the details of a scheme of that kind as experience shows modification to be required.  It is clear that the first ideas applied by Bord Fáilte for the extension of the tourist trade season by that arrangement was not happily conceived, in so far as they tried to do too much with far too limited resources.  Ultimately, they had to cut down the scale of their operations, picking out of the numerous activities organised in the first year those that proved most successful.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that as a result of the inauguration of An Tóstal, a number of festivals and other events of considerable importance&mdash;certainly of growing importance&mdash;have emerged through the activities of local Tóstal Councils and have proved quite successful and will indeed become important national occasions in the future.  For my own part, I should like to say, as one who for very many years felt like a voice crying in the wilderness about the economic importance of the tourist trade, that I did not believe the public was responding to the opportunity the tourist trade offered until an Tóstal came along.  Whether it was the criticism of the arrangements made in connection with the Tóstal or whatever other aspect of the project touched the public imagination, it did appear to me during the early years of the Tóstal that, for the first time, public interest in the possibilities of the tourist trade really became aroused and local effort to develop tourist amenities really became effective.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan queried the statistics published by Bord Fáilte regarding the extent of our tourist trade.  Bord Fáilte publishes statistics received from the Central Statistics Office, and I am sure the Central Statistics Office will have no hesitation in telling Deputy McQuillan or anybody else the basis on which they compile those statistics.  It is, of course, recognised by all of us that, in addition to those who come here as <Col N="463" /> tourists in the ordinary sense of the term, there are a large number of people who come because they were born here or because they have relatives here.  People working abroad come back for holidays, or to see relatives.  No doubt, a very high percentage of those would come, no matter what facilities, attractions or transport arrangements were provided, but they will come all the more readily and happily, if we have proper accommodation for them <i>en route</i> and when they are in their native localities.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to make one remark arising out of a comment by Deputy Dillon.  It is true that the modern tourist tends more and more to live up to the full significance of that term, as a visitor who in a motor car does in fact tour the country. Many of them, of course, avail of the rapidly developing and very efficient car hire facilities already within the country, but some of them bring their cars with them.  We are to some extent handicapped in this country by the inadequacy of the facilities available to those who want to bring their cars with them here.  However, changes are taking place in that respect. Deputies will have seen that the cost of bringing a car here has been reduced by the shipping companies and that the Government have abolished customs formalities.  It is now no longer necessary to have a triptyque; a mere notification to the customs authorities on entering the country gives the right to bring in a car without any further customs formalities. We have completely liberalised the movement of cars in that regard.</P>
    <P>In addition, arrangements are being inaugurated this year at Dún Laoghaire which will permit of a limited number of cars being brought on the mail boats from Holyhead, and later on, it may be possible to improve the facilities at other ports.  Certainly, the number of tourists who go into the northern part of Ireland on the Stranraer-Larne ferry is an indication of the potentiality of a service of that kind.  In fact, many of those who want to visit us as motor car using tourists <Col N="464" /> have to come by that route and do in fact come by that route.  There is a great deal which we could do to extend the facilities at present available for those who want to come to this country bringing their cars with them. Some progress has been made, but a great deal more has yet to be done. Some of it, however, will be done this year.</P>

      <P>Would it be convenient for the Minister if I used the Explanatory Memorandum?  I should like to know what items are covered in No. 8, the Imposition of Duties (No. 19) (Glucose) Order, 1958.  There was a duty at the rate of 37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. preference.  I notice now that a minimum duty is being imposed. Will the Minister explain the need for the minimum duty and what percentage duty does the minimum duty of £30 full and £20 preference represent?</P>
      <P>Under the Imposition of Duties (No. 20) (Berets) Order, 1958, there is a minimum rate of duty of 5/7½ full and 3/9 preference.  What is the idea of the 5/7½?

      <P>Who managed to hit on that figure?  With regard to the duty on slide fasteners, I should like the Minister to say how many people are now employed in this industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> What are the imports of slide fasteners at present?  At one stage, the situation was very bad from the standpoint of their being very large imports and a relatively small number of persons employed. If the Minister looks at the file, he will see that certain steps had to be taken to bring about a reversal of the process then extant.  I should like to know what the present position is.</P>
    <P>With regard to pot scourers, No. 37, could the Minister say what number of persons are employed making pot scourers?  What is the value of the imports?</P>
    <P>With regard to spectacles, No. 45, could the Minister say how many firms are making spectacles and where are they located?</P>
    <P>With regard to cast-iron baths, No. 50, the duty on these baths has varied from time to time.  The industry always seems to be in the battle for a new range of duty.  We have now reached the stage at which the full rate of duty is £9 and the preferential rate £5 per bath.  Could the Minister say what percentage is £9 full and £6 preferential in relation to the present price charged for baths in this country?</P>
    <P>Having put these questions to the Minister, I do not wish to cause him any difficulty in getting the appropriate answers at this stage.  I am quite willing to leave the answers to the Report Stage, if that will help the Minister.</P>

Could he not have left the duty as it was, if this is merely a device?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to know if he inquired whether the waxed paper manufacturers are still in business and able to do business, or do they want a <Col N="466" /> monopoly such as they had under the 30 per cent. duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to some of these duties about which Deputy Norton inquired, the modification of the rate, or the imposition of a minimum rate, arose out of evidence of dumping here because of temporary circumstances prevailing elsewhere, or because of the emergence of a situation which seemed to threaten the stability of an existing industry here.  That is particularly true in relation to glucose. There were some developments affecting the production of glucose which could have had a prejudicial effect upon its production here.  The efforts of certain firms to enlarge their share of the world market brought about a fairly substantial fall in price. No doubt, the price to which glucose fell could not be maintained for any length of time because it was uneconomic but it was decided not to allow that temporary situation to interfere with the production of glucose here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not from any particular area.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that there are very powerful organisations in that field and their operations extend beyond national boundaries to a large extent.  Other factors were also involved.  Our industry was only getting into its stride and, as the Deputy knows, it is not yet in full production on the basis planned. It was felt that we should keep the industry going and, to offset any commercial disadvantage to firms here, arrangements were made to supply at a considerably reduced price, where production for export was involved or, to allow firms to import, where re-export was being undertaken.</P>
      <P>In the case of slide fasteners, that again is a minimum duty.  It is about the only effective duty that can operate in the case of commodities of that kind where the product is sold as part of another commodity at a much higher price than the cost of the actual unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> These are zip fasteners.  Incorporated in a lady's dress, or something of that kind, the price of the fastener would be of no great moment and a minimum rate of duty is, therefore, required.</P>

Frames with bits of coloured glass in them were being imported under the description of sun glasses for the purpose of avoiding the paying of the tariff.  The definition was amended to cover that situation.  In the case of baths, there was substantial evidence of dumping and a minimum duty was imposed to make the protection effective.

I was about to tell Deputy Crotty that in the case of dried peas an arrangement of this kind must involve some effective measure to control the import of the peas.  As I explained, the arrangement made with the Minister for Agriculture is designed to ensure that peas will be imported free of duty by any firm engaged in packaging peas which has contracted with Irish farmers to grow peas for them.  An arrangement of that kind would not be effective at all, if the duty were not high enough.  Certainly any weakening of it would merely weaken the inducement for these firms to get peas grown here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise an increase of £5,000,000 in the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow from the Central Fund or other sources for the performance of its functions.  This increase will permit the board to borrow up to a maximum of £19,000,000.  The Bill also removes the limit of £2,000,000 on the amount which the board may, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, borrow from sources other than the Central Fund. Total borrowings will, of course, be limited in any event to the overriding figure of £19,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital of Bord na Móna was fixed at £14,000,000 by the Turf Development Act, 1953.  At that time, it was estimated that output in 1960 would be: 874,000 tons of machine turf of which at least 390,000 tons would be used for electricity generation; 2,530,000 tons of milled peat practically all of which was to be used for electricity generation; between 45,000 and 50,000 tons of briquettes <Col N="470" /> and between 100,000 and 150,000 bales of peat moss.</P>
    <P>The board's development programme was, of course, closely related to the E.S.B. generation programme. When the E.S.B. programme was revised early in 1956, a total of 180 MW. which it had been intended to base on milled peat was eliminated from the programme.  This reduced E.S.B. estimated requirements of milled peat by over 1,000,000 tons per annum. The planned capacity of the Ferbane generating station, for which the Boora Bog was being developed, was reduced from 100 MW. to 60 MW. and that of the Rhode Station, for which Derrygreenagh Bog was being developed, from 80 MW. to 40 MW. Bellacorick Station, which was to be based on Oweninny Bog, and Shannonbridge Station, based on Blackwater Bog, were postponed indefinitely.  Approval has been given for the construction of a briquetting factory on each of the bogs at Boora and Derrygreenagh, each of which will produce annually 100,000 tons of briquettes and will require a total of about 600,000 tons of milled peat per annum.  The Turf Development Act, 1957, authorised the board to obtain the capital for these factories, estimated to be £1,800,000. as far as possible from sources other than the Exchequer.  As the House is aware the board has, in fact, already received a loan of £500,000 from Messrs. Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., Ltd.</P>
    <P>The revised estimates of Bord na Móna's production for 1960 were then: milled peat, 1,300,000 tons per annum, of which about 450,000 tons would be used for briquettes and the balance for electricity generation; machine turf, 960,000 tons per annum of which about 500,000 tons would be used in the E.S.B. stations and the balance for industrial and domestic purposes; briquettes, 150,000 tons by 1960 increasing ultimately to 250,000; and peat moss, 200,000 bales.</P>
    <P>In October, 1957, the Government decided that the generating station at Bellacorick, County Mayo, should be reinstated in the E.S.B. generation programme.  The station is expected to come into commission in 1962-63. <Col N="471" /> It will require about 320,000 tons of milled peat per annum and Bord na Móna are at present preparing the Oweninny Bog to supply that quantity.</P>
    <P>During the past year, discussions have been proceeding regarding the electricity generating capacity which will be required subsequent to the commissioning of the Bellacorick station.  As a result of these discussions the E.S.B have decided to install an additional 40 MW. at Rhode in 1964 and an additional 20 MW. at Ferbane some time prior to 1965-66. To meet the requirements of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna propose to develop new areas of bog at Boora, for the Ferbane Station, and at Derrygreenagh, for the Rhode Station, to produce 550,000 tons of milled peat per annum.  I will shortly be introducing a Bill to provide amongst other things for increased capital for the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna also plan to supply milled peat for the proposed nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  Deputies will recollect that it was announced last August that Blackwater Bog, County Offaly, would be reserved as a source of milled peat for a factory for the production of ammonium nitrate. Some development work has already been carried out on Blackwater Bog and Bord na Móna are arranging to have the bog ready for further development when required.  The economic and technical problems associated with the establishment of the factory are at present being examined. The requirements of the factory are estimated at 150,000 tons of milled peat annually for 60 years.</P>
    <P>In the course of their discussions with the E.S.B., Bord na Móna undertook to make available 350,000 tons of milled peat per annum from 1965-66 onwards in the Garryduff group of bogs which are situated on the opposite side of the Shannon from Blackwater bog.  It is intended that the two bogs should be developed as one unit to supply the power-station and the fertiliser factory.  When the E.S.B. erect this station, the total production of Bord na Móna will amount to 3,000,000 tons of milled peat in <Col N="472" /> 1965-66, of which 2.1 million tons will be used for electricity generation, 750,000 tons for the production of briquettes in the three factories and 150,000 tons for the nitrogenous fertiliser factory, in addition to the 1,000,000 tons of sod peat, of which 500,000 tons will be used for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>In the exercise of their powers under the Turf Development Act, Bord na Móna will, it is estimated, have borrowed a total of not less than £13,928,000 by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By to-day&mdash;the present day.  Bord na Móna will have borrowed a total of not less than £13,928,000 by 31st March, 1959, of which £500,000 will have been borrowed from sources other than the Central Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All the rest is from the Central Fund.  To carry out the development programme which was envisaged up to 1965-66 it is estimated that Bord na Móna would require to borrow up to £22,000,000, apart from capital, estimated at about £2.5 million, which they expect to obtain from their own resources.  It is considered, however, that the limit of the board's borrowing powers need not be raised at this stage beyond £19,000,000 which will assure adequate capital for the board for 1959-60 and up to the end of the financial year 1960-61.  It is anticipated that further legislation making additional provision will be required in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second and minor purpose of the Bill is to remove the limitation of £2,000,000 on the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow from sources other than the Central Fund.  It is considered that the retention of that limit is not necessary and should an opportunity for such borrowing arise at any time, the board should be in a position to avail itself of it, with of course, the consents of the two Ministers concerned. I may say that, it is, however, unlikely that the board will be able to <Col N="473" /> borrow in excess of £2,000,000 from outside sources.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the operations of Bord na Móna which is also deserving of mention to the House is their production of peat moss.  Sales of that commodity were £51,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1953.  In the year ended 31st March, 1958, sales had risen to almost £120,000, about three-quarters of which were export sales.  Last year, however, owing to adverse weather, production fell by about 50 per cent. Encouraged, however, by the steady demand for their product, the board has enlarged the Kilberry factory and is at present erecting a second factory based on Allen Bog.  The peat moss bog at Coolnamona, in Laois, has been acquired by Bord na Móna and a third factory based on that bog is intended.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is one of the largest employers in the country as Deputies are aware and it offers employment in areas where other industry is sparse. In the current year employment at the peak period will be available for approximately 7,000 workers and that figure is expected to increase eventually to 9,000.</P>
    <P>The steady progress which Bord na Móna is making in the exploitation of one of the most profuse of our natural resources, the volume of employment which it offers, and the substantial contribution which it makes to our power requirements are all matters on which the board is to be congratulated.  In the confidence that the Dáil will share that view, I recommend this Bill for approval.</P>

The most recent accounts are those up to 31st March, 1958, and they have been published.  No doubt, accounts for the current year will be available very soon.  The board has shown a substantial surplus up to 1958 and it has repaid a large part of its indebtedness to the State.  I am afraid 1958 will turn out to be a bad year and the accounts, no doubt, will be considerably disimproved, owing to the weather conditons which prevailed, so that any estimate for the future based on 1958 would be unreliable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The development and evolution of Bord na Móna is one of those heartening developments in our national economy.  There is no doubt that the work which the board has done in endeavouring to drain lands, in converting previously unused and, indeed, ignored fuel to the satisfying condition in which we now utilise that fuel to generate electricity is, I think, something to be commended by all Parties in this House.  The board undertook an extremely difficult task.  The problem of draining the land, especially in the Central Basin, was a particularly tough one.  Any experiments in that field previously had been foredoomed to failure, and some to substantial loss, and there was generally abroad an atmosphere that these bogs were bewitched by fairies <Col N="475" /> and it was better to leave them alone&mdash; you could get nothing out of them. However, all these difficulties have been overcome and the board is now a substantial, producer of a national product which is valuable, not only as a generator of electricity, but as a generator of steam in boilers, and as a domestic fuel and, in addition to this valuable product, a very substantial amount of employment is given by the board in the production of the fuel in question.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will find general gratification on all sides of the House that Bord na Móna is doing so well. It was, unfortunately, the subject of political contention in its early years. I never shared that view myself, personally, but I think all these difficulties have now been overcome.  I think the loves and the hates are over and everybody concerned with the promotion of Bord na Móna is entitled to take a justifiable pride in its progress. I think, therefore, the board should know that the House is behind it in all its efforts to develop our bogs for the winning of fuel, and for the ultimate conversion of the bogs into arable land or at least into land which can be afforested to the national advantage and which, again in the course of time, will yield a very valuable product for the nation.</P>
      <P>I have nothing but admiration for the sense of dedication&mdash;if I may so put it&mdash;with which the board applies itself, and with which the staff applies itself, to the task of winning fuel from the bogs.  Some of these young engineers, and some of the workers employed on the bogs, have a pretty tough time endeavouring to work under the conditions which operate in these flooded, swampy, wind-swept bogs throughout the country, but they have triumphed over all these difficulties. We owe them recognition for that sense of dedication and that tenacity, indeed, relentless tenacity, which has enabled them to accomplish such an excellent task in such a relatively short period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of employment with Bord na Móna which, if anything, is unsatisfactory and will remain <Col N="476" /> unsatisfactory, unless we find something to fill the lacuna.  Work with Bord na Móna starts at various times from February onwards, and continues until October.  It may be a little later, but normally work tapers off in September and October.  After that, only skilled staff are retained in employment, but even that staff suffer by way of a lower rate of wages because the incentives which operate during the earlier part of the year do not operate during the winter.  During the winter months, a large number of workers employed by Bord na Móna are virtually compelled to exist on the labour exchange from October to February, unless they are lucky enough to get a job under a local authority grant.  I think that is a blot on employment with Bord na Móna, but the board itself is not responsible.</P>
    <P>Cutting and harvesting are seasonal jobs and, of course, like every other seasonal job, they inevitably have the casualisation which is associated with seasonal employment.  I recognise that there are very definite difficulties to be surmounted, but consideration should be given to the possibility of giving Bord na Móna powers to plant fringe areas on the bogs which they own.  Again, I know there are difficulties because of the board's method of using the bogs, that is, of farming the bogs.  The whole bog does not become usable for afforestation until all the layers of turf are taken off it, and the anticipation is that, in the main, that condition will arise all over the bog at the same time.  However, there are fringe areas associated with turf.</P>
    <P>Turf just does not start and go on down after you meet clay.  There are various layers of turf after you leave arable and pasturable land, and it is in these areas where turf is not deep, and where the board has fringe turbary which it would not use itself because it has no value for turf cutting, it might be possible to get the board to examine the possibility of planting some of them.  If that could be done, it would give work and would help to provide employment between October, when the staff are paid off, until the following February, <Col N="477" /> when they are taken on again for the next year's work.  There is a great deal to be said in favour of such a scheme of employment which would absorb staff during that period.</P>
    <P>In Germany, I have examined electricity stations which were fired by turf and the steam, after being used for generation, was trapped in pipes and then pumped into land which was covered by glass.  In those glasshouses, I saw tomatoes, cucumbers, and a variety of other vegetables being grown which could only be grown in well-heated glasshouses.  The E.S.B., of course, is not concerned with that kind of development but Bord na Móna might be concerned with a development of that kind.  After all, we have very substantial imports of that type of vegetables and if that matter were examined, with a view to trapping the waste steam from the electricity generating stations on the bogs, a valuable source of employment might be provided for workers who would otherwise have to live during the winter months on what they get from the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt there will be difficulties in the way.  There were difficulties in the way of the German scheme to which I have made reference, but the difficulties were overcome and, when I saw these places, I saw large numbers of workers in about eight acres of glasshouses producing excellent crops and getting very good wages for doing that, at a time of the year when they were not employed on the bogs.  If it can be done elsewhere, we are not so intellectually deficient that we could not do it here.  I suggest the Minister might at least have the matter examined to see if there is any possibility of giving powers to Bord na Móna in that, or any other field, to eradicate that blot which is on Bord na Móna now, namely, that if you are employed by Bord na Móna, you are almost certain to be paid off for four months of the year.  If we could provide employment during those four months, it would eliminate that blot, and at the same time, we would be providing useful products.  I am sure the pioneering spirit of Bord na Móna will be equal to any task or any assignment <Col N="478" /> given to them.  I shall conclude by saying that any proposal to give the board new capital for new endeavours of the same fruitful kind as they produced in the past will have my personal support at all times.</P>

      <P>Everybody is concerned with the seasonal character of Bord na Móna's employment and a great deal of thought has been put into the possibilities of associating with the work of Bord na Móna other activities which would tend to absorb the labours of those who are not required on the bogs during the winter months. That problem will not be as acute in the future as in the past.  The highly seasonal character of the work was far more pronounced when sod peat was the main product.  The milled peat method of production does tend to smooth out the peaks and eliminate to a large extent the problem of seasonal unemployment.  Some seasonal element will remain and discussions are proceeding between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands as to the possibility of carrying out afforestation on the waste areas&mdash;if they may be so described&mdash; adjoining the bogs on which the board are working.</P>
      <P>I have been interested for a long time in the possibility of utilising the waste heat of power stations for horticultural or agricultural purposes.  A great deal of examination of possibilities in that direction has been undertaken not merely here but in many other countries.  So far as I know, the only station in the world where it has been successfully done is the Weismoor Station in Germany to which Deputy Norton referred.  A large number of people in this country are convinced it is technically and economically feasible and at the present time there is a committee examining possibilities from both technical and economic points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say the Deputy is wrong in assuming that this is more a task for Bord na Móna than the E.S.B.  Indeed, the technical people associated with this committee are E.S.B. personnel and it would be a question of utilising the productive capacity of the E.S.B. rather than of Bord na Móna if it <Col N="479" /> could be done, whether through the E.S.B. or through some new organisation of the Department of Agriculture which is associated with the examinations. Again, it would help to introduce more stability into the employment available arising out of these operations.</P>
    <P>I think Bord na Móna&mdash;if I may end on this note&mdash;would be very much attracted to any type of development in the bog areas which might employ girls.  They believe their menfolk would be happier if there was more feminine society in the vicinity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the names of provincial newspapers, periodicals or publications in which the State advertised in each of the years 1954 to 1957, inclusive, the cost in each case, and the circulation of the publication in question; and what considerations are taken into account in the allocation of such advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first portion of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the information given in reply to a question on 28th May, 1957, in columns 1961-1970 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>That information is in respect of the financial years 1954-55 to 1956-57 but it is suggested that it may meet the Deputy's requirements.  The preparation of returns of this nature entails a special investigation and the compilation of the particulars sought in respect of the periods not covered in the answer of 28th May, 1957, would involve a substantial expenditure of time and labour and an addition to administrative costs which, in my opinion, would not be justifiable.</P>
      <P>While inquiries are made from time to time about the circulation of newspapers and periodicals, figures of circulation as at any particular date are not available for all the newspapers and periodicals concerned&mdash;the number of which is very great.</P>
      <P>In placing advertisements, Departments make their selection from among newspapers and periodicals according as they judge that their requirements as regards coverage can most adequately and economically be satisfied.</P>

    <P>(B)  Figures of monthly variation in bonus earnings at each individual Forest are not produced in the normal course of control and supervision of the operation of the Incentive Bonus Scheme and with the expansion of application of the Scheme their production would entail appreciable work.  Such figures would not in themselves be adequate to indicate the true effectiveness of the Incentive Bonus Scheme since such factors as wet weather also have a bearing on the level of bonus earnings and can cause periodic fluctuations in bonus earnings at a particular forest even where productivity is constant or steadily climbing.  A cautious approach by the workers to securing the benefits of an Incentive Scheme also commonly operates in the early stages of application and can affect the true productivity level from week to week.  I consider, therefore, that no useful purpose would be served by the production and publication of monthly bonus earnings figures for each Forest.</P>
    <P>Average earnings figures for all Forests are more easily furnished and give a truer picture of the progressive success of the Scheme.  The following are figures for each month in 1958:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The figures are expressed on an hourly basis (that used in the Scheme).  Conversion to a weekly basis for a full working week involves the assumption that the interplay of factors which determined bonus earnings would be unchanged if all the workers employed had given a full attendance.
